		In reading this passage in Ephesians what I had in mind was to point out that, as nearing the end of his course, Paul tells us that he is concerned about the mystery and about enlightening all as to it, and then moreover, having said that, he tells us how he prays in relation to it.<a name=1:2></a> We were hearing last night of Daniel as a praying man, and the importance and value of prayer, but here in this passage Paul comes before us as showing us how earnestly he prays.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before that he speaks to us about the mystery, and the grace given to him to announce among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things.<a name=1:4></a> "That now", he says, "to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God".<a name=1:5></a> Earlier in the chapter he tells us that he desired that the Ephesians might know his intelligence in the mystery; that is, he would have us understand that he, at any rate, had intelligence in the mystery, which, he says, "in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the power of the Spirit" (verse 5).<a name=1:6></a> It is now revealed, and Paul, at any rate, had remarkable

		intelligence as to it, intending to convey that there is no reason why we should not increase in under-standing as to the mystery.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say that we are likely to have Paul's intelligence of it, but at the same time he wanted them to know the intelligence that he had, in order to show that it is not beyond the range of the saints.<a name=2:2></a> Indeed, he was concerned to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery, and that we might have our eyes opened to see what there is on earth in the assembly, through which principalities and powers in the heavenlies even now are learning the all-various wisdom of God, for, beloved brethren, it is God's masterpiece, the assembly.<a name=2:3></a> I am not speaking now of it abstractly or theoretically, but I am speaking of it as that which has concrete existence at this present time, and we ourselves are part of it.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is here on earth (and I say again, we ourselves are part of it), that which is God's masterpiece in wisdom and love, a company drawn out from the nations, knit together, bound together in the power of the Holy Spirit in love amongst ourselves, and united in affection towards Christ in glory, and held in relation to Christ, so that He can speak of it, as He does, as "my assembly".<a name=2:5></a> Whatever Satan may do contrary to the truth, there is that here as held under the influence of Christ, and deriving wisdom from Him in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, which Satan cannot overcome.<a name=2:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is a great thing, beloved brethren, that there is a sphere here in which what is of God is maintained in living expression, and it is to be seen in various parts of the world, and in it the service of God is maintained in a unified way and in spiritual power.<a name=3:1></a> Love amongst ourselves is seen there, and whatever Satan brings in, God turns it all to account to further this wonderful interest of His, which He has here on earth.<a name=3:2></a> The war [1939 - 1945] and all the ravages of it, so to speak, all the testings of it, have just brought to light love amongst the saints in a universal way.<a name=3:3></a> And it has resulted in the saints being enlarged in their apprehension of this great vessel that God has here on earth, and the links in the divine nature which bind us together have been strengthened and become more real.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has used all the moral confusion in the world, brought in by the lawlessness of man, with Satan behind it, to further this great interest of His here on earth.<a name=3:5></a> Whatever has happened, Satan has not been able to interfere with the service of God, but through all the testings the service of God has been enriched.<a name=3:6></a> The saints are being delivered from earthly-mindedness and from having their interest in things here, and heavenly things and spiritual things are becoming more and more real as a consequence.<a name=3:7></a> You can understand how angels are taking account of what is going on.<a name=3:8></a> They are learning in it "the all-various wisdom of God".<a name=3:9></a> You might say, dear brethren, 'Well, it looks as though Satan is having it all his own way in the world', but it is not so.<a name=3:10></a> God is

		using everything and turning everything to account to further this great interest of His on earth, the assembly which He is forming, and He is bringing it increasingly into view and making it more real to us all .<a name=4:1></a>.<a name=4:2></a>.<a name=4:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		After the apostle has spoken about this, and note, he was in a prison, though the conditions may not have been quite so rigorous when he wrote the epistle to the Ephesians as they were when he wrote the second epistle to Timothy, but he tells us he was a prisoner; in those conditions he was not praying to the Lord to take him to Himself or to release him from prison.<a name=4:4></a> He is engaged with the saints, and the ministry of the assembly committed to him, and wanting to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery; that is, how it works, and the present importance of it, that principalities and powers in the heavenlies are learning in it the all-various wisdom of God.<a name=4:5></a> Surely, dear brethren, it is for us to have the assembly before us.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said all that, Paul tells us that he bows his knees.<a name=4:7></a> Why does he say that?<a name=4:8></a> Is it not that we should bow our knees?<a name=4:9></a> Is it not that we should understand that however much is ministered to us, if we really want to get an impression of the mystery, what the assembly is to Christ, and what it is to God, it is a question of getting down on our knees, of bowing our knees?<a name=4:10></a> That is to say, it is a matter of real exercise.<a name=4:11></a> One is reminded of the incident regarding Othniel and Achsah, Caleb's daughter.<a name=4:12></a> Achsah is a type of the assembly, and Caleb says,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#15:16">Joshua  15:16</a>).<a name=5:1></a> That is to say, he is really presenting the assembly in her attractiveness.<a name=5:2></a> And Othniel goes and smites Kirjath-sepher, the city of the book, and overcomes it.<a name=5:3></a> That is, we are not to suppose that we can get into the truth of the assembly merely by reading books.<a name=5:4></a> Read the ministry by all means, beloved brethren.<a name=5:5></a> If the Lord is giving ministry to the assembly, we ought to be diligent to follow it up.<a name=5:6></a> Thank God for the ministry, for the books in which it is recorded and made available to us, but let us not think we shall get into it merely by reading books.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Othniel had to overcome the city of the book.<a name=5:8></a> He moved in energy because he wanted to have Achsah, and if we want to have the assembly, so to speak, and the assembly as the wife, what she is to Christ, it is a question not simply of reading books, although we may get help as to the mind of God by reading books, but what is necessary is that there should be the energy of the Spirit, for Othniel no doubt represents one in the energy of the Spirit, to apprehend the truth, and if the energy of the Spirit is to come into evidence, what goes with it is that we should be marked by prayer.<a name=5:9></a> This thought of prayer is amplified in the incident.<a name=5:10></a> You remember that Othniel took Kirjath-sepher, and Caleb gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.<a name=5:11></a> But then she urges him to ask of her father a field.<a name=5:12></a> It is a question now of the influence that she exerts upon Othniel to ask of her father.<a name=5:13></a> That is what Paul was doing, he was asking
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the Father.<a name=6:1></a> He said, "I bow my knees to the Father".<a name=6:2></a> The assembly was so great in his mind that it urged him, so to speak, to get on his knees to the Father.<a name=6:3></a> Typically, that is what Achsah does; she urges Othniel to ask of her father.<a name=6:4></a> Then it says, "she sprang down from the ass.<a name=6:5></a> And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?<a name=6:6></a> And she said, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water.<a name=6:7></a> Then he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs".<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of us have been together these last three days, and I think we have had a taste of the southern land which God has given us, a good land indeed.<a name=6:9></a> But now what is needed, beloved brethren, are the upper and the nether springs.<a name=6:10></a> It is a question of the power of the Spirit operating in us both in relation to heavenly things and also in relation, you might say, to the responsible life here, because if we are not maintained fulfilling righteousness in the responsible life here, we shall not be able to rise to the spiritual level that God has in mind for us.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul tells us that he bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, "of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".<a name=6:12></a> I know nothing more encouraging than this, beloved brethren, nothing more stimulating than that we should give ourselves to praying to the Father in relation to this great

		matter of the assembly and our apprehending it in a real way.<a name=7:1></a> That the Father "may give you .<a name=7:2></a>.<a name=7:3></a>.<a name=7:4></a> to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man".<a name=7:5></a> It is the Father's Spirit.<a name=7:6></a> The Father is the Originator of these great thoughts of divine love, and in them, Christ Himself is the Centre.<a name=7:7></a> And the Father in devising the assembly has been considering for Christ, providing something for the affections of Christ.<a name=7:8></a> The more you think of it the more you see how everything dove-tails together in wonderful wisdom, but the Father is the Source of all, the One who has conceived it, and it is the Father's Spirit which strengthens us with might in the inner man.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father's Spirit will give us something of the Father's thoughts, and the Father's feelings in regard to Christ, and the Father's intentions in relation to Christ in giving Him the assembly, and will give us to understand the portion that the assembly with Christ is to fill out in the whole range of glory of which the Father is the Source.<a name=7:10></a> It says that every family in the heavens and on earth is named of the Father.<a name=7:11></a> What an immensity of glory, of which the Father is the Source, lies before us!<a name=7:12></a> And we are nearing the actuality of it.<a name=7:13></a> We are to get an impression of the immensity of it, "the breadth and length and depth and height".<a name=7:14></a> The Spirit of God uses these words to convey that there is an immense range that we are to take up, that we are to enter upon.<a name=7:15></a> We are in the very centre of it, dear brethren, because we belong to Christ.<a name=7:16></a> Christ is the Centre of it, and the assembly is with Him, in the very centre
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of it.<a name=8:1></a> The assembly has the foremost place with Christ.<a name=8:2></a> Wonderful thing!<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the apostle prays that "the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".<a name=8:4></a> As He dwells in our hearts, the true wifely features proper to the assembly will develop at the present time: faithfulness as to His interests and consideration for His tastes.<a name=8:5></a> There is plenty to do, dear brethren, at the present time.<a name=8:6></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>shows us how much there is to do, how the assembly is to be marked by activity that is the result of her wifely affections for Christ, as the outcome of the Christ dwelling in her heart by faith.<a name=8:7></a> All these things are open to us.<a name=8:8></a> I would beg of you, dear brethren, as I would urge upon myself, not to allow these things to be just abstract thoughts in our minds, but to seek that we might get a greater view in a concrete way of what there is here among the saints.<a name=8:9></a> The assembly is to be seen now representatively, and its features, in all that it is for the heart of Christ and for God, are more and more to come into expression.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the apostle gives us this wonderful example, he tells us that in the light of these great things, he bows his knees to the Father.<a name=8:11></a> There is much wealth in the passage which one could not touch upon now, leading up to that which we so often speak of as to the assembly as the great vessel of praise to God throughout all generations of the age of ages.<a name=8:12></a> "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".<a name=8:13></a> We are to be concerned as to the service of God
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		now.<a name=9:1></a> How shall we develop in ability to ascribe glory to God unto all generations of the age of ages, if we do not avail ourselves now of the Holy Spirit, as capable of developing us in spiritual intelligence and affections, so that we might be formed as the vessel of praise?<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just a word now in closing, on the third of Philippians, because there we find Paul also at the close of his course, for he is ready to be offered, or rather as he says in chapter 2, "if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all" (verse 17); showing that he was contemplating martyrdom, and rejoicing in it.<a name=9:3></a> He was now drawing near to the close of his history, and what impresses one in relation to Paul in this epistle, is that, wonderful man though he had been, with wonderful gift, and wonderfully devoted in service, and he still was devoted to the saints, as we see from <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, the one thing that was before his heart was that he might win Christ, have Christ as his gain.<a name=9:4></a> His one desire was to know Christ better.<a name=9:5></a> He speaks of the "excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (chapter 3: 8).<a name=9:6></a> It is what a spiritual man has before him at the close of his career; not that he is giving up service, not that he is ceasing to pray for the saints or anything of that sort, but over and above all that, he is commanded by one thought, that he desires to know Christ and to have Him as his gain.<a name=9:7></a> And not only that, but he has known that he has been apprehended by Christ Jesus, for a calling on high of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God in Christ Jesus.<a name=10:1></a> He is viewing Christ Jesus, Christ in glory, the Man of God's purpose and good pleasure, and he sees that he, as an individual saint, and so with every individual saint, has been taken up to be found in Christ.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing, beloved brethren.<a name=10:3></a> If we have it before us, I think it will help us to renounce everything that would attach any kind of importance to us as in the flesh, or minister to self-gratification in any form.<a name=10:4></a> The more we get into our souls that we have been apprehended for a calling on high of God in Christ Jesus, Christ Himself where He is is the Pattern of it, the more we shall recognise that the one thing to do is to allow God to go on working in our souls to that end, bringing us increasingly at this present moment into conformity to the One to whom we are shortly to be conformed, even as to our bodily condition.<a name=10:5></a> For that is what Paul had before him.<a name=10:6></a> He said, "we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself" (verses 20, 21).<a name=10:7></a> Christ's body of glory enshrines supreme moral excellence in a Man, and we ourselves are to be found in Him, and our bodies conformed to His body of glory.<a name=10:8></a> We have been apprehended for that.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul understood that God was using everything in his circumstances to further the work in him of moral conformation to Christ.<a name=10:10></a> He would accept everything with that in view.<a name=10:11></a> We read from the first

		chapter what the circumstances were; he was in bonds, and that unrighteously.<a name=11:1></a> And then certain brethren were seeking to add tribulation to his bonds by preaching Christ out of contention.<a name=11:2></a> Think of what that would mean to the spirit of a man like Paul!<a name=11:3></a> And now the question was, was he going to be overcome, or how was he going to meet it?<a name=11:4></a> He says, "for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 19).<a name=11:5></a> He would not allow himself to be overcome by it.<a name=11:6></a> He rejoiced that Christ was preached, and as to the circumstances, in the way they affected him, he would accept them and be with God in them, in the spirit of obedience.<a name=11:7></a> It is set out in its blessedness in Christ in the second chapter; it has proved itself of such moral excellence in the sight of God, that He has ordained that the One marked by obedience supremely, shall be acknowledged by all, heavenly, earthly, and infernal beings, acknowledged by all as Lord.<a name=11:8></a> God is going to exalt publicly the Man in whom obedience was supremely seen, and, beloved brethren, God will use every circumstance in our life, if we are with Him in it, and are in the light of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus, to promote further the features of Christ in us so that we may be found truly answering to our calling.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">

		I would like to speak a little about the feature of genuineness.<a name=13:2></a> We are living in the last phase of the assembly's history.<a name=13:3></a> The Lord's word to Laodicea was, "thou sayest, I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing", but the Lord's assessment of that assembly was "thou .<a name=13:4></a>.<a name=13:5></a>.<a name=13:6></a> knowest not that <i>thou</i> art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:15">Revelation  3:15</a> - 17) -- such unreality marks some in the public profession in Christendom, but over against that there are those, thank God, that are genuine, and it is of that feature that I now wish to speak.<a name=13:7></a> So I want to refer briefly to these passages which speak of: a woman who was marked by genuine motherly feeling; Barnabas, as a "Son of consolation"; Naomi and Ruth; and Paul and Timothy.<a name=13:8></a>

		The incident in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3">1 Kings  3</a>would appear to have happened shortly after Solomon came to the throne.<a name=13:9></a> God had appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, "Ask what I shall give thee".<a name=13:10></a> Solomon said, "I am but a little child .<a name=13:11></a>.<a name=13:12></a>.<a name=13:13></a> Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to discern between good and bad" (verses 5 - 9).<a name=13:14></a> God was pleased with his request and said, "I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart" (verse 12) -- the spirit of judgment.<a name=13:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28">Isaiah  28</a>it says, "In that day will Jehovah of hosts be .<a name=13:16></a>.<a name=13:17></a>.<a name=13:18></a> for a spirit of judgment to him who sitteth in judgment"

		These two women came before Solomon at the beginning of his reign.<a name=14:2></a> They were harlots, but there was a problem which had to be faced and it required judgment, and they appeared before the king.<a name=14:3></a> Both these women claimed to be the mother of the living child, and clearly one of them was not speaking the truth.<a name=14:4></a> What impresses me as I read this account is how patiently Solomon listened to them.<a name=14:5></a> He listened to both of them as they stated their case, and he did not interrupt them, and then he sums it up: "The one says, This that is living is my son, and thy son is the dead", and the other says the opposite.<a name=14:6></a> Up to that point the king did not pronounce any judgment, but then he says, "Bring me a sword".<a name=14:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a scene it was: these two women, the living child, the king and the sword, and what is going to be done?<a name=14:8></a> It is in the presence of the sword that the true features of the mother come out when Solomon says, in wisdom given of God, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other".<a name=14:9></a> That word served to bring out true maternal feelings, so that one woman immediately says, "Ah, my lord!<a name=14:10></a> give her the living child, and in no wise put it to death".<a name=14:11></a> True maternal feelings, genuine maternal feelings are there, but the other woman says, "Let it be neither mine nor thine; divide it".<a name=14:12></a> How coldly and callously that woman spoke about division.<a name=14:13></a> Solomon then forms a judgment in the presence of what they have said.<a name=14:14></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>, John speaks of himself as "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience".<a name=39:2></a> He loved Christ, and knew the love of Christ for him, and, though isolated "in the island called Patmos", he is conscious of his links with the saints.<a name=39:3></a> If we feel the limitations of the circumstances in which we are, then the consciousness of our links with the saints universally is a wonderfully sustaining thing.<a name=39:4></a> Still John regards himself as "your .<a name=39:5></a>.<a name=39:6></a>.<a name=39:7></a> fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=39:8></a> Well, there had been a scattering of the saints; how is the kingdom to be maintained in these circumstances?<a name=39:9></a> I believe that the coming of the Lord will be very soon, but patience is needed in the present time.<a name=39:10></a> How is it to be sustained?<a name=39:11></a> - in Jesus.<a name=39:12></a> That makes it worthwhile.<a name=39:13></a>

		John continues, "I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet".<a name=40:3></a> The power of the heavenly voice was in no sense diminished by the circumstances in which John was.<a name=40:4></a> That mighty, powerful voice spoke to him and told him certain things.<a name=40:5></a> What a wonderful revelation this book is.<a name=40:6></a> What glorious things were vouchsafed to him: "what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these" (verse 19).<a name=40:7></a> He gets a marvellous view of all that God has under His hand and in His mind to do.<a name=40:8></a> Well, though our circumstances may be limited down here, yet divine Persons are not limited, and we can be lifted in spirit out of our circumstances and brought into contact with a scene that is heavenly and spiritual.<a name=40:9></a> Think of all that was vouchsafed to him!<a name=40:10></a> But what lies behind it, I believe, is what he says in verse 5, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood".<a name=40:11></a> These circumstances had not diminished for a moment John's conscious sense of the love of the Lord Jesus.<a name=40:12></a> It was not to Him who <i>has</i> loved us, although that is so.<a name=40:13></a> He loved us and He died on the cross -- that was a demonstration of His love -- but it is a present love: "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood".<a name=40:14></a> That is the One who sustains His own in conditions of limitation and weakness, for His love is the same.<a name=40:15></a>

		It is laid upon my heart to say a word in regard to God's will, feeling that it becomes the test to men, and hence to us.<a name=43:4></a> One feels especially encouraged to call attention to it in view of existing conditions, for it is the question really raised at the present moment amongst God's people; that is, Is God's will or man's will to rule?<a name=43:5></a> What is noticeable in the passage I have read is, that all that is contrary to God's will has to be removed; whereas, on the other hand, he who does the will of God abides for ever.<a name=43:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John does not here raise the question as to where he is to abide, but he habitually refers to the sphere created by God for man, and he thinks of it as a sphere of blessing, and a sphere in which God's will is to be paramount.<a name=43:7></a> Evidently, if God creates a sphere, He creates it for His own pleasure, and He intends that it is to be dominated by His will; and all who are not at agreement with His will have to go, for God will not brook any disagreement.<a name=43:8></a> It is well for people to make their minds up as to this.<a name=43:9></a> God will not admit of any divergence from His will.<a name=43:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will find if you trace it in Scripture that this is so, and what specially marked Christ was, that in becoming Man He recognises the principle of absolute submission to God's will.<a name=44:1></a> He came into the sphere designed for man, and that was His first object; He would at all cost recognise God's will.<a name=44:2></a> As we have been seeing already, He found the law, which was the expression of God's will, disregarded; but He says, "thy law is within my heart" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:8">Psalm  40:8</a>).<a name=44:3></a> In a way I know of nothing that brings out the faithfulness of Christ, and what He was as a perfect Man, more than that.<a name=44:4></a> He had in His soul before God the idea of what man's place was, and that is, that man was to be subject to God.<a name=44:5></a> Hence He thought so much of God's will and of His law that He had it in His heart.<a name=44:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only did He keep the law Himself, but He brings in a generation who keep it also.<a name=44:7></a> I think if there is one thing more than another that brings out who Christ is, it is that He is capable of bringing into God's world a generation of people who love His law.<a name=44:8></a> You remember how that, directly He begins to teach His disciples, He taught them how to pray, and what He had in view was the production of a race which should be according to Himself, loving the will of God.<a name=44:9></a> He says, "pray <i>ye</i>, Our Father .<a name=44:10></a>.<a name=44:11></a>.<a name=44:12></a> thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:9">Matthew  6:9</a>, 10).<a name=44:13></a> The Lord was perfectly cognisant of what existed in heaven.<a name=44:14></a> God's will was not contravened in heaven, but it was on earth.<a name=44:15></a> So His thought was to form His disciples in accordance with God's will,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and hence their petition was to be, "thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth".<a name=45:1></a> And I think that this desire is what the Spirit of God produces in us.<a name=45:2></a> But I will come to that presently.<a name=45:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was saying that if you search the Scriptures you will find that in every new departure in God's ways there was something that indicated His will, and whatever it may have been, it became the test for the moment.<a name=45:4></a> It takes a very little thing to indicate what God's will may be, and it takes also a very little thing to indicate that it is man's intention to disregard it.<a name=45:5></a> You find this at the very outset.<a name=45:6></a> Eden was designed for man; it was a garden of delights, in every way representing the goodness of God; but there was one element there that was a testimony to God's rights; God planted one tree there, which was a witness to His rights.<a name=45:7></a> He planted another, a witness to His counsels; the tree of life was a witness to His counsels, but He also planted a tree there which was a witness to His rights, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and what was a testimony to God's rights placed man under responsibility.<a name=45:8></a> So that in result the conditions were simply this, that God had formed a sphere which was in every way in accordance with His nature as revealed, and that sphere was to be dominated by His will.<a name=45:9></a> It was very simple.<a name=45:10></a> The will of God for the moment was set forth in a negative way.<a name=45:11></a> It was a question of what should not be taken.<a name=45:12></a> It was negative, but it was sufficient to become a testimony to God's rights.<a name=45:13></a> It indicated that the sphere in which He placed man
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was to be dominated by the will of God, and hence Adam was placed under responsibility.<a name=46:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see that what the apostle John states in the passage I read is fully verified in what took place.<a name=46:2></a> Adam did not abide "for eternity".<a name=46:3></a> He was driven out because he did not regard God's will, and so it is, that unless there is recognition of God's will in any given sphere of blessedness (and there is at the present time a sphere of blessedness ordained of God) those who do not recognise His will must go out.<a name=46:4></a> It is not a question of what your brethren may think of you, but of the unalterable principles of God's government.<a name=46:5></a> Adam was driven out because he did not recognise God's will.<a name=46:6></a> And this we find all through the Scriptures.<a name=46:7></a> You will find that in every departure in God's ways, in every new phase of the testimony, there was always something that indicated that God's will must prevail.<a name=46:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been speaking of the law given to Moses, which was in an especial way the testimony on the part of God to His rights.<a name=46:9></a> It was not a negative law like that given to Adam; it contained positive requirements.<a name=46:10></a> It was one of two testimonies.<a name=46:11></a> There were two great witnesses in the Old Testament: first, the law, and secondly, the prophets.<a name=46:12></a> I do not know if we have considered them much in that light, but it is clear from the New Testament that these are the two witnesses to men in the Old Testament.<a name=46:13></a> "The law and the prophets", the Lord says "were until John" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16:16">Luke  16:16</a>).<a name=46:14></a> I take the law to be a witness to God's rights, and the prophets to be a witness to His patience.<a name=46:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable that there were so many prophets.<a name=47:1></a> I have often wondered why there were so many.<a name=47:2></a> You would think Isaiah said so much, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, that these three would be sufficient, but it is very interesting to see that there are so many, and there were a great many more prophets than those who have written.<a name=47:3></a> There were prophets who spoke, whose words are not recorded.<a name=47:4></a> The prophets have a voice.<a name=47:5></a> I believe the voice of the prophets, in one respect, is the patience of God, God's long-suffering.<a name=47:6></a> It tries a man to get up early.<a name=47:7></a> God states several times, in figure, of course, that He rose up early to send prophets.<a name=47:8></a> It does not say this as to the law, but He rose up early to send prophets; a striking testimony to His patience.<a name=47:9></a> The people de-parted from Him and from blessing, and hence He recalls them.<a name=47:10></a> He gets up early to send prophets to them to recall them to what was a standing witness to His rights.<a name=47:11></a> The permanent testimony to God's rights in the Old Testament is the law.<a name=47:12></a> We were saying that Israel did not keep it, and hence God made an ark in which to treasure it; so that the ark was the depository of His law.<a name=47:13></a> The ark is a most remarkable type of Christ in many ways, but especially in this, that it is the treasury of God's law, that in which God's law was preserved when men could not keep it.<a name=47:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what I want to say, as briefly as I can, is that the Lord Jesus Christ has taken up the testimony, He has taken up the law, He has treasured it in His

		heart; He came to fulfil it, and that one jot or tittle of it should not fail.<a name=48:1></a> Moreover, what He proposes to do is to bring in a generation of law-abiding people.<a name=48:2></a> We were speaking about the Son of man, and I think the Son of man recovered humanity for God, but how?<a name=48:3></a> He recovered man in the law-abiding condition.<a name=48:4></a> That condition is set forth in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=48:5></a> He treasured the law in His heart; He was here for God's pleasure, and He is raised up on high and given a place in heaven.<a name=48:6></a> That was the place for the ark of the testimony for the moment, but there is now a place for it on earth.<a name=48:7></a> He treasured that which was the most precious thing on earth, the will of God, and He goes to heaven.<a name=48:8></a> What you see is that the Lord intends to bring in a generation after His own pattern.<a name=48:9></a> It is just that which I would like especially to make clear.<a name=48:10></a> The disciples asked Him to teach them to pray.<a name=48:11></a> I think it were well for us to be stirred up in regard to God's will, and directly you become exercised, what marks you is prayer.<a name=48:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would say one word in regard to prayer, and that is, that God does not always answer prayer immediately, because He puts your heart to the test as to whether you really value what you ask for.<a name=48:13></a> As an example, Jacob requested from Jehovah in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32">Genesis  32</a>that He would reveal His name to him.<a name=48:14></a> He says, "Tell me, I pray thee, thy name" (verse 29).<a name=48:15></a> God had asked Jacob for his name, and he told Him that his name was Jacob.<a name=48:16></a> Jacob in turn asked God for His name, and God says, "How is it that thou askest after my name?<a name=48:17></a>" It is well

		for us to have our interest aroused as to something of God that we are not acquainted with, because directly our interest is awakened as to something we do not know, we ask.<a name=49:1></a> God does not answer Jacob's request until <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35">Genesis  35</a>.<a name=49:2></a> He waited until then, and in that chapter God answers him in His own time.<a name=49:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must never think that we can control God in any way, even by prayer.<a name=49:4></a> God reserves the right to answer, and He chooses His own time and place to answer.<a name=49:5></a> In regard to Jacob, the place where he got the answer was at Bethel, and the time was when Jacob arrived there.<a name=49:6></a> Bethel is God's house.<a name=49:7></a> That is where most things are disclosed to you.<a name=49:8></a> You may ask for things from God at home and He answers in the assembly.<a name=49:9></a> I do not say it is so in every case, of course, but the assembly is the oracle really, and if you are in the assembly in heart, all your difficult questions will be answered.<a name=49:10></a> It is in Bethel that God answers Jacob's question, "Tell me, I pray thee, thy name", and it is there He says, "I am the Almighty God" (chapter 35: 11).<a name=49:11></a> That is a wonderful disclosure.<a name=49:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are accustomed to the term "God Almighty", but it was a wonderful thing for Jacob to have a God like that.<a name=49:13></a> It means that He is Almighty.<a name=49:14></a> He is able to do everything to accomplish His counsels, and to do everything needed for our good, and He revealed His name to Jacob in His house.<a name=49:15></a> I do not know of a chapter that is, in a way, more helpful to believers than <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35">Genesis  35</a>.<a name=49:16></a> I think it shows how God directs His people into a sphere in which His interests are, and where His will is paramount.<a name=49:17></a> God says to Jacob,

		Now chapter 23 gives us the record of the death of Sarah, and Abraham's purchase of a burial- ground.<a name=78:4></a> It is perhaps one of the most interesting chapters in the Old Testament, for it establishes the rights of redemption in regard to the earth, and you have the purchase price paid with the current money of the country, and the land made sure to Abraham for ever.<a name=78:5></a> And, let me remind you, that piece of land is going to be demanded, and Israel shall come forth and people the earth.<a name=78:6></a> The incident is a picture of Israel, for the time being, buried; but the rights of redemption are held by the true Abraham, and He will take up those rights, and Israel will come forth and stand upon the earth, for the purchase price has

		Chapter 24 stands between chapter 23 and the incidents recorded in chapter 25 where other families are referred to; but you will have noticed in it that Isaac gets the pre-eminent place -- Abraham gave to Isaac all that he had, and before he died he sent the other families away eastward.<a name=79:3></a> The picture is beautiful: there stand Isaac and Rebecca, with all the blessing of his father, in a unique and distinct position; and all the other families blessed as only Abraham could bless them, but sent away eastward.<a name=79:4></a>

		Now the hope of our calling is connected, I think, with the 24th chapter of Genesis; and when you come to consider the way we have to enter into it, practically, you will, I think, agree that the Spirit of God has graciously given us, through Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, three salient epistles that deal with the subject; I do not at all undervalue Paul's other epistles, but the three epistles in which the heart of the apostle comes out in a distinct way in this connection are those to the Romans, the Colossians, and the Ephesians.<a name=79:5></a> I may remind you that the apostle had not seen either the Roman or Colossian saints when he wrote those epistles; he had, however, been to Ephesus, and he knew the people intimately.<a name=79:6></a> Ah!<a name=79:7></a> beloved, it is an immense thing that we should be established in these with a view to entering on the whole of our calling.<a name=79:8></a>

		In our meditations upon the various types of the church, we have now come to that of Eve.<a name=82:2></a> The order selected has been that which would suggest our spiritual progress rather than the unfolding of truth from the divine standpoint.<a name=82:3></a> There are certain spiritual steps we take in experimentally reaching that which is proper to the assembly.<a name=82:4></a> Hence Eve suitably comes last.<a name=82:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rebecca as a type sets forth the church as presented in the epistle to the Colossians; Eve the view of the church seen in Ephesians.<a name=82:6></a> Eve is a type given to us before the question of sin came into the world.<a name=82:7></a> And the view presented is not that of the church in the ways of God, but as the fruit of divine counsel and as having a place according to the purpose of God.<a name=82:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) Eve typifies the church as the subject of divine counsel and as sharing in the headship of Christ.<a name=82:9></a> The words, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion", obviously included Eve.<a name=82:10></a> It was a matter of divine counsel that the woman should share with the man the position as set over the works of God's hands.<a name=82:11></a> The first chapter of Ephesians brings this before us as to the church.<a name=82:12></a> After the apostle's prayer in chapter 1: 17 - 20 an additional statement is given, "and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies", etc.<a name=82:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having raised Christ from the dead, the thoughts of divine counsel were unfettered, and it was an act of divine pleasure to place Christ thus as Head over all things to the assembly.<a name=83:1></a> The church is given to share with Him in headship.<a name=83:2></a> In Colossians Christ is said to be the Head of the body (chapter 1: 18), but here He is given to be Head over all things to the assembly, and the assembly is said to be the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=83:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both the man and the woman were included in the name Adam, and together they were to have the place of dominion over all earthly creation.<a name=83:4></a> And the church is included in the thought of headship as presented in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>.<a name=83:5></a> She shares with Christ in the place of supreme influence.<a name=83:6></a> This, dear reader, let us note is a question of the pleasure and counsel of God.<a name=83:7></a> Nothing, of course, can possibly interfere with or prevent it.<a name=83:8></a> The counsel of God shall stand.<a name=83:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is refreshing to turn from the turmoil of conditions here on earth to the calm definite certitude of divine counsel.<a name=83:10></a> It is God's will, and in divine counsel it is settled, that Christ and the church shall be together over all things.<a name=83:11></a> There will be many families in the world of the Father's pleasure (as we read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:15">Ephesians  3:15</a>), and each family will have some impression of Christ who will fill all things.<a name=83:12></a> But the assembly will be 'next his heart' as has been happily remarked; indeed she will be His body, His fulness: His every feature will be expressed in the assembly.<a name=83:13></a> Who can now rightly estimate the precious influence the church will exert both in the world to come and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) In order that there should be such a place, we find a work of God of a special kind.<a name=84:2></a> Not only is the assembly the fruit of divine counsel, she is also the product of an entirely divine work, and she is derived from Christ.<a name=84:3></a> This is beautifully prefigured in the type before us.<a name=84:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How really wonderful it is that in the quiet, pure scene described in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>God typically set forth the fact of the death of Christ and the formation of the assembly.<a name=84:5></a> There is no reference made to any other question: it was not a matter of remedying things, but of the pleasure of God.<a name=84:6></a> The "deep sleep" was wholly with a view to forming a helpmate for Adam.<a name=84:7></a> It is very clear that neither the death of Christ nor the assembly were afterthoughts.<a name=84:8></a> The entrance of sin into the world had not yet taken place.<a name=84:9></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>describes a condition of things wholly the outcome of divine wisdom and pleasure.<a name=84:10></a> This act of forming the woman was the fruit of divine deliberation.<a name=84:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From Adam, then, God takes a rib, and out of this rib He builded the woman.<a name=84:12></a> The infidel mind may find difficulty, and scorn to receive the simplicity of the divine account.<a name=84:13></a> But the believer is filled with holy wonder as he reads the record in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=84:14></a> Marvellous indeed that God should thus set forth the far greater marvel of the death of Christ and the formation through that death of a vessel suited to be a companion of Christ!<a name=84:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be advisable again to remark that the side
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of truth here presented is that of the purpose and work of God.<a name=85:1></a> In previous articles other sides of truth -- equally important in their place -- have come before us.<a name=85:2></a> But it is necessary to seize this view of things; for otherwise a great deal of Scripture is unintelligible to us.<a name=85:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one view we may consider the "deep sleep" of Adam as typically covering the whole period during which the assembly is being formed.<a name=85:4></a> And when she is brought to Christ He will recognise that which is wholly of Himself.<a name=85:5></a> In another view the "deep sleep" suggests the death of Christ, and in His resurrection the assembly is seen as made to live and, elevated in His exaltation, she sits in heavenly places in Him.<a name=85:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of immense moment to recognise that viewed in this light, and in fact spiritually viewed, the church is wholly derived from Christ.<a name=85:7></a> Though we can well remember, as we are exhorted to in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, that we were Gentiles in the flesh, yet in the way in which we are considering the church, what we were is not the question at all.<a name=85:8></a> The church is wholly the product of God's work.<a name=85:9></a> There was no past to Eve, and Adam could recognise that she was wholly "of him".<a name=85:10></a> "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>).<a name=85:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this that qualifies the church for the place she has of wondrous intimacy and influence.<a name=85:12></a> How else could she be the suited companion of Christ?<a name=85:13></a> How else fitted to share with Him His place of headship?<a name=85:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great moment in our soul's history when we can take up this ground spiritually.<a name=86:1></a> The privileges of the assembly connected with the first day of the week are after this order.<a name=86:2></a> A 'first day' obviously has no day before it.<a name=86:3></a> And as we are by the Spirit's power enabled to take up our place as of the assembly, we are entitled to view our whole history and being as of Christ .<a name=86:4></a>.<a name=86:5></a>.<a name=86:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So long as we are on earth we have our several paths of responsibility, and the assembly as in the wilderness has its history and responsibility.<a name=86:7></a> The first epistle to the Corinthians views the assembly thus.<a name=86:8></a> But there is also another side of the truth, and Eve sets forth the assembly according to the purpose of God and as wholly derived from Christ.<a name=86:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) From <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>we learn that which the type does not afford, namely, that Christ loved the assembly and gave Himself for her.<a name=86:10></a> The deep sleep of Adam did not set forth his love for Eve; but the death of Christ was the deepest proof of love.<a name=86:11></a> It is not the only proof; for He still cares for the assembly and lives for her, sanctifying her by the washing of water by the word.<a name=86:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to its actual condition, the assembly needs to be purified from that which is extraneous to it -- to be washed from that which is really not itself.<a name=86:13></a> This is the present service of Christ.<a name=86:14></a> He gave Himself for the assembly and proved His love in so doing.<a name=86:15></a> But though as an object of His love He could view it as wholly pleasing to Him apart from whatever might be its circumstantial condition, as here on earth, it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord now serves His assembly in His activities of love.<a name=87:6></a> It may be He leads us to see that we are allowing an element belonging to Gentiles in the flesh or some other feature of the children of wrath.<a name=87:7></a> His loving service is removing it; He is purifying the assembly.<a name=87:8></a> It is with a view of the final presentation to Himself of a church without spot or any such thing.<a name=87:9></a> All is being wrought out in the moral history of our souls.<a name=87:10></a> We shall be presented so.<a name=87:11></a> How would this be possible without this present service of Christ?<a name=87:12></a> He is setting us free from that which He could never love.<a name=87:13></a> As an object of His love the assembly is wholly pleasing to Him.<a name=87:14></a> Such in actual state she will soon be presented.<a name=87:15></a> Wholly of Christ, the fruit of His death, the object of His love, the assembly will soon be presented to Christ in every way pleasing to Him and thus fitted to share with Him His glory and His place of influence over all things.<a name=87:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures refer to longing or desire, and it is in mind to speak, with the help of the Spirit of God, as to the feelings and longings of divine Persons.<a name=97:1></a> There are instructions for us in Scripture as to how we should walk.<a name=97:2></a> The first epistle to the Corinthians would bear on our conduct in regard of the assembly, and other epistles would amplify that.<a name=97:3></a> The epistle to the Romans would help us as to our individual walk, leading on to the assembly, because the assembly is ever in view in divine arrangements.<a name=97:4></a> The first epistle to Timothy would help us as to how we should conduct ourselves in the house of God.<a name=97:5></a> These things are given to us for our help and guidance, so that, when circumstances arise that test us, we should have recourse to Scripture to guide us as to what we should do, as helped, of course, by the Holy Spirit.<a name=97:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we need help and guidance to use what we have been given by way of instruction, and the Lord has in mind that, whatever the circumstances, there should be an answer provided that would result in two things: one, that what is right might be done; and the other, that there might be glory to God.<a name=97:7></a> As exercises come up in relation to divine things it is not simply sufficient that matters should be put right, but God would look for something added.<a name=97:8></a> That is prefigured in the Old Testament where it says, "he
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		shall make restitution for the wrong that he hath done in the holy things, and shall add the fifth part thereto" (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5:16">Leviticus  5:16</a>).<a name=98:1></a> Well, that is instruction for us, and I think most would agree that it is a simple matter to rehearse the truth -- it is good, and it has its own value -- but to work out the truth is a real test.<a name=98:2></a> We speak about self-judgment, but let us practise it so that Christ becomes greater and what is in us according to flesh is reduced.<a name=98:3></a> There is much discipline among the saints, and we would speak about it very carefully, but God is working to that end, and in one way there is an element of encouragement even in the very discipline itself, "for whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:6">Hebrews  12:6</a>); and the Lord Himself said, "<i>I</i> rebuke and discipline as many as I love" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:19">Revelation  3:19</a>).<a name=98:4></a> Discipline is no light matter, but still there is this element of comfort in it, that as accepted from God's hand there will be fruit.<a name=98:5></a>

		I would like now to touch on the scriptures read as to the feelings of divine Persons, either actually or typically, on the line of desire.<a name=98:6></a> I am thinking of David here as a type of Christ, and what he looked for.<a name=98:7></a> It says, "David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate!<a name=98:8></a>" David was then in the stronghold.<a name=98:9></a> You might say, in one sense, the position is impregnable, and that is true, for what is connected with the position the Lord has taken up cannot be overthrown, it is impregnable.<a name=98:10></a> But there is the other side in which it is possible to minister to

		His blessed heart something that He actively desires.<a name=99:1></a> Bethlehem, to David, I suppose, would mean much, for, historically, it was the place of his youth.<a name=99:2></a> But perhaps we could apply it in this sense, that, as the Lord looks back over the history of the testimony, there is much that He has enjoyed from His saints, there has been much for His heart from the gatherings of His people.<a name=99:3></a> The Lord looks at the present time for something from His own that would be pleasing and refreshing to His own blessed heart.<a name=99:4></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>we read, "For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling".<a name=100:11></a> Think of that, God Himself, in all the greatness of His Being, yet having desires after a dwelling place such as this.<a name=100:12></a> What would He find in Zion?<a name=100:13></a> A place of sovereign mercy.<a name=100:14></a> Zion, typically, would be composed of the fruit of His own work, the persons there would be persons like you and me, enjoying a sense of mercy.<a name=100:15></a> Paul, the apostle, never left Zion in that sense, he carried with him throughout all his christian pathway a growing sense of God's mercy.<a name=100:16></a> He says, "but mercy was shewn me because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:13">1 Timothy  1:13</a>).<a name=100:17></a> What a sense of mercy Paul had, and what a fine thing it is to carry with us a sense of mercy, and of divine love and divine giving.<a name=100:18></a> These things should form us spiritually.<a name=100:19></a> A good assembly person, I believe, would be well-founded in the truth of the glad tidings.<a name=100:20></a> Paul, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>, exhorts the saints to "take to you the panoply of God, that ye may be able to withstand in

		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>it speaks of the Lord's desire, His own feelings entering into this matter.<a name=103:2></a> I know it relates to the passover, but the thought was in one's mind that what the Lord looked for was the company of His own.<a name=103:3></a> The Lord is still in rejection, He is refused publicly, and He feels that.<a name=103:4></a> He is rejected by many in Christendom, but we would respect the work of God, and salute it, wherever we see it.<a name=103:5></a> Luke's gospel does not deal with the side of pressure quite so much as Matthew and Mark, as we know.<a name=103:6></a> What Luke brings out more is the side of things connected with the Lord's feelings and sufferings that the saints can take account of, and that is an interesting consideration.<a name=103:7></a> It says in Luke's account, when they were on the mount of Olives, that the Lord found the disciples "sleeping from grief" (verse 45).<a name=103:8></a> They were overwhelmed for the moment by the pressure that had come upon them.<a name=103:9></a> It says of the Lord that "being in conflict he prayed more intently.<a name=103:10></a> And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth" (verse 44).<a name=103:11></a> We are intended to feel conditions as they are in the testimony, and to feel them as the Lord feels them.<a name=103:12></a>

		I conclude with reference to <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, where we have the Lord's own feelings expressed as though His sufferings were past, and it has in view, I believe, that we might be with Him.<a name=104:10></a> It is wonderful to think that believers are the objects and the subjects of divine desires.<a name=104:11></a> The Lord in this chapter speaks about men, "the men whom thou gavest me" (verse 6), that is, persons (both brothers and sisters) formed substantially after Christ, having taken on the features of manhood, able to stand in the testimony and maintain, not only the truth, but the character that belongs to the present dispensation.<a name=104:12></a> You might say the two are one thing, and in a way they are, but the character of things which the Lord

		So the Lord says, "as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me".<a name=105:2></a> The Lord knew practically what it was like to be alone, yet He could say, "I am not alone .<a name=105:3></a>.<a name=105:4></a>.<a name=105:5></a> he that has sent me is with me" (chapter 8: 16, 29), and again, "and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me" (chapter 16: 32).<a name=105:6></a> The Lord knew what loneliness of spirit meant, He knew what standing for the truth meant, and His desire is that He might encourage us and strengthen us, so that, even though we go through circum-stances that are testing, He can assure us that He has been that way, and that He has been maintained in it, and He has been faithful.<a name=105:7></a> And so He says, "I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" -- what a thought that is!<a name=105:8></a> I cannot say much about it -- simply this, that the Lord would have His own, persons like you and me, with Himself to take account of His glory that the Father had given Him.<a name=105:9></a>

		Perhaps one might say that there are few books in the Bible less understood than the book of Deuteronomy; and I think it is because the assembly is not understood; for, I take it, that Deuteronomy contains regulations for the assembly.<a name=106:1></a> You will notice in chapter 1: 5, that Moses speaks of a second law.<a name=106:2></a> He had given the first one in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>.<a name=106:3></a>.<a name=106:4></a>.<a name=106:5></a> But what you find in the book of Deuteronomy are instructions for the people, which were to be permanent; laws which applied to them as in the land.<a name=106:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is to my mind of great importance that that thought should be laid hold of.<a name=106:7></a> You will notice that, after speaking of the law given in the land of Moab, the Spirit proceeds to indicate the character of it; "Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have stayed long enough in this mountain.<a name=106:8></a> Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbouring places in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and by the seaside, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<a name=106:9></a> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them" (verses 6 - 8).<a name=106:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most touching that God, through Moses, should proceed to suggest to the people that they move on, opening up to them the entire extent of the promised land.<a name=107:9></a> That is what the Spirit of God would seek to do for us.<a name=107:10></a> The resurrection and ascension of Christ secures for man at the present moment what answers spiritually to the entire extent of the land of promise, from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, including the valleys and the hills, Lebanon and the sea-shore; a land flowing with milk and honey; a land watered with the rain from heaven; a land influenced by heaven itself; that land is opened up to the people of God at the present moment, and it is most touching that Jehovah, in opening up His second law, in giving the regulations for the land, should suggest to them to go in.<a name=107:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, where are we?<a name=108:11></a> The plains of Moab is a most desirable place for a certain state of soul in Christians.<a name=108:12></a> The Israelite that inhabited the plains of Moab had the Spirit typically, and was an intelligent believer .<a name=108:13></a>.<a name=108:14></a>.<a name=108:15></a> People who dwell there are Christians; they have title to Canaan, but they do not go there, and, inasmuch as they have no regulations from God, they make regulations for themselves, they formulate codes of laws for themselves; these laws are especially fitted for them, but they are not God's laws.<a name=108:16></a> Now God begins His law by directing His people to move into Canaan, and He opens up the entire extent of the land of promise to them.<a name=108:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I was saying that Deuteronomy corresponds with the assembly in a sense.<a name=109:1></a> One could easily show that from different passages.<a name=109:2></a> I refer to one particularly in chapter 16, in which Jehovah enjoins the people, all the males, to appear before Him three times in the year (verse 16).<a name=109:3></a> Now I take it that when the Spirit of God specifies the males among His people He alludes to the saints viewed as formed in the intelligence of the Spirit, and hence they represent the whole.<a name=109:4></a> They were to appear three times in the year.<a name=109:5></a> I venture to connect it with the Lord's request in regard to the Lord's supper.<a name=109:6></a> It may be inquired, Why three times?<a name=109:7></a> I believe that three is an adequate testimony, and in the threefold appearance of all the males of Israel in the presence of Jehovah you have an adequate testimony of their affections, affections formed by the Spirit of God, and they are not on the wane.<a name=109:8></a> If they only appeared once or twice one might conclude that their affections were declining; but inasmuch as they were to appear three times in the year it indicates how Jehovah would secure for Himself the affections of His people.<a name=109:9></a> As often as they responded there was a positive testimony to sustained affections.<a name=109:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think that it is in that way the Lord maintains us.<a name=109:11></a> We do not come three times in the year only; we come on the first day of every week in answer to the request of our Lord.<a name=109:12></a> Every Christian who neglects the Supper virtually confesses that he has no affection for Christ.<a name=109:13></a> It is impossible for one who really has affection for Christ, and who rightly
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=110>[Page 110]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		understands the Supper, to neglect it.<a name=110:1></a> Therefore the Supper was to be a continual law, so to say.<a name=110:2></a> It was to be permanent during the absence of Christ.<a name=110:3></a> It was to afford an opportunity for the saints to attest their affection for the Lord.<a name=110:4></a> But what I wish specially to call attention to is that in the assembly there is a witness to resurrection.<a name=110:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say, for the moment, that the assembly itself is that, although that is also true, but what I see in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26">Deuteronomy  26</a>is that, as the Lord's people appear before God they do not appear in their own nakedness; they appear with that in evidence which is an obvious testimony to Christ in resurrection, the basket of firstfruits.<a name=110:6></a> That is what I had specially before my mind, but I would like to encourage you first of all in regard to the assembly.<a name=110:7></a> As the resurrection of Christ is realised and laid hold of in the soul one is led to the assembly, and once there, you are under the law that is to regulate the assembly.<a name=110:8></a> I would impress you with that, because we are living in a most lawless age; and I would point out again that the law that is to regulate you in your individual conduct is not the law that is to regulate you in the assembly.<a name=110:9></a> There are regulations for the assembly that have no reference to the wilderness; and there are regulations for the wilderness which have no reference to the assembly.<a name=110:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most important, if we are to walk together, and if we are to maintain the order that belongs to God, and to God's house, that we should recognise that there is a code of laws, so to speak, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=111>[Page 111]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		regulates the assembly.<a name=111:1></a> Those laws are of a unique character; as I have already pointed out, they begin with directing the saints to go in, and that in itself suggests a great deal.<a name=111:2></a> They are of a unique character; in truth, because it is the law of new creation.<a name=111:3></a> Who can tell anything about the law of new creation?<a name=111:4></a> Certainly none but those who are created anew.<a name=111:5></a> The apostle says, "neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation.<a name=111:6></a> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:15">Galatians  6:15</a> - 16).<a name=111:7></a> Is that your rule?<a name=111:8></a> It is a rule that is altogether outside of the ken of man in the flesh.<a name=111:9></a> He may know something of the law given at Sinai, but the law of new creation is outside of him.<a name=111:10></a> The law that rules in God's world is altogether and absolutely outside of the knowledge of man in the flesh for "neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision".<a name=111:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what the assembly presents under the eye of God.<a name=111:12></a> It is a company of people here upon the earth risen with Christ, morally outside the present order of things .<a name=111:13></a>.<a name=111:14></a>.<a name=111:15></a> it is ruled by the law of new creation; in that people there is what is for God, and it is because of that I delight in the book of Deuteronomy.<a name=111:16></a> It is the family book.<a name=111:17></a> The priest and the Levite officially have little place there.<a name=111:18></a> The priest is recognised in chapter 26, but when the man comes and sets his basket of firstfruits before God (verse 10) he is the most conspicuous person; not that he was conspicuous personally, but the basket of firstfruits was conspicuous.<a name=111:19></a> You may ask where he

		got it.<a name=112:1></a> We must not be too abstract in dealing with divine things.<a name=112:2></a> If that man came in with his basket of firstfruits they cost him something; they were placed down by the altar; they were a sacrifice.<a name=112:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember David positively declined to offer to God anything that he did not pay for; and the man who can come up on the first day of the week with a basket of firstfruits brings what has cost him something; they may cost him a good deal of self-denial, and a good deal of sacrifice.<a name=112:4></a> They are the fruit of the Holy Spirit in his affections; they are the fruit of the Holy Spirit forming a man after Christ; so that, instead of the Aramaean, instead of a poor dying, perishing Aramaean, you have a man living; for, remember, the man himself is the basket and the firstfruits are in the man; they are not separated from the man, they are in him.<a name=112:5></a> The man is formed after Christ by the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=112:6></a> That man appears in the presence of God in the character of Christ risen from the dead.<a name=112:7></a> It is the firstfruits.<a name=112:8></a> He got them out of the land; he came up to Jehovah with something he had got in the land.<a name=112:9></a>

		As risen with Christ, "raised with him through faith of the working of God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>), the Holy Spirit has His way with the believer, and the Aramaean is not there; the man himself is the basket; the fruit is in the basket, and the man appears in the presence of God.<a name=112:10></a> He does not forget what his father <i>was</i>, "A perishing Aramaean", but <i>he</i> is not ready to perish.<a name=112:11></a> Viewed as risen with Christ we are not ready to perish; we are living; we are made to live by the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The basket is placed down there at the altar of God by the priest, and the man worships.<a name=113:8></a> And the scripture goes on to say, "And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the land, which thou, Jehovah, hast given me" (verse 10).<a name=113:9></a> The man is in the land, and he recognises that God has brought him there and given it to him, and he says, I have brought the firstfruits; he had brought them to God.<a name=113:10></a> It is a great thing for God to find in us the gracious fruit of the Spirit formed in our affections, so that morally Christ appears and not the Aramaean.<a name=113:11></a> The word says: "And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God".<a name=113:12></a> Now it seems to me that all these things are found today in the assembly.<a name=113:13></a>

		Now when you come to consider the question of the state that is necessary in order to enter into the inheritance, and this is a point of very great importance, you will remember that what led the damsel to the conclusion that she should go with the servant was the treasure that he gave out at this particular juncture; we read, he brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebecca; he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.<a name=115:3></a> This is the picture that the Spirit of God gives to captivate the heart for Christ, and to get you to move in your affections to the scene where Christ is.<a name=115:4></a> Look how the Spirit lavishes the wealth of God upon you.<a name=115:5></a> Is His object that you and I might be established, and set up, and made glorious with the glory of this world?<a name=115:6></a> No, no.<a name=115:7></a> What is His object?<a name=115:8></a> It is that we might cut our connection with this scene, and move to where Christ is.<a name=115:9></a>

		(verse 19), and the glory of the children of God (verse 21).<a name=121:1></a> God has become glorious in the eye of faith, and He will eventually display that glory before the face of all; in our Lord Jesus Christ man has become glorious, and into that glory it is God's purpose to bring His loved ones.<a name=121:2></a> Man, in his estrangement from God, has sought glory, and in his own way he has gained it, for the scripture speaks of the glory of man; but it speaks of it to show how vain and short- lived it is, comparing it to the flower of the grass which falleth away (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:24">1 Peter  1:24</a>).<a name=121:3></a> This must be so, seeing that death rests upon man as God's judgment.<a name=121:4></a> Man may gain great renown among his fellows, and clothe himself with honour, but he passes away and his glory fades.<a name=121:5></a> The One to whom God has given glory has passed through death, and has been raised from the dead, the token of God's having been glorified in His death respecting sin, and also of the breaking forever of the power of evil.<a name=121:6></a> The renown which He has, therefore, is deathless, and can never fade away.<a name=121:7></a> It is through Him that God carries out all His purpose of love, and His end is to have us in association with Christ, as the many sons whom He brings to glory.<a name=121:8></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>the church is seen in its relation to the earth, under the figure of a city, the centre of administration.<a name=124:6></a> It descends from God out of heaven, invested with the glory of God.<a name=124:7></a> It is the figurative setting forth of those who are children of God, now unknown of the world, partakers of the divine nature, brought into display, and inheriting with Christ.<a name=124:8></a> Light shines from the holy city for the nations upon earth, and healing and blessing flow from thence.<a name=124:9></a>

		What a separating effect must all this have upon him who through grace enters into it!<a name=124:10></a> The eye penetrates below the surface of man's glory and sees the corruption to which the whole creation has become subject, and into the ear enters the groan which can never be hushed until Christ reigns.<a name=124:11></a> But in the midst of it we know the love of God, and in the enjoyment of that love we not only trace our own blessing of superlative degree, but we also know the peace and bliss which shall shortly fill the earth.<a name=124:12></a>

		We should appreciate this much better if we understood the conditions in the East where the sheep are absolutely dependent upon the shepherd's leading to find their food, in a land where there are no fields, only patches of grass here and there.<a name=146:9></a> We do well, dear brethren, to recognise that despite all the wealth of ministry which is being given, with the Scriptures in our hands, and all the privileges which are available to us, we still need to come under the shepherd care of Christ, to find the pastures of tender grass, and to be kept together.<a name=146:10></a> What power there is with Him to hold us together!<a name=146:11></a> He says, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd" (verse 16) -- "one flock", not 'one fold'.<a name=146:12></a> There is no need for a fold now because the Shepherd is there, and He is the point of attraction: He holds the sheep together.<a name=146:13></a>

		The fold is an artificial means of holding the sheep together, encircling them with a wall.<a name=147:1></a> The power of the Shepherd to hold the sheep individually and collectively makes unnecessary the appointment of religious leaders, organisations, committees, and such humanly devised means to hold together persons who are following Jesus in the path where He leads.<a name=147:2></a> The Lord has raised up leaders certainly; and we thank God for them!<a name=147:3></a> We should remember our leaders and follow their faith; but the Lord Jesus Himself is the Shepherd of the sheep, and He is the One we follow.<a name=147:4></a> So He takes us in chapter 10 from the individual into the collective thought.<a name=147:5></a> He says not only, 'I know my sheep', but He speaks of the one flock that we might each know consciously our part in it, proving all that the Shepherd can be to that flock collectively.<a name=147:6></a>

		The first thing which really would arise in our thoughts would be the kind of person that a man is, so we may inquire at the outset of our meditation, what kind of a man is Moses, and particularly what kind of a man is he under pressure, when there are difficulties?<a name=148:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word used for man, as many will know, is <i>Ish</i>, meaning, I believe, that in all that Moses had to undertake whether for good or correction, or in suffering or in victory he always had the affectionate feelings of a man, as I might say, a husband.<a name=149:2></a> He had, as it were, God's feelings for His people.<a name=149:3></a> God says of them later, "I was a husband unto them" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:32">Jeremiah  31:32</a>), and I believe Moses shines in this particular way as he shone in affection and real husbandly thoughts towards God's people.<a name=149:4></a> He would not be hard unless he had to be.<a name=149:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We think of him as even hesitating to speak, "I am slow of speech" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:10">Exodus  4:10</a>), he says.<a name=149:6></a> Stephen says of him later, "mighty in his words and deeds" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:22">Acts  7:22</a>), but he says of himself, "slow of speech".<a name=149:7></a> It was no doubt a thing which God helped him in, but that is what he says and that is what he meant.<a name=149:8></a> Think of the meekness of spirit too, which marked such an one, even under the most irritating circumstances of the whole people worshipping a golden calf, Moses going up to the mountain and saying he would pray for them, "perhaps", he says, "I shall make atonement for your sin" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:30">Exodus  32:30</a>).<a name=149:9></a> Think of being served, dear brethren, by a man like that.<a name=149:10></a> We have known the spirit of that in our day.<a name=149:11></a>

		So we are led to think of the spirit of a man like Moses, how he would impress the greatness of the inheritance upon us, as Paul says in our day, that we have a holy calling, a heavenly calling, a high calling, the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>).<a name=150:4></a> It is that kind of thing which Moses typically sets out, and with which he charges himself through many a wearisome year in the wilderness to bring the people to at the end.<a name=150:5></a>

		The duty of the husband is quite as simple as that of the wife.<a name=155:1></a> As hers is comprised in the word "obedience", his is contained in that of "love".<a name=155:2></a> The wife, if a direction sent to a special class be excepted (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:4">Titus  2:4</a>, Authorised Version), is never commanded to love her husband.<a name=155:3></a> It is taken for granted that she will do so; and, as a matter of fact, she seldom fails in this direction.<a name=155:4></a> Even though she may be unequally yoked -- be united to one who has not the least sympathy with her holiest feelings, and receive little but unkindness, her love will survive the harshest treatment.<a name=155:5></a> Crushed and trodden under foot, it will spring up and greet the first display of kindness with a forgiving embrace.<a name=155:6></a> It is a perennial fountain.<a name=155:7></a> But with the husband it is often otherwise.<a name=155:8></a> With fewer of the tender emotions, engrossed by his daily occupations, and exposed, it may be, to severer temptations, his danger is to forget his responsibility to love -- or at least to manifest his love to -- his chosen wife.<a name=155:9></a> Hence the Spirit of God recalls his responsibility to mind, and gives this injunction, "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word", etc.<a name=155:10></a>

		1. Let us consider what is to be the character of the husband's love as here enjoined.<a name=155:11></a> "Husbands love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved

		the assembly".<a name=156:1></a> It is a most wonderful standard; and no doubt here introduced because of the typical character of true marriage, because the primal marriage between Adam and Eve displayed, in figure, the union between Christ and the church.<a name=156:2></a> This should ever teach us the sanctity and real character of marriage before God.<a name=156:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then, we may enquire, was the character of Christ's love to the church?<a name=156:4></a> The answer is here given.<a name=156:5></a> First, He proved it by giving Himself for it (verse 25); and He gave Himself to death for it, and thereby in fact purchased His bride.<a name=156:6></a> 'He gives Himself; it is not only His life, true as that is, but Himself.<a name=156:7></a> All that Christ was has been given, and given by Himself; it is the entire devotedness and giving of Himself.<a name=156:8></a> And now all that is in Him -- His grace, His righteousness, His acceptancy with the Father, His wisdom, the excellent glory of His person, the energy of divine love that can give Itself -- all is consecrated to the welfare of the assembly.<a name=156:9></a> There are no qualities, no excellencies in Christ, which are not ours in their exercise consequent on the gift of Himself.<a name=156:10></a> He has already given them, and consecrated them to the blessing of the assembly which He has given Himself to have.<a name=156:11></a> Not only are they given, but He has given them; His love has accomplished it'.<a name=156:12></a> And this gift of Himself is greatly enhanced when we remember that it was upon the cross that this gift was consummated.<a name=156:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, His love is displayed in His sanctifying and cleansing the church with the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=157>[Page 157]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		washing of water by the word (verse 26).<a name=157:1></a> This exhibition of love is a present thing, that which goes on now, and by which He suits it to Himself.<a name=157:2></a> 'It is important to remark that Christ does not here sanctify the assembly to make it His own, but makes it His own to sanctify it.<a name=157:3></a> It is first His, then He suits it to Himself'.<a name=157:4></a> The means is the word, the washing of water by the word, the truth taught in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>by the washing of the disciples' feet by the Lord.<a name=157:5></a> And there, it will be remembered, it is in connection with His love.<a name=157:6></a> "Having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" (verse 1).<a name=157:7></a> The sanctifying and cleansing of the church is thus the expression of His abiding and unchanging love -- love that finds its delight in making it morally suitable to Himself, and hence never wearies in watching over, tending, and preparing it for Himself.<a name=157:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, the fruit of His love is seen in the object He has before Him -- "that he might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless".<a name=157:9></a> This refers to the time when the Lord shall have returned to receive His church to Himself, or more exactly, to the period indicated when it is said, "the marriage of the Lamb is come" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:7">Revelation  19:7</a>) .<a name=157:10></a>.<a name=157:11></a>.<a name=157:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And wherefore have we this wondrous description of the love of Christ for the church?<a name=157:13></a> To show what should be the character of the husband's love for his wife.<a name=157:14></a> "Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly".<a name=157:15></a> Not to press

	<div class="paragraph">
		too closely the comparison in all its parts, we yet cannot fail to observe, that as Christ's love preceded His giving Himself for the church, so there cannot be a true union in the sight of God unless it has sprung from love.<a name=158:1></a> Love, and love only, should be the motive of the choice; and love must cement and beautify the union when formed.<a name=158:2></a> The whole element of the married life should be love; and not only so, but if the husband looks upon the standard here given, he will see that the one and constant demand the wife will make upon him is for love.<a name=158:3></a> His love must endure -- survive all trials, unweariedly seeking to draw his wife closer and closer to himself, and ever keeping before him (as to earth) the object of a union which, as it has sprung from, can only be cemented by, an unchanging and indefatigable love.<a name=158:4></a> Nothing less can be intended by this divine model.<a name=158:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A special application may perhaps not be out of place.<a name=158:6></a> Many a christian husband finds himself united to an unbeliever; but his duty remains the same.<a name=158:7></a> And as the love of Christ seeks the eternal blessedness of the church, so the love of the husband will not be satisfied with seeking to secure the present comfort and happiness of his wife; but it will be exhibited in watchful and tender ministry of that word which brings the knowledge of salvation, through faith in the Lord Jesus.<a name=158:8></a> Every husband indeed will feel the obligation of caring for the spiritual welfare of his wife; for it is in this direction that his love will more nearly partake of the same character as that of Christ for the church.<a name=158:9></a> Truly therefore marriage, according

		Surely, when He will review the paths of His own, those who stood by the cross so devotedly will stand out then in a holy dignity before the vast company of the saints to hear the Lord express His great appreciation of their loyalty.<a name=184:2></a> Can we do likewise?<a name=184:3></a> Let us remember our brethren who are in reproach today -- following our rejected Lord, turning away from formal religion and from all that exalts the man after the flesh, to stand true to the cross with all its deep meaning and import!<a name=184:4></a> It was the same devoted love that led Mary Magdalene to remain at the sepulchre -- still following Him as her heart said -- I cannot leave Him.<a name=184:5></a> She was speaking in the language of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73:25">Psalm  73:25</a>, "Whom have I in the heavens?<a name=184:6></a> and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee".<a name=184:7></a>

		It is important that we should be prepared to suffer the reproach of Christ.<a name=184:8></a> Up to the present time many of us have not been called upon to suffer much in this land; some of our younger brethren are being tested more than hitherto, but the Lord would have us all follow Him with such true and deep affection that we may all be able to rejoice to be "counted worthy to be dishonoured for the name" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:41">Acts  5:41</a>).<a name=184:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in reviewing the words of the Son of God throughout this gospel, can we limit the thought of following to our path here on earth: as we follow Him, will He not delight to lead us even now into the deep joys that are His -- the Son of the Father: will He not lead our hearts into the Father's realm, into the enjoyment of the Father's love, until at last we are found with Him in the Father's house -- having followed Him there?<a name=185:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we are carried back, as has been remarked, to the garden of Eden, to the creation and presentation of Eve to Adam, which in itself is a manifest figure of the union between Christ and the church; and this fact accounts for the way in which the apostle weaves the two things in these exhortations.<a name=186:5></a> (See <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:21">Genesis  2:21</a> - 25).<a name=186:6></a> The union is thus looked upon as so complete -- as Adam said of Eve, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh"; and again, "they shall become one flesh" -- that it is said, so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.<a name=186:7></a> In this aspect, self-love is to be the measure of a man's love to his wife; and as this is one of the instincts of our nature -- and naturally its governing principle -- it is impossible to conceive of a more definite and comprehensive direction.<a name=186:8></a> Let therefore the oneness of the union -- they two shall be one flesh -- be apprehended, and love will follow; for the husband will then no more consider his wife as distinct from, but as a part of, himself.<a name=186:9></a> Thus whatever touches her, will touch him; and his self-love, moving now in a wider circle, includes her, and all that affects and concerns her, within its

		embrace.<a name=187:1></a> All that he desires for himself he will also desire for his wife; all the care he exercises for himself he will exercise for her; and all that he receives he will receive for her as well as for himself.<a name=187:2></a> In a word, all the good he seeks, and all the evil he deprecates, he will also seek and deprecate for his wife, as for himself; for together they are "one flesh", and therefore he that loveth his wife loveth himself.<a name=187:3></a> The word of God provides in this way a perfect antidote against selfishness, and leads out the husband in self-sacrifice, which is the fruit of all true love, and which finds its highest exemplification in Christ, who loved the church, and gave Himself for it.<a name=187:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have said that self-love is to be the measure, in the aspect considered, of the husband's love for his wife; but it is remarkable how this also is connected with Christ, teaching us that in no human self-love, but only in the love of Christ for the church, can its true pattern and example be found.<a name=187:5></a> For, giving the other side, the apostle proceeds: "For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, <i>even as also the Christ the assembly</i>".<a name=187:6></a> The wife therefore being "one flesh" with him, he must nourish and cherish her, even as Christ the church.<a name=187:7></a> What heights and depths are contained in this comparison!<a name=187:8></a> showing indeed that the debt of love is never paid, but always owed.<a name=187:9></a> And yet that love delights to recognise it, and to be ever paying it, in lavishing care and tenderness upon her who has thus become one with him in the view of God.<a name=187:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=188>[Page 188]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It should again be added, if we would have a full sense of the responsibility, that this obligation of love is also irrespective of the character of the wife.<a name=188:1></a> No amount of unworthiness in the wife, short of the one sin specified by our Lord, can excuse the husband from the duty of love; for Christ loves the church unceasingly, and in spite of all faults and failures, and even worse; yea, He is even seeking to wean her from her faults, and to cleanse her from her defilements by His perfect charity; and His love, be it ever remembered, is the model of that of the husband.<a name=188:2></a> It may be that he will fail to copy it in its infinite perfection; but notwithstanding, it is His love which the husband must ever have before his eyes.<a name=188:3></a> Behold in this the wisdom of God; for here is the provision to direct the gaze of the husband to Christ, to keep Him before his soul, and thereby he will surely be drawn into imitation of His love; for no one ever failed while his eye and heart were fixed upon Christ.<a name=188:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. The apostle Peter confines himself to certain aspects of the husband's responsibility.<a name=188:5></a> "Ye husbands, likewise, dwell with them according to knowledge, as with a weaker, even the female, vessel, giving them honour, as also fellow-heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered".<a name=188:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To dwell with the wife "according to knowledge", is to have the relationship, and the affections proper to it, ordered by the truth, by the knowledge which the Christian has of the relationship in the sight of God.<a name=188:7></a> And this is exceedingly important; for herein lies the difference
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=189>[Page 189]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		between the believer and the unbeliever in these relative positions; and it behoves the Christian to act in all these according to the new place in which he has been brought by the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=189:1></a> The christian husband will therefore dwell with his wife according to the truth of his union with his wife, as revealed in the Scriptures.<a name=189:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, he is to give honour to his wife, and on two grounds.<a name=189:3></a> First, on the natural ground, that she is the weaker vessel.<a name=189:4></a> There is little doubt that this reference is to the more delicate frame and organisation of the woman, requiring and deserving more gentle and more tender treatment.<a name=189:5></a> So that just as weakness constitutes a claim upon strength for consideration and support, so the wife as the "weaker vessel" has a claim upon her husband for thoughtful, loving watchfulness and care.<a name=189:6></a> He is to give her honour by rendering her all the attention which her more delicate nature requires.<a name=189:7></a> It is possible, however, that there may be a reference to the fact that "Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:14">1 Timothy  2:14</a>), that she thus showed herself to be the "weaker vessel", by being the first to fall through the subtlety of the devil.<a name=189:8></a> More easily acted on, especially through the affections, she thus needs and demands from her husband vigilant and tender care to shield her from the peculiar temptations to which, with her weaker nature, she is constantly exposed.<a name=189:9></a> But, secondly, this exhortation is grounded in grace as well as in nature, as being "fellow-heirs of the grace of life".<a name=189:10></a> In Christ there is neither male nor
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=190>[Page 190]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		female (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:28">Galatians  3:28</a>).<a name=190:1></a> All natural distinctions therefore, as constituting any relative superiority in Christ, are abolished.<a name=190:2></a> While therefore the husband claims the natural obedience of his wife, he must never forget that, if they are both children of God, they are together "heirs of God, and Christ's joint-heirs" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a>).<a name=190:3></a> And as such he is to give honour unto his wife; for these natural ties, and these relative connections, are only for earth; and when the Lord comes to receive His people unto Himself, husbands and wives will alike be caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and then both will be like unto Christ, and be for ever with Him.<a name=190:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Attention to this injunction is the more needful for the reason given, "that your prayers be not hindered".<a name=190:5></a> It is pre-supposed that husband and wife will habitually unite in prayer; and hence the warning is, that any failure in the husband to give honour unto his wife will tend to disturb harmony of feeling, and thus to hinder prayer.<a name=190:6></a> It were well if all christian husbands and wives would often ponder these words.<a name=190:7></a> For in the activities of this present time there is great danger of neglecting this united prayer; and the slightest disturbance of concord will ever tempt them to neglect it the more.<a name=190:8></a> Satan knows this, and hence he ever seeks to cloud over the peace of these relationships; for he does not forget that it is impossible for husband and wife to go together to the throne of grace when there is the smallest discord in their hearts.<a name=190:9></a> The husband must watch against this snare, remembering the importance of

		their prayers not being hindered.<a name=191:1></a> For how many things are there constantly occurring in every family which need to be spread out before God!<a name=191:2></a> And how blessed it is when husband and wife can go together, with one heart, concerning every difficulty and perplexity, to the throne of grace!<a name=191:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. There is one thing the husband is taught to avoid: "Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them".<a name=191:4></a> It might be thought that if the 'love' were secured there would be no place left for the 'bitterness'.<a name=191:5></a> But is it so in the actual experience of life?<a name=191:6></a> Many a husband, who truly loves his wife, drops, in moments of unwatchfulness, when out of the presence of God, hasty words, which are as bitter as gall to a tender heart.<a name=191:7></a> The object of the warning seems thus to be to secure the constant exercise of a spirit of self-judgment, so that the husband may avoid everything that might fret or irritate the spirit of his wife.<a name=191:8></a> Bitterness -- whatever the provocation -- is to be carefully eschewed; and it will be done the more easily if he but remember his responsibility to love his wife, even as Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it.<a name=191:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such, then, are the divine requirements from the husband.<a name=191:10></a> We might perhaps shrink from them, if we did not remember that He who enjoins them is ever at hand to supply the needed grace, and to enable us to walk according to His word.<a name=191:11></a> The power for such a walk is found in the Holy Spirit who dwells within us; and inasmuch as He ever leads us to Christ, we shall find that the path thus indicated is one of peace

		I use the word sympathy advisedly.<a name=192:8></a> It gives us another view of Christ.<a name=192:9></a> We get something very touching in the ability of Christ, because He had become a real Man, to enter sympathetically into all that which pressed on man down here.<a name=192:10></a> I think it leads up to the priesthood of Christ.<a name=192:11></a>

		There is an urgent need to hear the Lord's word and to obey it.<a name=193:2></a> It is possible to listen to the Lord's word and to be, perhaps, little affected by it.<a name=193:3></a> Some, in Ezekiel's day, who listened to such a word found it "a lovely song, a pleasant voice .<a name=193:4></a>.<a name=193:5></a>.<a name=193:6></a> and they hear thy words, but they do them not" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#33:32">Ezekiel  33:32</a>), and we too might be unmoved inwardly.<a name=193:7></a> Or the word might, like the seed that "fell by the wayside" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:4">Mark  4:4</a>), be quickly snatched from us.<a name=193:8></a> The Lord is very gracious, and He provides a word, and He looks for exercise with you and me, that we might sow and reap and take root downwards and bear fruit upwards (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#19:29">2 Kings  19:29</a>, 30).<a name=193:9></a>

		SYMPATHY IN THE TESTIMONY AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD OF GOD

	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to say a word in regard to sympathy with Christ in the testimony, and in connection with that to seek to show the importance of the word of God.<a name=202:1></a> What you can see here is that the Lord stands forth in connection with the testimony, not only as individually connected with it, but as associating others with Himself; and you will observe that whilst it states that the twelve were with Him, there were also others, and these were women.<a name=202:2></a> You will find in the Scriptures that what represents divine authority, as the apostles, is associated with what is subjective; and the feature in which the subjective side appears here I take to be that of sympathy.<a name=202:3></a>

		Now I think you will find in the perusal of the Acts that these two lines are found together.<a name=202:4></a> Most of us here are aware that Luke wrote to confirm Paul.<a name=202:5></a> It is indeed essential to a right understanding of Luke to bear that in mind, and you will find in the Acts that which corresponds with this section of his gospel; namely, the position and ministry and authority of the apostles, which I take the liberty of designating as official, it being the result of divine appointment.<a name=202:6></a>

		Then you will find that whilst awaiting His promise, the gift of the Spirit, they recognised the authority of the Scriptures in the choice of an apostle to fill Judas's place; the Scriptures being the only authority left upon earth, seeing that Jesus had gone into heaven.<a name=203:7></a> To these men the Holy Spirit came, and as endued with power from on high, they carried on their ministry.<a name=203:8></a> The Holy Spirit coming down from heaven, we are told, sat upon each of them; there were others there as we know, but I speak for the moment of the apostles.<a name=203:9></a> The Holy Spirit came into the company, and His sound filled the house where they were sitting, and He sat upon each of them.<a name=203:10></a> Peter in the power of that Spirit stood up and testified for Christ.<a name=203:11></a> Now that is the apostolic position; it was characterised by affection for Christ,

		What I wish to show is that side by side with that there appeared a spontaneous element, which is represented in Barnabas.<a name=204:4></a> I am not overlooking the fact that Barnabas was called an apostle; he was an apostle in virtue rather of what he was morally than by official appointment; that is, he was sympathetic with what was going on.<a name=204:5></a> Barnabas first appears in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>.<a name=204:6></a> We are told that he had lands and he sold them.<a name=204:7></a> Now we might have thought he sold them because he cared no longer for them; that, in the light of what was heavenly, brought in by the Spirit, he who had title to the earthly possessions surrendered them; but that is not the way in which the Spirit of God presents the matter to us.<a name=204:8></a> Barnabas had a true estimate of his property, I have no doubt, and did not undervalue it; we are told by the Spirit that he sold his lands.<a name=204:9></a> Why did he do that?<a name=204:10></a> Clearly because he saw that he could use the price for the furtherance of the testimony.<a name=204:11></a> He was taken up with the testimony, and he brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.<a name=204:12></a> That is to say, he recognised the authority of the Lord in His apostles.<a name=204:13></a> They were there with power to administer, and he brought to them what he had; he had land, he sold it, and devoted the money to the service of the testimony.<a name=204:14></a> It

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will recall how in Israel the Levites were divided into two classes: there were those who carried the holy things upon their shoulders, and there were those who had wagons.<a name=205:2></a> I take Barnabas' gift in a sense to be a wagon; he recognised the necessities connected with the testimony, and he brought what he had got for his lands and laid it at the apostles' feet.<a name=205:3></a> What came to light in connection with his action indicates the Lord's appreciation of what he did.<a name=205:4></a> He was sympathetic with the testimony, and the apostles named him; his name had been Joseph, but they called him Barnabas -- "Son of consolation".<a name=205:5></a> Now that is what I understand to be an evidence of his sympathy with the testimony.<a name=205:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we proceed in the Acts you will find that the testimony moves on, and it is when the movement takes place that Barnabas shines.<a name=205:7></a> He shone in connection with that which was official at Jerusalem, but the testimony moved on; and when we are genuinely moved in regard of Christ we shall follow the course of the testimony.<a name=205:8></a> The testimony moved out to Antioch.<a name=205:9></a> An independent action of the Spirit took place there.<a name=205:10></a> There were no apostolic labours bestowed upon Antioch, as far as we know, prior to the movement there, but chapters 11 and 13 show us that Levitical service, and, indeed, priestly service, had moved out among the Gentiles.<a name=205:11></a> That was a great triumph for Christ.<a name=205:12></a> There were found at Antioch certain men who ministered to the Lord and

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Barnabas, who was a "good man and full of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:24">Acts  11:24</a>), recognised this work; he recognised the movement of the testimony and he was in complete sympathy with it.<a name=206:2></a> What did he do?<a name=206:3></a> He went down to Tarsus to seek out Saul.<a name=206:4></a> He was instinctively in the mind of God, and recognised what God had done, and how the testimony had moved.<a name=206:5></a> He sees that Saul is the man for the occasion; he goes to Tarsus to seek him out, and he takes him, not to Jerusalem, but to Antioch.<a name=206:6></a> Thus the testimony moved on, and correlatively the authority of Christ in the apostles, until we come to chapter 15.<a name=206:7></a> That is to say, the service of God was set up among the Gentiles, and you will find in tracing these chapters that the Spirit of God pursues it until it is enshrined at Ephesus.<a name=206:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I make another remark in regard to Ephesus: the economy of the house of God is in connection with Ephesus.<a name=206:9></a> Timothy was at Ephesus when Paul wrote his first epistle to him, and it is this epistle above all others which should govern us in relation to the house of God.<a name=206:10></a> The house of God, beloved friends, is a heavenly institution.<a name=206:11></a> The assembly at Ephesus was set up in the light of its heavenly position, and hence you have the true basis for the development of the house of God.<a name=206:12></a> The house of God is in the good of what is in heaven; the first mention of it in Scripture shows it was the connection between heaven and earth (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:17">Genesis  28:17</a> - 19).<a name=206:13></a> We need to maintain the

		Matthew contemplates things set up in perfection and a perfect result -- an "hundredfold", but there is decline from a hundred to sixty, and from sixty to thirty; whereas in the gospel of Mark it is presented in the reverse order; that is, there is fruit, thirty, sixty, and an hundredfold (chapter 4: 8, 20).<a name=208:1></a> Mark presents increase of energy.<a name=208:2></a> Mark had at first failed as a servant (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:38">Acts  15:38</a>), but having been restored he was stronger at the end than he was at the beginning.<a name=208:3></a> Now Luke gives the full and perfect result of the testimony of God in the soul of man; it is not a question of our responsibility in that respect, or of the history of the church.<a name=208:4></a> What he is presenting is the ministry of grace; the effect of the Lord's ministry.<a name=208:5></a> In other words, he is presenting the full testimony by Paul; the <i>word of God</i>.<a name=208:6></a> When Paul went out from Antioch, it was to preach "the word of God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:5">Acts  13:5</a>), and Luke shows us that the word of God produces a perfect result.<a name=208:7></a>

		I now pass on to where the Lord's relations are referred to.<a name=209:4></a> It is good to have the light in our souls of our relation with the Lord as the result of His death and resurrection.<a name=209:5></a> One cherishes the thought that we are the "brethren" of Christ, not only of Christ as risen from the dead, but we are the brethren of the One who could say, "I ascend", which in a certain sense is the most wonderful light that can possibly enter into the soul of a man.<a name=209:6></a> He who says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>), also says, "my brethren".<a name=209:7></a> It is a divine Person speaking in the liberty of sonship.<a name=209:8></a> The Son has the full liberty of the house, and He can say, "I ascend"; and at the same time He associates us with Him as His brethren.<a name=209:9></a> I repeat, that no greater light can enter into the soul of man.<a name=209:10></a> But here in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:21">Luke  8:21</a>, we have the other side.<a name=209:11></a> The Lord says, "My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God and do it".<a name=209:12></a> I am not introducing <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>into this passage; I referred to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>as showing the full light of our place.<a name=209:13></a> One can see in the Acts that the Lord in the course of the testimony indicates that the earthly relations were abandoned, and that the new circle took form at Antioch and Ephesus, where divine

		There is a peculiar sweetness about the gospel by Luke.<a name=218:2></a> It is pre-eminently the gospel of grace.<a name=218:3></a> Written by a Gentile who was the companion of Paul -- the apostle of the Gentiles -- I believe it contains a presentation of the gospel as, in a special way, God would have it to be made known to the Gentiles.<a name=218:4></a> This is not fanciful, because the gospel is addressed to a Gentile -- Theophilus -- whose name means, Lover of God, and no doubt the Holy Spirit indicated thus that this gospel has special claims upon the attention of Gentile "lovers of God" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:4">2 Timothy  3:4</a>).<a name=218:5></a>

		This gospel is the unfolding of the dispensation of grace.<a name=218:6></a> In its opening chapters we have the dawn of a new day as it is said, "the dayspring from on high has visited us" (chapter 1: 78).<a name=218:7></a> A day of heavenly light and blessing has dawned upon this dark, lost world and the Gentile "lover of God" is to "know the certainty of those things" (chapter 1: 4).<a name=218:8></a>

		In this gospel every blessing is wholly of God, and therefore purely of grace, and the only link that man has with it is faith.<a name=218:9></a> Hence the gospel opens by a striking contrast between Zacharias and Mary -- unbelief and faith.<a name=218:10></a> Zacharias, a type of the Jew, reasons and doubts, with the result that he is dumb until the period of faith is ended.<a name=218:11></a> He completely failed both as a witness and a worshipper until the time of faith ended; that is, until John was born.<a name=218:12></a> Zacharias at the beginning of the gospel history and

		It is well for us to remember that we are living in a period when every blessing is of pure grace, and can only be apprehended by faith.<a name=219:6></a> Mary sets forth the blessedness of faith; see Chapter 1: 45.<a name=219:7></a> She does not reason; she anticipates no difficulty; her spirit rejoices in God her Saviour; she enters into the character of the new day which was just dawning; she knows that men of low degree are to be exalted, and the hungry are to be filled with good things.<a name=219:8></a> How truly do we speak of her as the blessed virgin!<a name=219:9></a> The new day of grace had lighted up her heart, and there was not a cloud of unbelief to dim the joy of her happy spirit.<a name=219:10></a>

		You will notice, too, that in this gospel we have not visions and dreams as in Matthew's.<a name=219:11></a> The communications come directly from heaven, and they relate to a new order of things in which heaven delights -- an order of things in which everything is of God -- connected with a Person who is not only the Seed of the woman, but the Second Man out of

		In <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#2">2 Peter  2</a>we are told that punishment awaits the fallen angels (verse 4); for the sure punishment of sins is the subject there in hand.<a name=253:9></a> In Jude we learn what their sin was -- they "had not kept their own original state" (verse 6).<a name=253:10></a> But why is their existence kept a secret till so late in the world's history?<a name=253:11></a> Why is it that what happened, we believe, before man was created is not disclosed till after atonement has been made?<a name=253:12></a> The character of their sin is similar to that of apostate Christendom.<a name=253:13></a> They left their first estate.<a name=253:14></a> Men in the latter days will despise dominion.<a name=253:15></a> Both cast off the position of subjection in which God has placed them.<a name=253:16></a> Now this evil having been introduced in the days of Jude, the Spirit by him warns souls of

		I read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>because it suggests the exercise of one who has to do with the Lord on an individual basis.<a name=258:4></a> He says, "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up".<a name=258:5></a> He had a distinct impression, typically, of the greatness of Christ, and that He was in the place that is suited to Him: a Person in authority and in a place of moral elevation.<a name=258:6></a> Now that was a good beginning.<a name=258:7></a> This refers, I believe, to a saint who had some understanding of divine things, though not as Jacob, who had some impression of God in his early days, and his comment was, "How dreadful is this place!<a name=258:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:17">Genesis  28:17</a>).<a name=258:9></a> Now Isaiah was intelligently taking account of this Person, who was God, and it raised questions for Isaiah himself.<a name=258:10></a> He took account of the Lord, and of the functioning system that was around him.<a name=258:11></a> We should remember that the Lord Jesus at the present time in heaven is in glory and there are those who minister to Him; there

		Well, the doors were shut, and "Jesus came and stood in the midst and says to them, Peace be to you".<a name=266:3></a> Then it says, "he shewed to them his hands and his side".<a name=266:4></a> That went further than His saying, "Handle me and see".<a name=266:5></a> He showed them His hands, those hands that served them; and He showed them His side, which suggests the purpose of God, and I believe we get a touch of that at the Supper and what flows out of it.<a name=266:6></a> We find that what God has purposed -- wondrous, eternal blessings -- coalesce with what God is doing with each one of us in our day-today difficulties and exercises.<a name=266:7></a> We get some impression that God's purpose is being worked out through His ways, and that it will be brought to a perfect conclusion.<a name=266:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "everlasting gospel" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:6">Revelation  14:6</a>, Authorised Version), and the "gospel of the kingdom" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:35">Matthew  9:35</a>, Authorised Version), are spoken of, but the gospel of the glory is the present gospel; it includes all the others, for no saint, whether in the past or future, will have anything in the way of spiritual blessing that God does not propose for us now.<a name=268:2></a> Of Christians it is written, "blessed us with <i>every</i> spiritual blessing" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>).<a name=268:3></a> That was a letter written to believers in Christ in the city of Ephesus; and it was said of them that God had blessed them with every spiritual blessing.<a name=268:4></a> Where?<a name=268:5></a> On earth?<a name=268:6></a> No; material blessings belong to the earth; there are those who will be blessed with material blessings in a future day on earth.<a name=268:7></a> Christians are blessed, not with those, but with spiritual blessings <i>in the heavenlies</i>.<a name=268:8></a> Now, that is part of the gospel.<a name=268:9></a> So that, if God has begun to work in you, He has in view that you should have part in what is spiritual; and that you should have part in that, not on the earth, but in heaven.<a name=268:10></a> That is the full height of the glad tidings.<a name=268:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that, as I was saying, recovery is in a spiritual way; and if God reverts to the idea of a garden, it is in a spiritual sense.<a name=268:12></a> Now you can all understand what a garden is.<a name=268:13></a> If there is anything that marks Scripture, it is the simplicity of its similes.<a name=268:14></a> Everybody, from a child up, may form some idea of a garden: it is a distinct part set aside by the farmer, or the landed proprietor, for his special use.<a name=268:15></a> Now God

	<div class="paragraph">
		was pleased to introduce that idea.<a name=269:1></a> God has rights over all men.<a name=269:2></a> We must not limit the rights of God to believers; the Lord Jesus Christ has established His indisputable right to all, even though a man be an infidel.<a name=269:3></a> Do not forget that.<a name=269:4></a> He may not have put His mark on you yet; He would never claim you as His special property as an unbeliever; but He has a right to claim you.<a name=269:5></a> It is one thing to have a right, and it is another thing to assert it.<a name=269:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the believer has a mark put upon him.<a name=269:7></a> It is very important to determine whether you have that mark or seal.<a name=269:8></a> The gift of the Holy Spirit is referred to in three distinct ways by the apostle Paul in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>, 22; he says, God "has anointed us"; that is to say, oil is poured on your head; you are distinguished; an anointed man is a distinguished man.<a name=269:9></a> The believer gets the Holy Spirit from Christ, and the possession of the Spirit distinguishes him from all others who have not the Spirit; he is anointed.<a name=269:10></a> Anointing is not an internal thing; it is an <i>external</i> thing; it is on the head.<a name=269:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the next thing is that God "has sealed us".<a name=269:12></a> He has sealed believers.<a name=269:13></a> He marks them off as His own; it is for us to determine whether it is so.<a name=269:14></a> You remember how Paul raised the question with the Ephesian saints.<a name=269:15></a> There were twelve believers there.<a name=269:16></a> He says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=269:17></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>).<a name=269:18></a> It was for them to answer.<a name=269:19></a> It is a very pertinent question.<a name=269:20></a> You are a believer; or you are a professed believer.<a name=269:21></a> Where is the seal?<a name=269:22></a> God's thought is that you should be sealed
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=270>[Page 270]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as one who is redeemed.<a name=270:1></a> It is a wonderful thought that God would put a distinct stamp upon you, and that stamp is the testimony that you are His.<a name=270:2></a> He has bought you; you are His.<a name=270:3></a> What is the price?<a name=270:4></a> The blood of Jesus.<a name=270:5></a> That is current money, speaking reverently; that is, the currency of the sanctuary.<a name=270:6></a> You are purchased by the blood of God's own Son; you belong, in that sense, to God, and you have the seal; but, as I said, it is for you to answer to that.<a name=270:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next thing in regard to the Spirit is, that He is given as "the earnest .<a name=270:8></a>.<a name=270:9></a>.<a name=270:10></a> in our hearts".<a name=270:11></a> That is not the external mark; that is something for <i>our hearts</i>.<a name=270:12></a> Do you not need something in your heart?<a name=270:13></a> The Spirit in us is the earnest of coming good things; things which "eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>).<a name=270:14></a> Thus you have means spiritually.<a name=270:15></a> There are many people who have nothing to live on; and they turn to the world.<a name=270:16></a> What is the earnest for?<a name=270:17></a> That is something to live on.<a name=270:18></a> Is it not a handsome income?<a name=270:19></a> The Spirit is life, says the apostle writing to the Romans.<a name=270:20></a> 'Oh well', you say, 'I want to see a bit of life'.<a name=270:21></a> You want to taste a little of the world; you want to prove it for yourself.<a name=270:22></a> Ah!<a name=270:23></a> but you will not see <i>life</i>.<a name=270:24></a> You will see death there; "the dead are there" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#9:18">Proverbs  9:18</a>).<a name=270:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, recovery is on this principle; and if God returns to the idea of a garden, He recovers it in a spiritual way.<a name=270:26></a> You may ask, 'What is the garden?<a name=270:27></a>' Your heart is the garden; that is the garden that God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the river in Eden, God intended to have a hold on the garden; He was to influence it; His river flowed into it, and flowed out of it; and, moreover, as the verse I read stated, God came into it Himself.<a name=271:12></a> Now I want you to dwell on that.<a name=271:13></a> The general idea is that God would have a special place for man, and He would influence the place for good.<a name=271:14></a> Think of the continuous stream flowing into it, influencing it with its refreshing power.<a name=271:15></a> Everything in the garden would benefit by that river; and then God Himself came into the garden.<a name=271:16></a> What I want to show you is this, that He found no response to Himself in it.<a name=271:17></a> The trees ministered nothing to God.<a name=271:18></a> Adam was so constituted

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something in you, and in me, and in every one, that is not material; there is something that is in its nature spiritual.<a name=272:4></a> God had breathed into Adam; that was not material; He had breathed into him His own breath.<a name=272:5></a> You remember how Solomon tells us later that the spirit returns to God who gave it.<a name=272:6></a> The question is not raised as to what God may do with it; but the wicked are limited to the lake of punishment.<a name=272:7></a> The spirit returns to God who gave it, and the body to dust.<a name=272:8></a> But God had breathed into Adam, and it was the answer to this that God sought in Adam, but He did not find it; Adam had become corrupted.<a name=272:9></a> Man has become corrupted in his spirit, his soul, and his body.<a name=272:10></a> The spirit, that which was nearest to God, became corrupted.<a name=272:11></a> It is a terrible thing to think of it; and when it became corrupted, and the link cut between God and man, the whole being is lost.<a name=272:12></a> Adam said "I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared".<a name=272:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when you come to Solomon's Song, you find the simile of the garden again.<a name=273:10></a> It refers to the last days, as no doubt many of you here know; and the Song is a celebration of Christ's victory over His earthly people, His triumph over their affections in the future.<a name=273:11></a> In the course of the interchange of expression in the book, we arrive at the garden.<a name=273:12></a> Now I want you to consider this garden.<a name=273:13></a> I believe that most of you here are professed believers.<a name=273:14></a> You have heard the gospel, and most of you have professed to have accepted it.<a name=273:15></a> Now let me ask, What are you in the Lord's eye?<a name=273:16></a> He speaks of His spouse as His sister; a remarkable way to speak of her.<a name=273:17></a> A man's spouse is not usually his sister, but in this connection it must be so.<a name=273:18></a> You get the principle of it in Abraham, in Isaac, and in Jacob.<a name=273:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The speaker in the Song of Solomon says, "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed".<a name=273:20></a> There is no invitation in verse 12, but when you come to verse 16 there is an

		I refer also to Hezekiah in relation to this ministry of comfort.<a name=288:2></a> It is said of him in that day of wondrous recovery, that he "spoke consolingly to all the Levites" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#30:22">2 Chronicles  30:22</a>).<a name=288:3></a> Have we had such on our hearts, those engaged in Levitical service?<a name=288:4></a> Have we been preoccupied in our service, or have we been so obsessed with our own service that we have forgotten them?<a name=288:5></a> I well remember one of the earliest longings that I had in regard of divine service.<a name=288:6></a> It was that one might have part in that very privileged service by constantly praying for those who serve.<a name=288:7></a>

		When the children of Israel held the feast of unleavened bread seven days, it says that Hezekiah spoke consolingly to the Levites and such was the joy and greatness of that feast that they decided to hold another feast for another period of seven days (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#30:23">2 Chronicles  30:23</a>).<a name=289:2></a> Then when Hezekiah, this great comforter of the Levites, recognised what joy there was in Israel, we are told that he gave a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep.<a name=289:3></a> He was not too great, though he was a king, to think of the Levites who served in relation to the heart of God.<a name=289:4></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#32:6">2 Chronicles  32:6</a> that he also spoke consolingly to the captains of war.<a name=289:5></a> He is concerned now, having secured the praise and the service of God, as to the conflict, as to this impious enemy who would come within the gates; and it is said he assembled the captains of war to him at the gate of the city and spoke consolingly to them.<a name=289:6></a> Have we had such in our minds?<a name=289:7></a> Have we wept with them?<a name=289:8></a> Have we sorrowed with those who have been concerned as to the maintenance of what is due to God, those who have had, as it were, the first hand in the conflict?<a name=289:9></a> Have we been near them in spirit?<a name=289:10></a> Have we prayed for them?<a name=289:11></a>

		Following upon that, for I want you to see what a ministry of comfort may bring in among us in the last days, it is said that Isaiah the prophet and Hezekiah the king joined in prayer (verse 20).<a name=290:5></a> What a sight for God to see the prophet and the king praying together and crying to heaven in priestly intercession in relation to the people of God -- the people to whom Isaiah was instructed to say, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<a name=290:6></a> Speak to the heart of Jerusalem" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40:1">Isaiah  40:1</a>).<a name=290:7></a> What is this ministry of comfort that Isaiah the prophet would bring in?<a name=290:8></a> It is the introduction of the true Noah, the One upon whom Israel will lean, the One for whom the earth and the heavens wait during the time of the groaning creation, the advent of the true Noah who shall bring in rest, repose and comfort.<a name=290:9></a> "Every valley shall be raised up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low .<a name=290:10></a>.<a name=290:11></a>.<a name=290:12></a> And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40:4">Isaiah  40:4</a>, 5).<a name=290:13></a> What will mark that day, thank God, will be the feature that will delight the heart of every lover of Jesus that "Jehovah alone shall be exalted" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#2:11">Isaiah  2:11</a>).<a name=290:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, too, the Thessalonians in their early freshness needed the constant attention of a nursing father and a nursing mother, and he would send Timotheus to them (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:2">1 Thessalonians  3:2</a>).<a name=292:7></a> The very presence of Timotheus in a local gathering would ensure comfort for the saints.<a name=292:8></a> They had no room for him at Corinth.<a name=292:9></a> Paul says, "Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:10">1 Corinthians  16:10</a>), indicating that the tendency at Corinth would be to quench what had been divinely entrusted to Timothy.<a name=292:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then this great comforter Paul is equally concerned about the Ephesians.<a name=293:8></a> He has in reserve Tychicus and he would send him in order that he might comfort their hearts, that the Ephesians might be acquainted with all that was happening to Paul, and that their own hearts might be greatly comforted (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:21">Ephesians  6:21</a>, 22).<a name=293:9></a> Likewise as to Colosse, Paul is concerned to know the state of the saints there, and he purposed to send Tychicus in order that he might know their state, and that he might comfort their hearts (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:8">Colossians  4:8</a>, 9).<a name=293:10></a> It is not now the great apostle himself coming; it is not an official movement; it is Paul representatively; he sends this representative -- Tychicus.<a name=293:11></a> He is to pass into that local gathering, and find out their state and also to comfort their hearts.<a name=293:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer now to John, for the thought of comfort links up with John's ministry.<a name=294:9></a> He treats of the divine nature, and shows that we have wealth and power to deal with every difficulty, every problem that can arise in these difficult days.<a name=294:10></a> Jude speaks of certain men having crept in unawares; John says, "They went out from among us, but they were not of us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:19">1 John  2:19</a>); they went out.<a name=294:11></a> The exposing power of John's ministry is such that evil cannot dwell where love is.<a name=294:12></a> The viper that would destroy those affections, that would militate against the warmth and comfort of the saints, can never exist in the

		presence of divine love amongst the saints.<a name=295:1></a> We have in John's ministry the most precious bulwark against all the unholy inroads of anti-christian men today as they move about in this earth, and if John himself is confined to Patmos he moves out in an endeavour to comfort the saints, and says, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>).<a name=295:2></a> If he himself is restricted as to his movements, he refers to one whose movements are unrestricted, for he is like Paul, he leaves behind a keeper of the sheep.<a name=295:3></a> Paul leaves a Timothy to keep the sheep, to protect them on church lines and to comfort them in relation to the assembly and the affections proper to it.<a name=295:4></a> John, too, is concerned about his keeper, and in that connection he refers in the most touching way to Gaius (3 John).<a name=295:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gaius is found as one who has a house, and a house that is a home.<a name=295:6></a> What marks him, having the spirit of John, is that he is greatly concerned, not so much how the brethren come into his house, but the manner in which they go out.<a name=295:7></a> I commend that to you in all simplicity, that we should have deeper concern about the way in which the saints leave our houses.<a name=295:8></a> Are they, as those who have visited the house of Gaius, the better for having been in?<a name=295:9></a> Are they comforted?<a name=295:10></a> Have they received all this spiritual warmth which is contained in John's ministry?<a name=295:11></a> Are they sent forward in a manner worthy of God?<a name=295:12></a> John is greatly concerned about the family life of the saints.<a name=295:13></a> He would comfort the saints in that relation -- that is, as the family of God.<a name=295:14></a> The family of God is

	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the earliest, and certainly one of the sweetest impressions that one had of the saints in the path of separation, as first moving amongst them apart from the systems of men, was to go into a meeting where they were singing, 'Whom have we, Lord, but Thee?<a name=296:3></a><a name=296:2></a>' (<a href=".<a name=296:4></a>.<a name=296:5></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=296:6></a>htm#427:1">Hymn 427</a>).<a name=296:7></a> I confess that it left upon my spirit an indelible impression.<a name=296:8></a> It was no appeal made to the senses, no disorder, but waiting in simple dependence upon the movements of divine Persons.<a name=296:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another impression of which one would speak was that one had found a company where the Holy Spirit was free.<a name=296:10></a> May it be so to the end!<a name=296:11></a> Let us be preserved from the intrusions of man's mind, from the mere assertion of things as light, or the mere passing on of information.<a name=296:12></a> Let us see to it that we are content to wait upon the Lord Himself for guidance, and that in our deliberations together over the Holy Scriptures, and on every occasion when we are found together, we may leave room for the Holy Spirit.<a name=296:13></a> There is that left to us today, the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and one speaks of it with intense joy.<a name=296:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing I refer to Peter.<a name=296:15></a> Peter's great concern is to comfort the saints in relation to their kingdom sufferings.<a name=296:16></a> He leaves to Paul the line of the assembly, the one who was filling up that which was

	<div class="paragraph">
		behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake -- the line of suffering, which, one feels ashamed to say, we touch so little.<a name=297:1></a> Peter's suffering stands in relation to the kingdom.<a name=297:2></a> We are to arm ourselves against every unholy intrusion of the flesh, forasmuch as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh.<a name=297:3></a> John's sufferings, I believe, stand in relation to the spirits of the believers, as being found still in a hostile and anti-christian system of things, but Peter is concerned about the souls of the saints.<a name=297:4></a> He says, "abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:11">1 Peter  2:11</a>).<a name=297:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter is concerned about soul-health.<a name=297:6></a> He would have the saints prospering in their souls, and so he brings in a word of comfort in relation to any who may be suffering, suffering on the line of the kingdom, and his greatest and deepest concern in view of his departure, of his decease, is that the saints might be greatly comforted.<a name=297:7></a> Would he leave the sheep without a keeper?<a name=297:8></a> Would he pass off without leaving the saints a precious legacy?<a name=297:9></a> I believe he leaves the legacy to us in the one whose salutation he speaks of when he says, "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:13">1 Peter  5:13</a>).<a name=297:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One has derived comfort from that thought, that in a place like Babylon you have Peter, shortly to put off his tabernacle, as he says, and you have Mark.<a name=297:11></a> Ah!<a name=297:12></a> we cannot do without the kingdom; we need to be maintained in the exercises relative to it; we need to be maintained in the joy and power of it.<a name=297:13></a> Let us

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would refer briefly for a moment to the legacy that Mark has left behind in the ordering of the Lord in his gospel.<a name=298:3></a> It has sometimes occurred to me that in Mark's gospel we have portrayed more deeply than in any other, the feelings and sensibilities of Jesus.<a name=298:4></a> I believe that Mark was a man of deep feeling and that consequent upon his early failure he would be in direct touch with divine Persons.<a name=298:5></a> When he is restored and strengthened, he is spoken of as being profitable for the ministry, and his gospel is a precious legacy handed on to us, a gospel in which the feelings and sensibilities of Jesus are treated of in a most delicate way by divine inspiration through "Marcus my son".<a name=298:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These were the thoughts that were on my heart, suggesting how the line of comfort may be continued by us in a difficult and a dark day, and that one of our greatest concerns may be to "speak to the heart of Jerusalem".<a name=298:7></a>

		Timothy is first introduced to us by the Spirit of God, as one who was commended by the brethren.<a name=314:4></a> The language of the Holy Spirit is, he "had a good testimony of the brethren in Lystra and Iconium".<a name=314:5></a> They were prepared to put their hands upon him; and it is a great matter that the younger brethren who would aspire to service in the house of God should start rightly as commended by the brethren.<a name=314:6></a> Timothy had another immense advantage, that is, he had a peculiar link with the great vessel of the testimony at that moment.<a name=314:7></a> Paul refers to him as his child, and before Paul's course was ended, he urged Timothy to entrust what he had learned from Paul to faithful men.<a name=314:8></a> What an immense advantage to be brought up under Paul!<a name=314:9></a> Think of the intermingling of affection that existed between Paul and Timothy, and how he had been formed by Paul's doctrine and manner of life.<a name=314:10></a> How the spirit of Paul had taken possession of Timothy so that he proved to be of great spiritual value in his service in the house of God!<a name=314:11></a> Paul, as a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the verses we read in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1">2 Timothy  1</a>, Paul refers to Timothy on the maternal line.<a name=315:2></a> He speaks to him in relation to the unfeigned faith that dwelt in his grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice, and he was persuaded that it was in him also.<a name=315:3></a> That is a great point in relation to service in the house of God -- that there should be purity of spiritual succession, so that one is known as trustworthy -- fit to have things handed down to one; this great feature marked Timothy.<a name=315:4></a> As we think of the continuance of the testimony, of how divine things are to be preserved till the coming of the Lord, we need, not only those well spoken of by the brethren, but those who come under Paul's teaching, and are formed by it: those who are marked off distinctively as having faith; of having it in their moral fibre.<a name=315:5></a> The beloved apostle could speak of the unfeigned faith that dwelt in Timothy's grandmother and his mother, and Paul could say, "I am persuaded that in thee also".<a name=315:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Following that, we would like to refer briefly to the various assemblies in which Timothy carried on his service, as indicated in the scriptures we read in 1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, Philippians; and, finally, as carried on at Ephesus; so that in 2 Timothy he becomes the great model for service in the last days; the pattern workman for everyone who would serve in the house of God at the present moment.<a name=315:7></a>

		Turning to the first epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says in chapter 3, "we .<a name=316:1></a>.<a name=316:2></a>.<a name=316:3></a> sent Timotheus, our brother and fellow-workman under God in the glad tidings of Christ, to confirm you, and encourage you concerning your faith, that no one might be moved by these afflictions.<a name=316:4></a> (For yourselves know that we are set for this)".<a name=316:5></a> These beloved Thessalonians were the youngest assembly in the New Testament; they were but babes in Christ, and at the opening of the epistle, the apostle can refer to them in a unique way, speaking of them as "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 1).<a name=316:6></a> And then we are reminded of how Paul had carried on his service in their midst.<a name=316:7></a> In chapter 2, he refers to himself under the figure of a nurse, speaking of his service in that way, that he had been gentle among them as a nurse cherishing her own children (verse 7).<a name=316:8></a> And so Paul becomes the great model in relation to service in the house of God.<a name=316:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third chapter Paul speaks of Timothy firstly, as "our brother", for that feature takes precedence of all service.<a name=317:2></a> A brother brings in a vital element amongst the people of God, adorning the house of God with the brotherly spirit, bringing in an affection which is eternal amongst the people of God.<a name=317:3></a> So the very base of all our service, as it was with Timothy, is what Paul speaks of when he says, in relation to Timothy, he is "our brother".<a name=317:4></a> Then, secondly, he refers to him as a "fellow-workman under God".<a name=317:5></a> Paul could see, so to speak, the pure gold in the soul of Timothy; he could take account of the work of God in that young man, and so refer to him as "our brother, and fellow-workman under God in the glad tidings of Christ".<a name=317:6></a>

		What a congenial atmosphere it is in which we are called upon to serve!<a name=317:7></a> -- an atmosphere of love and affection, even as amongst these young saints at Thessalonica.<a name=317:8></a> You will notice what Timothy's service was.<a name=317:9></a> The apostle sent him "to confirm you and encourage you concerning your faith".<a name=317:10></a> There is a younger generation growing up amongst us, and there is a great necessity for this kind of establishing ministry, such as Timothy carried out towards the saints in Thessalonica.<a name=317:11></a> As coming into touch with these babes in Christ, how great the character of his service, as seeking to establish them in the faith, and bring in divine comfort to them.<a name=317:12></a> We should ever bear in mind the necessity for the great foundations of our faith to be deeply laid in the souls of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would now turn to the first epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=318:2></a> In chapter 4: 14 Paul says, "Not as chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish you.<a name=318:3></a> For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus <i>I</i> have begotten you through the glad tidings.<a name=318:4></a> I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.<a name=318:5></a> For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus".<a name=318:6></a> What a different sphere Timothy was called to serve in at Corinth!<a name=318:7></a> In this assembly the enemy had brought in the spirit of division.<a name=318:8></a> Alas!<a name=318:9></a> there existed in the assembly at Corinth the spirit of rivalry and emulation; there were those who were saying, "<i>I</i> am of Paul; and <i>I</i> of Apollos", and others "<i>I</i> of Cephas", and then there seemed to be a kind of super-spiritual party who said, "<i>I</i> of Christ" (chapter 1: 12).<a name=318:10></a> It was into this atmosphere that Timothy was sent, and what a searching thing it must have been to serve where there was rivalry and jealousy, and an absence of the spirit of Christ.<a name=318:11></a> It became a great test to Timothy's own spirit.<a name=318:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of this epistle Paul bids the Corinthians to receive Timothy that he might be with them without fear.<a name=318:13></a> To the Corinthians Paul says, "as my beloved children I admonish you".<a name=318:14></a> Think of the great parental heart of the beloved apostle, the intense affections he had for these Corinthians!<a name=318:15></a> He told them he would gladly spend, and be spent for them, though the more abundantly he loved, the less he was loved.<a name=318:16></a>

		Paul appears here as a grieved spiritual father: the very depth of his affections had been touched by their behaviour to him.<a name=319:1></a> Think of the heartless way in which they had treated one who was their spiritual father, to whom they owed everything.<a name=319:2></a> The beloved apostle reminds them that though they had ten thousand instructors -- and there were a great many rival instructors in the assembly at Corinth -- yet they had only one spiritual father, for he says "in Christ Jesus <i>I</i> have begotten you through the glad tidings".<a name=319:3></a> The gospel was the instrument the Spirit of God employed in the hands of Paul, so that these Corinthians were begotten through the gospel.<a name=319:4></a> He did not write these things to shame them, but he says, I write to "admonish you".<a name=319:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second epistle, he tells us of the tears which he shed over these Corinthian saints.<a name=319:6></a> He gives them an insight into the depths of his spiritual affections and intense love for them.<a name=319:7></a> Think of their shameful conduct!<a name=319:8></a> How they dishonoured the name of the Lord Jesus, and misrepresented their spiritual father, so that he has to say to them, "I entreat you therefore, be my imitators".<a name=319:9></a> Then, "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord".<a name=319:10></a> That is a fine commendation!<a name=319:11></a> We have spoken of the commendation of the brethren, and of Paul's commendation of Timothy to the saints at Thessalonica, as a brother and one who is a fellow-workman under God; but here he speaks of him in a two-fold way, as his "beloved and faithful child in the Lord".<a name=319:12></a>

		How important in relation to all ministry, and in the carrying on of the service in the house of God, that these two features should be present in every servant -- that he should be both beloved and faithful in the Lord!<a name=320:1></a> The great idea of faithfulness is, that we will not deviate one hair's breadth from the principles of the house of God.<a name=320:2></a> If Paul came into the assembly at Corinth, he would not for one moment lower the standard, but would maintain the truth at its spiritual height, and so it would be evident that he was faithful in the Lord.<a name=320:3></a> The apostle says to these Corinthians, that Timothy's particular service at Corinth, was not to unfold some fresh doctrine, but to bring to their remembrance Paul's ways which be in Christ.<a name=320:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the great features of the ministry today is the spirit in which it is rendered.<a name=320:5></a> Does the spirit of Christ have such an effect upon us, as to revolutionise our whole moral being by changing our outlook, bringing us into a spiritual environment and giving us to taste the fatness of God's house?<a name=320:6></a>

		What I desire to speak of is that in which we are called to set forth divine behaviour.<a name=321:1></a> I do not intend to enlarge on the behaviour, but rather to show the sphere, or the character of the sphere, in which it is to be carried out; and that sphere, as you will observe in this epistle, is God's house.<a name=321:2></a> Now I desire by the Lord's help to say a word in regard to God's house viewed in that light; as the sphere in which Christian behaviour is to be manifested.<a name=321:3></a> And what I shall have to say centres largely in the house as formed by Paul's ministry.<a name=321:4></a> My apprehension of it is that the house is properly formed by Paul's ministry; I shall come to that directly, but I wish to point out a feature or two of the house as indicated in the Old Testament scriptures.<a name=321:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you will be aware, the first mention of the house of God in Scripture is in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>, and there you have indicated a very important feature of it.<a name=321:6></a> The house of God is connected with the earth, and is introduced primarily in connection with Jacob.<a name=321:7></a> There are two features which appear in the introduction of it, which are carried all through; indeed, in every subject introduced in the Scriptures you will find the salient features at the outset.<a name=321:8></a> There are two features which appear in the introduction of it, which are carried all through; indeed, in every subject introduced in the Scriptures you will find the salient features at the outset.<a name=321:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=322>[Page 322]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what appears in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>in connection with the house is divine interest in man upon earth; that is, Jacob was an object of interest to God.<a name=322:1></a> The heavens were opened upon him as he lay a lonely wanderer upon the earth with a stone for his pillow; he was the object of the interest of heaven; and then, his appreciation of the house consisted in God being in it, and hence it was none other to him than the house of God and the gate of heaven.<a name=322:2></a> That is to say, although it was a terrible place to him, because of his state, nevertheless he recognised that it was God's dwelling, and that it was in close proximity to heaven; indeed, it was the "gate of heaven" (verse 17).<a name=322:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Genesis in that way presents to us the house; although not actually formed as a structure, nevertheless it is presented to us abstractly.<a name=322:4></a> God had, as it were, indicated His mind in regard to Jacob, and you will find that when God introduces light, those to whom the light is given have to go through a course of exercise until they are formed according to it.<a name=322:5></a> Jacob came back to Bethel, but the full course of exercise only ended with David.<a name=322:6></a> At Ephratah (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>) David had received light in regard to the house, and he connects the light that he received with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>; he would build the house; he would give no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he found out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.<a name=322:7></a> The light that David received at Ephratah was connected with the light that came to Jacob as he fled from his brother Esau.<a name=322:8></a> David referred to that.<a name=322:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=323>[Page 323]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to dwell for a moment on two features that come out in connection with David and the house.<a name=323:1></a> The first is, that the foundation of the house was connected with sacrifice, and the fact that at that place Jehovah's sword was sheathed.<a name=323:2></a> You will recall that when David numbered the people (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21">1 Chronicles  21</a>) he brought down the wrath of Jehovah.<a name=323:3></a> But God in grace directed him to rear an altar to Him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<a name=323:4></a> There David offered sacrifices, and there Jehovah accepted him; hence David instinctively recognised that that spot was the only proper location for God's house.<a name=323:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you will look at <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21">1 Chronicles  21</a>and the beginning of chapter 22 you will observe that David decided that that spot was to be the site of the house.<a name=323:6></a> In other words, the foundation of the house is in the place where sacrifice is accepted.<a name=323:7></a> It is laid in the death of Christ; the judgment of God is there exhausted.<a name=323:8></a> I am not saying that judgment may not be connected with the house, judgment begins there (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:17">1 Peter  4:17</a>), but God's house is properly immune from judgment; its foundations are laid upon the spot where the sword of Jehovah was sheathed.<a name=323:9></a> You will notice that, the site being indicated, David prepared with all his might to rear a structure.<a name=323:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another feature that came out in connection with David is that he was not allowed to build the house.<a name=323:11></a> He had the desire to build it, but the house of God is not built by a man of war.<a name=323:12></a> It is built by a <i>son</i>.<a name=323:13></a> I want you to take notice of that; it is built by a <i>son</i>.<a name=323:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that the first child of Bathsheba died under divine judgment.<a name=324:1></a> David would have saved the child; he lay all night upon the earth, in hope that God would have mercy upon him and spare the child, but the child died, and David bowed to the judgment.<a name=324:2></a> He said, "now he is dead".<a name=324:3></a> The child was never to be revived; "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:23">2 Samuel  12:23</a>).<a name=324:4></a> He says, virtually, 'Not only has the child died, but I am going that way also'.<a name=324:5></a> He bowed to divine judgment, and then there is another child; and Jehovah named that child.<a name=324:6></a> Jehovah loved that child, and He sent by the hand of the prophet Nathan and named him Jedidiah, which signifies <i>The beloved of the Lord</i>.<a name=324:7></a> It is the son, the beloved of God, that builds the house.<a name=324:8></a> We speak of Solomon and his glory, and he is a type of Christ.<a name=324:9></a> He is Christ in relation to the millennial world; but we must not overlook that Solomon was a son.<a name=324:10></a> Solomon was the object of affection, and the house is built by the beloved of the Lord, and what a house!<a name=324:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that Solomon spoke of everything in creation from the cedar-tree to the hyssop (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4:33">1 Kings  4:33</a>).<a name=324:12></a> He was acquainted with nature; he was in that way qualified to head the millennial world.<a name=324:13></a> All the beauties of nature and the secrets of nature that men spend their lifetime and their means to bring to light now will be spoken of definitely by Christ.<a name=324:14></a> He will show what they signify in regard to God.<a name=324:15></a> Solomon spoke of all these things, but he was also <i>the son</i>, and it was as such that he
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		built the house.<a name=325:1></a> Now, beloved friends, that is what the house of God is; these features that I have intimated suggest to us what the house is; and I would specially dwell upon the fact that it is built by the Son.<a name=325:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that leads me to the Acts of the Apostles, where you have the development of the course of the testimony; and I take it that in the earlier chapters of Acts we have that which refers to the city and its walls.<a name=325:3></a> It seems to me that it awaited the ministry of Paul to bring in the house according to its true character, and my reason for saying that is this, that Paul preached <i>the Son of God</i>.<a name=325:4></a> That is, he brought in Christ, not exactly officially (although you find that also in his preaching) but he preached the Son of God.<a name=325:5></a> He says, "God .<a name=325:6></a>.<a name=325:7></a>.<a name=325:8></a> was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>, 16).<a name=325:9></a> That is, Paul preached a Person who was in relationship with God as Son, and the effect of his gospel is to bring in <i>sons</i>.<a name=325:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The house is formed in view of relationships which involve affection; a man's house is not an official place; his house is a place of relationship; a man's house is where his affections flow, and in order that you should see God's affections in flow, you must see the Son as man in relationship with Him, and you must see the sons who are brought in as His brethren.<a name=325:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I see is, that the house of God, although upon earth, is composed of what is
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heavenly; not simply of that which has come out of the death of Christ, but also of that which is heavenly.<a name=326:1></a> It is composed, in other words, of those who are the companions of Christ.<a name=326:2></a> As the companions of Christ, we are the companions of a heavenly Man.<a name=326:3></a> You will remember how that the Lord said to Mary Magdalene, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>); thus intimating that all links henceforth should be with Him in connection with heaven, or rather as the heavenly One.<a name=326:4></a> He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=326:5></a> He is the ascending One; He is the One who is in all the liberty of the house.<a name=326:6></a> He has the title to ascend, and He does ascend.<a name=326:7></a> None but the Son could speak thus!<a name=326:8></a> He says, "I ascend".<a name=326:9></a> He is the glorious One, beloved friends, of whom we are the companions.<a name=326:10></a> He is the Son, and hence He is in the liberty of the house; and He goes to the highest point.<a name=326:11></a> In John it is not that He is <i>received</i> up, but He <i>goes</i> up; it involves the liberty of sonship: and we are the companions of that glorious One; and it is as the companions of Christ in heavenly glory that we form the house of God upon earth.<a name=326:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in confirmation of what I have been saying, I refer to the assembly at Ephesus, in which assembly Timothy was when this epistle was written to him.<a name=326:13></a> Ephesus is the end, as it were, of the course of ministry that began in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>.<a name=326:14></a> Paul began with announcing that Jesus was the Son of God; he had received heavenly light into his soul; it was a light

		Now you may ask me how I know that Ephesus had reached that point.<a name=328:10></a> Well, there are various answers to that question, but the most conclusive to my mind is that Paul was loved at Ephesus.<a name=328:11></a> He was not generally loved at Corinth; the Corinthian saints were not characterised by love for Paul; but at Ephesus Paul was loved.<a name=328:12></a> You remember how he sent from Miletus to Ephesus and called for the elders; and he calls their attention to the character of his ways and of his ministry; these were after Christ (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>).<a name=328:13></a> Paul was a vessel entirely formed after Christ.<a name=328:14></a> I do not believe that we shall rightly understand his position unless we see this, for as so formed he was a test for the saints, and hence you will find that he frequently refers to himself as such.<a name=328:15></a>

		You will find it in his letters to the Corinthians habitually, and in his appeal to the elders of Ephesus.<a name=329:1></a> Speaking to the Ephesian elders, he concludes with recalling the word of Christ, with which he was in full accord; that "It is more blessed to give than to receive".<a name=329:2></a> He says, "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive" (verse 35).<a name=329:3></a> There you have the character of Christ, as it were, condensed, and Paul was entirely in accord with it; his ministry and his ways were in complete agreement with that character.<a name=329:4></a> I need only refer you to his letters as a proof of what I am saying -- he was Christianity livingly expressed.<a name=329:5></a>

		Well, now, if you have followed what I have said you will have some idea of the circle in which christian conduct is to shine; and I refer to it for a moment so that we might be exercised as to whether we are equal to it.<a name=329:11></a> Paul's word was, "if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot enlarge upon it, and I did not intend to; my thought was to show, as I said, the character of the house, and if the character of the house is rightly understood you have the divine standard.<a name=330:9></a> The divine standard of everything is Christ -- the Son.<a name=330:10></a> He is the Model.<a name=330:11></a> It is as One in the affections of the Father; One who could lift up His eyes to the Father and speak to Him as Son.<a name=330:12></a> It is the Son in the presence of the Father that is the Model.<a name=330:13></a> See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a> - 30.<a name=330:14></a> He is the Standard, and it is beautiful to see how Paul was in accord with that Standard; he was formed after Christ.<a name=330:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another beautiful touch which I would call your attention to is this; that Timothy was formed after Paul; Timothy was begotten by Paul's testimony.<a name=330:16></a> You will never understand Timothy's position in the Scriptures if you do not see that he was Paul's son in the faith.<a name=330:17></a> The Corinthians were naughty; they were like naughty children in a house; they knew not how

		What we require, beloved friends, is that our ways should suggest Christ: that is the test before men; it is a question of how we are formed by the truth; it is not what we say, as we have often heard, it is what we suggest; it is what we put people in mind of; if we are like Christ, we remind people of Him.<a name=331:6></a> I have referred more than once lately to Gideon's interview with the Midianitish kings after having vanquished them.<a name=331:7></a> He said, "What sort of men were they that ye slew at Tabor?<a name=331:8></a>" Their reply was, "As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the sons of a king"; and Gideon answers, "They were my brethren, the sons of my mother" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#8:18">Judges  8:18</a>, 19).<a name=331:9></a> That is, they had taken character from their mother, as Gideon had.<a name=331:10></a> Now we Christians have all one mother, and that is "Jerusalem above" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:26">Galatians  4:26</a>); it is <i>that</i> which gives character to us.<a name=331:11></a> Jerusalem above is really formed in the light of sonship; it has reference to liberty; "Jerusalem above

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, all that is to be in the house of God.<a name=332:7></a> And then it is "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=332:8></a> That I take to be a kind of check, or safeguard, for in evangelical desire we might go beyond the truth.<a name=332:9></a> Many are evangelical at the expense of the truth.<a name=332:10></a> The nearer we are to God the more divinely evangelical we shall become; but being in the light of the assembly as the pillar and base of the truth becomes a safeguard, for you cannot do violence to the truth if you recognise that the assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=332:11></a>

		Samson had a rather chequered history, but God used him.<a name=334:3></a> His strength was particularly given to him of God; he was "a Nazarite of God".<a name=334:4></a> Failure had come in, for he had given away his secret to a Philistine, to Delilah: "I am a Nazarite of God .<a name=334:5></a>.<a name=334:6></a>.<a name=334:7></a> if I should be shaven, then my strength would go from me" (verse 17).<a name=334:8></a> The Nazarite was to be distinctive in his or her committal to God, and to be separate in view of what was for God's pleasure.<a name=334:9></a> How telling it is to read that "he knew not that Jehovah had departed from him".<a name=334:10></a> That was a very serious thing, and it says, "the Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gazah, and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he had to grind in the prison-house".<a name=334:11></a>

		In the latter part of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, the Spirit of God alludes to the human body and uses it as an illustration to show each believer his place in the body of Christ.<a name=348:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Before doing so, however, I would again emphasise the fact that every believer -- i.<a name=349:5></a>e.<a name=349:6></a>, every person who has received the Spirit of God, <i>is</i> a member of that body.<a name=349:7></a> It is not optional with him.<a name=349:8></a> <i>God</i> has set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased Him (verse 18).<a name=349:9></a> We are losers indeed if we ignore this fact and rob ourselves of many happy privileges; and on the other hand, it is a serious thing for any one to refuse to recognise his position as set in the body, for the place has been given him by <i>God</i>.<a name=349:10></a> It is vain for any to plead individual liberty to the denial or evasion of responsibility as a member of Christ's body.<a name=349:11></a> The words are clear, and I beg my readers' prayerful consideration of them: "God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased him", and "Now <i>ye</i> are Christ's body, and members in particular" (verse 27).<a name=349:12></a> It may be added that whilst this truth is of universal application to all Christians it

	<div class="paragraph">
		particularly refers to those in any given locality.<a name=350:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question then before us is, what are the believer's privileges as being a member of the body of Christ, and what should mark him in his ways practically?<a name=350:2></a> The two sides of the question go together, for every privilege carries with it a corresponding responsibility.<a name=350:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a side of privilege which is not developed in the first epistle to the Corinthians, but we shall not consider that side in this brief article, but restrict our attention to what may be termed practical privileges -- i.<a name=350:4></a>e.<a name=350:5></a>, privileges granted to us to carry out in our ways down here.<a name=350:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First we may notice in verses 21, 22 that we are privileged to recognise <i>every member as necessary</i>.<a name=350:7></a> As the eye of our body cannot say to the hand, "I have not need of thee", so no one of us can say of another believer, I have no need of him.<a name=350:8></a> We cannot be independent of each other.<a name=350:9></a> We are not mere units, but members of a body.<a name=350:10></a> This is very encouraging, because some of us may think that we are not nearly so useful or necessary as So-and-So, yet we must remember that God has set us in the body, and if we isolate ourselves we shall deprive ourselves of benefits we might derive from others, and on the other hand we shall not fulfil the work which God has designed for us as being needful members of the body of Christ.<a name=350:11></a> Each member is needful.<a name=350:12></a> That bed-ridden saint, as well as that much-used evangelist; that sister, whom so few know or notice, as well as that prominent servant or gifted brother.<a name=350:13></a>

		"But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker <i>are necessary</i>".<a name=351:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, God has tempered the body together so that <i>everything is comely</i> (verses 23, 24).<a name=351:2></a> How often we view things otherwise!<a name=351:3></a> We take account of each other according to what we are as natural men born of Adam's sinful race, with weakness and failure, instead of as forming part of Christ's body, each member being comely.<a name=351:4></a> God has thus tempered the body so that there should be no division in it.<a name=351:5></a> We have already noticed that we are linked together by the Holy Spirit.<a name=351:6></a> What is natural and of the flesh must tend to divide us.<a name=351:7></a> It is interesting to recall that the curtains of the tabernacle were coupled together with loops of <i>blue</i> and clasps of <i>gold</i> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#26:4">Exodus  26:4</a> - 6).<a name=351:8></a> That is, to apply the type, what is heavenly and divine unites us.<a name=351:9></a> Let us ever remember this and recognise happily our bond with every member of Christ's body and view each with honour and as comely.<a name=351:10></a> We feel how often what is of the flesh intrudes into little gatherings of Christians, and the natural result ensues -- divisions, cliques, etc.<a name=351:11></a> How can it be otherwise?<a name=351:12></a> Social distinction and position, as well as many other things, if brought in amongst a gathering of Christians must distress and cause trouble, whereas what is heavenly and divine unites all, for our bond is spiritual.<a name=351:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, we may observe that it is our happy privilege <i>to care for one another</i> (verse 25).<a name=351:14></a> All are to suffer if one does; all are to rejoice if one is honoured.<a name=351:15></a> <i>Self</i> can have <i>no</i> place, for its every

		I desire, if the Lord will, to speak of the tabernacle system as marked by stability and unity, because the centre of the tabernacle system is the ark, which speaks of Christ Himself.<a name=353:2></a> The Lord is the Centre of what God is doing, and He ought to be the Centre of the lives of saints -- our "life is hid with the Christ in God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>).<a name=353:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God introduced the tabernacle system as a pattern of what would be established in Christ.<a name=353:4></a> In the centre of the tabernacle system was the ark, which was small, and which had staves so that it could be carried in the wilderness in accordance with the divine indication.<a name=353:5></a> It was made of acacia-wood -- a wood that was durable, and speaks to us of the manhood of Christ.<a name=353:6></a> It measured "two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof".<a name=353:7></a> It is not to say that Christ in manhood is within our compass; the half cubit would remind us of the greatness of His Person.<a name=353:8></a> Now, because He is the Centre of all God's operations, we can be certain that what God has set on will be preserved and will go through for His pleasure.<a name=353:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ark is a wonderful vessel and appears in many references in Scripture.<a name=353:10></a> It is worth following up the different titles that are ascribed to the ark.<a name=353:11></a> In the days of Samuel, when the rights of God were not being widely acknowledged, the ark was referred to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=354>[Page 354]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		often as "the ark of God" or "the ark of Jehovah".<a name=354:1></a> God is able to maintain and sustain what is for Himself even in adverse circumstances.<a name=354:2></a> Even when the ark was taken into captivity and one could say that the glory was departed, yet in the house of Dagon, the god of the Philistines, Dagon fell "on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#5:3">1 Samuel  5:3</a>, 4).<a name=354:3></a> The ark was later brought by David to a place where it was valued, into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:10">2 Samuel  6:10</a>, 11).<a name=354:4></a> There is blessing for every house that values Christ and honours Him.<a name=354:5></a> What is valued in our houses comes into expression when we are together.<a name=354:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>it is "the ark of the testimony".<a name=354:7></a> God had made a covenant with the people of Israel.<a name=354:8></a> The covenant which He had made in the law becomes His testimony -- a testimony to who God is.<a name=354:9></a> You might say, How is the law a testimony to who God is?<a name=354:10></a> Well, it involves an understanding of the heart of God that lies behind it.<a name=354:11></a> We get in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>the setting out of the law, and in chapter 21 the Hebrew bondman, who says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free" (verse 5).<a name=354:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the ark it says, "thou shalt overlay it with pure gold".<a name=354:13></a> We speak of gold in relation to the divine nature, and in the mercy-seat there is a testimony to the nature of God and to His righteousness in the way in which Christ has been set forth.<a name=354:14></a>

		relation to carrying the ark.<a name=355:1></a> The staves were made of acacia-wood overlaid with gold.<a name=355:2></a> Think of the way in which divine Persons carry us!<a name=355:3></a> Scripture says, "unto hoary hairs I will carry you" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#46:4">Isaiah  46:4</a>).<a name=355:4></a> And we know a Saviour who has carried us and who will continue to carry us, who will bring us, as the psalmist says, to our "desired haven" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#107:30">Psalm  107:30</a>).<a name=355:5></a> But it is also for us to be exercised to carry what the Lord may lay upon us, "that the ark may be borne with them".<a name=355:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold".<a name=355:7></a> The mercy-seat rests upon the ark.<a name=355:8></a> There are cherubim there; God's rights are acknowledged.<a name=355:9></a> The setting forth of Christ as a mercy-seat involved that Christ had to die.<a name=355:10></a> God said, "And there will I meet with thee, and will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim .<a name=355:11></a>.<a name=355:12></a>.<a name=355:13></a> everything that I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel".<a name=355:14></a> God's rights are upheld, and He speaks from above the mercy-seat.<a name=355:15></a> What an impression it should give us of the heart of God, that He chooses to speak from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim.<a name=355:16></a> God would look down on that mercy-seat and see the blood that had been sprinkled upon it, and from there He would speak to the people, "everything that I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel".<a name=355:17></a> Everything would come from there.<a name=355:18></a> It would come to us as God speaks in the light of what Christ has done.<a name=355:19></a> So that it is not God speaking in judgment.<a name=355:20></a> How blessedly God speaks to us, how carefully He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 26, we read of "fifty clasps of gold".<a name=356:3></a> The detail of the tabernacle system is interesting.<a name=356:4></a> In relation to God coming out in revelation, so to speak, from the centre, the ark is first, then there is the table of acacia-wood for the shewbread, then there is the beaten work of the lamp-stand and surrounding all that we have the curtains.<a name=356:5></a> Now what is particularly in mind is that there are fifty clasps of gold, and the curtains are coupled together with the clasps "that the tabernacle may be one whole".<a name=356:6></a> We sometimes link the curtains with principles -- I believe that is right -- and they are all needed, and they are held together in order that the tabernacle may be one whole.<a name=356:7></a> That is to say that one principle is not taken to supersede another; every one is needed.<a name=356:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains together with the clasps".<a name=356:9></a> So that the nature of God is seen in the way in which these things are applied and held together.<a name=356:10></a> The detail of the curtains is interesting: "And thou shalt make curtains of goat's hair for a tent over the tabernacle", and there is the "covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red", which would remind us of the death of Christ.<a name=356:11></a> Red was not the natural colour for the rams' skins; they were dyed red -- they went through a process.<a name=356:12></a> "And a covering of badgers' skins over that"; that would be the outward protection.<a name=356:13></a>

		<a name=357>[Page 357]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a number of things to consider about them.<a name=357:1></a> First, they are made of acacia-wood.<a name=357:2></a> In the saints, we should look for manhood according to Christ, formation after Christ.<a name=357:3></a> Then they are "standing up".<a name=357:4></a> God made man upright and God desires that man should be found upright in His presence.<a name=357:5></a> There was one whom the Lord had to meet who was bowed down; but the Lord cured her so that she might stand up (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#13:11">Luke  13:11</a> - 13).<a name=357:6></a> "Ten cubits the length of the board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of one board".<a name=357:7></a> These are boards of substance and of value.<a name=357:8></a> And the saints are persons of substance and of value.<a name=357:9></a> They are standing up and they are great persons; not great in man's scheme of things, but great in God's scheme of things.<a name=357:10></a> Think of the word of Gideon when one said to him, "each one resembled the sons of a king".<a name=357:11></a> He says, "They were my brethren" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#8:18">Judges  8:18</a>, 19).<a name=357:12></a> Well, these are like the boards, made of acacia-wood, standing up.<a name=357:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And thou shalt make forty bases of silver under the twenty boards".<a name=357:14></a> It is interesting to consider the number of things in the tabernacle system that have bases.<a name=357:15></a> They are not there just as a haphazard collection of items put together.<a name=357:16></a> There are pillars for the veil with bases; there are these boards with bases.<a name=357:17></a> They stand up and they are secure.<a name=357:18></a> It would remind us again of the stability of the tabernacle system.<a name=357:19></a> Forty bases of silver remind us that each one of us is standing on the ground that Christ has redeemed us.<a name=357:20></a> "Two bases under one board for its two tenons, and two bases under another board for

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=358>[Page 358]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		its two tenons" -- two bases, not one.<a name=358:1></a> That is to say that God would bear witness to us of the value of the death of Christ and of His rights over us.<a name=358:2></a> The Holy Spirit would give us to be in the good of the forgiveness of our sins through the redemptive work of Christ.<a name=358:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there are bars of acacia-wood -- five bars for the boards of the tabernacle.<a name=358:4></a> I particularly wanted to refer to the middle bar in the midst of the boards "reaching from one end to the other".<a name=358:5></a> Each of us has his or her individual link with the Lord, but also what I do affects my brethren, and what they do affects me.<a name=358:6></a> We might apply that negatively and say that if I misbehave it has an effect on all the brethren.<a name=358:7></a> Well, that is so, and I do not make light of that at all; I have my responsibility in relation to that.<a name=358:8></a> But the other side is that we are all held together, we are all bound up in the bundle of the living (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:29">1 Samuel  25:29</a>).<a name=358:9></a> There is a bar running from one end to the other.<a name=358:10></a> And, "if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:26">1 Corinthians  12:26</a>).<a name=358:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make of gold their rings, the receptacles of the bars, and shalt overlay the bars with gold".<a name=358:12></a> So everything in this system of things speaks of the glory of the divine nature.<a name=358:13></a> The saints are representative of how God has come out in testimony: "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>).<a name=358:14></a> It is all overlaid with gold.<a name=358:15></a> God takes account of the saints as set together and, as it were, overlaid with gold.<a name=358:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And thou shalt set up the tabernacle according to its fashion, as hath been shewn thee on the mountain".<a name=359:1></a> It is a good thing to look at the saints and to see them as God sees them: "the brother for whose sake Christ died" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:11">1 Corinthians  8:11</a>).<a name=359:2></a> When we come to glory, who will we see there?<a name=359:3></a> We will see the Lord.<a name=359:4></a> But we will also see those whom His love has secured, for whom His blood was shed; we will see those who, like these boards, who have stood up in difficult circumstances as well as in good circum-stances, who have stood at the corners when they needed to stand at the corners, who have defended what is for God and delighted to do it even if it involved a path of suffering.<a name=359:5></a> We see God's glory shining in the face of Jesus Christ, but we see it reflected in those whom love has secured, we see it shining there.<a name=359:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved brethren, we have an opportunity to see it shining now.<a name=359:7></a> In whom can we see the glory of Christ?<a name=359:8></a> It shines every day; it shines through pressure, it shines through joy, it shines in the faces of the saints.<a name=359:9></a> It might become covered over by things, it might become dim for a time, but let us look for it, and if it has become covered over let us work to uncover it again.<a name=359:10></a> There was a time when it says in the prophet, "How is the gold become dim!<a name=359:11></a>" (<a href="../bible/Lamentations.htm#4:1">Lamentations  4:1</a>).<a name=359:12></a> Well, if it has become dim let us work to burnish it back to its full glow.<a name=359:13></a> Think of the time when two were going on the way to Emmaus, and, as it were, the gold had become dim.<a name=359:14></a> They were disappointed and sorrowful and sad; but the Lord
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		went with them every step of the way, and brought the gold to light again.<a name=360:1></a> "Was not our heart burning in us?<a name=360:2></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:32">Luke  24:32</a>).<a name=360:3></a> Think of that!<a name=360:4></a> The gold was there on that long journey, when they had trudged all the way back to Emmaus, but it was not a burden to return to Jerusalem for the joy of being amongst the Lord's people again.<a name=360:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we come to the matter of the altar of acacia-wood.<a name=360:6></a> "Five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth" -- man's responsibility has been perfectly met in Christ.<a name=360:7></a> "The altar shall be square": suggestive of the universal value of what Christ has done.<a name=360:8></a> "The height thereof three cubits": speaks of how He has come out in resurrection power and burst the grave.<a name=360:9></a> "And thou shalt make its horns at the four corners thereof; its horns shall be of itself, and thou shalt overlay it with copper".<a name=360:10></a> There was power with Christ to meet every matter that stood between man and His God.<a name=360:11></a> Think of His suffering, anticipatively, in the garden of Gethsemane -- "his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:44">Luke  22:44</a>).<a name=360:12></a> I believe, and I speak simply, that when the Lord rose up to go out of the garden of Gethsemane, the enemy was a defeated foe.<a name=360:13></a> He had brought before the Lord anticipatively all that he could of the suffering that lay ahead of Him, and the Lord was restful in doing the will of the Father.<a name=360:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing, I refer to chapter 28 because for this system to operate the priests had to be there.<a name=360:15></a> As to the matter of unity, "they shall bind the breastplate

		The use of knowledge is to inform a man what he may do and what he may not do, and hence we are to add to knowledge temperance (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:6">2 Peter  1:6</a>).<a name=377:3></a> According as you have knowledge, you know how to steer clear of things which would otherwise hinder and check you.<a name=377:4></a> "Every one that contends for a prize is temperate in all things" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:25">1 Corinthians  9:25</a>).<a name=377:5></a> Divine knowledge teaches us how to be temperate.<a name=377:6></a>

		The desire to be wise was part of the temptation which led to the eating of the forbidden fruit.<a name=377:7></a> The desire to know more exists in the natural mind.<a name=377:8></a> To exalt and to minister to oneself is man's continued effort, and mere knowledge peculiarly contributes to it.<a name=377:9></a> Nothing so exalts a man above his fellows as knowledge, and hence there may be a labour and pursuit to acquire even the knowledge of the Scriptures, without having the conscience exercised by this simple principle, that for every increase of knowledge there is an increase of responsibility.<a name=377:10></a> It is plain, as man has turned everything here to self- aggrandisement, that as I hear the word of God and receive it, so must I break away from the things in their endless variety which this world presents to me.<a name=377:11></a> The world is an organisation by which every-

		Now the culmination of this world is Babylon, where there will be the best of everything, with entire and unequivocal independence of God.<a name=378:4></a> The calling of the saints is, "ye are not of the world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:19">John  15:19</a>), and yet we are in it; and we are taught of God in it, and as we learn and understand the mind of God, the better and the more distinctly do we keep clear of the world.<a name=378:5></a> A saint of full age has his senses exercised to discern good and evil.<a name=378:6></a> We are to regard ourselves in this world as ships at sea.<a name=378:7></a> Unless properly guided the ship will surely be wrecked, and all the learning and knowledge of the mariner is to keep it safe, and to find a clear path, where it is exposed to dangers and adverse elements on all sides.<a name=378:8></a> The master of the ship understands very well that his knowledge is of little use unless he can apply it to the navigating of his ship.<a name=378:9></a>

		That is just the way a saint is to regard all knowledge; he has to apply knowledge to a definite point, and that is, to steer his way safely through elements that he cannot trust, and which are often set dead against him.<a name=378:10></a> The first thing for a saint is to accept in his conscience that he is in a world where everything is against him, and where there is only

		MIXED CONDITIONS

		The truth is that a Christian is of new creation before he has done with the old; he is heavenly before he has done with the earthly; he has eternal life before he has done with his responsible life as a man down here.<a name=380:3></a> Hence while on the one hand we are a new creation in Christ where old things have passed away and all things have become new, on the other hand we have to run a race, to continue in the faith, to see that sin and flesh do not reign in us.<a name=380:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians we see our new creation state, in Romans our responsible life as still here in old creation condition and circumstances, but justified and indwelt by the Spirit.<a name=380:5></a> This makes the mixed condition, and it is of all moment to see these things in their distinctness or we fail to see either the true character of the new creation order -- or to appreciate the grace by which we are supported in our responsible life while here.<a name=380:6></a> It is somewhat like a dissolving view; the new picture has come on to the scene before the old has completely passed away.<a name=380:7></a>
