		Now when we come to the next passage, that [i.<a name=1:2></a>e.<a name=1:3></a> the care of one another] is seen in Abraham, and he is spoken of in Scripture as the "father of us all" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:16">Romans  4:16</a>).<a name=1:4></a> And that means that we are to look to Abraham as an example.<a name=1:5></a> Normally, children in a family look to their father.<a name=1:6></a> They like to do the same things that they see their father do, I mean, that is normal.<a name=1:7></a> And that is the idea, among other things, in connection with Abraham being father of us all: that he sets out the features of those who are truly of faith.<a name=1:8></a> He was the beginning, you might say, of the household of faith.<a name=1:9></a> Not that there were not those marked by faith before him, because there were -- Abel and Enoch and Noah, and so on -- only it was in Abraham the great principle of living by faith was set out, and so he is said to be the father of us all.<a name=1:10></a>

		So now we read in this 14th chapter, that "Abram the Hebrew", was dwelling "by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the <i>brother</i> of Eschol, and the <i>brother</i> of Aner".<a name=1:11></a> That is, Abram was dwelling by the oaks of Mamre in the region at any rate, in the company, it would seem, of these three men who are called brothers.<a name=1:12></a> It says they "were Abram's allies".<a name=1:13></a> Now here are important matters.<a name=1:14></a> First of all, that we should dwell "by the oaks of Mamre", for Mamre is Hebron, and Hebron in Scripture always refers to the purpose of God.<a name=1:15></a> We are told that it was "built seven years before Zoan in Egypt" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13:22">Numbers  13:22</a>), the town

		which was, I understand, a seat of learning in Egypt.<a name=2:1></a> Seven years before that was built, Hebron was built.<a name=2:2></a> So that whatever wisdom there may be attaching to this world, God has in His thoughts for the saints an order of wisdom infinitely superior to it, and that precedes it.<a name=2:3></a> God's thoughts for the saints go back before the foundation of the world, and therefore in Corinthians we are told about that "hidden wisdom" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:7">1 Corinthians  2:7</a>) which God prepared before the world for our glory.<a name=2:4></a> Abram was dwelling in the light of that.<a name=2:5></a> He was dwelling by the oaks of Mamre.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The oaks speak of great stability.<a name=2:7></a> It is a great thing to have the purpose of God in our minds and hearts, for it gives great stability.<a name=2:8></a> Whatever happens in this world, the purpose of God is going through, and if we are the subjects of that purpose, we are going through too.<a name=2:9></a> And if we are the subjects of the purpose of God it means that we are the objects of the love of God; that is another thing.<a name=2:10></a> And so our portion is absolutely immovable, it is absolutely stable and we ourselves are the objects of the love of God.<a name=2:11></a> There is nothing like the sense of that to give stability in the soul.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abram was dwelling there, he was not just visiting the place, but he dwelt there.<a name=2:13></a> And he dwelt there with three brothers, that is to say, there is a suggestion of not only having the purpose of God in our souls, but also that we appreciate the circle of the brethren.<a name=2:14></a> They were his allies.<a name=2:15></a> There was no divergence between them, but they were co-operating with him.<a name=2:16></a> But now news is brought to

		him about another brother, Lot.<a name=3:1></a> It says, "And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew .<a name=3:2></a>.<a name=3:3></a>.<a name=3:4></a> and Abram heard that his brother was taken captive".<a name=3:5></a> That is, a brother who has been caught by the world.<a name=3:6></a> There is no reason to suppose that Lot had any part in the wickedness of Sodom.<a name=3:7></a> Indeed we know from Peter's epistle, in which he is called "the righteous man", that he "tormented his righteous soul day after day" on account of the wickedness of Sodom (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#2:8">2 Peter  2:8</a>).<a name=3:8></a> So that Lot, personally, was a righteous man, but yet he was occupying a place in Sodom.<a name=3:9></a> He chose it too, deliberately, and he acquired a certain position of prominence, apparently that of a magistrate.<a name=3:10></a> He acquired a position in Sodom, and the result was that when king Chedorlaomer and those with him came and defeated the king of Sodom and his allies, Lot was carried away captive.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, Abram does not say, 'It is his own fault.<a name=3:12></a> I am afraid it is just the end of a course; he looked toward Sodom and fancied it, and this is the result': he did not leave it at that.<a name=3:13></a> He set out to recover his brother, if possible.<a name=3:14></a> And what is to be noted is that he had three hundred and eighteen trained servants born in his house.<a name=3:15></a> That is, there is a suggestion of a kind of system with which Abram is connected, entirely outside the world system by which Lot had been captivated.<a name=3:16></a> And that, I think we can say humbly, we know something of.<a name=3:17></a> There is, thank God, a system, the christian circle, the christian fellowship, and all that belongs to it: there

		is that system in which we find our life and move freely, and Abram had three hundred and eighteen trained servants, born in his house.<a name=4:1></a> That is, he had those who belonged to his system; they had not taken on the features of Sodom, but they belonged to this system to which Abram belonged.<a name=4:2></a> They were trained in it.<a name=4:3></a> That is a very important matter, that those who are born, born in Zion, as you might say, those who are given to us as a result of the work of God, should be trained in what belongs to the truth.<a name=4:4></a> They must be instructed in divine principles.<a name=4:5></a> Abram had a large number of servants, three hundred and eighteen trained servants, born in his house, who were available to him for this work of saving his brother.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose there is nothing so calculated to impress Christians who get carried away by the world, but who find out how empty and hollow it is, as to bring before them by some means that there is a system in which life and satisfaction and contentment are to be found.<a name=4:7></a> Abram, at any rate, used what was available under his hand, and went forth and was successful in saving his brother Lot.<a name=4:8></a> Alas!<a name=4:9></a> we know that Lot did not benefit by it.<a name=4:10></a> We know that eventually he goes back to Sodom and has to be dragged out of it in God's mercy by the angels when Sodom was overthrown; but at any rate Abram had proved himself a true brother.<a name=4:11></a> Whatever the result was, or lack of result, Abram had proved himself to be a true brother.<a name=4:12></a> And then as he returns from the slaughter of the kings it says that "Melchisedec
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		king of Salem brought out bread and wine.<a name=5:1></a> And he was priest of the Most High God".<a name=5:2></a> It is as though in all these exercises the Lord would always bring before us the thought of the service of God.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abram might have felt jubilant at the success of his efforts in the way that he had recovered all the persons and all the property: he might have been inclined to be jubilant, but Melchisedec comes out with bread and wine, "And he was priest of the Most High God", and he blesses Abram on the part of the Most High God.<a name=5:4></a> So it is a question of the Lord being before us, that the greatest thing of all is that we know God, and that we have part in the service of God.<a name=5:5></a> And if saints are to be delivered, the point is that they are to have part in the service of God too.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must be delivered from the world to be available to serve God acceptably, and at this point Melchisedec comes out -- type of Christ -- and he brings out bread and wine; I suppose to bring home to Abram that there was sustenance for him which the world could not afford: spiritual food, spiritual stimulation, all in view of his being maintained in liberty and power to serve God.<a name=5:7></a> And he blesses Abram.<a name=5:8></a> He blesses God, too, but he first blesses Abram.<a name=5:9></a> "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth".<a name=5:10></a> It is a far greater thing to be blessed by God, especially God known as the possessor of heavens and earth, as it says in Ephesians, "I bow my knees to the Father .<a name=5:11></a>.<a name=5:12></a>.<a name=5:13></a> of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" (chapter 3: 14, 15).<a name=5:14></a> What a vast extent of glory

	<div class="paragraph">
		and blessing God has before Him.<a name=6:1></a> And we are blessed by Him, blessed in a most exalted way.<a name=6:2></a> And so all that is brought to bear on Abram, typically upon ourselves, in order to deliver us completely, and preserve us completely, from any taint of this world, from any allowance of the principles of the world, in self-exaltation or self-complacency or whatever it might be, and to remind us that our great business and responsibility (whatever else is done, and we are responsible to care for our brethren), is to be engaged with the service of God, and to be engaged in it not formally, but in spiritual power and liberty.<a name=6:3></a> If we are maintained in exercise, we soon discover anything that hinders our spiritual liberty and power, and it helps us if we keep before us the thought that God has taken us up to serve Him.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Melchisedec was priest of the Most High God, and he sets before Abram the thought of the service of the Most High God because he was priest.<a name=6:5></a> But he came out to serve Abram, in order that he might convey to Abram that he was blessed of God.<a name=6:6></a> Of course, if God blesses us His intention is that we should bless God, that we should be secured for His service.<a name=6:7></a> And so Abram gave him, it says, the tenth part of all.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I pass on to John's epistle, and that really gives us in teaching what we have been referring to in type in the passages in Genesis.<a name=6:9></a> It says, "In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil.<a name=6:10></a> Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, and he who does not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		love his brother".<a name=7:1></a> These are the two things which God is looking for pre-eminently in His children as here in testimony.<a name=7:2></a> Firstly, we should <i>practise</i> righteousness, that is, what is right in the sight of God is to govern us in <i>all</i> that we do.<a name=7:3></a> Follow righteousness, Paul says to Timothy.<a name=7:4></a> That is the first principle.<a name=7:5></a> I know he brings that in particularly in relation to religious associations, but at the same time it is the principle that is to govern us in all things, in the smallest thing as well as the biggest thing.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness is simply what is right in the sight of God.<a name=7:7></a> Not what is right in the sight of men but what is right in the sight of God is to be followed, and it is to be followed because we are here as children of God, and if we fail in righteousness practically we deny the character of God.<a name=7:8></a> That is a very solemn matter.<a name=7:9></a> We are here as born of God to be a testimony in the world to what God is in His attributes and in His nature.<a name=7:10></a> God is righteous, He is essentially righteous, and therefore what is right in the sight of God is to characterise His children.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, love is also to characterise us because God is love, and that is where the brother comes in.<a name=7:12></a> If I am living in an isolated spot away from brethren, I have very little opportunity to express love, and very little opportunity to develop in love.<a name=7:13></a> The circle of the brethren is given to us as the circle in which love is to be expressed and developed.<a name=7:14></a> The reason for that is that love is of God, and God has in mind that there should be a circle maintained here on earth, in the very presence of all that is of the wicked one, in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which what is of Himself is expressed.<a name=8:1></a> We may rest assured that Satan will attack.<a name=8:2></a> He always will, wherever there is what is of God, Satan is not far off.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know no more solemn instance of that than we have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>where we have the Lord with His disciples at supper time, and the devil had put into the heart of Judas Iscariote, one of the disciples of Jesus, to betray Him.<a name=8:4></a> When Jesus gave to Judas the sop while he was still at table, it says, "then entered Satan into him" (verse 27).<a name=8:5></a> Think of that!<a name=8:6></a> How near Satan is, that there were Jesus and His disciples, a circle of love, and Satan was nearby.<a name=8:7></a> There was what was of God there and Satan was nearby trying to get in, and there was one of the company who afforded him a loop-hole and Satan got in.<a name=8:8></a> We are always to bear in mind, dear brethren, that as long as we are here, and are going on with what is of God, Satan is not far off.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must be watchful, therefore, not to allow any loop-holes.<a name=8:10></a> If I begin to allow the principle of covetousness, if I begin to allow the principle of pride, if I begin to allow any false principle, then I am affording a loop-hole for Satan.<a name=8:11></a> And that is one reason, dear brethren, why the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is such a very great matter.<a name=8:12></a> It is such a preservative, such a privilege, that we should have God's Holy Spirit dwelling in us.<a name=8:13></a> He has holy sensibilities, I need not say, and if we do not quench Him, if we do not grieve Him, He will promote similar sensibilities with us.<a name=8:14></a> And if we are quick to His touch, and sensitive as He gives us the consciousness
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that we have grieved Him, then there is immediate recovery open to us, so that we do not become a tool for the enemy.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says, "this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another".<a name=9:2></a> Then it goes on to say, "Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you.<a name=9:3></a> <i>We</i> know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren".<a name=9:4></a> It is a good thing, dear brethren, to cultivate this.<a name=9:5></a> And love, I would say, expresses itself in activity, and in sacrifice.<a name=9:6></a> Love does not demand.<a name=9:7></a> Love on <i>my</i> part does not demand that the saints should love <i>me</i>; love in <i>my</i> heart expresses itself in serving the saints and seeking their good.<a name=9:8></a> Love never demands, love never makes itself an object.<a name=9:9></a> If we want to see a description of love in the abstract we should read the 13th chapter of the 1st epistle to the Corinthians, "Love .<a name=9:10></a>.<a name=9:11></a>.<a name=9:12></a> does not seek what is its own" (verses 4, 5), it says, "Love .<a name=9:13></a>.<a name=9:14></a>.<a name=9:15></a> bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things" (verse 7), and so on.<a name=9:16></a> And in that same chapter we are told that one might have prophecy and knowledge and faith, and yet if I have not love, "I am nothing" (verse 2).<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our power in service is not our measure.<a name=9:18></a> Our real measure is love, and how much we <i>do</i> love.<a name=9:19></a> But here it says, "Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you.<a name=9:20></a> <i>We</i> know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.<a name=9:21></a> He who does not love his brother abides in death".<a name=9:22></a> And now it says, "Hereby we have known love".<a name=9:23></a> It is a question, not now of brotherly love, although love is to find

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		expression in the circle of the brethren, and development there, but now it is love in its absoluteness, what God is in His nature.<a name=10:1></a> We are taught in Peter's epistle that in brotherly love we are to have love.<a name=10:2></a> So it says, "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us".<a name=10:3></a> That is always to be before our minds and hearts, that love has come into expression.<a name=10:4></a> God is love, and what God is has come into perfect expression in Jesus.<a name=10:5></a> He has laid down His life for us, and we "ought", it says, it is now a question of moral obligation -- "<i>we</i> ought for the brethren to lay down <i>our</i> lives".<a name=10:6></a> That shows that the circle of the brethren is constituted for the express purpose of the expression and development of love, because God is love.<a name=10:7></a> And one of the ways in which love expresses itself is that we accept the responsibility to care for our brethren, and especially to care for their souls.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember what it says in the epistle to the Ephesians, "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, and <i>walk</i> in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>, 2).<a name=10:9></a> Love is of God and we are to be imitators of God, but if we are to learn love in its expression; we learn it in Christ, as it is said, "the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour".<a name=10:10></a> I believe the expression of love was so perfect in Christ when He gave Himself for us, that it went up to God as a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=10:11></a> Love

		I draw attention first to what Paul could say about the Macedonian saints; he speaks of their "deep poverty" and "free-hearted liberality", and then he says, "And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will".<a name=11:12></a> This scripture raises a challenge with me, and I trust with every one of us, as to whether we have given ourselves "<i>first</i> to the Lord".<a name=11:13></a> That is a very necessary thing.<a name=11:14></a> You may say, 'I have given my heart to the Lord'.<a name=11:15></a> Thank God for that; but I believe it is important to consider if you have given yourself in full committal to the Lord Jesus.<a name=11:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The psalms are a collection of poems written, by inspiration of God, under circumstances which gave occasion for the expression of feelings which prophetically were <i>Christ's</i> feelings.<a name=27:11></a> The psalms do not in every case bring Christ personally before us, but in some psalms He is so presented, and it is these psalms which we shall by God's help consider.<a name=27:12></a> They are called '<i>Messianic psalms</i>' -- that is, they refer particularly to Messiah or Christ.<a name=27:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In other psalms the <i>Spirit</i> of Christ is seen in His people, and hence there are expressions of piety which could not be Christ's personally.<a name=27:14></a> In such souls the Spirit of Christ was <i>pre-produced</i>.<a name=27:15></a> But, seeing that the persons to whom I refer were in themselves

	<div class="paragraph">
		sinners, piety would express itself differently to that which would characterise Christ's utterances.<a name=28:1></a> For example, the first pious movement in the soul of a person who is a sinner is to own itself to be such, and expressions such as "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned", and "I acknowledge my transgressions" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51:4">Psalm  51:4</a>, 3), would be right and fitting; but <i>Christ</i> could not say this, although the <i>Spirit</i> of Christ would lead <i>us</i> to do so.<a name=28:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we leave these psalms, and will meditate on those where Christ is Himself personally before us, though it is important to remember what has been said in reading the psalms, for even in these 'Messianic' ones some verses cannot be directly applied to Christ personally.<a name=28:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>does not refer exclusively to Christ, for in itself it describes the blessed and godly, and contrasts them with the <i>ungodly</i>.<a name=28:6></a> But who, we may say, held that place as Jesus did?<a name=28:7></a> In others through grace He may have been <i>pre-produced</i>, as He now is by His Spirit <i>reproduced</i>; but Jesus was pre-eminently <i>the</i> Godly Man.<a name=28:8></a> All that a man should be morally, Jesus was in perfection!<a name=28:9></a>

		It is unquestionable that we have different lines of teaching presented to us in the New Testament, in the scriptures which bear more directly on Christians.<a name=33:2></a> While every scripture is given by inspiration of God, there are certain scriptures which relate in almost an exclusive way to Christians.<a name=33:3></a> And I see increasingly that the spirit and principle which pervades all such writings is unity; that is, all the teaching tends in that direction.<a name=33:4></a> It is a point that it is not at all difficult to demonstrate.<a name=33:5></a> Expressions which are common with us out of the writings of Paul sufficiently prove it.<a name=33:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The end of Paul's teaching is "one body".<a name=33:7></a> I have been struck with this in the epistle to the Romans.<a name=33:8></a> In the first eight chapters of that epistle, though the body is not named, the apostle gives you a sufficient doctrinal basis for the one body, so that in chapter 12 we find the statement, "we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other" (verse 5).<a name=33:9></a> If you do not understand the truth of the one body, you are not intelligently in the will of God here.<a name=33:10></a> I might make other quotations from Paul; but everybody knows that the fact of the one body is almost the heart of the apostle's teaching, a body composed of Jew and Gentile, formed by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven, of which Christ is set in the place of Head.<a name=33:11></a> God gave Him "to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body,

		the fulness [or completeness] of him who fills all in all" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, 23).<a name=34:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I find the same principle pervading the writings of John, namely, that what we are being led on to is the thought of unity.<a name=34:2></a> No one can read <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>without seeing that the end to which the Lord was leading is expressed in this "And I have other sheep" -- speaking of the Gentiles -- "which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd" (verse 16).<a name=34:3></a> I can understand someone saying, But you are confounding the flock with the one body.<a name=34:4></a> I reply, No, they are parallel truths; it is a different idea, but there is no difference substantially between the one body and the one flock.<a name=34:5></a> There is another point connected with it, namely, that it is impossible for any one of us to enter intelligently into the idea of unity according to the mind of God if we have not first learnt what is true of us individually.<a name=34:6></a> That is as certain as anything can be.<a name=34:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unity is a very important point; but I am not speaking about outward ecclesiastical unity.<a name=34:8></a> By unity I mean the unity as of one body, and the one body is the body of Christ.<a name=34:9></a> We learn that there is one body; and it is the knowledge of that which separates Christians from all the great religious bodies about us.<a name=34:10></a> It is not difficult to show to those who are really Christians the inconsistency of the great sects and systems with the truth of Scripture, because it is so manifest.<a name=34:11></a> There is one body existing here upon earth; but when that is seen there is another truth to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be as well to stop for a moment to prove this, for I do not care to put out anything which cannot be substantiated from Scripture.<a name=35:3></a> It is evident that the body is for the display of Christ for Scripture says: "the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" -- fulness is that which is adequate for the complete display.<a name=35:4></a> As we see in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13">Romans  13</a>, "Love is the fulness of the law".<a name=35:5></a> The text reads, "Love is the fulfilling of the law" (verse 10, Authorised Version), but the real meaning is "the fulness of the law"; that is, love is that which is alone needful for the complete display of the law.<a name=35:6></a> When Paul was going to Damascus on the errand of persecution, there appeared to him a light above the brightness of the sun, and he heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?<a name=35:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>).<a name=35:8></a> He was persecuting Christ in His body; it was Himself, that in which He was displayed.<a name=35:9></a> I only refer to that in connection with the thought of unity.<a name=35:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will, by way of preface, just briefly go over the main points of John's gospel.<a name=35:11></a> Down to the end of chapter 6 we get what is individual, namely, the great truth of life brought out in its principles and characteristics, and with it the deliverance of the soul from what is contrary to God.<a name=35:12></a> Then chapter 7 introduces a new thought: the change of dispensation, the time of the Spirit; and in connection with this we have the new company, the one flock.<a name=35:13></a> That,

		and the various glories of Christ, is the great subject of the section from chapter 7 to chapter 12, which is one continuous section.<a name=36:1></a> Then, from chapter 13 to chapter 17 you get the disciples viewed as the vessel which was to be here in witness for Christ, and the features and character of the vessel.<a name=36:2></a> By the vessel I mean the company which was to be here for Christ, and which was to be expanded into one flock, of which Christ was the Shepherd.<a name=36:3></a> It was to be here for Him, not for itself, just as the body is for the display of the Head.<a name=36:4></a> That is what comes out from chapter 13 to chapter 17.<a name=36:5></a>

		the succeeding chapters man is viewed as completely tested by the light of Christ's word and work, both of which he rejects and is thus found wanting; and, consequent upon that, an entirely new and heavenly company is formed, composed of Jew and Gentile, "one flock", of which Christ is the Shepherd.<a name=37:1></a> So that you have a new dispensation which is marked by the presence of the Spirit here, and a new company, of which Christ is the Shepherd.<a name=37:2></a> And then the section closes up, in chapters 11 and 12, with witness to the varied glories of Christ, as Son of God, Son of David, and Son of man; and He, having been lifted up from the earth, is the point to which all are drawn.<a name=37:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have called this new dispensation the dispensation of light, and I touch on it for a moment, because of the importance of the thought that light tests.<a name=37:4></a> Light in divine things is positive, for light is the revelation of God, and the revelation of God necessarily tests everything.<a name=37:5></a> Thus it is the word of Christ which tests the Jew in chapter 8, and His work which tests him in chapter 9, and the Jew rejects both.<a name=37:6></a> At the close of chapter 8 they took up stones to stone Jesus, and in chapter 9 they excommunicated the subject of His work; they will neither have the word of God nor the work of God.<a name=37:7></a> But then, consequent upon that, the Lord reveals that He is leading His sheep out of the fold; and in bringing in the Gentile there is the formation of one flock, and there is one Shepherd.<a name=37:8></a> But that could not be until the Jew had been completely tested by the

		presentation to him of the light.<a name=38:1></a> Then the Lord brings out His sheep; there is one flock, but not to take the place of Israel.<a name=38:2></a> When I go into that, we shall see that the characteristic of the flock now is this, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father" (chapter 10: 14, 15).<a name=38:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I remarked, it is before the mind of the Lord in chapter 7 that He is about to go away.<a name=38:4></a> There are four utterances of the Lord in the chapter, but I only touch on the last of them.<a name=38:5></a> "Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to him that has sent me.<a name=38:6></a> Ye shall seek me and shall not find me, and where I am ye cannot come" (verses 33, 34); that is, the Lord reveals the truth that He was on the point of going away.<a name=38:7></a> Then (verses 37 - 39), "In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.<a name=38:8></a> He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=38:9></a> But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=38:10></a>

		I must refer for a moment to the occasion on which this truth in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>comes out, namely, the feast of tabernacles; for you cannot well understand it apart from seeing the occasion.<a name=39:7></a> You will see that the chapter begins a fresh subject.<a name=39:8></a> "After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.<a name=39:9></a> Now the tabernacles, the feast of the Jews, was near.<a name=39:10></a> His brethren therefore said to him, Remove hence and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest; for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known in public.<a name=39:11></a> If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world: for neither did his brethren believe on him" (verses 1 - 5).<a name=39:12></a> You must take account of the fact that the brethren of the Lord, the Jews, were lost in

	<div class="paragraph">
		unbelief.<a name=40:1></a> No doubt the passage refers to His natural kindred; but I think it has a wider significance, and refers to the Jew after the flesh.<a name=40:2></a> What we find is that the Lord will not publicly identify Himself with the feast of tabernacles; but He goes up secretly to teach in the temple, He takes every occasion to carry on the service of His testimony here, though He cannot identify Himself in any public way with the Jewish feast.<a name=40:3></a> "My time is not yet come", He says (verse 6); that is, His time was not yet come to bring in the feast of tabernacles in its true power.<a name=40:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then at the close of the chapter you come to what is remarkable: the Lord, having met all the different thoughts of the Jews in the early part of the chapter, at the close propounds something on the great day of the feast, which, I take it, means the eighth day, "In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me, and drink.<a name=40:5></a> He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (verses 37, 38).<a name=40:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to refer for a moment to the feast of tabernacles.<a name=40:7></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>that it took place on the fifteenth day of the seventh month.<a name=40:8></a> As far as I can understand the teaching of the feasts, everything for Israel was to begin afresh in connection with the seventh month.<a name=40:9></a> The previous principal feasts were the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of weeks; and on the first day of the seventh month everything began afresh.<a name=40:10></a> On the first day is the blowing of trumpets, on the tenth is the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		day of atonement, and on the fifteenth day is the feast of tabernacles.<a name=41:1></a> The teaching of it is, I suppose, that in connection with the seventh month, the history of Israel is taken up afresh.<a name=41:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John the Lord ignores everything connected with Israel and the feast of tabernacles, and nothing comes out of His mouth about it till the great day of the feast.<a name=41:3></a> Then He stands and cries, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink"; and we have the interpretation of the Spirit of God, "this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=41:4></a> The first seven days of the feast indicate the completeness of earthly blessing and joy in Israel; but the eighth day brings in eternal things, that which is in resurrection, in conjunction with the earthly things; it is in that sense the communion of the heavenly and the earthly.<a name=41:5></a> Now you can understand how it is that the Lord begins to speak here about the heavenly things, because the feast of tabernacles was not for the time to have place, and what was to come in were the eternal and heavenly things in connection with Jesus being glorified and the Holy Spirit given.<a name=41:6></a> To me it simplifies the matter very greatly when we see what was the significance of the great day of the feast.<a name=41:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now say a word or two about Jesus glorified and the Holy Spirit given, because the presence of the Holy Spirit was to introduce another day.<a name=41:8></a> You can see the great contrast between Jesus being in humiliation here, and His being glorified.<a name=41:9></a> It

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the apostle says in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, "we see not yet all things subjected to <i>him</i>, but we see Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour" (verses 8, 9).<a name=42:5></a> A little period is left to men during which they can carry on their actings down here, but faith knows that God has put all things under the feet of Christ; the word to Him is, "Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:13">Hebrews  1:13</a>).<a name=42:6></a> He is saluted there as High Priest, He is the Minister of the holy places, and the Holy Spirit has come down as witness of His glory; it is the time of the Holy Spirit, and He could not be here until Jesus was glorified.<a name=42:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am loath to leave the point because I think the light of the glory of Christ is the light in which our

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the time of the Holy Spirit now; and perhaps the greatest mercy which God has shown to us in these last days is in giving us the recognition of the presence of the Holy Spirit here.<a name=43:9></a> I remember thirty or forty years ago, we were accustomed to look for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit; Christendom, even Protestantism, had lost all sense of the true character of the dispensation, the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit here.<a name=43:10></a> The very point of the moment is that the Spirit is here as witness of the glory of the Bridegroom.<a name=43:11></a> The position of the virgins is that they

		One of the things Jesus does in this opening section of <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>is to set persons free from the fold.<a name=46:7></a> We can say, reverently, that the Lord Jesus, from one point of view, was willing to come to the fold, and to enter into it, but it says, "He came to his own, and his own received him not" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:11">John  1:11</a>).<a name=46:8></a> The fold would speak of what is organised, what might be very zealous and appeal to the human senses.<a name=46:9></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21">Acts  21</a>, "Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law" (verse 20) -- that is like the fold.<a name=46:10></a> Many persons are held in it, and yet in the chapter before <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, you have a man who is set free from the fold through being cast out -- but Jesus found him.<a name=46:11></a> The Shepherd leads the way out, and we are to go forth to Christ without the camp, bearing his reproach (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:13">Hebrews  13:13</a>).<a name=46:12></a> He has come in order that He might lead the sheep out, and He knows every one by name.<a name=46:13></a> There is not a person in this room whose name the Lord Jesus does not

		Well, He wants to lead you out too, and so He says, "I am the door".<a name=47:3></a> Persons that know Him as the Door are not afraid of the wolf coming.<a name=47:4></a> The Lord says, "the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep".<a name=47:5></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#18:10">Proverbs  18:10</a>, "The name of Jehovah is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe".<a name=47:6></a> That Name is a place of safety: as we confess the name of Jesus, as we own that we love Him and we belong to Him, when His name brought in, we prove it is a strong tower.<a name=47:7></a>

		As you look at <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11">2 Corinthians  11</a>you will see a list of Paul's sufferings.<a name=51:12></a> He says, "in labours exceedingly abundant, in stripes to excess, in prisons exceedingly abundant, in deaths oft.<a name=51:13></a> From the Jews five times have I received forty stripes, save one.<a name=51:14></a> Thrice have I been scourged, once I have been stoned, three times I have suffered shipwreck, a night and day I passed in the deep: in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from the nations, in perils in the city, in perils in the desert, in perils on the sea, in perils among false brethren; in labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.<a name=51:15></a> Besides those things that are without, the crowd of cares pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies" (verses 23 - 28).<a name=51:16></a> I make no apology for reading that list; Paul was a man who knew what suffering was.<a name=51:17></a> He speaks earlier of "if indeed we suffer with him" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a>), that is, with Jesus.<a name=51:18></a> Paul knew what

	<div class="paragraph">
		In that list in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11">2 Corinthians  11</a>, having gone over all the physical sufferings that he endured, he says, "Besides those things that are without" -- there is a lot of internal pressure and suffering too that very often is secret and that persons are caused to pass through that none else can appreciate or share.<a name=52:10></a> The burdens that are carried secretly, and the sufferings that some persons pass through, are very real.<a name=52:11></a> But Paul says, and it is a great comfort, "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us".<a name=52:12></a> Footnote <i>a</i> to the verse before says, 'If we co-suffer that we may be co-glorified'.<a name=52:13></a> How precious to be so near to the Lord Himself.<a name=52:14></a> How valuable it makes the suffering of this present time.<a name=52:15></a> May we go through in faith and with a conscious sense that, as we bear these things in relation to the Lord Himself, there will be no loss.<a name=52:16></a>

		THE ARK AND THE HIGH PRIEST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J. Taylor
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:10">Exodus  25:10</a> - 16; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:1">Exodus  28:1</a> - 5; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a> - 8; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:1">Hebrews  3:1</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to show the connection between the ark and the high priest.<a name=53:7></a> I wish to dwell upon each separately, and in pointing out the contrast between them, to show also the connection that exists between them.<a name=53:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ark, as most of us here know, has reference to Christ, and the high priest in Israel represented Christ.<a name=53:9></a> It is in that way that they become of such interest; indeed, it is thus that the Old Testament becomes of such interest to those who love Christ.<a name=53:10></a> I doubt whether any one reads the Scriptures with heart interest until he loves Christ; you may dwell upon the type, but your heart is engaged with the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=54>[Page 54]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		antitype, and I desire, beloved friends, that that may mark our meeting now; that whilst I seek to engage you for the moment with the types, your hearts, by the Spirit, may be engaged with the antitype; that is, with Christ.<a name=54:1></a> No type can exceed in interest the ark of the testimony, and in one point it is very like that of the high priest, for it represents Christ with something in His heart; the law of God; whereas that which the priest had in his heart was the saints.<a name=54:2></a> I wish you to bear this in mind for we have to take account of the Lord here in this world in connection with the will of God, and then we have to take account of Him in connection with the saints.<a name=54:3></a> The high priest had the saints in his heart; I refer to the breastplate, as you will understand.<a name=54:4></a> That was one great feature of the high priest, that he represented Christ as having the saints in His affections.<a name=54:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I would point out as to the ark is that the predominant feature of it is not exactly that it was heavenly; whereas the predominant feature of the priest was; the type suggests to us that the priest is heavenly.<a name=54:6></a> You will all remember that <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>is taken up almost entirely with the description of the dress of the high priest; the colours referred to, by the Spirit, in the description of the dress convey to us the characteristics of Christ, as Man, in relation to, and as having to say to, God, as approaching God, and the predominant colour is blue.<a name=54:7></a> There are other colours mentioned which have reference to the earthly side of Christ's official glory, but the predominant colour in the dress of the high priest is
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		blue.<a name=55:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when you come to the ark, you are struck immediately with the fact that there is nothing said about colour at all.<a name=55:2></a> The point in the ark is, that it was made of acacia-wood and it was overlaid with gold, and it was to contain the tables of the covenant.<a name=55:3></a> Now that is what I want to dwell upon.<a name=55:4></a> By the Lord's help, I desire to show you, that the Lord has to be taken account of here in this world as appearing amongst men, and as the One capable of taking up the revealed will of God and carrying it into effect.<a name=55:5></a> I desire that our hearts might ponder that.<a name=55:6></a> The great thing in view was that the divine glory might be sustained here, but evidently the acacia-wood has to be taken account of.<a name=55:7></a> Primarily the great thing that God had in view was to have a Man here through whom He might carry out all His will.<a name=55:8></a> Adam had failed in that, but God would wait, and He did wait.<a name=55:9></a> He waited for that which the acacia-wood represented.<a name=55:10></a> One loves to think of God waiting for that.<a name=55:11></a> I desire to enlist your sympathy in that respect as to God; He had His mind set upon man, but God could wait.<a name=55:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One great attribute in God, one might say, is that He can wait.<a name=55:13></a> God will wait; He will wait for the suitable material for the effectuation of His purposes.<a name=55:14></a> He waited after the fall of Adam; He waited for the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=55:15></a> I think of God taking Moses up to the mount; the law in principle was given to the camp below.<a name=55:16></a> He takes Moses up to the mount Sinai, and the first thing He speaks to

		Moses about is that which was in His heart; the first thing He speaks about to His servant is the ark of the testimony.<a name=56:1></a> It was that, that He had in His heart.<a name=56:2></a> He looked on to a Man here upon the earth, moving under His eye; every motive of that Man was Godward; every aspiration had God as its object; every movement of His heart had reference to God; it was a delight to God to unfold to Moses the ark.<a name=56:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God says, "make an ark of acacia-wood" and He gives the dimensions.<a name=56:4></a> It was a delight to God to dwell upon those dimensions, to dwell upon that wood, as representing that Man whose every movement of heart had God as its object.<a name=56:5></a> God speaks to us later through the prophets and He says, "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:18">Matthew  12:18</a>).<a name=56:6></a> How do you take account of that?<a name=56:7></a> I take account of it as referring to Christ, and to what He was here for 30 years.<a name=56:8></a> That of which God had spoken to Moses, that material, those dimensions given in His instructions to Moses, all that, beloved friends, had taken form in a Man here on earth.<a name=56:9></a> Let us think of that.<a name=56:10></a> The wood of the ark speaks of the humanity of the Lord Jesus, and now God says, "I will put my Spirit upon him"; He can put the gold upon that vessel.<a name=56:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If ever I hear of a brother undertaking to serve Christ, to serve God, I want to know his past history.<a name=56:12></a> God always takes up a man in reference to his past history.<a name=56:13></a> Every servant of God is set apart from his birth, and all the divine dealings have reference to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the gold.<a name=57:1></a> What God has in His mind is the gold.<a name=57:2></a> He intends to set the gold before men, but before you have the gold you must have the wood.<a name=57:3></a> If you have not the wood the gold would be discredited.<a name=57:4></a> Paul says God set him apart even from his mother's womb, and called him by His grace.<a name=57:5></a> Every servant is taken account of by God from his birth, and before God, as it were, puts the gold upon the vessel -- there must be the wood.<a name=57:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we look at Christ, it is important that we dwell upon what He was personally.<a name=57:7></a> I believe it is of the Spirit that the deity of the Lord should be put into evidence in every bit of ministry.<a name=57:8></a> The cherubim of glory over the mercy seat suggests to our hearts that there must be a guarding of that Person.<a name=57:9></a> He is what He was and what He ever will be as to His Person, but let us think of the wood; think of that Man here in this world where all was opposed, where there was such absence of sympathy, even from those akin to Him in the flesh.<a name=57:10></a> Mary says, "thy father and I have sought thee distressed" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:48">Luke  2:48</a>); they had no idea who was there, but the Lord says, "did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?<a name=57:11></a>" As Man here, He was personally equal to that which He was to sustain in testimony; He was to be covered with the gold.<a name=57:12></a> God was to set there the full weight of the divine glory, and that was to be displayed in that Man.<a name=57:13></a> What food there is for our souls in Christ viewed in that light here in this world, moving about in a scene that was contrary to Him, every

		movement of His heart had reference to God.<a name=58:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the idea I have of the ark of the covenant.<a name=58:2></a> It is Christ in this world where everything is contrary, sustaining the full weight of the divine glory.<a name=58:3></a> I have often thought that we too little consider what it was for Christ to take up God's law; what power was required for it.<a name=58:4></a> We do well to consider the conditions into which Christ came, every part of the world and its whole power turned against Him.<a name=58:5></a> Now I say, consider the power that was necessary to stand against that, yet, not one iota of the divine will was surrendered for a moment; it was in His heart, "Lo, I come .<a name=58:6></a>.<a name=58:7></a>.<a name=58:8></a> to do, O God, thy will" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:7">Hebrews  10:7</a>).<a name=58:9></a> "To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:8">Psalm  40:8</a>).<a name=58:10></a> I say, what power was required.<a name=58:11></a> I have no doubt the wood, as typifying Christ's humanity, was divinely selected.<a name=58:12></a> It was most durable, and hence we have in it the suggestion of the power that was in Christ <i>inherently</i> in carrying out the will of God here upon the earth.<a name=58:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, God says in the prophet, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=58:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a>).<a name=58:15></a> I understand that to be the ark of the covenant; "my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=58:16></a>" Now notice, He says, "I will put my Spirit upon him".<a name=58:17></a> That is what I understand to be the gold.<a name=58:18></a> "I will put my Spirit upon him".<a name=58:19></a> You can all recall the remarkable incident of the Lord's reception of the Spirit in the gospel of Luke.<a name=58:20></a> He appears in baptism, and He comes up out of the water, and He is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what was the result of that, beloved friends?<a name=59:6></a> I appeal to you who know the Scriptures.<a name=59:7></a> It is of all moment to know the Scriptures.<a name=59:8></a> If you read this prophet Isaiah you will find the great controversy is between God and idolatry, and now that He has a Servant, now that He has a Vessel, He puts His Spirit upon Him, and the conflict is on.<a name=59:9></a> I want you to understand that the conflict continues.<a name=59:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great forces in the world, one is lawlessness, and the other is idolatry; they are linked together, and in the ministry of Christ God has taken issue with the lawlessness of man, and the idolatry of man!<a name=59:11></a> I want you to consider that.<a name=59:12></a> God found His Servant in whom His soul delighted, and He put His Spirit upon Him.<a name=59:13></a> "He shall not faint nor be in haste"; that is the ark of the covenant.<a name=59:14></a> "He shall not faint nor be in haste, till he have set justice in the earth", that is Christ.<a name=59:15></a> God took public issue, in the ministry of Christ, with the lawlessness and the idolatry of man, and if you read the gospels in the light of these two thoughts, I think you will get great help from them.<a name=59:16></a> Then there is a third great issue which is

	<div class="paragraph">
		obvious; and that is, the issue between life and death.<a name=60:1></a> That issue had been raised in the garden of Eden, the question of life.<a name=60:2></a> Is the question of life to be solved?<a name=60:3></a> I want you to bear in mind that God has found His Vessel, and has put His Spirit upon Him, and that now the conflict is on.<a name=60:4></a> Think of Christ in that position; think of the tremendous power; the almighty power that was required to carry out the divine mind.<a name=60:5></a> Christ was anointed of the Spirit, and He is led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil; that was in order that it might be brought into greater evidence who and what that Man was.<a name=60:6></a> He returned from the wilderness the victorious One.<a name=60:7></a> Think of the power of Christ here in subjection to God.<a name=60:8></a> He bound the strong man in the wilderness, and returned in that power, in that same Spirit into Galilee, and hence the glory is shown resplendently in that wonderful ministry before men; but the conflict was on.<a name=60:9></a>

		The question of God's rights in the heart of man had to be solved.<a name=60:10></a> He was the only God, the only Object who deserved the adoration of man.<a name=60:11></a> The Lord undertook to make that evident.<a name=60:12></a> God had rights over man, He was the only true God.<a name=60:13></a> With what delight the Lord Jesus brought that into evidence before men.<a name=60:14></a> Now, in this chapter God says, "my glory will I not give to another" (verse 8).<a name=60:15></a> You will have noticed the verse, "and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images".<a name=60:16></a> You remember when Moses came down into the camp, the glory had been changed into the similitude of an ox that

		And so, as I was saying a moment ago, in order that these things should not be theoretical with us, the epistle contemplates that we should keep our eyes open, so it says, "whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him?<a name=61:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:17">1 John  3:17</a>).<a name=61:8></a> And then chapter 5 says, "If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death" (verse 16).<a name=61:9></a> That is in material things, and in spiritual things we are to have our eyes open to see how the brethren are getting on, and if any one sees his brother, or of course, his sister, sinning a sin, not unto death, the first thing he should do is to ask for him -- to ask God.<a name=61:10></a> He should get to God about him, and plead on his behalf that he may be allowed to continue, that he may be restored in his soul and continue in life.<a name=61:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, dear brethren, if we get to God about someone else who has sinned, we shall very likely find that God will raise exercises with ourselves, and all that will be for our help, and as we face those exercises with God, we may acquire a little power and influence and be able to save our brother.<a name=61:12></a> Indeed

		in Galatians, as has been much brought before our notice in recent years, it says, "if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted" (chapter 6: 1).<a name=62:1></a> The Lord places on the spiritual the responsibility of restoring one taken in a fault.<a name=62:2></a> Here John says you are to ask for him, and use your influence with God that such an one might be recovered.<a name=62:3></a> But Galatians would go further, and say you are to restore such an one.<a name=62:4></a> As has been said by another, if we pray for people we gain power with them.<a name=62:5></a> If we get to God about them in secret we may acquire a certain amount of moral power with them, so as to be able, like Abram, to recover our brother.<a name=62:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think from what I have said, dear brethren, that the importance of the brother, that is, the brotherly element, seen in sisters as well as in actual brothers, will be manifest.<a name=62:7></a> And you will remember too that Paul constantly brings in a brother.<a name=62:8></a> In writing to the Corinthians in his first epistle he says, "Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother" (chapter 1: 1).<a name=62:9></a> As an apostle he is authoritative, he brings in the mind of the Lord, and it is the Lord's commandment and it must be obeyed, but then he brings in the brother with him.<a name=62:10></a> The brother would not assert authority, but he would move about as caring for the souls of the brethren.<a name=62:11></a> So Paul always looks for the support of the ministry by the influence and power of the brother.<a name=62:12></a> And so in writing his second epistle to Corinthians he says

	<div class="paragraph">
		again, "Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and the brother Timotheus" (chapter 1: 1).<a name=63:1></a> He brings in another brother.<a name=63:2></a> And then in writing to the Corinthians too, in the first epistle he says, "Aquila and Priscilla .<a name=63:3></a>.<a name=63:4></a>.<a name=63:5></a> salute you much in the Lord" (chapter 16: 19); why does he say that?<a name=63:6></a> Because Aquila and Priscilla had been local brethren at Corinth at one time, and the Corinthians would know them well, and know indeed the kind of line that they were on, and when they heard that Aquila and Priscilla, who were with Paul when he wrote his first epistle, saluted them much in the Lord, they would say to themselves, what is the force of that word "much"?<a name=63:7></a> And they would perhaps realise that Aquila and Priscilla were very much concerned about them, and the assembly in their house also.<a name=63:8></a> And as they began to think on those lines, they would begin to understand why they were concerned about them.<a name=63:9></a> It would just be a means of bringing home to them that not only was their condition serious in the sight of the Lord and of His servant the apostle, but this brother and sister, and the assembly in their house, were feeling it too.<a name=63:10></a> They were a known brother and sister, who had been local at Corinth, and now they would bring their influence to bear upon the Corinthians, and say, We are thinking much about you, as though to emphasise tenderly without saying it, We hope you will soon get right!<a name=63:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		I wish to speak about wisdom's children.<a name=65:2></a> Wisdom is from God Himself: "But if any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely .<a name=65:3></a>.<a name=65:4></a>.<a name=65:5></a> and it shall be given to him" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:5">James  1:5</a>).<a name=65:6></a> Wisdom is the way love has taken; it is light to lead us out of the labyrinth of difficulty and problems.<a name=65:7></a> A maze, or labyrinth, is difficult to find your way out of.<a name=65:8></a> But there is light from God which wisdom understands, and there is a way out, and I believe that way is by affection for Christ, the One "who has been made to us wisdom from God" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>).<a name=65:9></a>

		In the passage read in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:35">Luke  7:35</a> the Lord says, "wisdom has been justified of all her children", and then you have an illustration of one of wisdom's children in the woman with the alabaster box of myrrh.<a name=65:10></a> Her name is not given; it is in her character and what she did that wisdom was seen.<a name=65:11></a> What is emphasised is what she did to Christ.<a name=65:12></a> She manifested her need of Him, her love for Him and her appreciation of Him.<a name=65:13></a> One of the features that mark wisdom's children is that they have an appreciation of the wonderful grace of having been drawn to Christ.<a name=65:14></a> The fact that we have been drawn to Him, and He has become precious to us, is all of the Father: "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:44">John  6:44</a>).<a name=65:15></a> Think of the wisdom of divine operations through Christ and

		So I read of this woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, so well-known to us, but of great import to us, for we need to be kept fresh in our affections for the Lord Jesus.<a name=66:5></a> The Lord says to Simon -- representing the formal religious side, you might say -- "Seest thou this woman?<a name=66:6></a>" Just think of the Lord saying that: He wants <i>us</i> to see her today and to take account of what she did.<a name=66:7></a> She is one of wisdom's children, a needy sinner indeed, and she knew it, but she loved much.<a name=66:8></a> That is the way of wisdom -- in repentance toward God.<a name=66:9></a> But then this woman realises that all her needs can be met only by the Saviour.<a name=66:10></a> There was what was outward, formally with Simon, the Pharisee, but there was what was substantial inwardly with this woman and she showed it -- the manifestation of love.<a name=66:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Wisdom has often been said to be the handmaid of love.<a name=67:8></a> Where we are inwardly in our affections shows itself in our actions.<a name=67:9></a> So the Spirit of God delights to put on record the detail of what this woman did.<a name=67:10></a> It was not only that she was one of wisdom's children, but the Spirit delights to enlarge upon it: "thou gavest me not water on my feet" -- nothing to refresh Christ; "but <i>she</i> has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair" -- all her glory she put at the feet of Jesus, for those feet were going to that cross of shame to settle every matter in regard to herself.<a name=67:11></a> She was in a maze of difficulty, a sinner indeed, but how was she to get out of that labyrinth of difficulty and sinnership that she was in?<a name=67:12></a> Only by Jesus whose blessed feet, in wonderful love, went the way of the cross for her, and she loved Him on that account, she loved Him in deed.<a name=67:13></a>

		Now the passage read in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30">Proverbs  30</a>speaks of "four things" that are "little upon the earth, and they are exceeding wise".<a name=68:10></a> There is something special about these four creatures that are mentioned here.<a name=68:11></a> Solomon wanted wisdom: "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111:10">Psalm  111:10</a>) -- and it pleased God exceedingly.<a name=68:12></a> He said to God, "Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy great people?<a name=68:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#1:10">2 Chronicles  1:10</a>).<a name=68:14></a> Solomon must have had some sense of how great the people were to God, and of the need of wisdom as to how he should move in and out amongst them.<a name=68:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can take account of features that marked these creatures in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30">Proverbs  30</a>.<a name=68:16></a> God created them, and He had a purpose in it.<a name=68:17></a> It says, "The ants, a people not strong", but they are "exceeding wise".<a name=68:18></a>

		The Egyptians had to do that under Joseph; they stored up wheat in those storehouses in Egypt in view of the famine conditions (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:36">Genesis  41:36</a>).<a name=69:7></a> Wisdom was seen therefore in Joseph, and wisdom is acting for us at the present time, for Christ "has been made to us wisdom" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>).<a name=69:8></a> It is wonderful what is available to us, as, you might say, the sun is shining in Christ in glory.<a name=69:9></a>

		Then you have the locusts, who "have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands".<a name=70:6></a> Israel wanted "a king to judge us, like all the nations" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#8:5">1 Samuel  8:5</a>).<a name=70:7></a> God was not pleased with that; it says, "I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#13:11">Hosea  13:11</a>).<a name=70:8></a> God was their King; He was the One to whom they were to look for protection and care and direction, and He felt it when Israel looked for a king.<a name=70:9></a> The Corinthians wanted a king in the local company, but Paul writes to them about wisdom (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:19">1 Corinthians  1:19</a> - 31).<a name=70:10></a> He shows how the wisdom of men was such folly in putting the Lord of glory to death at the place of a skull, the termination of human wisdom.<a name=70:11></a> How did Paul meet the condition there at Corinth?<a name=70:12></a> He brought in the truth of the cross, and the resources that we have in the blessed Spirit who would continually magnify Christ to us.<a name=70:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		wisdom they required, and, as a consequence, they got away from Christ.<a name=71:1></a> Paul felt that, and you marvel at his wisdom and his patience with them, the love that was in his heart for them, and the wise way in which he dealt with them.<a name=71:2></a> He spoke to them and pointed out the seriousness of what they were doing, but he brought in with it what was positive as to Christ in seeking to rectify the situation there in Corinth.<a name=71:3></a> What a wise man he was!<a name=71:4></a> He was one of wisdom's children indeed.<a name=71:5></a> The secret of it was that he loved them, and the less they loved him, the more he loved them, because of what they were to the Lord.<a name=71:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The locusts have no visible leader; they "have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands".<a name=71:7></a> They suggest believers who are not looking for a man to lead them, a visible head here on earth, who have a glorious living Head in heaven and their hearts are attached to Him in the love of wisdom, you might say.<a name=71:8></a> Such are looking to Him for resource; and all that they need.<a name=71:9></a> The headship of Christ involves resource; infinite resources of wisdom are available to meet every situation as we hold fast the Head and draw upon Him.<a name=71:10></a> The Spirit of God would speak to us, I believe, at the present time, of the resources we have in the Lord Jesus.<a name=71:11></a> So there is no need for human agency or human help, or telephoning somebody for advice, and so on.<a name=71:12></a> Why not get to Christ first of all and have to do with Him personally, look to Him for wisdom in every situation that may arise?<a name=71:13></a> Of course, we can always

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the lizards would suggest believers who, though moving among mankind daily, are enjoying secretly their place of highest honour as taken into favour in the Beloved according to God's purpose (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:6">Ephesians  1:6</a>); so their walk should differ from that of men of the world.<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the passage I read in Matthew, in the Authorised Version the virgins are said to be "wise" or "foolish", but in the Darby translation it is "prudent" or "foolish", and they represent profession and reality.<a name=72:4></a> We may make a profession even of the enjoyment of the most precious light and truth that God has given, but what about the reality?<a name=72:5></a> Here, again, is an illustration of wisdom's children: the wise "took oil in the vessels with their torches".<a name=72:6></a> If they do not have the oil, they are not sustained, and they cannot reach the divine end.<a name=72:7></a> This, of course, is an illustration of what has happened in the course of the history of Christianity.<a name=72:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says, "Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be made like to ten virgins".<a name=72:9></a> "Ten" would suggest there was responsibility resting upon each one; it is a number that represents that.<a name=72:10></a> They take their torches and go forth to meet the bridegroom, but "five of them were prudent and five foolish.<a name=72:11></a> They that were foolish took their torches and did not

		take oil with them".<a name=73:1></a> They all had light; they had, typically, received the apostles' doctrine, but the foolish did not have the oil, and things began to die out.<a name=73:2></a> Paul knew it would happen.<a name=73:3></a> He says, "For <i>I</i> know this, that there will come in amongst you after my departure grievous wolves, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:29">Acts  20:29</a>, 30).<a name=73:4></a> He knew what would happen, and, as the Lord says, "the bridegroom tarrying, they all grew heavy and slept".<a name=73:5></a> No doubt, during the dark ages of the church's history there were individuals giving place to the Spirit who maintained the testimony in a hidden way, but it says here "they all grew heavy and slept", a rather sad picture.<a name=73:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God is going to accomplish His thoughts.<a name=73:7></a> There may be failure in the testimony, but God is going to reach His end: "But in the middle of the night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom" -- it is just the Person.<a name=73:8></a> This is the way wisdom has taken.<a name=73:9></a> Who is going to recognise the Bridegroom?<a name=73:10></a> Those with fervent affection for Christ.<a name=73:11></a> So, some 170 years ago that call went forth again, "Behold, the bridegroom", and what an awakening of affection for Christ there was, and it happened all over the world at about the same time.<a name=73:12></a> There were little companies of believers arising with real affection for Christ, having love for the Scriptures, wanting to practise the truth, loving one another, and that over against the public profession that had, alas, gone to

	<div class="paragraph">
		This was God's sovereign work, the work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=74:2></a> No particular person did it, but then there arose many who were able to provide food for the saints, for those who had woken up out of their sleep, and they were provided with the richest food spiritually.<a name=74:3></a> Think of the wonderful light as to the knowledge of God as Father, as to Christ as Head in heaven and His body here on earth united to Him by the Holy Spirit; what wonderful light was shed on the Scriptures.<a name=74:4></a> Maybe it was known before -- I am sure it was, by individuals, because the Spirit has always been here since Pentecost -- but there was a very great awakening at that time.<a name=74:5></a> Persons left what was largely outward profession because of real affection for Christ.<a name=74:6></a> Wisdom's children are marked by movement; it is what they do.<a name=74:7></a> So they go forth to meet the Bridegroom; it is to a Person.<a name=74:8></a>

		I think we would all feel that the Lord Jesus is seeking for a present answer to His love.<a name=77:1></a> The general conditions in Christendom are dealt with both in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>and <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3.<a name=77:2></a> These chapters are very interesting from that aspect, being ground covered by the Lord Himself.<a name=77:3></a> We know that in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>, when the Lord speaks finally to the assembly at Laodicea, He speaks of His very deep feelings as to the lukewarm conditions which were noxious to Him.<a name=77:4></a> It is for us to think about what the Lord feels as to the present conditions generally in Christendom around us, where there is a profession of His Name and yet organised systems which, in effect, keep the Holy Spirit out and consequently make no room for Christ, self-satisfied and complacent, even in their miseries, and what they count as riches the Lord shows to be worth nothing, but He presents Himself as the One who has true riches.<a name=77:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, it is in the presence of these conditions, dear brethren, that we find ourselves today, and I think the Lord would desire us all to think more for Him and to seek to provide what will give an answer to His heart at the present time, and also He would convey to us that He is concerned about quality.<a name=77:6></a> The Lord is not only thinking of quantity, but even more so of quality; what He would find in those who love Him and who devote

	<div class="paragraph">
		themselves to Him in these times.<a name=78:1></a> So let us think about quality, for we can always improve in quality.<a name=78:2></a> There is so much mixture; we all know that.<a name=78:3></a> It may take a lifetime to bring about something that is very attractive and pleasing to the heart of Christ, something of refinement and quality, love and devotion which are delightful to Christ.<a name=78:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think, therefore, that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>helps us about these things.<a name=78:5></a> Certainly, when we talk about the pleasure Christ has in the pearl, we are talking about quality.<a name=78:6></a> Not everybody knows about that; you have to go into "the house" to know about that.<a name=78:7></a> The Lord spoke certain things at the seaside and dismissed the crowds and went into "the house", and it says, "his disciples came to him" (verse 36).<a name=78:8></a> So here you have a devoted line seen in the disciples who follow the Lord where He goes.<a name=78:9></a> Is every one in this room doing that?<a name=78:10></a> Are you following the Lord?<a name=78:11></a> Some people constantly keep at "the sea".<a name=78:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Evangelicals are generally at "the sea".<a name=78:13></a> Well, that is all right if the Lord is there.<a name=78:14></a> When the Lord goes into the house, you would be far better to follow Him.<a name=78:15></a> Not that the gospel ceases.<a name=78:16></a> Not at all, but is there not more concern for man at the present time than there is for the rights and honour of our Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=78:17></a> Alas!<a name=78:18></a> many of the Lord's people are taken up with what is for themselves, rather than thinking about what is for Christ.<a name=78:19></a> The Lord will look after us.<a name=78:20></a> I do not think any of us who follow Him lack anything.<a name=78:21></a> The Lord said to His disciples at the end of His life here, "did ye lack anything?<a name=78:22></a> And they

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those to whom the Lord was entrusting the setting up of things in His absence, in the power of the Holy Spirit, were lovers of His -- not intellectuals or theologians -- as <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>shows.<a name=79:8></a> So He said to Peter, "Art thou attached to me?<a name=79:9></a>" (verse 17).<a name=79:10></a> That was a test.<a name=79:11></a> You cannot excuse yourself from that, nor can I.<a name=79:12></a> That is the test for every believer: "Art thou attached to me?<a name=79:13></a>" Three times the Lord tested Peter.<a name=79:14></a> Peter came through that exercise well; I suppose he felt he was in a crucible.<a name=79:15></a> He did not like it at one point.<a name=79:16></a> The Lord was trying him.<a name=79:17></a> Yes, He was, but Peter came through the trial all right, the better for having been through it, and that, of course, is the point with every one of us, dear brethren, that when the Lord puts us through trials we are to come out of them better than when we went into them.<a name=79:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we were speaking about <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, where the Lord leads His disciples into the house and then He speaks freely to them.<a name=79:19></a> He opens up matters to them, answering questions they raise, and then He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we are, dear brethren; you and I, through God's grace, are in this treasure and we are in this pearl.<a name=80:7></a> Do you know you are part of the pearl?<a name=80:8></a> What did the Lord want a treasure for?<a name=80:9></a> You see, He did not want it immediately for display, for He went and hid it.<a name=80:10></a> That is the remarkable thing about it.<a name=80:11></a> He found it here, and sold all that He has and bought the field.<a name=80:12></a> The Lord has rights universally.<a name=80:13></a> He is acquiring treasure now, but He is hiding it.<a name=80:14></a> It is not the time for the display of it; it is being hidden.<a name=80:15></a> So that is a good point to begin with, and I would like all the young people to take interest in this, because there are great secrets to be known by those who belong to the Lord Jesus and who love Him at the present time, secrets that worldly persons do not know.<a name=80:16></a> The university people do not know about it, or the renowned people of this world, the politicians and the men who frame the policies that would guide the world, like in the United Nations.<a name=80:17></a> Why?<a name=80:18></a> Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the pearl; it is one thought, "one pearl".<a name=81:7></a> That is the point of it here.<a name=81:8></a> "Having found one pearl of great value".<a name=81:9></a> Have you ever thought of the Lord Jesus like a merchant?<a name=81:10></a> "A merchant seeking beautiful pearls; and having found one pearl of great value .<a name=81:11></a>.<a name=81:12></a>.<a name=81:13></a>" Do we often think of that, as to what the Lord really meant in it?<a name=81:14></a> Because I think there was more in what He was saying than only what was in the mind of God to be reached at some future time.<a name=81:15></a> The Lord found elements of the pearl in certain persons when He was here.<a name=81:16></a> It was there in Peter, John, Mary of Magdala.<a name=81:17></a> Do you not think so?<a name=81:18></a> Mary of Bethany?<a name=81:19></a> Yes, and we will not leave out Martha either.<a name=81:20></a> There were elements of the pearl there, and He found it.<a name=81:21></a> He says, 'This is what I am going to have.<a name=81:22></a> I am going to have myriads like this and I am going to have them as one pearl of great value'.<a name=81:23></a> Hence the assembly, the mystery, as opened up in Paul's ministry.<a name=81:24></a> The Lord is securing under that beautiful figure of the pearl what would delight His heart, what would answer fully to Him and give Him joy and pleasure eternally.<a name=81:25></a>

		suffering.<a name=82:1></a> It is a question of what is being formed now at the present time, a very beautiful thing, of great quality to shine in the light.<a name=82:2></a> The Lord would help His saints to come up to the quality of the pearl, the one pearl of great value, so that they may be for Christ, knowing that He went and sold whatever He had and bought the pearl.<a name=82:3></a> He bought the field because of the treasure, but He bought the pearl because of itself.<a name=82:4></a> Beautiful, is it not?<a name=82:5></a> The Lord was seeking beautiful pearls; He has an eye for beauty.<a name=82:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to learn what is beautiful in the eye of Christ.<a name=82:7></a> I would not ask a religious dignitary for a definition of that.<a name=82:8></a> I do not think these men know.<a name=82:9></a> I am not speaking against them personally, but the fact of the high office of certain people who assume certain positions in Christendom conveys nothing as to these things at all.<a name=82:10></a> It is a question of what divine Persons are forming and securing for Their own pleasure, what cost the blessed Lord Jesus so much to secure: "he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it".<a name=82:11></a> Do you think the Lord has lost the pearl?<a name=82:12></a> Who is going to answer that?<a name=82:13></a> The Lord has not lost the pearl; He has bought it, and He will have it eternally.<a name=82:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a great time coming, dear brethren.<a name=82:15></a> Are we not looking forward to it?<a name=82:16></a> We have great things before us, when the display comes, but the secret of it is known to those who are near to the Lord in the house, that is, who are separate from all that is going on in the world, Christendom in general, to be with Christ.<a name=82:17></a> Then you will get to understand the secret of

	<div class="paragraph">
		what is in His heart.<a name=83:1></a> Here we have the quality that is in His mind and heart, "one pearl of great value".<a name=83:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not get pearls mentioned often in Scripture.<a name=83:3></a> In the New Testament we have the Lord saying, "nor cast your pearls before the swine" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#7:6">Matthew  7:6</a>) which of course is a very meaningful thing.<a name=83:4></a> That is, what you value you should look after, and do not part with it in situations where it may be trampled underfoot.<a name=83:5></a> Always value the truth, especially the truth of the assembly.<a name=83:6></a> I appeal to all here to value the truth of the assembly.<a name=83:7></a> This is the one pearl for which our blessed Lord sold all whatever He had and bought it.<a name=83:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have also in Revelation the reference to the pearl at the gates of the city: "each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl" (chapter 21: 21).<a name=83:9></a> I think that gives a hint as to what is in the mind of Christ as to the pearl.<a name=83:10></a> A pearl is a very beautiful thing, but it is going to bring its influence and beauty into all that Christ will carry through in administration in the world to come.<a name=83:11></a> Matthew is the book of the Administrator.<a name=83:12></a> If administrators would read the book of Matthew and study it, they would do better at their jobs, but Matthew was not written for the administrators of this world.<a name=83:13></a> No, Matthew was written to train administrators for another world.<a name=83:14></a> That is what we are increasingly concerned about -- another world.<a name=83:15></a> I think even the youngest here would agree that there could be a better world than this present one.<a name=83:16></a> Thank God there is a better world, and we are heading for it fast.<a name=83:17></a> So, God will have in that

		The Lord says, "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said" -- it was to be a fulfilment of scripture, and I think you might find the scripture if you search for it -- "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (verse 38).<a name=91:2></a> I want by the Lord's help to give you an idea of what that means; and for that purpose I must refer to the previous chapters, because I do not think that you can talk about rivers of living water flowing out of the belly of the believer if you do not see first how the believer is set in life.<a name=91:3></a> In the three previous chapters the question of life is solved.<a name=91:4></a>

		It is the revelation of God active in grace which delivers a soul from legality, for one learns that so far from our having to work, God has been working for our blessing; "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (verse 17).<a name=92:1></a> When once a person learns that his blessing depends -- not upon his working, but the Father's pleasure, then he is delivered from legality.<a name=92:2></a> That is what comes out in chapter 5, where the Lord raises up the man at the pool of Bethesda, who had lain on the bed of his weakness for thirty-eight years.<a name=92:3></a> God delights to be known as Father in the activities of His love.<a name=92:4></a> You were drawn to Christ by the Father; you may say that you were drawn to Him by preaching, but the real truth is that <i>the Father</i> drew you to Christ.<a name=92:5></a> And you were drawn to Christ that He might bring you to the Father; that is the way in which grace works.<a name=92:6></a> "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work".<a name=92:7></a> No one can come to Christ except the Father draw him; the Father works in drawing to Christ, and then Christ reveals the Father to those that are drawn to Him by the Father.<a name=92:8></a> The love of Christ to saints is explained by this, they are individually dear to Christ because they are the Father's gift to Him, and He makes known to them the Father's name.<a name=92:9></a>

		In chapter 6 another point comes out, that the believer is completely independent of the world because he has living bread for the food of his soul.<a name=92:10></a> The Lord Jesus says, "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father" (verse 57).<a name=92:11></a> I understand by it that the Lord Jesus down here was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was seeking to show that in chapter 7 we get the introduction of the dispensation; two leading marks in it being that Jesus was to be glorified and the Holy Spirit given.<a name=140:3></a> These give you the principles of the dispensation.<a name=140:4></a> Now I think you can understand that the Holy Spirit could not be given until Jesus was glorified; for you could not have man glorified before Jesus was glorified.<a name=140:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem strange to speak of man being glorified, but man is glorified in receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=140:6></a> I do not mean to say that he is glorified as to his bodily condition; but the Spirit of glory is on him.<a name=140:7></a> What greater glory could be conferred upon man here than that he should be a vessel for the Holy Spirit!<a name=140:8></a> The Holy Spirit could not be here apart from a vessel.<a name=140:9></a> That was true even when the Lord Himself was here.<a name=140:10></a> Christ was the vessel in that sense; He was anointed and sealed with the Spirit.<a name=140:11></a> Now the one body, the one flock, is the vessel.<a name=140:12></a> "There is one body and one Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a>); one Spirit must make one body.<a name=140:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now Jesus is glorified as Man; He is exalted to the right hand of God, and all power and authority given to Him; He is glorified according to the counsel of God, and the Holy Spirit is given.<a name=141:8></a> And it is that which marks the present period.<a name=141:9></a> The Lord refers to it in connection with "the last, the great day of the feast" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>).<a name=141:10></a> He does nothing except teach for the first seven days of the feast, which were more particularly connected with Israel; but on the last day He speaks about what would take place when the Holy Spirit was given.<a name=141:11></a> Think what a wonderful thing it is for man to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit!<a name=141:12></a> It has become so doctrinal with us, we have got so accustomed to the sound, that we have lost the sense of the greatness of it.<a name=141:13></a>

		I am leading on to the great truth on which I hope to dwell on another occasion -- one flock, one

		<a name=142>[Page 142]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Shepherd.<a name=142:1></a> But there is first an intermediate truth of great moment, that Christ is "the light of the world"; and that is what I want now to dwell upon.<a name=142:2></a> You cannot reach the truth of the one flock and one Shepherd without first apprehending the nature of the light that has come in, and the effects which it has produced.<a name=142:3></a> Of course, if I make such a statement I am bound to substantiate it.<a name=142:4></a> The truth is that the necessary consequence of the manifestation of the light was that something completely new, and which had no previous existence, was formed down here; the result being that there was one flock and one Shepherd.<a name=142:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There had been a flock here before; God's people Israel was Jehovah's flock.<a name=142:6></a> But now there was to be a flock of a totally different character; "those also I must bring" -- that is, Gentiles -- "and they shall hear my voice" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:16">John  10:16</a>).<a name=142:7></a> Gentiles were to hear His voice, "and there shall be one flock, one shepherd": one flock composed of Jew and Gentile, which was inconceivable and impossible when God was owning Israel.<a name=142:8></a> Hence it is in the setting aside of Israel you get one flock, one Shepherd, just as you get one body.<a name=142:9></a> It brings before us in a sort of parallel line what Paul brings before us in the truth of the mystery.<a name=142:10></a> In Paul it is, there is one body composed of Jew and Gentile, of which Christ is Head.<a name=142:11></a> In John it is, "there shall be one flock, one shepherd".<a name=142:12></a> I do not think the disciples understood it in the least so long as Christ was here.<a name=142:13></a> The truth of one body comes out afterwards in the teaching of Paul; and finally John

		comes in to show how the ministry of the Lord here upon earth indicated in principle what afterwards came out by Paul.<a name=143:1></a> The Lord brought out a great deal more in His teaching when here upon earth than was presented in testimony in the first instance in the Acts of the apostles.<a name=143:2></a> The fact is, that the development of God's testimony in the world depended on various things being accomplished; Israel had to be completely and finally tested, and hence all the truth of which Christ witnessed was not presented at once: it took a considerable time to come out.<a name=143:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my first point is one of great moment; Christ is the light of the world (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>): "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life".<a name=143:4></a> And again in the next chapter (verses 4, 5): "I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day.<a name=143:5></a> The night is coming, when no one can work.<a name=143:6></a> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world".<a name=143:7></a> Now I apprehend that the law was the light of the Jew.<a name=143:8></a> And the godly valued it as such.<a name=143:9></a> Refer to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>, and see what the law was to a pious heart, what importance was attached by it to the law of God.<a name=143:10></a> "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of Jehovah are

		truth, they are righteous altogether: they are more precious than gold, yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey and the dropping of the honeycomb" (verses 8 - 10).<a name=144:1></a> That refers to the law, and those verses give you the impression which a pious person had, by the Spirit, of the law.<a name=144:2></a> I think I may say, without fear of contradiction, that the law was the light of Israel: they had light from God undoubtedly; they had Jehovah's testimonies, His statutes and His judgments; and in that sense the law was their light.<a name=144:3></a> Hereafter the law will be written in their heart.<a name=144:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage I read Christ says, "I am the light of the world".<a name=144:5></a> You can understand that the law was not God; but the very essence of the truth in connection with Christ was, that, in Christ God was presented to man in grace; Christ was not simply something given.<a name=144:6></a> It says, "the law was given by Moses" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:17">John  1:17</a>); it does not say, 'Grace and truth were given by Jesus Christ', but 'Grace and truth have come to pass by Jesus Christ'.<a name=144:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is all the difference possible between Moses and Christ; Moses was an instrument, and the law was given by him, and the law was light to Israel; but when Christ came it was not a question of God giving, it was a question of God come.<a name=144:8></a> It is true the Father gave the Son, I quite admit the gift in that connection, and that the Lord always took the ground of being sent; but I do not think any one here would question the thought that it was God come here in grace.<a name=144:9></a> I notice particularly in the gospel of

	<div class="paragraph">
		John that on two occasions the Lord distinctly makes the matter of His presence here a question between Israel and God; He sought to show the Jews that His presence and their conduct towards Him was not simply a question between them and Messiah, but between them and God.<a name=145:1></a> "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#2:19">John  2:19</a>); He could speak like that as Himself being a divine Person.<a name=145:2></a> So, too, afterwards in this chapter He says to them, "Before Abraham was, I am" (verse 58), and they took up stones to stone Him; but they took up stones to stone One who claimed to be "I am", that is, Jehovah.<a name=145:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I lay great stress upon the point, that in the service of Christ here it was not something given like the law, but God come down in grace, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:19">2 Corinthians  5:19</a>); there was a blessed Vessel here in which God had drawn nigh to man.<a name=145:4></a> Therefore the Lord Jesus could say, "Return to thine house and relate what great things God has done for thee" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:39">Luke  8:39</a>): Christ came to this world to bring God close to man, that man might see what the heart of God was towards him.<a name=145:5></a> Satan had deceived man about God; and it was of the grace of God that man's heart might be enlightened, that he might be undeceived as to God, that what was in the heart of God might be made known to man as light.<a name=145:6></a> I think you can very well understand that if that were the case, the bearing of it could not be limited to Israel: the law was limited to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel; it was the light of Israel; but if it was a question of God come here in grace, that could not be so limited.<a name=146:1></a> Therefore the Lord takes this ground here, "I am the light of the world": not the light of Israel (though He was the light to Israel), but the light of the world; because it was God come here.<a name=146:2></a>

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to refer simply to exercises that are necessary for the maintenance of the testimony of God.<a name=161:1></a> He has entrusted very precious substance to His people that it might be preserved and kept.<a name=161:2></a> I have particularly in mind three specific exercises that are referred to in these passages: first of all, that of keeping; secondly, that of carrying; and, lastly, that of trading.<a name=161:3></a> It is very encouraging that the things of God in themselves know of no devaluation, though in our day, "the last days" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:1">2 Timothy  3:1</a>), publicly these things appear to have lost their true value in the estimation of many persons.<a name=161:4></a>

		The Lord Jesus presents Himself as "the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:14">Revelation  3:14</a>), to Laodicea, an assembly that was in a lukewarm state spiritually, and considered that it had no need.<a name=161:5></a> But the Lord says, "thou sayest, I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing" (verse 17), and presents Himself in this wonderful way, as "the faithful and true witness".<a name=161:6></a> Things, dear brethren, are maintained by Him for God; everything is carried through in Him, the faithful and true Witness.<a name=161:7></a> In His pathway here, as the hymn says, He was

		But how encouraging it is that everything for God is still maintained at its very height in that perfect Man.<a name=162:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now the exercise is, how are things to be maintained among His people in testimony?<a name=162:2></a> Paul speaks wonderfully in this first verse that we read: "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God".<a name=162:3></a> How faithful he was in maintaining what God had revealed to him, and in delivering it to the saints.<a name=162:4></a> He says, "To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>, 9).<a name=162:5></a> Wonderful mysteries were entrusted to Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles.<a name=162:6></a> It was given to him to complete the word of God, which, no doubt, included the great truth of the mystery which he speaks of in Colossians as "Christ in you the hope of glory" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a>).<a name=162:7></a> This blessed truth was "hidden throughout the ages in God" but is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets.<a name=162:8></a> Paul was a steward of what he had received, and faithful in delivering it to the saints.<a name=162:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question for each of us now is, Are we faithful in relation to that which has been entrusted?<a name=162:10></a> We are entrusted with inestimable spiritual wealth, but are we faithful stewards?<a name=162:11></a> Paul was concerned that what Timothy had heard in the presence of many witnesses might be entrusted to "faithful men, such

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul goes on to say, "But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day".<a name=163:9></a> The Corinthians were judging Paul according to sight, according to man's day, and man can only judge according to sight.<a name=163:10></a> It was "the very smallest matter", Paul says, that he should be judged of man's day.<a name=163:11></a> The apostle judged everything in the light of a coming day, the day of Jesus Christ, and, dear brethren, we should judge of things in the light of His day, that quickly-coming day when the rights of Christ will be acknowledged and His glory will fill the earth.<a name=163:12></a> What a day we await!<a name=163:13></a> Let us not judge according to man's judgment; let us judge according to truth.<a name=163:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Paul speaks about being examined by the Lord.<a name=163:15></a> He was manifested, so to say, before the judgment-seat.<a name=163:16></a> That is what a faithful steward would desire, that he should have the Lord's assessment, the Lord's judgment.<a name=163:17></a> Paul was not on the line of pleasing men: he says to the Galatian saints, "If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bond-

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul then speaks about not judging anything "before the time".<a name=164:8></a> I think that is very important.<a name=164:9></a> It is necessary to have a right and true judgment, but Paul says, "do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord shall come".<a name=164:10></a> No doubt he had in view the coming of the Lord, when everything will be set right.<a name=164:11></a> He says, "until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts, and then shall each have his praise from God".<a name=164:12></a> So it is a question of waiting upon the Lord in matters of judgment.<a name=164:13></a> The Lord will always make known His mind to persons who wait in simple dependence upon Him, and He makes matters clear by coming into them Himself.<a name=164:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like to refer to the matter of keeping.<a name=164:15></a> Divine things, dear brethren, are not to lose their value in our hands, but to be preserved at their true value, and for that we need divine power.<a name=164:16></a> The truth is not held in bookcases, or in any theoretical way; the truth is to be held in the hearts of God's people.<a name=164:17></a> So the apostle says, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit .<a name=164:18></a>.<a name=164:19></a>.<a name=164:20></a> the good deposit entrusted".<a name=164:21></a> What a good

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only are divine things to be kept, but they are also to be carried.<a name=165:10></a> God made detailed provision for the carrying of the precious things belonging to the tabernacle (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:14">Exodus  25:14</a>, 27; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#27:7">Exodus  27:7</a>; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#30:4">Exodus  30:4</a>).<a name=165:11></a> It is a wonderful privilege to carry divine things.<a name=165:12></a> There is to be movement, there is an objective in view.<a name=165:13></a> We are passing, as it were, through the wilderness, but we have a wonderful, heavenly inheritance in view.<a name=165:14></a> The things of God do not belong here, but they are to be carried in the hearts and affections of His people.<a name=165:15></a> The Lord will, very shortly, gather up everything that belongs to Him here and display it in another day.<a name=165:16></a> May we have that millennial day livingly in our hearts, because bound up with it is the glory of Christ.<a name=165:17></a> One of the greatest privileges, dear brethren, that we have today is, typically, to carry the ark, that is, Christ in testimony, that it may be brought into its place.<a name=165:18></a> That was David's exercise (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>), that the ark might be in its place.<a name=165:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From the time of Christ and onwards, whenever light came in, it had the effect of blinding people who said they saw.<a name=174:2></a> When a man says, 'I see', he takes the ground of being competent, and such men are bound to be blinded by the light.<a name=174:3></a> I may not be able successfully to prove it to you, but that such is the case I have no doubt.<a name=174:4></a> When the Lord was here upon earth the scribes took the ground of being competent to judge in divine things, and the effect of the light upon them was that they were made blind.<a name=174:5></a> The Lord brings the light to bear upon them in chapter 8.<a name=174:6></a> He reveals to them where they really were, that they were the slaves of sin and the children of the devil, seeking to carry out the lusts of their father, seeking to commit murder, and refusing to receive the truth, because they were liars and the children of the devil.<a name=174:7></a> The Lord completely exposes their moral condition; but the brightness of the light only served to blind them.<a name=174:8></a>

		To a man who says, I am perfectly satisfied with the order of things down here upon earth, you may bring as much light as you like, but it will only blind him; he does not want to know the light of God or the love of God; he is well content with himself and things about him; he says, "We see", and he becomes blind in regard to the very light which he had, and in which he boasted.<a name=174:9></a> It is very much like the people that are pictured to us in the address to the church at Laodicea, "I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:17">Revelation  3:17</a>) -- we

		You see the same thing if you pass down to a time nearer to our own, the time of the Reformation.<a name=175:2></a> The ecclesiastical people, the Jews of that day, who said, "We see" -- and there were plenty of them -- were blinded by the light that came in.<a name=175:3></a> I will give you a proof of it.<a name=175:4></a> It is remarkable that in the Council of Trent, which took place after the Reformation, the apocryphal books were made part of the sacred canon.<a name=175:5></a> I have no doubt that the very light which the Spirit of God brought in at that time served to blind those who said, "We see".<a name=175:6></a> They said, We are competent, we can judge what is the word of God and what is not, and they fastened on to the sacred canon the unworthy books of the Apocrypha.<a name=175:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The same danger besets us.<a name=175:8></a> If we take the ground here of ecclesiastical assumption with an idea that we are something, we may be in very great danger of being blinded by the light that has come in to the true position and responsibility of Christendom.<a name=175:9></a> The people that are content to take the place of a poor and afflicted people calling upon the name of the Lord, get the benefit of the light, not the people who make great pretensions; they are often blinded by it.<a name=175:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you can understand that the great light which came in by Christ eclipsed all else; nothing could stand its ground in the presence of that great light.<a name=175:11></a> I do not mean to say for a moment that the light that came in by Christ was contrary to the law and the prophets; but it eclipsed them, like Moses and Elias, they disappeared in the light which came

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this must be the case, because the revelation never would be appreciated, or enjoyed, if it did not please God in grace to open eyes for it; God does it really by the revelation; it is the testimony of divine love used in the power of the Spirit to open the eyes of those who are blind, those who never saw.<a name=177:14></a> You remember the commission to the apostle Paul; he was to go to the Gentiles "to open their eyes".<a name=177:15></a> How?<a name=177:16></a> He could not of course do it in the sense in which God could do it, but he could do it by his testimony; and the testimony of the love of God was to be, in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And that is the wonderful thing which is effected; you are turned "from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God".<a name=178:3></a> Look at this blind man; he had been a miserable, blind beggar, but he is turned from darkness to light, and in a certain sense from Satan's power to God; his eyes are opened that he might apprehend the Son of God who had come here to reveal God.<a name=178:4></a> That was the great mission of the Son of God here, to reveal God to man, to make known to man the love of God, that man might be led out of the world; but, of necessity, man was first exposed.<a name=178:5></a> You get in the next chapter that the sheep are led out of the fold, out of the world, that there may be one flock and one shepherd.<a name=178:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not purpose going further, because the one flock and one shepherd will form our subject on another occasion; but I think I have made it plain in some degree that you could not go on to that subject if you did not first apprehend the light that has come in to illuminate man where he is, and to lead him out of the world.<a name=178:7></a> The Jew was necessarily tested by the brightness of the light, and everything was brought

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many words for 'service' in the Scriptures.<a name=180:3></a> The one I am thinking about really indicates the <i>priestly</i> service of God, so that there is something going up from men which God receives, and which He is pleased with.<a name=180:4></a> It is, according to the word of Moses, like burnt offerings upon His altar, incense before His nostrils (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:10">Deuteronomy  33:10</a>).<a name=180:5></a> There is much going up that is called service, very often called divine service, which, alas, does not please God.<a name=180:6></a> It has a certain expression which practically does not alter, and it does not depend upon the state of the person who voices it.<a name=180:7></a> It seems just automatic.<a name=180:8></a> Even in a company like this where we are accustomed to the living voice of the truth, we need help so as to be living, not to be merely repeating.<a name=180:9></a> It may be that we need reminding of the renewal of the Holy Spirit.<a name=180:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, there are many words for service.<a name=180:11></a> There is the service which consists of the small, humble things like helping a person who has fallen, or even handing, as the Lord said, a cup of

	<div class="paragraph">
		cold water to a person (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:42">Matthew  10:42</a>).<a name=181:1></a> All these things, however humble, may come, in a certain general sense, into the service of God.<a name=181:2></a> There is the service in the preaching: Paul said, "God .<a name=181:3></a>.<a name=181:4></a>.<a name=181:5></a> whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:9">Romans  1:9</a>).<a name=181:6></a> He served God as he preached.<a name=181:7></a> It is not only that he was speaking to men, but the whole service went up to God as a sweet savour.<a name=181:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what we are speaking of mainly is the priestly service of God, which offers something to Him; and I judge from the reading of the Scriptures that to be effective and full it demands a certain state and condition in those who serve.<a name=181:9></a> For instance, to quote from our second passage, "be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind"; that is a state; it demands a state.<a name=181:10></a> God has provided for that state in the gift of the Spirit.<a name=181:11></a> He has also provided for us to come before Him with substance and fulness: "none shall appear before me empty" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:20">Exodus  34:20</a>).<a name=181:12></a> It is a very exercising thing if brothers never take any active part in the various services known to us in the assembly.<a name=181:13></a> It may raise the question as to whether we <i>have</i> anything.<a name=181:14></a> It is equally exercising for the sisters, whether they depend for their spirituality upon their husbands and menfolk.<a name=181:15></a> We are not to live by our relations or Christian parents; we are to live by Christ: "<i>he</i> also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:57">John  6:57</a>).<a name=181:16></a> We can never make a start on this line unless we are feeding on Christ; there is no life or substance in the soul apart from that.<a name=181:17></a>

		I may take the parallel from the Old Testament scriptures, which, of course, come readily to mind when thinking of the service of God, and you find persons bringing an offering.<a name=182:1></a> It was contemplated that there should always be offerings going up.<a name=182:2></a> A bullock was a rare kind of offering, a very large offering, but there were times when a bullock was brought.<a name=182:3></a> One woman brought three (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#1:24">1 Samuel  1:24</a>), a magnificent offering!<a name=182:4></a> She could not bring them if she did not have them.<a name=182:5></a> We cannot bring anything unless we have it, so we had better see that we have something, and all the more so as God has arranged for every circumstance.<a name=182:6></a> He has taken away every difficulty, He has removed every hindrance, even our sins; He has removed the old order of man which so stands in the way; every kind of enmity God has slain by the cross; "having effaced the handwriting in ordinances which stood out against us" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:14">Colossians  2:14</a>).<a name=182:7></a> What a God He is!<a name=182:8></a> He has not only removed it, but according to John He has done it in a Man in whom love has been pre-eminently manifested.<a name=182:9></a> John says, "To him who loves us" -- that is Jesus, and then, as I said, God has given us the Holy Spirit.<a name=182:10></a>

		I would like to encourage some of our younger people who are not yet breaking bread, because serving God without starting where God starts is just impossible; and God says, The beginning of My service in Christianity is the Lord's supper.<a name=182:11></a> That is the beginning of the public service of God, something which can be seen, where any person coming in can note it and say, There are persons

		I was remarking last time, that all the scriptures given to instruct us in Christianity lead up to the principle of unity.<a name=242:22></a> Of course, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable; but there are certain scriptures which especially address them-selves

		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		to us as Christians.<a name=243:1></a> And I think you will find that all such tend to the realisation of unity.<a name=243:2></a> I do not think that it is possible to attach too much importance to the thought of unity in connection with Christianity.<a name=243:3></a> What is the character of the unity is another matter; it has its own proper character.<a name=243:4></a> It is not a unity in the flesh; it is described in Scripture as "the unity of the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:3">Ephesians  4:3</a>); it has that character.<a name=243:5></a> Unity is what we are led on to in this gospel; and this is seen in what the Lord says in this chapter, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd".<a name=243:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just make this remark in passing, that John never gives us, so far as I know, what Paul does, the great system of profession.<a name=243:7></a> Paul gives us two great truths in connection with the church; the one is its identification as Christ's body, and the other its aspect as God's house.<a name=243:8></a> God's house, I have always thought, and still think, is founded on profession.<a name=243:9></a> It began in a few saints being gathered together by the testimony of the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit of God came down and dwelt in them and among them.<a name=243:10></a> But among the Gentiles, at all events, the house of God has been formed by profession; and Jew and Gentile have been builded together in the Lord for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=243:11></a> Now I do not think you will find that John ever gives you the outward system, and I do not say that he gives you the truth of the body; it is not exactly his line; but he gives you what runs parallel with the truth of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the body, and that is, "one flock, one shepherd".<a name=244:1></a> The truth of the one body, as I understand it, is given to us in Scripture to show us the real power of unity.<a name=244:2></a> And so I get a corresponding truth here in John, that there is one flock, one Shepherd.<a name=244:3></a> I do not think the one flock was in itself to be patent or evident to men any more than the one Shepherd; but I think the effect of it was to be patent, that the world was to witness a unity, the spring of which it was impossible for them to understand.<a name=244:4></a> But I am anticipating a little, and will come to that presently.<a name=244:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel was God's flock, and in a certain sense Jehovah was the Shepherd; that, I think, was patent to the nations; it was a flock in that sense, after the flesh.<a name=244:6></a> But that was never intended to be the character of the one flock and the one Shepherd.<a name=244:7></a> None the less the one flock and the one Shepherd are a great reality.<a name=244:8></a> So with the church: the house of God, the external system of profession is patent to the world, all know it; the world recognises Christianity as a system of profession; but they know nothing about the body, the truth of the body is the mystery.<a name=244:9></a> It has often been said that a mystery is something which is known to the initiated; it is made known to saints.<a name=244:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we pass on to the features of this chapter, I may just refer to what has been before us on former occasions, which, as I judge, is introductory.<a name=244:11></a> I do not think you can really understand the character of the one flock if you do not take it up in connection with what had been presented in the preceding chapters.<a name=244:12></a> What is unfolded in this chapter as to the one flock,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=245>[Page 245]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is dependent on what is unfolded in the previous chapters.<a name=245:1></a> My object has been so far to give you the characteristics of this present time, this dispensation, if you like to call it so.<a name=245:2></a> We have had two things a good deal before us -- Jesus glorified and the Spirit given.<a name=245:3></a> The present time, it has been often noticed, is the time of the Spirit.<a name=245:4></a> "The Spirit was not yet", it says; that is, the time was not yet come for the Spirit to be here, "because Jesus had not yet been glorified" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>); but consequent upon Jesus being glorified the Spirit has been given.<a name=245:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was saying last time what an immensity it is to man that the Spirit should have been given, that man down here upon earth should be the vessel of the Spirit; it is the most wonderful change which could have been brought to pass.<a name=245:6></a> But the giving of the Spirit depended upon the great truth of Jesus being personally glorified; and man, in a certain sense, is glorified here in the fact of the Spirit having been given to indwell him.<a name=245:7></a> I do not enlarge on it, but there was the Spirit's time coming, consequent upon Jesus being glorified; and another truth connected with it is this, that man is the vessel of the Spirit, for the Spirit does not dwell here apart from a vessel.<a name=245:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point necessary to it, which came before us last time, was the light; the Lord takes that ground in chapters 8: 12 and 9: 5, "I am the light of the world".<a name=245:9></a> I tried to show what I judge to be the significance of this, namely, that you need to apprehend the character of the light that has come in.<a name=245:10></a> In a sense the law was the light of the Jew; but Christ
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=246>[Page 246]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		says, "I am the light of the world", for He came here to declare God.<a name=246:1></a> It is true that Christ was "a minister of the circumcision" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:8">Romans  15:8</a>), to confirm the promises made to the fathers: He came thus to the Jew, but He was "the light of the world".<a name=246:2></a> If God reveal Himself in love, He does so in relation to the world.<a name=246:3></a> There are two things Christ came here for, to make known what God was, and to make good the Father's counsels of grace.<a name=246:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has often been said that you must not confound nature and counsels -- God has His counsels, and they connect themselves with the name of "Father"; but at the same time there is the nature of God -- "God so loved the world": that verse does not convey the idea of His counsels, but of His nature.<a name=246:5></a> When it is a question of God's counsels, the name of Father is brought in, "The Father seeks such as his worshippers" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:23">John  4:23</a>), because it is to accomplish His counsels of grace; "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:44">John  6:44</a>): that is, there are counsels of grace in which the Father draws to the Son.<a name=246:6></a> But at the same time there is the truth, "God is love"; this is what God is in His nature, and not a question of the counsels of His grace.<a name=246:7></a> And Christ came here to make known, in the midst of the world, the nature of God.<a name=246:8></a> If you apprehend that, you can well understand the Lord saying, "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>).<a name=246:9></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=247>[Page 247]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		chapter 9, I was saying last time that if divine light came into this world in fulness, as it did in Christ, of necessity it brought everything to an issue.<a name=247:1></a> That is what the Lord, I judge, means by the expression, "For judgment am I come into this world".<a name=247:2></a> Two things are connected with it which I dwelt on; "that they which see not may see; and they which see may become blind".<a name=247:3></a> Bear in mind what I mentioned in the last lecture, that in the very nature of things, if man takes the ground of seeing, he rejects revelation.<a name=247:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Until Christ came man took the ground, more or less, of expectation, not of seeing.<a name=247:5></a> When Christ came, men took other ground, and began to say, "We see".<a name=247:6></a> In the nature of things, if man says, "We see", he does not want a revelation from God; he rejects it.<a name=247:7></a> And that is the real reason why the religious, scientific, and literary leaders of the present day largely reject revelation, because they say, "We see"; they take the ground of being competent.<a name=247:8></a> When Christ was here, the scribes and Pharisees were really infidel at heart; they began to say, "We see"; they were competent, and rejected Christ's word.<a name=247:9></a> But there is another thing, "that .<a name=247:10></a>.<a name=247:11></a>.<a name=247:12></a> they which see not may see"; the testimony and evidence that Christ brought of the goodness of God were used of God to the opening of the eyes of men, as seen in the case of the blind man in chapter 9.<a name=247:13></a> The grace of God has come down to man here in this world, to take account of him in his miserable condition, and of every effect of sin under which he

	<div class="paragraph">
		laboured; and the fact of the grace of God having in this way visited this world in the Person of God's Son is used to open the eyes of those who never saw.<a name=248:1></a> They accept the exposure and are touched and affected by the grace; it is the very thing they want, the Spirit of God makes everything to them of the wonderful goodness of God in visiting this world in the Person of His blessed Son.<a name=248:2></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the assembly recognises the redemption- rights of Christ.<a name=249:4></a> That dismisses for ever any rights that we might have.<a name=249:5></a> The Lord Jesus has all the rights that belong to you.<a name=249:6></a> He has purchased them and He is the best One to hold the title-deeds.<a name=249:7></a> They are secure in His hands.<a name=249:8></a> Do you recognise the Lord in that light?<a name=249:9></a> The assembly does.<a name=249:10></a> She recognises that the title-deeds as to every right are held by Christ on the ground of redemption.<a name=249:11></a> She is espoused to Him who bought her and all that belonged to her.<a name=249:12></a> In other words, Christ has redeemed the inheritance and has bought her with it.<a name=249:13></a> All this has a practical bearing.<a name=249:14></a> Your rights are all merged in Christ.<a name=249:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one other thought, and this Abigail represents.<a name=249:16></a> When you come to David, you come to the king, and there is no one to come after him, hence we get in Abigail the last type of the assembly, and I would like to look at it.<a name=249:17></a> I just want you to ponder over this remarkable personage.<a name=249:18></a> She appears at an epoch marked by the death of Samuel, recorded in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25">1 Samuel  25</a>; that is to say, at a time when the link between God and the established order is severed.<a name=249:19></a> Samuel dies.<a name=249:20></a> I may say in passing, for the benefit of any one here who may be hankering after an established religious order in the world, that there is no link whatsoever between that and God.<a name=249:21></a> The link is severed and till you acknowledge it you will

		never come into the benefits of assembly privilege.<a name=250:1></a> You must acknowledge that the link between God and the established religious order in the earth is broken.<a name=250:2></a> Samuel was that link in his day, and he died, and in the death of Samuel is evidence that the link is broken between God and the people, between God and the outwardly established order of things.<a name=250:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now David is in rejection, and Abigail is presented to us.<a name=250:4></a> She is the wife of a man called Nabal.<a name=250:5></a> He was churlish, and the Spirit records of her that she was "of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance" (verse 3).<a name=250:6></a> The chapter is most interesting, and it ends with "David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her as his wife" (verse 39).<a name=250:7></a> He has thus secured a companion in his royalty, equal, not as a matter of lineage, but as a matter of intelligence and beauty.<a name=250:8></a> She has a good understanding.<a name=250:9></a> That is one of the greatest things.<a name=250:10></a> What is said in the prophet is that God's people were destroyed for lack of knowledge.<a name=250:11></a> They were not acquainted with things.<a name=250:12></a> Think of all that is opened up to us now that Christ is in heaven; all that is opened up to us in the ministry of Paul!<a name=250:13></a> Paul as in the light of it and the blessedness of it, bows his knees in prayer.<a name=250:14></a> What does he pray about?<a name=250:15></a> First of all, that the saints might have "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:17">Ephesians  1:17</a>); that is, of God.<a name=250:16></a> God wishes us to be intelligent.<a name=250:17></a> If we take up the truth of God and pray over it, the Lord will give us understanding.<a name=250:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will see in what I have been saying, that the divine thought is that the Man is not to be alone in any position, and therefore I connect all I have had to say with those verses in 1 Corinthians, "For man is not of woman, but woman of man.<a name=251:12></a> For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.<a name=251:13></a> Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.<a name=251:14></a> However, neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.<a name=251:15></a> For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman, but all things of God".<a name=251:16></a> So you see that in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle being stated, it is for us to recognise what is implied in the word "It is not good that Man should be alone".<a name=252:3></a> Do we recognise that we are essential to Christ?<a name=252:4></a> If there is anything that I treasure in my heart, it is that I am essential to Christ.<a name=252:5></a> I am no more essential to Him than you are; every member is essential.<a name=252:6></a> The Lord knows each one and the question for our hearts is this: Where are we in regard to Him?<a name=252:7></a> He seeks companionship.<a name=252:8></a> I do not know any word in the Scriptures that carries more with it in this connection than the word <i>with</i>.<a name=252:9></a> "God .<a name=252:10></a>.<a name=252:11></a>.<a name=252:12></a> has quickened us <i>with</i> the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:5">Ephesians  2:5</a>) .<a name=252:13></a> "<i>Ye</i> are they who have persevered <i>with</i> me in my temptations" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:28">Luke  22:28</a>).<a name=252:14></a> "Father, as to those whom thou has given me, I desire that where I am they also may be <i>with</i> me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:24">John  17:24</a>).<a name=252:15></a> In these scriptures, and in many more, you will see the desire of the Lord's heart, and the question is as to whether we are answering to it at the close of this period, and when He is about to appear.<a name=252:16></a> Are we with Him so that we shall be ready to join Him in reality when the assembling shout is heard?<a name=252:17></a>

		It is of the greatest importance that we should distinguish between the atoning and martyr sufferings of Christ.<a name=253:2></a> In His atoning sufferings He was alone, and suffered from God for sin on account of others.<a name=253:3></a> In His martyr sufferings we are privileged to suffer with Him, for in these He suffered from man for righteousness.<a name=253:4></a> If we do not rightly note this difference we may become irreverent in our expressions and unscriptural in our thoughts.<a name=253:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the psalm before us the atoning sufferings are spoken of.<a name=253:6></a> Jesus is here seen as the Sin-Bearer; for, whilst other sufferings are alluded to, the burden of the psalm is found in the opening cry: "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=253:7></a>" The laughing to scorn, the mocking with a crown of thorns, the piercing of His hands and feet, only led up to what is found in verse 15: "Thou hast laid me in the dust of death".<a name=253:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Surely every indignity and shame was felt by Jesus -- felt, we may say, deeply and intensely, for He was perfect in everything.<a name=253:9></a> But in this psalm the sorrow is unique, and eclipsed every other sorrow.<a name=253:10></a> It is the unutterable sorrow of Christ as abandoned by God.<a name=253:11></a> A comparison of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:34">Matthew  27:34</a> - 46 will show us how really this psalm applies to our Lord Jesus.<a name=253:12></a>

		I am now coming to the putting forth of the sheep from the fold, and the formation of the one flock; and I desire to make plain to you, by the grace of God, two or three of the characteristics which mark the sheep.<a name=257:2></a> But first we get the thought of Christ entering the fold and leading out the sheep.<a name=257:3></a> You will notice that in chapter 10 the ground of the Lord's action is not His rejection by the Jews.<a name=257:4></a> The two previous chapters bring out His rejection both as to His word and His work; but His leaving the fold was not exactly a question of His rejection by them, but that when He puts forth His own sheep He goes before them.<a name=257:5></a> And the reason is simple; His going before them is by death.<a name=257:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sheep could not leave the fold until Christ left the fold, and He actually left it in His death.<a name=257:7></a> His death is looked at through all this chapter as a necessity; I may quote the Lord's own words; He says, referring to His life, "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<a name=257:8></a> I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.<a name=257:9></a> I have received this commandment of my Father" (chapter 10: 18).<a name=257:10></a> I think this an important point in connection with His leaving the fold.<a name=257:11></a> He came into the fold; but if the sheep were to be relieved of the pressure of death which lay upon them as the judgment of God, of necessity Christ must leave the fold.<a name=257:12></a> No one takes His life from Him.<a name=257:13></a> All through

		the chapter, when the Lord speaks of laying down His life, He lays it down, I will not say voluntarily, because that is not perfectly right: but He lays it down of Himself, He does it in obedience; "I have received this commandment of my Father".<a name=258:1></a> He is the first to leave the fold; no one could leave the fold until He left it.<a name=258:2></a> We get a type of it in the previous chapters.<a name=258:3></a> In chapter 8 Christ's word, the expression of what He was, had been rejected by the Jews, and the Lord leaves them; and in chapter 9 the man who was the subject of His work is excommunicated from the synagogue.<a name=258:4></a> Still the time had not yet come to leave the fold until the Shepherd left it; He says so expressly: "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them" (verse 4) .<a name=258:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now just a word about the fold, as being a point of importance.<a name=258:6></a> I think the fold was the enclosure, the system of ordinances, in which the people of God were kept up to a point -- the apostle Paul says, "the law has been our tutor up to Christ" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:24">Galatians  3:24</a>); but the law never justified anybody.<a name=258:7></a> It could not; those under it could not be justified as long as they were in the fold; they were to be justified by the faith of Christ.<a name=258:8></a> Death being upon man, he could not be justified except by blood.<a name=258:9></a> "Without blood-shedding there is no remission" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:22">Hebrews  9:22</a>).<a name=258:10></a> On the day of atonement the blood had to be carried into the holiest of all, because death lay upon man; and God could not approach man, nor could man approach God, without blood; that is, man had to recognise the sentence of death which was upon him.<a name=258:11></a> The great

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ had entered into the fold, and that in a legitimate way; but He did not enter it to abide there, nor to leave the sheep there.<a name=259:2></a> There were in God's counsels sheep down here, and Christ came to where the sheep were.<a name=259:3></a> The sheep heard His voice; that was the first thing.<a name=259:4></a> Think what the voice of Christ was when He was here upon earth, and what was the effect of that voice!<a name=259:5></a> What it was to Lazarus, for instance; "Lazarus, come forth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:43">John  11:43</a>).<a name=259:6></a> It was the voice of the Son of God, and His voice reached the dead.<a name=259:7></a> So, too, I might speak of other things; the Lord cast out devils: how?<a name=259:8></a> By His word.<a name=259:9></a> But the point here is that the sheep know His voice, they know the character of His voice.<a name=259:10></a> It is a wonderful voice that speaks here in this world; I believe the sheep felt it to be the voice of One that had power over all ill, of One that had come here with divine power over man's last enemy -- death: "they know his voice" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:4">John  10:4</a>).<a name=259:11></a> There was no good for man down here save in the advent of One who could bind man's great enemy in his stronghold, namely, death.<a name=259:12></a> That is exactly what Christ could do, and what He proved He could do, and the sheep know His voice, they are conscious that everything has to give way to His voice.<a name=259:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want you to bear in mind three things, which you can put together, as marking this present moment, and describing the blessings of the sheep: the sheep are relieved of the judgment of death

		under which they lay: it being now the time of the Spirit, the Spirit dwells in them: and they are in the light of God revealed in Christ.<a name=260:1></a> You cannot understand the privileges of the sheep, if you do not apprehend those three things; they are the marks of the moment.<a name=260:2></a> Death is annulled, so that man can be free here of the judgment of God in the very place where he was under that judgment; and the proof of this is that the believer receives the gift of the Spirit, he has the seal of God upon him, and is in the light as God has been pleased to reveal Himself in the Son.<a name=260:3></a> The love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit given to him (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>); that is, his heart is full of divine light by the revelation of God in His blessed Son.<a name=260:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in Romans to which I have just referred shows you how God has been pleased to display His love in His Son; and now the Holy Spirit has come to dwell in the believer to make the love of God effective in his heart.<a name=260:5></a> Those are the privileges of the sheep; they have left the fold by faith in Christ, they have come away from the system of ordinances in order to be justified by Christ, and are in the fulness of the light which Christ has been pleased to bring, in the presence of the love of God.<a name=260:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I see in people all around (and in myself too) is how little practical confidence they have in God as to circumstances and their pathway through this world; and I will tell you why -- it is because they do not know Him.<a name=260:7></a> I am perfectly confident that if our hearts were in the light of the revelation which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=261>[Page 261]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has given of Himself, the practical effect would be that we should be full of confidence.<a name=261:1></a> "Perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:18">1 John  4:18</a>).<a name=261:2></a> You know as well as I do that people in the circumstances of this life turn to all sorts of human resources and schemes, because of not knowing the love of God; their hearts have not learnt to trust in God.<a name=261:3></a> I think I begin to see how great a thing it is to trust God.<a name=261:4></a> If God has brought you into the presence of Himself revealed in perfect love (and He has) your heart can afford to trust in Him.<a name=261:5></a> "This is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:14">1 John  5:14</a>); our hearts are full of confidence because we are in the presence of God.<a name=261:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point I want to dwell upon is in the seventh and following verses: "Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.<a name=261:7></a> All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.<a name=261:8></a> I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture".<a name=261:9></a> Now you have got the sheep entering in by the door; I understand it to mean that one enters in by the faith of Christ dead and risen, one is saved.<a name=261:10></a> That is, there is the realisation of deliverance from death and Satan's power.<a name=261:11></a> The believer goes in and out, that is, he has perfect liberty; and he finds pasture.<a name=261:12></a> He gets three things, salvation, liberty and pasture, and that in the presence of divine light, into which he is brought in the grace of God and in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		power of the Holy Spirit that dwells in him.<a name=262:1></a> The secret of it all is this, that the sheep are no longer dependent on the system of ordinances, but are kept by a power within.<a name=262:2></a> It is a total mistake to suppose that the recognition of the power that dwells in the Christian will lead him to self-occupation.<a name=262:3></a> It will do nothing of the kind, because the Spirit in the Christian corresponds to Christ presented to his faith; the Spirit is "the truth" in the Christian (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:6">1 John  5:6</a>); but Christ is "the truth" as to revelation (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>), and therefore the Spirit always leads to Christ.<a name=262:4></a> You cannot understand anything about yourself, or your blessing or privilege, except as you learn it in Christ.<a name=262:5></a> He leads us into it by the Spirit.<a name=262:6></a> But it is a very important point to recognise that there is this mighty Power in you, and that you are kept by it.<a name=262:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it to be a point of great moment for Christians to apprehend that by Christ's work death is no longer upon them as penalty; and the proof of it is that they are indwelt by the Holy Spirit.<a name=262:8></a> The effect is that they are in divine light, in the light of God as revealed in Christ, they are saved, they go in and out -- they have liberty, and they find pasture.<a name=262:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now in the fourteenth verse we get to a further point in regard to the sheep.<a name=262:10></a> "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep".<a name=262:11></a> I believe this passage indicates that the sheep are formed in the reality of the divine

		nature.<a name=263:1></a> And I am more and more convinced that this is the work of the Spirit in the believer, to form him practically in the divine nature, that just as he has had part in the flesh and in man's ruin, so now, being enlightened and indwelt, he is formed in the divine nature.<a name=263:2></a> "He that practises righteousness is righteous, even as <i>he</i> is righteous" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:7">1 John  3:7</a>); and he loves according to Christ.<a name=263:3></a> Apart from that thought I doubt if you can understand the passage: "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine" -- that is in the divine nature -- "as the Father knows me and I know the Father".<a name=263:4></a> The Father knows the Son and the Son knows the Father in the reciprocity of divine affections, if I may use the expression.<a name=263:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it is in regard to Christ and the sheep; He knows His sheep and He is known of them in the reality of the divine nature in which they have been formed by the Holy Spirit given to them.<a name=263:6></a> It is a wonderful work of grace, and I think it is a great step beyond the previous passage.<a name=263:7></a> You see the same thought of the divine nature in Paul's doctrine; he speaks of the having put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:24">Ephesians  4:24</a>); that is, the believer is made partaker by the Spirit's work within him of the divine nature, and it is in that he knows Christ and is known of Christ.<a name=263:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more.<a name=263:9></a> It is in the divine nature that we become one flock.<a name=263:10></a> Now you come to the great truth, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold"

		(verse 10) -- that is, I suppose, to be gathered in from the Gentiles -- "those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd".<a name=264:1></a> I believe it to be one flock in the divine nature, not a body, patent and evident in the world; I do not think that is the idea of it; but it is very near akin to Paul's truth of the one body; "we, being many, are one body in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:5">Romans  12:5</a>).<a name=264:2></a> This is an abstract expression; <i>in Christ</i> we are one body, and members one of another.<a name=264:3></a> So here, it is one flock and one Shepherd; but the Lord does not bring out the truth of one flock and one Shepherd until He had previously brought out the truth of the divine nature which is to characterise the sheep.<a name=264:4></a>

		I believe that the idea of the knowledge which is spoken of is of knowledge between kindred natures not mere acquaintance.<a name=264:5></a> There are plenty of people with whom I am acquainted; but if I want to know a person intimately, there must be the possibility of affections of a kindred nature.<a name=264:6></a> And I think it is that into which the believer is brought in connection with Christ, as the Father knows Him and He also knows the Father.<a name=264:7></a>

		In an evil day, when the enemy is putting a false value upon temporal things and ever seeking to depreciate the true value of eternal things, it is necessary to see that all our "valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary" (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#27:25">Leviticus  27:25</a>).<a name=283:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the Mosaic law the standard weights, measures, and units of value were preserved in the tabernacle, and therefore questions which arose as to weight or value could be referred to the sanctuary of God, and a judgment obtained according to the divine standard, for "The just balance and scales are Jehovah's" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#16:11">Proverbs  16:11</a>).<a name=283:13></a>

		In the instructions given to His disciples in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6">Matthew  6</a>, the Lord emphasises the idea of cultivating what is secret.<a name=288:2></a> Whether it be in our giving of alms, or in our praying or fasting, we are to learn to cultivate that which is secret between our souls and God.<a name=288:3></a>

		He says particularly in regard prayer, "when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret" (verse 6).<a name=288:4></a> That is to say, there is to be nothing casual about our praying, there is to be that which is deliberate, seeking the presence of God, joying in the sense that the Father sees in secret, and the readiness to place ourselves under the eye of God in secret, so that all our thoughts and desires may be laid bare before the eye of Him who sees in secret, and it says, "thy Father who sees in secret will render it to thee" (verse 6).<a name=288:5></a>

		What I have before me is to speak about love-feasts as they are alluded to here, and also to show how these are to be maintained so that there should be a continuance of them until the end.<a name=289:1></a> The subject cannot be without interest.<a name=289:2></a> I desire to show you how the Lord introduced love, and I need not remind you that the Lord introduced it into this world.<a name=289:3></a> It took form in Christ, so that if we love, it is because He first loved us.<a name=289:4></a>

		Now I assume that every genuine Christian loves, and the first movement of love in your heart is taken account of by God, and though that love may become obscured, covered up in your soul, it is known to God; He remembers it.<a name=289:5></a> He never forgets the first movement of love in your heart.<a name=289:6></a> That is seen in the history of God's people of old.<a name=289:7></a> What is said of them at the beginning of their history is that they loved God, and God said of them, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:2">Jeremiah  2:2</a>).<a name=289:8></a> What is said of God at the end of the wilderness journey is that He loved them: "Yea, he loveth the peoples" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a>).<a name=289:9></a> Wonderful thought; it spans the wilderness: the end of the wilderness is He loved the people.<a name=289:10></a> That love which has taken root in your heart God nourishes, and so I take it that the seventy palm trees and twelve wells of water at the beginning of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember the statement in <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#10:2">Ecclesiastes  10:2</a>, "The heart of a wise man is at his right hand", and so it is with God, speaking reverently; He loved His people, and His right hand was at the disposal of His love.<a name=290:3></a> "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals".<a name=290:4></a> God takes account of that and remembers it.<a name=290:5></a> Israel was thus holiness to the Lord; holiness depends on love; Israel was "the firstfruits of his increase" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:3">Jeremiah  2:3</a>).<a name=290:6></a> What is the increase of God?<a name=290:7></a> The increase of God is love.<a name=290:8></a> There is nothing at all in the way of increase from God's point of view apart from divine love.<a name=290:9></a> Now God would cultivate that as a tender plant in this world.<a name=290:10></a> Consider the wilderness conditions!<a name=290:11></a> There was nothing in the wilderness as such to culture that plant; all was against it, but God brings in a means of preserving it, and I believe that the seventy palm trees, affording the shelter in which it is developed, and the twelve wells of water by which it is refreshed, represent this.<a name=290:12></a> God in that way provides for the continuance of love in your heart.<a name=290:13></a> It is a question of the continuance of the love, not simply of the beginning.<a name=290:14></a> God would see to it that love is continued.<a name=290:15></a>

		Now the Lord Jesus not only introduced the thought of love, but He introduced a love-feast.<a name=291:4></a> I do not say that the supper mentioned in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>was the only love-feast, but that is specially recorded for us, as it was the last, because in it the Lord provided for its continuance.<a name=291:5></a> Whilst He was here amongst them He provided that there should be a continuance of love-feasts; He would see to that.<a name=291:6></a> With what pleasure He would surround Himself with His loved ones; He would never fail to take advantage of every opportunity to afford His loved ones such privileges.<a name=291:7></a> But when we come to the last supper with Him we have added there the means by which it should be continued, even though the Lord were not present; He was to be absent, but the feasts were to continue.<a name=291:8></a> You remember that it was after the supper the Lord rose from the table.<a name=291:9></a> The supper was ended, and now He says, as it were, I want to show you how you can have this continued amongst you.<a name=291:10></a> He rises from supper and lays aside His garments.<a name=291:11></a> If the love-feasts are to be continued, we have to do that; we have to be prepared to divest ourselves of whatever dignity we may think we possess.<a name=291:12></a> I do not deny that we possess dignity, for God has dignified us; wonderfully He has dignified us in such manner as that we are suited companions for His beloved Son.<a name=291:13></a>

		It is a blessed thing to understand that God has reached out and given us redemption in Christ Jesus, and forgiveness of sins.<a name=301:4></a> We should ever thank Him for it.<a name=301:5></a> I think it is honouring to God that, as believers who have the Holy Spirit, we should take account of His own sovereign operations in our souls.<a name=301:6></a> God has looked a long way ahead and in His infinite foresight and wisdom He has taken account of our antecedents, our circumstances, up to our conversion.<a name=301:7></a> God has done that in sovereign grace and goodness.<a name=301:8></a> "He has called you", as it says, "by our glad tidings", and He would have us to be delivered from the world's system and be identified with Christ.<a name=301:9></a> God desires to have a separate people.<a name=301:10></a>

		So God, I believe, would stimulate our hearts to realise the greatness of what He has in mind for us, and to assure us that there are abundant resources to maintain us here for His pleasure until the Lord comes to take us to be with Himself.<a name=302:5></a> Paul says, "So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the instructions which ye have been taught".<a name=302:6></a> We need to value the ministry that has come to us from Christ in glory in the power of the blessed Holy Spirit.<a name=302:7></a> It is intended to preserve us here for God's pleasure and remind us that we are chosen of God in view of our being taken into that wonderful place of favour in Christ before Him.<a name=302:8></a>

		I have often thought that what would arrest the attention of a young priest when he entered the holy place for the first time would be that beautiful candlestick of pure gold illuminated by its seven lamps, for all the lamps threw their light on the candlestick itself.<a name=310:2></a> As priests we can go in to a place which is entirely beyond the ken of the natural man, and we can see how the full perfection of spiritual light is maintained by Christ, and that He is Himself the great and blessed Object on which all that light is concentrated in its holy purity.<a name=310:3></a>

		It is noticeable how the candlestick is spoken of more than once as "the pure candlestick" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#39:37">Exodus  39:37</a>; <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#24:4">Leviticus  24:4</a>), everything about it was pure; it was of pure gold, and the oil in its lamps was pure olive oil; it represents what is perfect and undimmed in Christ.<a name=310:4></a> The fulness and perfection of spiritual light is sustained in the holy place by Christ Himself through the night of His absence from the world.<a name=310:5></a> That is inside, and as priests we are privileged to go in to see it; then in our different localities we are called to correspond outside with what we have seen inside.<a name=310:6></a>

		It is evident that the object of the Lord in addressing the assemblies in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 was to bring about repentance and recovery.<a name=312:2></a> There is no suggestion in the seven epistles to the assemblies of His executing present judgment upon them; He speaks of what He will do if there is no repentance, but He ever speaks in the present with the object of producing repentance.<a name=312:3></a> Whatever has come in to dim the brightness of the golden lamps -- and much has come in -- the Lord points out that these things are to be the subject of repentance; and true repentance would mean recovery, so that the Lord's thought right through was recovery.<a name=312:4></a> I believe He is working now, in the last days, in a special way to recover not only individual saints to Himself personally, but to recover the golden lamp character in local assemblies; perhaps outwardly in a small way in a remnant, but as we have often been told, a remnant is a bit of the original, a remnant has a distinctive place as a reserved portion for the Lord.<a name=312:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A concordance will show us that the title Most High is more frequently found in the Psalms and in the book of Daniel than in any other parts of Scripture.<a name=317:5></a> The reason is simple.<a name=317:6></a> The Psalms very frequently anticipate the day when God will assert His title to earth as well as heaven -- when He will be publicly known as Most High (e.<a name=317:7></a>g.<a name=317:8></a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#47:2">Psalm  47:2</a>; <a href="../bible/@Psalm.htm#83:18">@Psalm  83:18</a>), and the writers by faith lay hold of God in this way though present events might seem to contradict the fact of God's supreme control.<a name=317:9></a> (e.<a name=317:10></a>g.<a name=317:11></a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73:11">Psalm  73:11</a>; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#77:10">Psalm  77:10</a> and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#83:18">Psalm  83:18</a>).<a name=317:12></a> In the book of Daniel we see how God hands over to a Gentile king the power of government, because His earthly people had failed; and Nebuchadnezzar has to learn that "the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#4:25">Daniel  4:25</a>).<a name=317:13></a>

		The next point which I dwelt upon was that of Christ as "the light of the world" (chapter 9: 5); and I showed that, by the very fact of His being the Light of the world, of necessity everything in regard to the world was tested.<a name=337:4></a> A dispensation marked by the presence of the Spirit could not be established until the world had been set aside; the world and the Spirit could not go on together.<a name=337:5></a> I dwelt on this in connection with the passage, "For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind" (chapter 9: 39); and I must say another word or two about the passage for it is so exceedingly important.<a name=337:6></a> The Jews were perfectly conscious that Christ was here in the ministry of grace.<a name=337:7></a> He gave them evidence that His mission here was to raise man up from every effect and consequence of sin.<a name=337:8></a> The Jew knew

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that; and I argue from it that he knew that the light that came in by Christ was the light of grace.<a name=338:1></a> The Jew had had the light of law and prophets, which was certainly light in darkness, but light only in measure; whereas in Christ the light was full, the light of grace.<a name=338:2></a> Law was intended to bring home to man the conviction of where he was as to his condition; but never raised him up out of it.<a name=338:3></a> You find that in chapter 5; law never raised up the man who had been helpless thirty-eight years; Christ raised him up.<a name=338:4></a> Thus the Jews knew that Christ was here in the ministry of grace.<a name=338:5></a> But although it was the light of grace, yet by the very fact of its being light, it of necessity exposed.<a name=338:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 8 it is shown that in the presence of Christ the Jew felt himself to be exposed; but as he did not care to be exposed, in result he rejects the light; in that sense he puts it out.<a name=338:7></a> And I can understand it very well, for on the one hand the Jew had no sense that the judgment of death was upon him, and on the other hand he believed in the competency of man.<a name=338:8></a> It is like plenty of people in the present day, they have no sense that the judgment of death is upon them, they attribute death to natural causes and ignore the judgment of God, and they believe in the competency of man's mind, just like the Jew.<a name=338:9></a> And therefore in the very nature of things they must reject light.<a name=338:10></a> In what follows in chapter 8 the Jew sets up all kinds of pretension; but he is exposed, and the Lord goes on patiently till the exposure is complete.<a name=338:11></a> They claimed to be the seed of

		Abraham and the children of God; but the Lord shows that there was no trace of moral resemblance between Abraham and them, or between God and them.<a name=339:1></a> Thus the Jew rejects revelation, that is, the word of Christ.<a name=339:2></a> But another thing follows on that, he rejects Christ's work, while declaring his inability to judge of it.<a name=339:3></a> If the work of grace is brought into the presence of people who reject revelation, they will account for it by some natural means, they will say the object of it is under some kind of delusion, or has turned religious, and so on, and in that way they refuse or discredit the evidence of Christ's work.<a name=339:4></a> But the result is this: "For judgment", the Lord says, "am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which see may become blind".<a name=339:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the second point.<a name=339:6></a> The first is that the time has come which is marked by the presence of the Spirit.<a name=339:7></a> The second, that the world has been tested by the light, and has rejected both the word and the work of Christ.<a name=339:8></a> Now consequent upon that, the Lord has formed something entirely new.<a name=339:9></a> He had come into the sheepfold and He leads the sheep out; they have not to go first, but He leads them out, and when He has led them out He goes before them like a shepherd.<a name=339:10></a> But further, He has other sheep which He must bring, and there is to be one flock and one shepherd.<a name=339:11></a> One flock living in the life of Christ: the flock lives in the life of the shepherd, that is the idea to me of the flock and the shepherd.<a name=339:12></a> I believe it is not fellowship, not a public association, but a vital unity, analogous to Paul's truth of the one body,

		I have gone over these scriptures because I thought it was needed, in order to lead on to the truth on which fellowship practically hangs, that is, the glory of the Lord: you must be led to the Lord, not only to know that Christ is the good Shepherd and knows His sheep, but that Christ is Lord.<a name=340:10></a> And the effect of the apprehension of Christ as Lord is that it

		We have to come back to what is seen in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>; the Lord as in the character of the Son of man is seen in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=344:6></a> I have no doubt that there is a reference in this to <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:9">Daniel  7:9</a>, 10, 13, 14: "I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, and its wheels burning fire.<a name=344:7></a> A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him .<a name=344:8></a>.<a name=344:9></a>.<a name=344:10></a> I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<a name=344:11></a> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consideration of this gives great force to the fact that the Lord is seen in the midst of the golden lamps in the character of the Son of man; indeed the characteristics of the Ancient of days and the Son of man seem to be blended in Him as thus seen; Daniel tells us that the Son of man reached unto the Ancient of days (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:13">Daniel  7:13</a>, footnote <i>b</i>).<a name=345:2></a> The Ancient of days is seen sitting in judgment; when that comes to pass we may be sure that everything will be dealt with according to the majesty of the One who sits; then the Son of man comes and is brought near as One who reaches to the Ancient of days -- how wonderful!<a name=345:3></a> It implies that His judgment of every-thing is equal to that of Him who sits in judgment.<a name=345:4></a> None but One who was Himself a divine Person could reach to the Ancient of days; it is One who is eternally divine who now as like the Son of man stands and walks in the midst of the local assemblies.<a name=345:5></a>

		We may be sure that He does not pass over anything that is displeasing to Him; nothing can be hidden from His eyes.<a name=346:4></a> But why this searching scrutiny?<a name=346:5></a> It is because He will have His saints as to their moral judgment of things in correspondence with Himself.<a name=346:6></a> He is concerned to have the local assemblies in correspondence with Himself.<a name=346:7></a> His judgment is to be their judgment; what He com-mends they are to commend; what He disapproves of they are to disapprove of -- that is clearly what is in view in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3; the Lord would have the local assemblies in accord with Himself.<a name=346:8></a>

		There is another beautiful touch in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:10">Daniel  7:10</a>, "thousand thousands ministered unto him".<a name=347:3></a> I do not think this is a company of angels, but of men; men ministering to the Ancient of days as being in correspondence with His pleasure!<a name=347:4></a> Think of the moral greatness of this.<a name=347:5></a> In that day of holy judgment there are seen thousand thousands who minister to the Ancient of days.<a name=347:6></a> Now the Lord seems to say, I want that to be anticipated in the local assemblies; nothing will satisfy Me but that; you are to minister to My pleasure by judging all that I judge, and approving all that I approve.<a name=347:7></a> That would be a great ministry of the local assemblies to the Lord; it needs to be worked out in one detail after another until all obscuring elements are discerned and judged, and the golden lamp is purified so as to stand in its true character locally.<a name=347:8></a>

		As Son of God, He is the last Adam; He is victorious over death, and a life-giving Spirit; that is what "the Son of God" conveys.<a name=371:2></a> It was proved very distinctly in the resurrection of Lazarus that He had complete authority over death, that is the first point (as now He says in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:18">Revelation  1:18</a>, "I .<a name=371:3></a>.<a name=371:4></a>.<a name=371:5></a> have the keys of death and of hades"); and secondly, He raises man up in life.<a name=371:6></a> Those are two things which belong properly to the Son of God; and they are not equivalent, because it is one thing to set death aside, and another to raise man up.<a name=371:7></a> Death had to be set aside for man as the judgment of God; but then man needs to be raised up in life, like the paralytic at the pool of Bethesda (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:1">John  5:1</a> - 9).<a name=371:8></a> But in order that man may be raised up, the sentence of death must first be taken off him, and both things belong to the Son of God; He effects both; it is His office, His place as last Adam.<a name=371:9></a> Death came in by the first Adam, death is set aside by the last Adam; and He is a life-giving Spirit.<a name=371:10></a> That is what is connected with the Son of God, and is illustrated in the resurrection of Lazarus.<a name=371:11></a> How did He put death aside?<a name=371:12></a> By Himself dying.<a name=371:13></a> "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone"; He puts sin away by the sacrifice of Himself, and He goes into death in order that He may annul death, and He has "brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a>).<a name=371:14></a> I do not say He always raises man up in the same way; the Christian is raised up in one way, according to the Lord's word in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, "an

		Now, as I said before, we get in chapter 10 vital unity, and in chapter 12 the glory of the Lord as the true basis of christian fellowship down here; that is, that in the revelation of His glory, we get the point of gathering, the proper basis of our fellowship.<a name=376:6></a> As I said before, the general principle of John is to take the opposite order to Paul.<a name=376:7></a> Paul would give us first what is connected with the Lord, and then the truth of the body; John gives us first what is essential, the truth of the flock and the Shepherd, and then the glory of the Lord as the gathering point for saints down here.<a name=376:8></a>
