		These scriptures speak of different persons and their thoughts about those to follow them.<a name=1:2></a> Of Abraham God says, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him".<a name=1:3></a> I want to say a word about "after him".<a name=1:4></a> What is going to be after you?<a name=1:5></a> What is going to be after me?<a name=1:6></a> These scriptures, I think, all bear upon that question.<a name=1:7></a>

		Abraham was a remarkable man.<a name=1:8></a> Stephen says, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia … and said to him, Go out of thy land and out of thy kindred, and come into the land which I will shew thee" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:2">Acts  7:2</a>, 3).<a name=1:9></a> What an impression Abraham must have received of God in all His greatness!<a name=1:10></a> Glory has been defined as moral excellence in display, and it was displayed in Abraham.<a name=1:11></a> By faith he answered to the call of God, and what marked him was strangership.<a name=1:12></a> He was prepared just to be a sojourner; he had his tent, and he built his altars.<a name=1:13></a> These are remarkable features which suggest to us that the believer is not of this world.<a name=1:14></a> So those that are to follow us, according to the Lord's mind and will, are those that are free of this world -- they have seen the God of glory, and something of the greatness and glory of God and of His thoughts.<a name=1:15></a> They are prepared to leave everything here -- their own country.<a name=1:16></a>

		Abraham to leave his own country, not knowing where he was going, but he had faith in God, and light in his soul.<a name=2:1></a> It says that "he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is the artificer and constructor" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:10">Hebrews  11:10</a>).<a name=2:2></a> Abraham was a sojourner, but faith operated with him.<a name=2:3></a> Righteousness was accounted to Abraham because he believed God (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:6">Genesis  15:6</a>), and the glad tidings have come to us and we have believed what has been presented to us by God in His beloved Son, our blessed Saviour.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah had said to Abraham, "I will make of thee a great nation" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:2">Genesis  12:2</a>), and Abraham was very concerned as to who was going to follow after him.<a name=2:5></a> How was it that he was going to have a generation to follow him?<a name=2:6></a> He was old, his wife was old, the outlook on the line of nature looked hopeless, but he had faith in God.<a name=2:7></a> He commanded his household with that faith too, and he got light from God that there would be those after him.<a name=2:8></a> I would like you to consider those two words, 'after him', and consider what will be after you.<a name=2:9></a> "Abraham", it says, "dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:9">Hebrews  11:9</a>).<a name=2:10></a> What a wonderful example they had in Abraham!<a name=2:11></a> Abraham had believed God; he had faith in God that there would be those after him that were according to God.<a name=2:12></a> I think that should be an encouragement to us at the present time.<a name=2:13></a>

		King David had the desire "to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and for the footstool of our God", a resting place for God here on earth.<a name=3:5></a> That is what the house of God is, and, as believers, we form part of that house, as Peter says, we "are being built up a spiritual house" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>).<a name=3:6></a> I love to think of what God will dwell in -- a company of those who love Him, who are the fruit of His wondrous work.<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So David, it says, "stood up upon his feet" and Jehovah "said to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.<a name=3:8></a> And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be firm to do my commandments and mine ordinances … And now … keep and seek for all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess the good land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you for ever".<a name=3:9></a> What are you going to leave to your children after you?<a name=3:10></a> Thank God, most of us have had godly parents -- that is a wonderful blessing -- who

		had us baptised, and in their measure sought to keep us true to our baptism, that is, apart from this world, in view of entering God's world.<a name=4:1></a> Here Israel was to have "children after you for ever".<a name=4:2></a> There would be a generation following David, and there was, too.<a name=4:3></a> It came right down to Christ.<a name=4:4></a> The Lord "has sprung out of Judah" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:14">Hebrews  7:14</a>), the royal tribe, the tribe from which there was to be praise continually to God.<a name=4:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And thou, Solomon my son", David says, "know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searches all hearts, and discerns all the imaginations of the thoughts.<a name=4:6></a> If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cut thee off for ever.<a name=4:7></a> Consider now, that Jehovah has chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it".<a name=4:8></a> This scripture comes from God to me and to you.<a name=4:9></a> What are we doing?<a name=4:10></a> There is work to be done to provide a dwelling place for God, to provide for His own praise and response in a world that is increasingly living its life without God.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are plenty of altars raised up to "the unknown God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:23">Acts  17:23</a>).<a name=4:12></a> Men do not know God; it is very solemn.<a name=4:13></a> But in the midst of the circumstances in which we are living, there is what God is going to reserve for Himself, for His own praise and His own delight.<a name=4:14></a> Satan is the god and prince of this world, but God is going to have the victory, and He is getting it now.<a name=4:15></a> You say, 'I am the only brother in the meeting'.<a name=4:16></a> God has got the victory.<a name=4:17></a> He has got a note of praise here in the enemy's domain -- a wonderful triumph

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David says to these responsible persons (princes, captains, mighty men, etc.<a name=5:4></a>), those who should continue after him, that they should "keep and seek for all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess the good land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you for ever".<a name=5:5></a> They were to seek for the commandments of Jehovah, that they might possess the good land and leave it as an inheritance.<a name=5:6></a> The principles of God and the truth are to be valued and practised today, too.<a name=5:7></a>

		The assembly is a wonderful vessel, "the pillar and base of the truth" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=5:8></a> Think of what is expressed in the assembly, a vessel that understands something of the divine mind, not only the love of Christ in all its supremacy and greatness.<a name=5:9></a> What a vessel the assembly is!<a name=5:10></a> It knows what is in the mind of God.<a name=5:11></a> It is the waiting time now, before the Lord actually comes at the rapture.<a name=5:12></a> God knows that, and He knows that evil is going to reach a very great height in this world, and God will deal with it in His supremacy.<a name=5:13></a> But in the meantime, He has those in whom He has sovereignly wrought and He gets the victory through them, and may you be one of them.<a name=5:14></a>

		Now, the question is, What are you doing with your life?<a name=5:15></a> What is the imagination of your heart?<a name=5:16></a> What are you thinking?<a name=5:17></a> Even as we read these scriptures, I trust you will be encouraged to arise and do

		what is necessary.<a name=6:1></a> There are things to be <i>done</i> in our localities, and difficult some of them may be.<a name=6:2></a> I would encourage all to continue in exercise and to be fellow-workers with God.<a name=6:3></a> He has formed this wonderful vessel, the assembly, for His pleasure, for His praise and for the comfort of the heart of Christ, and He is going to display in the world to come His own glory.<a name=6:4></a> The assembly will come down, "out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:10">Revelation  21:10</a>).<a name=6:5></a> Now what is of God is being formed in your soul and mine in view of the day of display.<a name=6:6></a> The Spirit has been given to us to magnify Christ continually in our hearts.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I read the passage in 2 Timothy because it applies particularly in our day.<a name=6:8></a> Timothy was Paul's "true child in faith" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:2">1 Timothy  1:2</a>), and Paul had come to the end of his life here.<a name=6:9></a> He was about to be poured out.<a name=6:10></a> It is remarkable that Paul, though, I suppose, he was to be martyred, yet he says to Timothy, "Luke alone is with me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>).<a name=6:11></a> Paul had Luke there with him; someone to carry on after him, a remarkable thing.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the word here is to Timothy, a young brother: "Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=6:13></a> And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men".<a name=6:14></a> Paul was concerned about who should follow after him in the testimony, that they should be faithful men.<a name=6:15></a> He could trust Timothy; indeed he could.<a name=6:16></a> He did not know any one like him: "I have no one like-minded who will care

		with genuine feeling how ye get on" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:20">Philippians  2:20</a>).<a name=7:1></a> Oh!<a name=7:2></a> how Paul was affected by the light he had as to what the assembly was to the heart of Christ.<a name=7:3></a> But he had someone who was concerned as to how the saints got on.<a name=7:4></a> But it is a question of how things are to continue.<a name=7:5></a> And so he says to Timothy, "the things thou hast heard of me … these entrust to faithful men".<a name=7:6></a> Is that the end?<a name=7:7></a> No, "such as shall be competent to instruct others also".<a name=7:8></a> Paul desired that faithful men should be entrusted with the ministry the Lord had given to him as to the assembly, and sonship -- blessed relationship!<a name=7:9></a> -- and the knowledge of God as Father.<a name=7:10></a> Oh!<a name=7:11></a> how great is the truth that has come to the saints through the beloved apostle Paul.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is the enemy attempting to do at the present time?<a name=7:13></a> -- everything possible that is contrary to Paul's teaching.<a name=7:14></a> Many Christians are ignoring Paul's writings.<a name=7:15></a> Thank God there are faithful men who do not, but, in the major part of the public testimony of Christianity, Paul is increasingly given up in thought and in practice.<a name=7:16></a> It makes one feel that the coming of the Lord is very near, and He will have those who are faithful at the rapture.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul is exhorting Timothy here how to pass on "the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses".<a name=7:18></a> It is not merely that we should give interested persons a book of ministry, but that our love for the truth may be evidenced in our lives, that we have learned from Paul's life of sacrifice and suffering in his service to the Lord and the saints.<a name=7:19></a> Yet Paul was marked by buoyancy of spirit.<a name=7:20></a> The

		Holy Spirit kept him above all the adversity that he had to face, and so he goes through in triumph: "the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day"; and he adds, "but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:8">2 Timothy  4:8</a>).<a name=8:1></a> There are some others besides Paul.<a name=8:2></a> If he was passing out by way of death, as he did, there were still those who would love the appearing of Christ.<a name=8:3></a> I think we need to love the appearing of Christ more -- then we shall see Him, displayed in His glory!<a name=8:4></a> The King of glory will come in; He will reign supreme, having put down every opposition of evil that exists in the world.<a name=8:5></a> The will of God will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; but with the believer, the will of God is to be done now, as it is in heaven.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Parents need to be exercised that their children are brought up true to their baptism.<a name=8:7></a> Baptism means that the child baptised is put out of sight in the waters of death.<a name=8:8></a> How then can you wish that your child should grow up and get to the top of his or her vocation?<a name=8:9></a> and to get a nice big salary?<a name=8:10></a> That is not consistent, and young persons need to be instructed so that they may not lose their way spiritually.<a name=8:11></a> You say, I have to get my bread and butter.<a name=8:12></a> God will help you with that, but He will not help if you want anything great here in this world.<a name=8:13></a> Bear a straight word, but it is very necessary because what is being taught in the schools is that you must develop your potential.<a name=8:14></a> The only potential that fallen man has got is to sin; I can tell you that, for I know my own soul.<a name=8:15></a> But God has

		worked in your soul, despite what you are by nature.<a name=9:1></a> He has given you the Holy Spirit, dear fellow-believer, and the Spirit promotes desires after Christ and desires after God, and will help you to be faithful to divine Persons in a scene of unfaithfulness at the present time.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul writes to Timothy, exhorting him to be a "good soldier of Jesus Christ", one who does not entangle "himself with the affairs of life" so that "he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier".<a name=9:3></a> Good soldiers of Jesus Christ are needed today, those who are willing to take their "share in suffering" -- it means the setting aside of what I might legitimately occupy my time with, and give a little more time to the Lord Jesus and to His things, and to private communion with Him.<a name=9:4></a> And that will bear fruit that will abide, and you will have something to pass on to those who follow after.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, the Lord Jesus was about to go into death and He is speaking anticipatively to the Father.<a name=9:6></a> This is the Lord's prayer in chapter 17 of John.<a name=9:7></a> The apostles had been given to Christ by the Father -- "those whom thou hast given me" -- and the Lord says, "I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee.<a name=9:8></a> Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we".<a name=9:9></a> We long that that feature of love amongst ourselves and unity might be seen in testimony, and the Spirit is here to help that desire of Christ's being fulfilled at the present time.<a name=9:10></a> It is very precious what the Lord says, "When I was with them
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I kept them in thy name".<a name=10:1></a> It is very wonderful, the Lord's personal service.<a name=10:2></a> There is no change in the Person of Christ; He is still the same.<a name=10:3></a> He will keep you and He will keep those who follow after you, too.<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of what He received immediately, after His death and resurrection -- His own, His brethren -- and of what He had here on earth at the beginning of the Acts.<a name=10:5></a> "All that believed were together, and had all things common …" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:44">Acts  2:44</a>) -- they were all one, remarkable fruit of the coming of the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:6></a> There was a united company and a most powerful testimony, and there were additions to it.<a name=10:7></a> It is nearly two thousand years since Pentecost, but the work of God is still going on, and may this be true in your soul and in mine.<a name=10:8></a> May we take every opportunity to increase in the knowledge of God and of the truth, and may we not only have things mentally, but practise them, too.<a name=10:9></a> That comes about through personal communion with the Lord Jesus.<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May we be helped to realise that the testimony of God continues.<a name=10:11></a> It is very important that we keep things morally according to God, that we may be truly here for Him.<a name=10:12></a> May it be so, for His Name's sake!<a name=10:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next point I notice is the effect that Joseph's testimony had upon his brethren.<a name=11:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:9">Acts  7:9</a> we read, "And the patriarchs, envying Joseph, sold him away into Egypt.<a name=11:3></a> And God was with him".<a name=11:4></a> The motive that actuated them is thus plain enough, "they hated him, and could not greet him with friendliness", their hatred intensified.<a name=11:5></a> Now the truth is this: their ways were evil, and Joseph had told their father of their evil deeds, and they hated him.<a name=11:6></a> Their ways were evil; there is the secret of man's perversity, he will not come to the light because his deeds are evil.<a name=11:7></a> There was light with Joseph, and they cast him out, but it was God's way for their preservation.<a name=11:8></a> Joseph was to be their preserver, if they had only known it.<a name=11:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can suppose that envy and hatred spring from good works.<a name=11:10></a> But Joseph's brethren were short-sighted in what they did to Joseph … but we find the same principle true in the Jews in connection with Christ.<a name=11:11></a> Why did not the Jews receive the testimony of God?<a name=11:12></a> Why did they not welcome the light?<a name=11:13></a> The Lord gave abundant proof that He came from God; there was the most complete presentation of God to man: "in him all the fulness … was pleased to dwell" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:19">Colossians  1:19</a>).<a name=11:14></a> The presentation was complete; the Lord could say, "they have both seen and hated both me and my Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a> 24); the Father dwelt in Him, and He did the works.<a name=11:15></a> He was a Man,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the works of Christ were expressive of divine goodness, of perfect grace; the only miracle which had any other character was the cursing of the fig-tree (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#11">Mark  11</a>), and that had of necessity to come to pass, but other miracles were for the relieving of man from the pressure which rested upon him down here.<a name=12:3></a> "Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me?<a name=12:4></a>" and they say, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for <i>blasphemy</i>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:32">John  10:32</a>, 33)!<a name=12:5></a> He said that He was the Son of God; but had He not given evidence of it?<a name=12:6></a> There was most abundant testimony that He was the Son of God, but in spite of the testimony of His works, and of the Father's testimony to Him, they saw and hated both Him and His Father.<a name=12:7></a> Why did they hate Him?<a name=12:8></a> Because their own deeds were evil.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men will justify envy, but do you think that envy ever springs from good?<a name=12:10></a> Could there be such a thing as envy with God or with Christ?<a name=12:11></a> It is totally impossible.<a name=12:12></a> Envy is a work of evil; if evil were not existing there would be no such thing as envy in this world.<a name=12:13></a> A holy angel does not envy, simply because it is a holy angel.<a name=12:14></a>

		But, as was the case with the brethren of Joseph, the Jews paved the way for their own weakness; Christ was their strength, if they had only known it.<a name=12:15></a> He had become identified with them in being born among them, "of whom, as according to flesh, is the

		Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>); He was their strength, but they did not know it, and the consequence was that when they cast Him out they had to prove their own weakness; they fell to pieces.<a name=13:1></a> It is remarkable with regard to the disciples, that when a traitor came to light among them they became weak: "all the disciples left him and fled" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:56">Matthew  26:56</a>), they proved their weakness.<a name=13:2></a> I refer to it because it shows that this principle runs through Scripture, and things repeat themselves remarkably.<a name=13:3></a>

		But in the latter part of verse 9 (of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>) we have the significant clause, "And God was with him"; in all the discipline through which Joseph went, God was with him .<a name=13:4></a>.<a name=13:5></a>.<a name=13:6></a> We are told that Joseph was apart from the evil of his brethren, but if Joseph is to be exalted, it is needful that he should be passed through exercise.<a name=13:7></a> Very often we do not know our own motives: even in condemning evil it is difficult to distinguish our motives; we have to be taught the difference between good and evil; many things pass muster as good, but one is not so sure about the motives in them.<a name=13:8></a> But the object of discipline is that we may discern between good and evil.<a name=13:9></a> We see this in the case of Job.<a name=13:10></a> It is great grace on the part of God that He should see fit to pass His people through exercise with this object.<a name=13:11></a> In any study in this world, whether it be art, or literature, or anything else, a man must be trained.<a name=13:12></a> Supposing I am taken to a gallery where there are many wonderful pictures, but among them some that are mere daubs; if I have not my senses exercised I may make great mistakes in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Joseph has to learn a very bitter lesson with his brethren, and it must have taught Joseph complete distrust of himself, but Joseph is not soured; when <i>God</i> is dealing with a man in discipline, and the man accepts it, that man is not soured.<a name=14:3></a> I do not know anything that has a worse effect on people than trials in which God is not with them; but on the other hand, if God is with them they are great gainers, and they have their senses exercised.<a name=14:4></a> Why should anything down here sour a Christian?<a name=14:5></a> Supposing I am soured by the treatment of my kindred, or of fellow-christians.<a name=14:6></a> <i>Who</i> is soured?<a name=14:7></a> <i>What</i> is soured?<a name=14:8></a> It proves that there is something in me that may be soured; but we are exhorted, "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:21">Romans  12:21</a>); and the end of discipline is that we may overcome in the power of good.<a name=14:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I see as a principle in the ways of God is, that if God is going to give deliverance, it must begin from Egypt.<a name=15:2></a> It was so with Israel, and it is so with us; that is the starting-point of every man.<a name=15:3></a> We have to realise that we are in Egypt, where God first begins to deal with man.<a name=15:4></a> Israel had to go down into Egypt, and it was there that they began to multiply; and it is from Egypt that God delivered them.<a name=15:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God delivers Joseph, and puts him out of reach of the machinations of his brethren.<a name=15:6></a> So God has set Christ in a place outside of all the hatred and malignity of men.<a name=15:7></a> God raised Him from the dead, and in resurrection He was set in a wealthy place.<a name=15:8></a> God has set Him in a place where man cannot come.<a name=15:9></a> The brethren of Joseph could do no more against him when he went down into Egypt.<a name=15:10></a> In the case of the Lord, the Jews were restrained for a long time, until the close of His pathway; then certain things were allowed, but God delivers Him.<a name=15:11></a> You read in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>the list of enemies, but "from the horns of the buffaloes hast thou answered me" (verse 21).<a name=15:12></a> God delivered Christ, and set Him in a wealthy place, as I understand it, in <i>resurrection</i>.<a name=15:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing which could not be typified in Joseph, that, as being set in that wealthy place, Christ has power to subdue all things to Himself; <i>one</i> Man in resurrection is better than a world of men under death.<a name=15:14></a> Christ in resurrection is not only superior to all as being there, but exercises the

	<div class="paragraph">
		And what of the Jews?<a name=16:4></a> They have become disunited and scattered.<a name=16:5></a> It was an evil day for Joseph's brethren when they sold their brother into Egypt; it was an evil day for the Jews when they refused Christ, when they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:38">Matthew  21:38</a>).<a name=16:6></a> They never did seize on His inheritance; they were scattered abroad, and are suffering under the penalty of their rejection of Christ to this day.<a name=16:7></a> They will come eventually into their blessing on the ground of the sovereignty of God's mercy, but they will have to recognise Him in resurrection whom they pierced.<a name=16:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The important thing for us is that our souls might be in the light of the glory of the Lord, that we should appreciate the greatness of the place in which God has set Him.<a name=16:9></a> The right hand of God is far above all things; and that is where we are privileged to know Christ.<a name=16:10></a> All the gifts have come down from Christ, at the right hand of God, and we are in the light of Christ <i>there</i>.<a name=16:11></a> He is set down "up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a> 10).<a name=16:12></a> It is a <i>great</i> place where Christ is set, where what is of sin, and of the flesh, and of Satan's power cannot come; they cannot touch what is of

		I have taken up these few points in the chapter that we may see in them a portraiture of Christ, and I do not think that I have strained the truth at all, for Scripture has given us evidence that Joseph is presented to us as a striking type of Christ Himself, especially in His relations to Israel.<a name=17:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in turning to 1 Chronicles I wanted to amplify this a bit, because I think the men of Issachar are like Ephesian Christians.<a name=18:1></a> It is said of them that they "had understanding of the times".<a name=18:2></a> It is not now that they redeemed the time, or that the time was short, but that they understood the times; and so I just seek to enlarge on this point because understanding is so important, otherwise, what we do we may do amiss.<a name=18:3></a> They had understanding of the times, it says, "to know what Israel ought to do".<a name=18:4></a> In other words, it is a question now of assembly obligations.<a name=18:5></a> It is not simply what <i>I</i> do, it is what <i>Israel</i> ought to do; and, may I inquire, dear brethren, as to whether we are accustomed to view the saints, and clothe the saints, with assembly thoughts?<a name=18:6></a> If I meet a saint I am to clothe him, as it were, with assembly thoughts; if I meet two or more saints I clothe them in the same way.<a name=18:7></a> In other words, I have understanding of the time and I apprehend what Israel -- that is, the assembly, speaking in christian language -- what the assembly ought to do.<a name=18:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I dwell on this thought of understanding, and, in order to make it clear, I would refer to Daniel.<a name=18:9></a> Daniel, in chapter 9: 2, tells us that he "understood by the books".<a name=18:10></a> Now I do not urge you to read everything, but it is important to <i>read</i>.<a name=18:11></a> We read of Ezra as "a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given"

		(<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#7">Ezra  7</a> 6).<a name=19:1></a> I would be disposed to read anything that Ezra wrote.<a name=19:2></a> I am not saying that Daniel acquired his knowledge by such literature (he speaks of <i>the</i> books, the Scriptures) as may have been written to meet the local need of the saints, but I have no doubt that Daniel would gladly read any helpful production, and if you cannot <i>hear</i> a man whom God has qualified to minister, then do not despise what he may <i>write</i>, for God uses scribes.<a name=19:3></a> There was a scribe in David's regime; there was a chronicler also.<a name=19:4></a> The scribe, or secretary, was a man who would write down at the king's mouth what the king might wish to communicate.<a name=19:5></a> Such a man is of great importance, especially in a day like the present, when the saints are so widely scattered, and many isolated.<a name=19:6></a> The preacher in Ecclesiastes indicates the exercises of one employed in this service.<a name=19:7></a> He says: "The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words; and that which was written is upright, words of truth" (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12:10">Ecclesiastes  12:10</a>).<a name=19:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit has given much for the people of God, and it is for us to get the benefit of what is available.<a name=19:9></a> So it says, "The words of the wise are as goads, and the collection of them as nails fastened in: they are given from one shepherd" (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12:11">Ecclesiastes  12:11</a>).<a name=19:10></a> There are words of wisdom, words of truth, carefully set down as food for the saints.<a name=19:11></a> Well now, Daniel said he understood by books, and by these books he gathered that there were certain time limitations, seventy years, and then there should be a return of the captivity.<a name=19:12></a> We gather the mind of God in this way

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been speaking about reading.<a name=20:3></a> Now I would urge prayer; so let us turn, for a moment, to the book of Daniel.<a name=20:4></a> It says, "In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans, in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years" (chapter 9: 1, 2).<a name=20:5></a> Thus he acquired an "understanding of the times".<a name=20:6></a> And now he says, "I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes; and I prayed" (verses 3, 4).<a name=20:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How much do we pray, dear brethren?<a name=20:8></a> I have been speaking about reading, but I ask, How much do we pray, and how far do we travel in our prayers?<a name=20:9></a> The more you are with God the wider shall become the area covered by your prayers, until the whole household of faith is embraced, and indeed "all men".<a name=20:10></a> Do not be satisfied with your prayers until you, as it were, cover the whole household of faith.<a name=20:11></a> As Scripture enjoins: "praying at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:18">Ephesians  6:18</a>).<a name=20:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a wonderful experience that was!<a name=21:2></a> It was about the time of the evening oblation, and was what his prayer was.<a name=21:3></a> It was an oblation; it ascended to God.<a name=21:4></a> And so Gabriel speaks to him: "He informed me, and talked with me" (verse 22).<a name=21:5></a> Is it not worth while to pray?<a name=21:6></a> Pray on, until you, as it were, receive a divine communication.<a name=21:7></a> Something from the Lord will come into your soul.<a name=21:8></a> "He informed me", Daniel says, "and talked with me".<a name=21:9></a> Those of us here who have had to do with God in prayer know something about this.<a name=21:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful experience to have to say to God, and as you pray and embrace the saints in your prayers, you get an impression from God; you become assured He has heard you.<a name=21:11></a> "If we know that he hears us … we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:15">1 John  5:15</a>).<a name=21:12></a> It is inexpressibly precious to be conscious that God hears us.<a name=21:13></a> And then it says further, "and said, Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding" (verse 22).<a name=21:14></a> These things are all within our reach.<a name=21:15></a> Is there any young brother here who desires to have the mind of God?<a name=21:16></a> "Think of what I say", says Paul, "for the Lord will give thee understanding"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in the judgment of our blessed and adorable Lord, the glory of God took precedence of every other consideration.<a name=39:3></a> Neither personal affection nor personal fear had the smallest sway over His movements.<a name=39:4></a> He was ruled, in all things, by the glory of God.<a name=39:5></a> From the manger to the cross, in life and in death, in all His words, and all His works, and all His ways, His devoted heart was set, with firm and unalterable purpose, upon the glory of God.<a name=39:6></a> Hence, though it might be a good thing to relieve a friend in distress, it was far better and higher to glorify God; and we may rest assured that the beloved family of Bethany sustained no loss by a delay which only made room for the brighter outshining of the divine glory.<a name=39:7></a>

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak of the personal influence of Christ upon five individuals: upon the man who had a legion of demons; upon Mary of Bethany; upon Peter; upon John; and upon Paul.<a name=41:2></a> The influence of Christ shows itself in the first case in subjection and sobriety; in Mary in intelligence; in Peter in serving love, Peter taking it on and enjoining it on others; in John in restful love; and in Paul in purpose of heart to acquire and take on heavenly excellence, that which is most excellent.<a name=41:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe all these things should be found in the assembly, but there cannot be anything found in the assembly that is not found in the individuals who compose it, and hence the need that each of us should be concerned as to how far we keep ourselves under the influence of Christ.<a name=41:4></a> There is no greater power in the universe than the influence of Christ.<a name=41:5></a> It is a great thing, dear brethren, to understand it: it is a most transforming influence, that exceeds, and ever will exceed, all others, the influence of Christ.<a name=41:6></a> His influence over millions is tremendous, and eternal in its results, and I believe God effects what He is working out in the saints now, by way of the personal influence of Christ brought to bear upon them by the Holy Spirit.<a name=41:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the man in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8">Luke  8</a>presents the effect of that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=42>[Page 42]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		influence on a man who was in a complete sense under the power and influence of evil.<a name=42:1></a> He was possessed by a legion of demons.<a name=42:2></a> He thus represents an extreme case, a case that is not intended, so to speak, to be representative of us all -- for one would not dare to say that any one here was under the influence of a demon, far less of a legion of them -- but at the same time, he presents an extreme case of a man under the influence of evil, in order to show that, what the Lord can do in an extreme case, He can do in every other case that is less extreme; and every one of us has to recognise that in some degree at least, each one is under the influence of evil until he or she is brought to do with the Lord.<a name=42:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then what comes to light is that not only was the power of evil in that man completely dispossessed, but that he came in an effective and transforming way under the personal influence of Christ.<a name=42:4></a> That is what God intends for every one of us, that we should be brought abidingly under the influence of Christ.<a name=42:5></a> It says that they went out and saw the man, out of whom the demons had been cast, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and sensible.<a name=42:6></a> The idea of sensible here is not so much the idea of intelligence as rather that he was sober, having a sober estimate of himself.<a name=42:7></a> Each one of us needs that, dear brethren, for naturally each one of us likes his own will and in some degree or other has high thoughts of himself.<a name=42:8></a> With some it may be more pronounced than with others, with some it may be more secret than with others, but I think every one here will acknowledge
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that it is natural to us, until we are brought into touch with Christ, to like our own will and to have high thoughts of ourselves.<a name=43:1></a> Now, the effect of the grace of God reaching us in Christ is to deliver us from all that.<a name=43:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think one of the earliest results of grace being rightly apprehended is that we are delivered from every element of self-will.<a name=43:3></a> We present our bodies, as it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service" (verse 1).<a name=43:4></a> The Lord came in, that that might be secured in every one of His own.<a name=43:5></a> He came in, as it says figuratively in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>, with His body (see footnote <i>b</i>, verse 3): I am referring to the Hebrew bondman.<a name=43:6></a> The Lord would thus, as having taken a body in which He was devoted to God's will, saying He delighted in it, set out the true idea of a human body held here for the will of God.<a name=43:7></a> He obtains His place in each heart to secure that result.<a name=43:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing to think how transforming the influence of Christ is; there is nothing so affecting as His personal influence.<a name=43:9></a> And, as we begin to take account of what Paul says in relation to the Lord Jesus -- "who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:6">Philippians  2:6</a>, 7) -- it is likely to have a subduing and transforming effect upon us.<a name=43:10></a> There is a certain moral excellence, dear brethren, in being here for the will of God, as well as its being our intelligent service, the only right answer to the grace

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that has reached us.<a name=44:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So this man was sitting at the feet of Jesus; he was delivered from the power of evil and in subjection to Christ.<a name=44:2></a> But then, as a result of coming under the influence of Christ, we become sober.<a name=44:3></a> We do not begin to have high thoughts about ourselves, the cross of Christ has its right place in our hearts, and we begin to take account of things in the light of that.<a name=44:4></a> We say to ourselves that our old man has been crucified with Him (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:6">Romans  6:6</a>).<a name=44:5></a> That is the effect in our hearts of contemplating the cross of Christ, so that high thoughts are written off.<a name=44:6></a> There is not only the cross of Christ, but there is the mind which was in Christ Jesus, of which we have been speaking.<a name=44:7></a> If one begins to have thoughts of obtaining a reputation for oneself, the Spirit of God reminds one of Him who made Himself of <i>no</i> reputation, and God has highly exalted Him.<a name=44:8></a> God has given Him all the reputation that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.<a name=44:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is these things presented to our hearts in Christ personally that have a definitely formative, subduing effect upon us.<a name=44:10></a> We have sober thoughts, not having high thoughts of ourselves, as it says in Romans: "as God has dealt to each a measure of faith" (chapter 12: 3).<a name=44:11></a> We are not to think nothing of ourselves, because we recognise that God is working in us, and when God begins to work we are not worth nothing!<a name=44:12></a> We are intended to work into the divine plan, but we have sober thoughts of ourselves according as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.<a name=44:13></a> Now that, I believe,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is what is illustrated in the man who was possessed with a legion of demons: they found him sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind.<a name=45:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with Mary of Bethany what is seen in her is that characteristically she sat at Jesus' feet and listened to His word.<a name=45:2></a> The Lord says of her that "Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her".<a name=45:3></a> It is very important, beloved brethren, that we cultivate the habit of listening to the word of Christ, because I do not know any way in which we shall become intelligent spiritually save as listening to the word of Christ.<a name=45:4></a> All divine wisdom is in Christ, all fulness is in Him, and the assembly is to derive from Him.<a name=45:5></a> Mary had grasped the idea; that is, in its application to us, it is not only that we read the Scriptures and the ministry and attend the meetings, but is it our exercise that the Lord will speak to us in it, that in it we will hear the Lord's voice.<a name=45:6></a> Are we cultivating sober thoughts, so that there is an opportunity for the Lord to speak to us?<a name=45:7></a> That is what is so important.<a name=45:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Himself, as having come in as Man to serve God, moved on the principle that His ear was opened morning by morning to hear as the instructed (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:4">Isaiah  50:4</a>).<a name=45:9></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>provides us with certain features which are to be found marking each local company.<a name=45:10></a> The chapter begins with the Lord sending out seventy to every city and place where He Himself was about to come.<a name=45:11></a> That is, cities and places were in mind, and the Lord was intending that the ministry of the seventy would come under His review as to its
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		effects when He Himself would come to the place to see what results there were.<a name=46:1></a> The chapter gives various characteristics that are to be found in local companies; it is stated, for instance, that there is to be the rejoicing that our names are written in the heavens (verse 20).<a name=46:2></a> That is, we are to rejoice in our heavenly portion, so distinctive, and to praise the Father accordingly; then the spirit of care is to be there.<a name=46:3></a> The Good Samaritan took up the man whom He found and brought him to the inn, and took care of him, and then, in leaving, indicated that any amount of care may be expended upon the saints and the Lord will see that those who do so are repaid.<a name=46:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there is also the incident as to Mary, which shows that spiritual intelligence is also to be a feature of each local company, sitting at Jesus' feet and listening to His word, and no one is to deprive us of that.<a name=46:5></a> Martha was cumbered with much serving.<a name=46:6></a> It is a right thing to desire to serve the Lord and we are to be active in it, always abounding in the work of the Lord, which applies to us all.<a name=46:7></a> It does not only apply to gift, but is addressed to the brethren, but at the same time as abounding in service we are also to preserve a balance, and to see that our activities of service do not deprive us of sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening to His word.<a name=46:8></a> Only in that way can the intelligence that God looks for in the assembly, be learned.<a name=46:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Peter in his epistle shows, I think, how much he had been affected by the way Christ has served.<a name=46:10></a> It is worthy of note that Peter as an elder
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		enjoins on his fellow elders, and says, "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am their fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also am partaker of the glory about to be revealed: shepherd the flock of God which is among you".<a name=47:1></a> He is speaking as a man of experience.<a name=47:2></a> He is not speaking as an apostle, though he might well have done so, and he does indeed call himself apostle of Jesus Christ in opening his epistle, but he is speaking as an elder, one who had had years of experience; and I suppose there was no one who had had more experience of the shepherd service of Christ than Peter.<a name=47:3></a> He would no doubt carry a sense of it in his soul.<a name=47:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is Peter who speaks of the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:25">1 Peter  2:25</a>).<a name=47:5></a> We well know how the Lord Jesus shepherded Peter.<a name=47:6></a> There came a time in the history of the disciples when the Lord said to them, "Will ye also go away?<a name=47:7></a>" and Peter said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=47:8></a> thou hast words of life eternal" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:67">John  6:67</a>, 68).<a name=47:9></a> As though he would say, I know where the food supply is.<a name=47:10></a> He knew how his own soul had been fed; he was not going to be turned away from the Shepherd.<a name=47:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So one of the first things in shepherding is to see that suitable food is provided, and also to see that there is encouragement.<a name=47:12></a> How the Lord would encourage Peter!<a name=47:13></a> When Peter came forward as he did on one occasion with his confession, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God", the Lord immediately speaks to him and says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed

	<div class="paragraph">
		it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a>, 17).<a name=48:1></a> The Lord encouraged Peter, and there is nothing so encouraging as to bring home to the saints something of the thoughts of divine grace which they have part in.<a name=48:2></a> So the Lord would, so to speak, say to Peter, You are blessed indeed, Simon Bar-jona.<a name=48:3></a> He called him by the name by which he was known amongst men, but implies, You have something in your heart that the Father has implanted there; you have something that your neighbour has not; it is a sovereign act of God.<a name=48:4></a> So God has given us an appreciation of Christ.<a name=48:5></a> In no other way can it be explained, but that it is God's sovereign act in opening our eyes to Christ, so we may well encourage one another that we have been thus blessed.<a name=48:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that in these four scriptures we have a very comprehensive expression of what belongs to and characterises Christianity.<a name=49:2></a> There is only one day mentioned in the New Testament in respect of Christianity, and that is the first day of the week, or the Lord's day.<a name=49:3></a> There is no mention of any other day, and in this respect Christianity stands in striking contrast to what preceded it.<a name=49:4></a> In connection with Judaism we not only have different days, but we have different times of different days, we have hours and moments.<a name=49:5></a> We have days, many days, different days, and then we have weeks, months, and years, even going so far as fifty years.<a name=49:6></a> But in Christianity we have only <i>one day</i>.<a name=49:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the way Christianity is presented to us in the New Testament scriptures gives us only a week at a time.<a name=49:8></a> There is the "first day of the week", and whatever belongs to that day is characteristic of Christianity.<a name=49:9></a> So that it is a question whether the Lord will tarry through the week; if He does not come during the week (and He may come) -- that is how the truth is put before us, for there is no scriptural ground for delay or putting off the coming of the Lord.<a name=49:10></a> He may come this week -- but if He tarry, if He does not come this week, we begin again next "<i>first</i> day of the week", that is how it is presented.<a name=49:11></a> The point I want to press upon you just at this moment is that the "first day", or the Lord's day, is the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=50>[Page 50]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will find I have read these four scriptures in their proper order.<a name=50:2></a> It is remarkable that the scripture in Revelation brings before us an individual Christian.<a name=50:3></a> You say, perhaps, But John was an apostle.<a name=50:4></a> We know that he was.<a name=50:5></a> But it is not as an apostle that he speaks in the verses I have read.<a name=50:6></a> But mark!<a name=50:7></a> he says, "I John, <i>your brother</i> and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=50:8></a> That is, John comes before us as a Christian, and further, he comes before us as a Christian in fellowship.<a name=50:9></a> "I John", who speaks of himself as "your brother" (the brother of every Christian) "and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus".<a name=50:10></a> And what follows?<a name=50:11></a> "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=50:12></a> There is perfect order.<a name=50:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John is here brought before us as a Christian, an individual Christian who is in fellowship.<a name=50:14></a> And then he speaks of the Lord's day.<a name=50:15></a> He says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=50:16></a> That is the beginning.<a name=50:17></a> We shall come to the assembly presently, but there is something that <i>precedes</i> the assembly, there is that which is <i>individual</i> which underlies and precedes everything that is <i>collective</i>.<a name=50:18></a> We participate in the breaking of bread, which may be spoken of as privilege.<a name=50:19></a> But even in connection with the breaking of bread you find a double responsibility.<a name=50:20></a> There is a responsibility belonging to the assembly as such, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=51>[Page 51]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		responsibility belonging to every individual who has part in it.<a name=51:1></a> But what precedes it?<a name=51:2></a> Why, just what John expresses about himself -- "I John, your brother and <i>fellow-partaker</i>".<a name=51:3></a> What precedes our coming together to break bread?<a name=51:4></a> You have to be <i>ready for it individually</i>, you have to be in fellowship for it individually.<a name=51:5></a> It is a poor thing to be connected with Christianity only in the way of responsibility.<a name=51:6></a> There <i>is</i> responsibility, but you will find in Scripture that there is a basis upon which responsibility rests, and that is, that you are in the reality of christian fellowship.<a name=51:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I allude for a moment to a scripture just for the sake of making that point clear.<a name=51:8></a> At the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>after an account of Peter's testimony is given and the wonderful working of God, when three thousand people were pricked to the heart and cried out, "What shall we do, brethren?<a name=51:9></a>" they got a very plain answer through the lips of Peter -- "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (verses 37, 38).<a name=51:10></a> They responded to that answer.<a name=51:11></a> And what is said about them then?<a name=51:12></a> "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles" (verse 42).<a name=51:13></a> I just want to emphasise that point -- they persevered in the apostles' teaching and fellowship.<a name=51:14></a> The truth had been presented and taught, and they who responded to it persevered in the apostles' teaching and fellowship.<a name=51:15></a> <i>Then</i> it goes on to say, "in breaking of bread and prayers".<a name=51:16></a>

		It has been well observed that Christianity differs from all pagan systems of religion in this great feature: that while those systems promise a man <i>future happiness</i>, they give him nothing but hope in the present.<a name=60:7></a> Christianity, however, in addition to the hopes of future blessedness, confers positive blessing of the very highest character upon the believer <i>now</i> while on this earth.<a name=60:8></a>

		It is right that Christians should know and understand not only that there is an inheritance reserved for them "in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:4">1 Peter  1:4</a>), but they should also consciously know things now.<a name=60:9></a> This was the earnest desire of the apostle Paul for the church of God (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:16">Ephesians  1:16</a> - 19; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a> - 19).<a name=60:10></a> To enumerate the various characters of present christian blessing is more than could be attempted in this little paper.<a name=60:11></a> I shall content myself with drawing attention to one item -- the Christian's joy.<a name=60:12></a>

		but this is not the joy referred to in the passage from which I have taken the words at the head of this paper.<a name=61:1></a> On the contrary, it speaks of a joy which is experienced while we do <i>not</i> see Jesus Christ: "whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom though not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:8">1 Peter  1:8</a>).<a name=61:2></a> I do not ask, Are we rejoicing with joy unspeakable day by day as we go about our necessary business, for that would be to put myself to shame; but I ask, Do we accept the verse which I have just quoted as a sober unexaggerated statement of what is the Christian's present portion through all the ups and downs of life?<a name=61:3></a> I believe every Christian knows something of it, but what <i>God</i> in His grace wills is that we should have it as a deep well in our souls, inexhaustible and unfailing because the Lord Himself is its Source.<a name=61:4></a> If we are content without this joy are we not failing to respond to the grace of God?<a name=61:5></a>

		I want to speak from these scriptures of the Lord as an Object of attraction.<a name=65:2></a> He is the Head and Centre of that world which will be for God's pleasure eternally.<a name=65:3></a> How blessed it is to have our view centred on Christ, the Man in the glory!<a name=65:4></a> That is where Jesus is, and may He occupy our hearts and draw us after Himself.<a name=65:5></a> We have been attracted to Him so that we might have our part in that world of which He is the Head and Centre.<a name=65:6></a> How blessed it is that He has drawn our hearts after Himself!<a name=65:7></a>

		The Lord Jesus could say, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:44">John  6:44</a>).<a name=65:8></a> So that, as we are brought into the appreciation of that blessed Person, we understand that divine operations have taken place in our souls, in order to give us a fuller impression of the greatness and glory of Christ as the Centre of all God's thoughts.<a name=65:9></a> Everything for God's eternal glory is going to be brought to pass through Him.<a name=65:10></a> That eternal scene, you might say, is already established for God in Christ.<a name=65:11></a> So it should be now for believers, as we take account of the Lord Jesus in all His glory as the Son of God.<a name=65:12></a> It would give us to understand the preciousness of God's thoughts, how they are all centred in Him.<a name=65:13></a> It lifts our hearts from this wilderness scene to take account of the Lord Jesus where He is

		So it says where we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "Now is the judgment of this world".<a name=66:2></a> This world is under judgment, though it has not yet been carried out, but it certainly will be; but we have been drawn out of it, attracted to Christ.<a name=66:3></a> The prince of this world has great scope at the present time, but, the Spirit being here, Satan's movements are much limited.<a name=66:4></a> It says, "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:20">Romans  16:20</a>).<a name=66:5></a> These things will be brought to pass.<a name=66:6></a> Meanwhile, we have this statement of the Lord Jesus, "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me".<a name=66:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three allusions to the Lord being lifted up in John's gospel: "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up" (chapter 3: 14); "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he" (chapter 8: 28), which brings out the glory of His Deity; and, "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me" (chapter 12: 32).<a name=66:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Lifted up out of the earth".<a name=66:9></a> What a spectacle to the world, what a sight for angels, for heaven, to look upon that holy One, hanging there upon a cross!<a name=66:10></a> And yet He says, "I … will draw all to me".<a name=66:11></a> What a thought that is!<a name=66:12></a> Those in whom the work of God is, who have an appreciation of Christ, are not ashamed of the cross, or of the reproach and shame that is seen there.<a name=66:13></a> John, at the end of his gospel, speaks of a little company that stood by the cross (chapter 19: 25).<a name=66:14></a> How

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The crucifixion of the Lord was a public matter; what shame and ignominy was heaped upon Him, my Saviour.<a name=67:4></a> He was there as One who would draw all to Himself -- that is, all in whom God has wrought.<a name=67:5></a> Oh!<a name=67:6></a> that the glories and greatness of that One might draw our hearts increasingly after Himself, away from this world, for this world is passing, and the judgment of God is upon it.<a name=67:7></a> Provisionally, the world stands in reconciliation because of the cross of Christ.<a name=67:8></a> Well, what a comfort it is to our hearts to see Him where He is at the present time; not now on the cross, but in the glory, and we are attracted, by the Spirit, to Him there.<a name=67:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>, we find the high priest prophesying: "it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish".<a name=67:10></a> He did not say that of himself; he "prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation; and not for the nation only".<a name=67:11></a> Mark, "not for the nation only" are not the words of Caiaphas the high priest, but are the words of the Spirit of God through John calling attention to the Lord Jesus as the One who is not only the Centre but the Gatherer.<a name=67:12></a> Think of how He would gather!<a name=67:13></a> Why should the people of God be scattered?<a name=67:14></a> That is the enemy's work.<a name=67:15></a> Surely it is a sorrowful matter to take account

		I think that the enjoyment of family relations is a feature that is to mark the people of God at the present time.<a name=68:10></a> I believe the Spirit of God is drawing attention to that -- the thought of the divine family.<a name=68:11></a> It is a primary thought with God; it is a thought that will go through into eternity and yet it is something that we can enjoy now by the Spirit.<a name=68:12></a> "God maketh the solitary into families" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68:6">Psalm  68:6</a>).<a name=68:13></a> As we are gathered to the Lord we can enjoy something of these blessed and eternal family relations that God has such delight and pleasure in.<a name=68:14></a> How precious it is to take account of Christ in all His attractiveness and glory.<a name=68:15></a> If we were asked, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved?<a name=68:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:9">Song of Songs  5:9</a>), what would we say?<a name=68:17></a> Could we answer like the person in the

		Well, I read that portion in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#12">1 Chronicles  12</a>where it speaks of David -- a remarkable section.<a name=69:7></a> The verses of the previous chapter give us a list of names, and it says in this chapter, "Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he kept still close because of Saul the son of Kish".<a name=69:8></a> Saul was still reigning, but there were those who came to recognise David as the one whom God was supporting at that time.<a name=69:9></a> He was the true king even though Saul was reigning.<a name=69:10></a> David was the one who by his attractiveness was able to gather these persons together.<a name=69:11></a> They were mighty men and were able to help David in the conflict.<a name=69:12></a> Well, the Lord Jesus would have us to be such at the present time; He would have His people to be in the understanding of what our conflict is.<a name=69:13></a> As we are with the Lord, I think we would be helped to see that victory is assured, and that is a great thing to have in our hearts.<a name=69:14></a> It speaks of those

	<div class="paragraph">
		who "were of Saul's brethren of Benjamin".<a name=70:1></a> They were overcomers; they were able to overcome the natural and to identify themselves with David in Ziklag.<a name=70:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might have read the names given in this chapter because the Spirit of God has seen fit to record them.<a name=70:3></a> They are names of men that have stood for David in the scene of His rejection.<a name=70:4></a> That is very precious to the Lord.<a name=70:5></a> It says of the Gadites that they "separated themselves to David in the stronghold".<a name=70:6></a> Notice the words, "to David".<a name=70:7></a> That is the key to the whole section, you might say.<a name=70:8></a> The stronghold would suggest the thought of fellowship, which we get in the Corinthian epistles.<a name=70:9></a> It speaks of something very precious, and these persons committed themselves to David.<a name=70:10></a> They were mighty men of valour and they were with him in the stronghold.<a name=70:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three positions in this chapter which are very important to take account of: in Ziklag; in the stronghold; and in Hebron.<a name=70:12></a> How attractive David must have been to draw all these persons after him!<a name=70:13></a> We need to be prepared to identify ourselves with a rejected Christ.<a name=70:14></a> Divine Persons value that.<a name=70:15></a>

		In the fifteenth verse of <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#12">1 Chronicles  12</a>it says, "These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it overflows all its banks, and they put to flight all them of the valleys".<a name=70:16></a> What tremendous energy they had!<a name=70:17></a> I think they had acquired that energy through their affection for David, and they were thus able to overcome all that Jordan represents -- the strength of death, and all that it meant.<a name=70:18></a> How

	<div class="paragraph">
		important it is at the present time to be an overcomer.<a name=71:1></a> You will notice in the epistles to the churches in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3, that there is a word addressed to "him that overcomes".<a name=71:2></a> Think of the preciousness that belongs to it; it is available to us all.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there were those who came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.<a name=71:4></a> They were prepared to come to David, and he questioned them in relation to their coming to him.<a name=71:5></a> So I believe it is a constant test as to our loyalty to Christ at the present time, that we should be loyal to Him in the scene where He is rejected, because He is the One who has loved us and has given Himself for us.<a name=71:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says, "the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and with thee, thou son of Jesse".<a name=71:7></a> What a wonderful matter that is!<a name=71:8></a> How clearly and definitely he came out in support of David here.<a name=71:9></a> And that is what is required of the saints at the present time amidst a scene of reproach and shame, to come out definitely in relation to Christ.<a name=71:10></a> "Peace, peace be to thee!<a name=71:11></a> And peace be to thy helpers!<a name=71:12></a> For thy God helps thee".<a name=71:13></a> He discerned that God was helping David, and he was prepared to identify himself loyally and in affection with him.<a name=71:14></a> That is the great challenge at the present time, I believe; we are all challenged as to our affection for Christ, and our committal to Him will be evidenced in the way that we act for Him here.<a name=71:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then in verse 23 it says, "this is the number of the men equipped for military service, who came to David to Hebron".<a name=71:16></a> We are told that Hebron was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many other features in this section which are very important indeed.<a name=72:11></a> The children of Issachar "had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do" (verse 32).<a name=72:12></a> I believe the Spirit of God would give us to have discernment of the times so that we are here fully identified with Christ.<a name=72:13></a> Then there were those who "came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel" (verse 38).<a name=72:14></a> There was nothing partial in their thoughts; they recognised that David was the true ruler, and that he was the one who would rule over all Israel.<a name=72:15></a> That was God's thought.<a name=72:16></a> Let us keep to whole thoughts in these days, despite the breakdown and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "All the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king".<a name=73:2></a> How important it is to be united in our affection for Christ.<a name=73:3></a> God has crowned Him; but He loves to see the saints coming into accord with His thoughts and crowning Christ as the One who alone has the right to reign.<a name=73:4></a> Then it says, "there they were with David".<a name=73:5></a> They not only came to David but they were with Him "three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them".<a name=73:6></a> Think of the rich provision there was here.<a name=73:7></a> The fig-cakes and raisin-cakes would speak of necessary spiritual food to sustain us here, while we are waiting for the Lord to come.<a name=73:8></a> All these things were prepared "abundantly; for there was joy in Israel".<a name=73:9></a> I think where saints rightly provide all that is necessary for the maintenance of the testimony, there will be true joy among the people of God.<a name=73:10></a> When the Lord comes to reign the whole scene will then be filled with true joy and blessing.<a name=73:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is all I have in mind to say, beloved.<a name=73:12></a> May our hearts be drawn to Christ where He is in glory.<a name=73:13></a> He is the Centre of God's world, but now we can appreciate it by the Spirit as our hearts and affections are attracted to Himself where He is.<a name=73:14></a>

		This is illustrated, I believe, in the history of Gideon, for the history of Gideon answers to the history of the Corinthians.<a name=85:3></a> It is a question of which man is going to have place amongst God's people, and the wrong man was there in Gideon's time (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#6">Judges  6</a>, 7).<a name=85:4></a> That is, Midian was there with the two kings and the two princes, and it says Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian.<a name=85:5></a> They left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass, and by what means were they to be delivered?<a name=85:6></a> By the sword of Jehovah and of Gideon (chapter 7: 20).<a name=85:7></a>

		When we come to John, it is the influence of Christ in restful love, because there is such a thing as serving love and there is such a thing as restful love, and both are to be characteristic of the assembly at this present time.<a name=86:2></a> It is like Abigail, who, as invited to become the wife of David, said, "let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:41">1 Samuel  25:41</a>).<a name=86:3></a> That is, serving love, but in view of restfulness.<a name=86:4></a> Serving love is what is to characterise us here, but the assembly is also to learn restful love, and we are all to learn it, for God delights in it.<a name=86:5></a> He will rest in His love, He will joy over His people with singing (<a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:17">Zephaniah  3:17</a>).<a name=86:6></a>

		So the influence of Christ upon John was seen in the verses read from <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=88:3></a> He was enjoying love in the bosom of Jesus, and in that position he was absolutely unmoved whatever arose.<a name=88:4></a> A serious issue is raised: the Lord says that one of the disciples should deliver Him up.<a name=88:5></a> Simon Peter made a sign to John to ask who it might be of whom He spoke.<a name=88:6></a> But John, leaning on the breast of Jesus says to Him, "Lord, who is it?<a name=88:7></a>" That is, it is not only a question of being restful in love, but you can rely on it, on the strength of it; and so John stresses one thing that will go through, the love of Christ.<a name=88:8></a> He says, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" (chapter 13: 1).<a name=88:9></a> The Lord was taking account of what the world would be in His absence, and He set Himself to love them right through to the end.<a name=88:10></a> It is most important, dear brethren, that we should have the sense of that and cultivate it too.<a name=88:11></a> There is one thing that will never fail, and that is the love of Christ, and it is a good thing to see to it that we strengthen ourselves in the knowledge of it.<a name=88:12></a>

		influence of Christ upon Paul was, of course, very great and varied.<a name=89:1></a> I do not suggest that what is seen in this third chapter of Philippians was the only result of the influence of Christ upon Paul, for it certainly was not, but it is a striking thing that when we come to the epistle to the Philippians we have Paul, who was, I suppose, the greatest of the apostles, and had more revealed to him than any other, and suffered more than any others, as he is drawing near the close of his history, marked by one desire to know Christ, and to apprehend that for which he had been apprehended by Christ Jesus.<a name=89:2></a>

		Paul speaks of "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord", and speaks in the first chapter of our approving the things that are more excellent (verse 10); it is a superlative expression, because literally there cannot be anything better than what is excellent.<a name=89:3></a> He commenced his career as a believer with the light of the glory of Christ, a light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=89:4></a> As far as we know he did not know Christ in the days of His flesh, and even if he did, he says in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, "yet now we know him thus no longer" (verse 16).<a name=89:5></a> Certainly his history as a believer dated and took character from the light he received of Christ in glory.<a name=89:6></a> We have never seen Christ; but Paul had seen Him, and he apprehended in Christ in glory the full thought that God has in mind for those whom He has taken up in Christ.<a name=89:7></a> May our hearts live for it, as we begin to get some sense of it.<a name=89:8></a> What it will be to be for ever free from the hindrance of the flesh, and the limitations

		I am exercised to point out that we have to be regulated in all our relations by the Lord Jesus.<a name=91:1></a> It is a simple thought, but as I hope to show by the Lord's help, a most essential one for us today; for if we are not regulated by the Lord, however well regulated we may regard ourselves, religiously or socially, it will not only be outside His direct influence, and to that extent without His law, but we shall also be deprived of the privileges which He has for us as those who obey Him.<a name=91:2></a> He is the Regulator according to divine appointment, not only of the saints, but of everything, just as of old Joseph was set over the Egyptians, and Pharaoh said to him, "according to thy commandment shall all my people regulate themselves" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:40">Genesis  41:40</a>).<a name=91:3></a>

		Hence, as a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, we see in Joseph the divine thought that all the saints, and indeed all the nations, and Israel as the head of them, as well as angels and all things, are to be regulated and ruled by the word of Christ.<a name=91:4></a> This is perfectly clear from the Scriptures, and I want to show you how essential it is for us; for if we do not go beyond the acknowledgment of our allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ in our baptism, we are simply a multitude without order.<a name=91:5></a> The Israelites came up out of Egypt, not indeed as a disorderly mob, but they did not go out according to their tribes; they came out in military rank, "arrayed" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:18">Exodus  13:18</a>); that is, by

		fives, five in a rank, thus presenting a military front to the enemy; they were under divine control, but not yet according to their tribes.<a name=92:1></a> I want to show you that the divine thought is that we should be regulated according to our tribes; in other words, that we should take up assembly position in our souls.<a name=92:2></a> That is what the Lord has in His mind for every one of us.<a name=92:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when a young Christian begins his course he recognises the lordship of Christ; that is the initial feature of his confession.<a name=92:4></a> In his baptism he confesses that Christ is Lord, but baptism does not set us in our tribes; it does not place us in the fellowship of God's people; that is a later consideration, a further step, but obviously we begin with the acknowledgment, not only in the outward form of baptism, but in our souls, of the lordship of Christ.<a name=92:5></a> The one thing that is indicative of Israel's faith is that they crossed the sea, so that baptism is only effective as it is taken up in faith; it is a dead form otherwise.<a name=92:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We as parents do it for the child, but in order that it may be effective for the child it must be in faith with him, so that he may be said to have crossed the sea.<a name=92:7></a> He never crosses it truly except by faith, so that he begins his christian career publicly in that way by the acknowledgment of the lordship of Christ.<a name=92:8></a> This is what Romans teaches us: "For with the heart is believed to righteousness; and with the mouth confession made to salvation" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:10">Romans  10:10</a>).<a name=92:9></a> So that he makes a good start in that way, with the heart affected by faith, and the mouth confessing what the heart has yielded to.<a name=92:10></a> Then the apostle goes on to say,

		"For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself … both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's" (chapter 14: 7, 8).<a name=93:1></a> Let us recognise that.<a name=93:2></a> Then he adds, "For to this end Christ has died and lived again, that he might rule over both dead and living" (verse 9).<a name=93:3></a> Thus the Lord has an incontestable right to rule over every soul; He has the keys of hades and of death; He can enter hades at any time and announce His right over every one there.<a name=93:4></a> For the moment, His rights through redemption are announced in the gospel testimony, and, as it is accepted in the souls of believers, the lordship of Christ is owned; as Saul said, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=93:5></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:10">Acts  22:10</a>).<a name=93:6></a> He not only recognised the Lord's rights over him as a matter of property, but he said, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=93:7></a>" -- that is a levitical resolve.<a name=93:8></a>

		Now, the people came out of Egypt, and in their song, joining as they did with Moses, as it is said, "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to Jehovah"; they say, "Jehovah is a man of war" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:1">Exodus  15:1</a>, 3).<a name=93:9></a> That is how they apprehended Him; not yet as the Jehovah who would dwell with them, although no doubt they had it in their hearts, but what the song contemplates is the thought of a military Leader, so that they come out victoriously.<a name=93:10></a> They were not led by the way of the Philistines, for God said, "That the people may not repent when they see conflict" (chapter 13: 17).<a name=93:11></a> Before we fight, we must learn to be subject.<a name=93:12></a>

		book in the Old Testament, and I want just to touch on it for a moment.<a name=94:1></a> In the beginning of the book it is said, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting" (chapter 1: 1).<a name=94:2></a> That was the position of the tabernacle; it was in the wilderness, and God spake out of it, in that position, and the speaking had in view the regulating of the people in regard to their tribes.<a name=94:3></a> The tribes, for faith, henceforth were always in view.<a name=94:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one who loves the Lord will ever let the assembly out of his mind; the assembly will be always before him; hence you find that where the Lord Jesus is typically seen in Moses as dwelling in the affections of His people, it is said "he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a> 5).<a name=94:5></a> It is as Christ is recognised and held in the affections of His people that they are regulated by Him in assembly relations.<a name=94:6></a> Moses says in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>, "Yea, he loveth the peoples" (verse 3).<a name=94:7></a> The Lord would have us in assembly relations, and as in those relations, the heads of the people and the tribes assembled will be seen there.<a name=94:8></a> The Lord is seen there; if as yet He is not acknowledged in the world, yet is He acknowledged there in affection.<a name=94:9></a> I believe that is what the king in Jeshurun signifies; Moses was held in the affections of the people; you can see the importance of the tribes.<a name=94:10></a> Those who are not walking in the light of the assembly are not holding to Christ.<a name=94:11></a>

		So James writes to them too, "to the twelve tribes which are in the dispersion" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:1">James  1:1</a>), for him they were all there; he does not hint at 'lost tribes'; Scripture knows no such thought.<a name=95:9></a> We hear people say that the British people are the lost tribes; this is not so.<a name=95:10></a> The scripture has all in view; you do not write to lost people.<a name=95:11></a> I only speak of it in regard to the assembly, my desire being that we might have before us the thought of the entire company, as being under the eye of the Lord, and, moreover, that if any one writes today, he writes as having all saints on earth in view.<a name=95:12></a> Scripture not only speaks of speakers, but also of writers; every scribe is like unto a householder, we read (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:52">Matthew  13:52</a>).<a name=95:13></a> James writes to the twelve tribes, and so if you write it is not only for the few you know, it is for all.<a name=95:14></a> Anything that the Lord gives, He gives for the whole assembly, because His

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to come to the thought of regulation.<a name=96:3></a> In the book of Numbers Jehovah is said to have spoken to Moses out of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and the word was one of regulation.<a name=96:4></a> It is in keeping with Corinthians, which is the word of regulation for the assembly.<a name=96:5></a> The Lord, through the apostle, addresses Himself "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth …with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a> 2).<a name=96:6></a> There is only one Lord; wherever there is a company calling on His Name He is their Lord, as He is of all other companies; and then as the apostle proceeds, you discern that one rule or law is to govern all; all are to be regulated by the same principles.<a name=96:7></a> So the apostle says, "Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:2">1 Corinthians  11:2</a>).<a name=96:8></a> There were some directions which they kept, and others which they disregarded, but he credited them with those they had kept.<a name=96:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christ was not simply set at liberty in resurrection.<a name=102:2></a> If you turn to <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:9">Philippians  2:9</a> - 11, you find three great points: first, exaltation; secondly, that a name is given to Him; and thirdly, authority is conferred on Him -- universal authority.<a name=102:3></a> This recalls to us the history of Joseph.<a name=102:4></a> Joseph was highly exalted in Egypt, he is second to none, except the king himself, and he gets a name.<a name=102:5></a> Now a name is given to Jesus -- and name expresses renown -- authority and renown are given to Christ, and the word is, as in the case of Joseph, "bow the knee"; "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow … and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to God the Father's glory".<a name=102:6></a>

		But I pass on to speak of the links which are formed in this present time, in which Christ is hidden from His kindred after the flesh.<a name=103:9></a> In Joseph's case his kindred had no knowledge of him; as far as they were concerned he might have been torn in pieces by wild beasts; he was hidden from them for the time being.<a name=103:10></a> That figures the position of Christ with regard to Israel at the present time.<a name=103:11></a> Christ is dead as to them, they know nothing about Him but

		Now I want to speak a little of links that are formed in that time.<a name=104:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:45">Genesis  41:45</a>, we see that Pharaoh gave to Joseph a name -- and a name that was symbolic in a way.<a name=104:3></a> He also obtains a wife.<a name=104:4></a> What I understand a wife often to represent in Scripture is a covenant, or system, or order of things.<a name=104:5></a> Sarah, as we see in the epistle to the Galatians, is used to set forth a covenant or order of things come in; and Hagar to show the legal covenant; and in the case of Joseph we see him identified with what was entirely outside of all that was natural to him; it would have been more natural to him to have married a wife from the land of his fathers.<a name=104:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the principle holds good in regard to Christ.<a name=104:7></a> He is identified in heaven with another order of things, represented by the wife of Joseph.<a name=104:8></a> A verse from <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>will make that plain; the law which "perfected nothing" is set aside -- that is one order of things; but there is "the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God" (verse 19) -- that is the order of things with which Christ is identified at the present time.<a name=104:9></a> The love of God has opened heaven to us -- that is the better hope.<a name=104:10></a> We have come unto "mount Zion; and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, the universal gathering; and to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a>, 23) -- that is the order of things with which Christ has become identified during the time of His decease as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if they would reach Christ, they must go forth to Him "without the camp", but the door of heaven has been opened to them.<a name=105:4></a> The death of Christ speaks not simply of the perverseness of the Jews, but of God's glory; and on the ground of that the door of heaven has been opened, and souls have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.<a name=105:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further, a generation has sprung from that link which Christ has formed -- from the system and order of things with which He is identified.<a name=105:6></a> Our souls identify Him with the better hope.<a name=105:7></a> He is the priest of that order of things, and the effect upon us is that we are a new generation, "the sons of God, without rebuke" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a>, A.<a name=105:8></a>V.<a name=105:9></a>).<a name=105:10></a> Was there ever that generation before Christ was here?<a name=105:11></a> There were the children of Abraham, and men of faith, but there was not a generation, before Christ, that understood anything about the Father's love.<a name=105:12></a> Such a generation could not come to light until Christ had been down

		I dwell on the point of regulation because, although there is to be no assumption to the position of the assembly in a <i>public</i> way, yet we must cling to first principles, those which were given to the apostle by the Lord to govern the saints.<a name=109:1></a> So it says, "But if any one think to be contentious, <i>we</i> have no such custom" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:16">1 Corinthians  11:16</a>).<a name=109:2></a> It is contrary to the assembly to have contention; "It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and irritable woman" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#21:19">Proverbs  21:19</a>).<a name=109:3></a> Contention is foreign to the assembly, so the apostle says, "<i>we</i> have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God".<a name=109:4></a> Men might meet on Mars' Hill to dispute about matters (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:19">Acts  17:19</a>), but not so in the assembly; it is a place for subjection to one another in the fear of Christ, hence the importance of rule.<a name=109:5></a> So the apostle says to Titus, "For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest go on to set right what remained unordered" (chapter 1: 5); things were to be set in order.<a name=109:6></a>

		Now, another point in regard to that: Reuben is the firstborn of Israel; he represents natural right.<a name=110:4></a> Natural right was wholly refused in the ordering of the tribes, so that Reuben had his own place, and that place was adjacent to the family of the Kohathites; alas!<a name=110:5></a> they influenced each other injuriously, and the result was a party spirit; a servant allying himself with those who had a natural right, and so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron (see <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16">Numbers  16</a>).<a name=110:6></a> There was the alliance of natural right and prejudices with those who had the position of being servants of the Lord; but that moral combination led them to become rebels against the authority of Christ in Moses, and the priesthood of Christ in Aaron.<a name=110:7></a> We are so apt to gender party feeling locally.<a name=110:8></a> Whilst the Lord emphasised in Numbers the principle of local responsibility, yet that very principle involved a danger, that is the danger of local party spirit.<a name=110:9></a>

		We have read from the writings of Peter, John and Paul concerning things that are said to have been <i>given</i> to us.<a name=129:2></a> John tells us in his gospel that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>).<a name=129:3></a> What a gift that was for all who believe in Him!<a name=129:4></a> We have also the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=129:5></a> The Lord said to the Samaritan woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a>).<a name=129:6></a> That should encourage us to get to God, the Source of all goodness and giving, and to ask living water from Him.<a name=129:7></a>

		James says, "But if any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:5">James  1:5</a>).<a name=129:8></a> It is wonderful to think of God freely giving wisdom -- not reproaching us for lacking wisdom -- He delights to give freely to us.<a name=129:9></a> James also says, "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning" (chapter 1: 17).<a name=129:10></a> So these writers of the epistles refer to our blessed God in this way as a great Source of goodness and giving.<a name=129:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What strikes you in reading Peter's epistles is the fact that he was not at all downcast, though knowing the future that lay before him.<a name=130:3></a> The Lord Jesus had told him by what death he should glorify God: "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>).<a name=130:4></a> The Lord was alluding to crucifixion, that Peter was going to glorify God by crucifixion like Himself; His crucifixion involved Himself as the propitiation for our sins, but Peter was going to die as a martyr.<a name=130:5></a> Peter was not despondent, he did not try to run away or resign his commission.<a name=130:6></a> He went on, steadfast in faith, holding on to the Lord who had bought him: "bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:1">2 Peter  1:1</a>).<a name=130:7></a> He realises the great service that was entrusted to him, and he is going to finish it to the glory of God, by the help of the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit.<a name=130:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter writes "to them that have received like precious faith with us" (verse 1).<a name=130:9></a> Well, that would include ourselves, dear brethren.<a name=130:10></a> The faith of the apostles was no greater than the faith that we have received; there is only one faith, as the Scripture says, "one Lord, one faith, one baptism" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:5">Ephesians  4:5</a>).<a name=130:11></a> And so, Peter speaks of those who have "received like precious faith with us through the righteousness of our

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter has a lot to say about precious things, and precious faith is one of them.<a name=131:5></a> You see how full his heart is with affection and desire for the welfare of the saints: "Grace and peace be multiplied to you" -- a very wide statement -- "in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord".<a name=131:6></a> That is how grace comes to us -- God in revelation, in expression, in the Son of His love.<a name=131:7></a> He has given us grace and He would multiply grace to us, and not only grace, but peace.<a name=131:8></a> Oh!<a name=131:9></a> how blessed it is to have peace in a world so disturbed as the present one is.<a name=131:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness": that is a remarkable statement.<a name=131:11></a> God "has given to us all things" -- it would be good to contemplate that and consider what things he has in mind.<a name=131:12></a> Write down what you think he is referring to -- "all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue".<a name=131:13></a> That came out very much in the path of the Lord Jesus here as He "went about through all quarters doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>).<a name=131:14></a> You will remember the woman with the flux of blood, coming up behind, she touched the hem of the Lord's

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter adds, "through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises, that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature" (verse 4).<a name=132:7></a> You see how much He speaks of "through" -- "through the righteousness of our God and Saviour" (verse 1); "through the knowledge of him that has called us" (verse 3); "through which He has given to us the greatest and precious promises" (verse 4).<a name=132:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of the Lord's promise in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>"for I go to prepare you a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be" (verses 2, 3).<a name=132:9></a> These were the things that may have been filling the mind of this beloved brother, Peter, who was soon to be martyred, and the greatest and precious promises are filling his heart.<a name=132:10></a> And he says that "through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature".<a name=132:11></a> It shows that what the Lord has promised, what God has promised, helps us on in our souls.<a name=132:12></a>

		Well now, in John's first epistle chapter 5 he had been speaking of a brother sinning.<a name=133:1></a> "If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death.<a name=133:2></a> There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request" (verse 16).<a name=133:3></a> Now we have to distinguish, as we see sin appearing in believers -- is it a sin unto death, or is it a sin not unto death?<a name=133:4></a> But there is a sin not unto death; thank God, we can pray for recovery amongst our brethren.<a name=133:5></a> Scripture speaks of one who recovers a man from the error of his ways shall cover a multitude of sins, and save a soul from death (<a href="../bible/James.htm#5:20">James  5:20</a>).<a name=133:6></a> Well, that is fine, we have seen that happen too -- many souls recovered, rescued from the ways of sin and self-pleasing, and given life.<a name=133:7></a> "Every unrighteousness is sin" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:17">1 John  5:17</a>).<a name=133:8></a> "Whatever is not of faith is sin" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:23">Romans  14:23</a>), is another word of the apostle Paul's.<a name=133:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then John says, "We know that every one begotten of God does not sin" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>) -- that is, the believer as looked at as of the Spirit, looked at according to the divine nature.<a name=133:10></a> "But <i>ye</i> are not in flesh but in Spirit", it says, "if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:9">Romans  8:9</a>).<a name=133:11></a> It is fine to see the believer in that abstract sense.<a name=133:12></a> He is not in flesh, but in Spirit, and so he does not sin.<a name=133:13></a> He is begotten of God, it says, and he does not sin, because he has been begotten of God, and he keeps himself.<a name=133:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How good it is that we are begotten of God!<a name=134:3></a> God has worked in us sovereignly Himself -- we did not beget ourselves.<a name=134:4></a> That is a gift from God -- a wonderful gift!<a name=134:5></a> And so we can keep ourselves that the wicked one does not touch us.<a name=134:6></a> The wicked one sees that you are determined to follow the will of God, and to please God, and be obedient to the Son of God -- and the wicked one does not touch you.<a name=134:7></a> So the believer has that power to resist the devil, so that he might flee from him -- and we are often attacked by Satan.<a name=134:8></a> He is after the young people very much, day after day, seeking to tempt them and allure them away from the will of God and the path of discipleship.<a name=134:9></a> But we need to pray for them, that they, like ourselves, would learn to keep themselves in the love of God, to keep themselves in communion.<a name=134:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that is a most important thing, to attend to our communion.<a name=134:11></a> If you find yourself going out of communion, you need to look into things and see what is happening.<a name=134:12></a> When you are in communion, you will not sin; it is when you get out of communion that you sin.<a name=134:13></a> "Keep yourselves", Jude says, "in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life" (verse 21).<a name=134:14></a>

		That takes your mind back to the epistle to the Ephesians, where Paul says that God "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a> - 5).<a name=138:3></a> Surely, He has "given us eternal consolation"!<a name=138:4></a> It is wonderful to put your head upon your pillow at night knowing that you have full peace with God, and eternal consolation is in your heart -- given to us by God, "who has given us … good hope by grace".<a name=138:5></a>

		I want to say a word with regard to the education of a servant.<a name=139:1></a> I am sure we all desire to serve the Lord, but we must not serve as uneducated, for we should know how it ought to be done.<a name=139:2></a> No one should essay to do a thing unless he knows how to do it, and, if God has called us to any service, He will educate us for it.<a name=139:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are incidents in the life of this great servant, Elijah, that give certain touches in his education.<a name=139:4></a> He appears in the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, as one who stands 'in the presence of God'.<a name=139:5></a> He says, "before whom I stand", meaning that he was acquainted with the divine presence, and before serving, <i>we</i> must be acquainted with the divine presence.<a name=139:6></a> Elijah was standing there ready for God to take him up.<a name=139:7></a> What holy joy pervades the heart of one who knows what it is to stand in the presence of the Lord!<a name=139:8></a> I wonder if we all know what it is to be in the presence of God and to be at home there, waiting to do what we are told.<a name=139:9></a>

		Jehovah had determined to bring famine on the land in order to recall His people who had wandered away from Him; and so near to Jehovah was this remarkable man that he could say, "there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word".<a name=140:2></a> Think of being able to speak as though his word was Jehovah's word!<a name=140:3></a> In public testimony our word should carry the authority and power of the Lord's word, in order to be effective.<a name=140:4></a> God supported Elijah, and the heavens were shut up for three years and six months.<a name=140:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Elijah was a remarkable servant.<a name=140:6></a> Not many of us could carry such dignity and honour as he did.<a name=140:7></a> I do not know how we should pass through the land, if at our word the heavens were closed for three and a half years.<a name=140:8></a> Are we great enough to carry that?<a name=140:9></a> Elijah was: and in order to educate His servant further, Jehovah tells him to go to the brook Cherith and abide there.<a name=140:10></a> The servant had to learn that every resource would fail but God -- a searching education.<a name=140:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When names are given in Scripture they are given with a purpose.<a name=140:12></a> We do not always know what they mean, but the name Cherith is said to mean 'piercing' or 'cutting', and Jehovah intended that this exercise should pierce to the very depths of the prophet's soul, as serving in this great service for the recovery of God's people.<a name=140:13></a> Corresponding to public honours there are deep and searching exercises, as you will know, and the Lord allows the one to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had commanded the ravens to bring him bread and flesh in the morning and the evening.<a name=141:11></a> It is remarkable that God should speak of bread, for the first mention of bread in scripture is in relation to man as toiling on account of sin coming in (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a> 19).<a name=141:12></a> Elijah would think about that.<a name=141:13></a> And flesh would remind him that God had made a covenant with man on the earth, and if God makes a covenant, He will be true to it.<a name=141:14></a> In the 9th chapter of Genesis God gave man in the renewed earth flesh for food, and following immediately on the instructions as to flesh, He made a covenant with Noah.<a name=141:15></a> Now Elijah would think of that in the valley beside the brook Cherith.<a name=141:16></a>

		Well now, the word comes to the prophet, "Arise, go to Zarephath … I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee".<a name=143:3></a> There is no word, or question from the prophet -- not a word!<a name=143:4></a> Think of a man who had shut up the heavens by his word, having to go to a place and be sustained by a widow!<a name=143:5></a> God knows what He is doing.<a name=143:6></a> The elements of flesh need to be touched, to the end that we may recoil from them and forsake them.<a name=143:7></a> Such is our education.<a name=143:8></a> You will know well enough that Zarephath is said to mean a 'crucible'; and God puts His people in a crucible.<a name=143:9></a> What for?<a name=143:10></a> To purge away the dross that what He is Himself may shine in us.<a name=143:11></a>

		With dignified patience Elijah moves off to Zarephath, and he meets the widow.<a name=143:12></a> What a state!<a name=143:13></a> She has not even a cake for him.<a name=143:14></a> She has a little meal and a little oil, just enough to make a cake for her child and herself and then to die.<a name=143:15></a> Yet God has sent him there … The prophet accepts it and he says, "make me thereof a little cake first".<a name=143:16></a> And then he gives the word, "The meal in the barrel shall not waste, neither shall the oil in the cruse fail …" It will go right through until the test is over.<a name=143:17></a> He had got that from God, and the barrel of meal did not waste and the cruse of oil did not fail.<a name=143:18></a> God has given us in Christ and the Spirit, enough to carry us through in the full strength of manhood according to God, and we shall have that to the end.<a name=143:19></a>

		The prophet has to learn yet something more.<a name=144:1></a> The widow's boy dies, and she began to be afraid that her sin was going to be brought to light.<a name=144:2></a> The prophet says nothing about it.<a name=144:3></a> That is not the question in hand.<a name=144:4></a> What about God's son?<a name=144:5></a> I am speaking now of Israel as God's son.<a name=144:6></a> "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:1">Hosea  11:1</a>).<a name=144:7></a> Has God lost him, has death come in there?<a name=144:8></a> Instead of a holy people with emotions stirred towards Jehovah, there is a people worshipping Baal and sacrificing to him.<a name=144:9></a> God has lost His son!<a name=144:10></a> Israel is no longer responsive in affection to Jehovah.<a name=144:11></a> The prophet has to learn the bitterness of this as part of his education, and the pain of it is, that the widow implies, that his coming to the house, is the occasion of the death of the child.<a name=144:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Elijah has a secret, and so have we.<a name=144:13></a> It says that he took the child "out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber where he abode" -- Elijah lived in an <i>upper room</i>, meaning that he lived in a region in touch with heaven, spiritually above the level of the earth.<a name=144:14></a> He lived up there.<a name=144:15></a> Let me affectionately enquire, Have we an upper room?<a name=144:16></a> Are we living near to God?<a name=144:17></a> Are we intimate with God?<a name=144:18></a> I find in moving about that there are those who are.<a name=144:19></a> No sooner are they on their knees than you find that they are intimate with God; the way they speak to Him reveals that He is One that is well known.<a name=144:20></a> That is the upper room.<a name=144:21></a> I would ask the young people, are you accustomed to pray?<a name=144:22></a> Do you know the blessedness of drawing near to the Lord and speaking to Him?<a name=144:23></a>

		Now Elijah can take up this exercise into the upper room, he has a <i>place of rest</i> in the upper room.<a name=145:1></a> He has a bed up there.<a name=145:2></a> Have we a place of rest in the upper room?<a name=145:3></a> We not only pray there, but do we <i>rest</i> there?<a name=145:4></a> It is marvellous to see the quiet grace of many of the people of God in a world of turmoil and difficulty.<a name=145:5></a> Ah!<a name=145:6></a> they have a place of rest in the upper room.<a name=145:7></a> They can rest there with the Lord.<a name=145:8></a>

		And so Elijah took the little dead boy and put him in his bed, and he <i>measured</i> himself -- the word means that.<a name=145:9></a> He measured himself upon the little dead boy, meaning that he brought himself to feel what that was -- a dead child, indeed a dead son.<a name=145:10></a> How God, to speak reverently, was feeling this with regard to Israel!<a name=145:11></a> "The son", that He brought out of Egypt, Israel, was lost to Him, dead, as it were, and there was no response.<a name=145:12></a> That servant, Elijah, through whom recovery is coming in, is being educated to feel this with God, and he cries to Jehovah in a most beautiful way, "let this child's soul come into him again!<a name=145:13></a>" A very lovely word!<a name=145:14></a> It is not the same thought as his spirit; it is his soul.<a name=145:15></a> What God looked for in His people was feeling -- and what God looks for in us are feelings: deep, reverent, holy, affectionate feelings; and the soul in a person is connected with <i>feelings</i>, emotions.<a name=145:16></a> So the child's soul was brought into him, teaching the prophet that God was going to bring back feelings in His people towards Himself.<a name=145:17></a>

		In the course of our Lord's ministry in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12">Luke  12</a>He exhorted His disciples, in view of His going away and coming again, to gird up their loins, to have their lamps burning, and to be like unto men that wait for Him, as the hour of His return was uncertain.<a name=146:7></a> He calls those servants <i>blessed</i> whom He should find watching at His return, and bids them to be <i>ready</i>, "for in the hour in which ye do not think it, the Son of man comes".<a name=146:8></a> This led Peter to say, "Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?<a name=146:9></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two chief qualities that He looks for in those whom He gives a charge over His household are <i>faithfulness</i> and <i>wisdom</i>.<a name=147:2></a> And the object of their appointment is, that they may give to His own their portion of meat in due season.<a name=147:3></a> To carry this out, the entrusted steward must walk in simple-hearted subjection to Himself.<a name=147:4></a> It is only as taught and directed by his Master that he will be cognisant of the need of those who are His, and will be enabled to give them food convenient for them.<a name=147:5></a> The Master alone reads the heart and knows the inward workings of the soul, and He only can direct to the portion that shall feed and nourish.<a name=147:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, He expects that His servant, whoever he may be, will continue this service till He come, and to him He gives this precious and encouraging promise, "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus; verily I say to you", (note the certainty of it) "that he will set him over all that he has".<a name=147:7></a> Blessing rests on the faithful and wise steward, and in the coming day of glory he shall be given a position of favour in association with his Lord.<a name=147:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		lowly ministry is apparent, for many are weary in spirit, soul, and body.<a name=156:1></a> Many of God's children are experiencing what it means to pass through "a dry and weary land without water" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#63:1">Psalm  63:1</a>).<a name=156:2></a> Numbers of souls are drooping as plants without water, and the need for a man "carrying a pitcher of water" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:13">Mark  14:13</a>) is only too obvious.<a name=156:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That such service is very acceptable to God is clearly proved by the references in Scripture to His appreciation of those who provided refreshment.<a name=156:4></a> The following well-known instances from the Old Testament will be recalled: What beautiful simplicity marked that memorable occasion on which the heavenly visitors were refreshed by Abraham, when Jehovah appeared unto him as he sat in the tent door in the plains of Mamre!<a name=156:5></a> Running to meet them, Abraham bowed himself toward the ground and said, "Lord, if now I have found favour in thine eyes … Let now a little water be fetched, that ye may wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.<a name=156:6></a> And I will fetch a morsel of bread; and <i>refresh yourselves</i>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:1">Genesis  18:1</a> - 5).<a name=156:7></a> Abraham enjoyed communion with God that day, as the secrets of God were unfolded to him, for God said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?<a name=156:8></a>" (verse 17).<a name=156:9></a> There was divine appreciation of one who could engage in ministering refreshment to God Himself.<a name=156:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The delight of the "servant" in this spontaneous response of Rebecca evidenced the appreciation which the Spirit of God ever has of this beautiful characteristic of the bride of Christ.<a name=157:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An equally touching illustration of the ministry of refreshment is seen when David was refreshed by his three mighty men.<a name=157:8></a> It is a record of devoted affection; for when David longed and said, "Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate!<a name=157:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#11:17">1 Chronicles  11:17</a>).<a name=157:10></a> The three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water and brought it to David.<a name=157:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Their deep concern was to refresh their king.<a name=157:12></a> It was an objective great enough to cause them to put their lives in jeopardy; and by their exploit they gratified his heart and gave him an occasion for

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are living in the day of the Spirit of God, and He is inseparably associated with the ministry of refreshment.<a name=158:2></a> The Lord's promise that the Spirit should be in the believer "a fountain of water" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>), and that there should flow out of him "rivers of living water" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a>), denoted that the presence of the Holy Spirit would bring refreshment to myriads.<a name=158:3></a> Almost immediately after His descent, Peter made a striking reference to it when he called upon the men of Israel to "Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of your sins, so that <i>times of refreshing</i> may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:19">Acts  3:19</a>, 20).<a name=158:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although Israel as a nation did not then repent, these times of refreshing are being spiritually enjoyed even today, by power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=158:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By the power of the Spirit, too, the gospel is being preached.<a name=158:6></a> "As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:25">Proverbs  25:25</a>).<a name=158:7></a> God's good news is still carrying refreshment to weary souls in the name of Jesus, who said, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and <i>I will give you rest</i>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:28">Matthew  11:28</a>).<a name=158:8></a> Many are proving Him to be "as brooks of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#32:2">Isaiah  32:2</a>).<a name=158:9></a>

		And so, throughout, Luke has in view that the saints should become a company of priests.<a name=167:5></a> Hence, when you come to the end of his narrative you have the disciples led out as far as Bethany by the Lord (chapter 24: 50).<a name=167:6></a> It is a beautiful scene, a most touching scene; and having arrived there He lifts up His hands and blesses them -- that was a priestly act; and having blessed them, He is parted from them and carried up into heaven; that is, He has gone up in their view, and disappears out of their view as a Priest; and, dear brethren, one might add to that, we have Him in heaven in that office.<a name=167:7></a>

		It would seem clear that our eyes are turned now towards the end of the dispensation; if we are not to be raptured immediately, at any rate we are to be occupied with what is suitable at the end, for it is a time, as we have often heard, of finishing, and we would use such an occasion as this to encourage one another to finish well.<a name=212:9></a> So I ventured to read scriptures relating to Paul and Peter and John, that we might gather up some of the features which should characterise the saints at the end of their time on earth.<a name=212:10></a> The verse has come to me relating to Joseph:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=213>[Page 213]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"By faith Joseph when dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:22">Hebrews  11:22</a>).<a name=213:1></a> We are now concerned with the going forth of the sons of God, desiring that all that is suitable to sonship in dignity, love, maturity and glory should characterise us now, and not only this, but the full framework of the truth.<a name=213:2></a> It is now the going forth of the sons of God, not the sons of Israel going out of Egypt, but the sons of God as leaving this scene altogether, and going out characterised by every feature of the truth relating to the true Joseph, our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=213:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Other features may be added, but I would speak of Paul as a characteristic <i>son</i> at the finish of his time; just as I would speak of Peter as an <i>elder</i>, and of John as a <i>brother</i>, believing that these features of manhood should have their place with us fully as we reach the end of the assembly's time here.<a name=213:4></a> It is to be noticed, in the second epistle to Timothy, that, though the times are very hard and very hostile, there is no sense of defeat.<a name=213:5></a> In no sense is Paul going out as a weakling.<a name=213:6></a> If he speaks of his death, he speaks of it as a "release".<a name=213:7></a> If he speaks of what is to come, it is in terms of joy -- what is laid up for him, and what he is preserved for.<a name=213:8></a> If he speaks of his path, it is in terms of what is finished.<a name=213:9></a> He says, "I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race".<a name=213:10></a> Although in such poor days, he is not going out in depression.<a name=213:11></a> He is going out like a son, conscious of his dignity and his approval.<a name=213:12></a> We are impressed with the <i>quality</i> of the person that is going out.<a name=213:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Paul at the end of the Acts gives us an insight into many things which attach to this.<a name=214:1></a> Paul's active ministry, as presented in the Acts, finishes at chapter 20; thereafter we see Paul personally as representative of the testimony, the finish of the testimony.<a name=214:2></a> So I would interweave that with this great finish of his in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4">2 Timothy  4</a>.<a name=214:3></a> Whether it be Paul personally or ourselves as in the testimony, both are to go out without a spot, without a stain.<a name=214:4></a> The testimony is not to finish in weakness; it is to finish in purity and power.<a name=214:5></a> That means that we are all to be in it, for we are speaking of the testimony as expressed in persons who carry it towards the finish of their own age, the assembly's time here.<a name=214:6></a> Hence, if we are to finish thus, we shall need, like Paul, to exercise ourselves to have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards men.<a name=214:7></a> Matters of purity, matters of righteousness, matters which concern us and our contact with sin and a sinful world, all are to be attended to with pure and good consciences at the end.<a name=214:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we think of Israel for a moment, their going out of Egypt was just like this in principle.<a name=214:9></a> They not only fed upon what God had done for them in Christ typically as the passover lamb, but they fed also on the unleavened bread, meaning that we are to be concerned about "sincerity and truth" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:8">1 Corinthians  5:8</a>) as leaving this scene.<a name=214:10></a> There are to be no complaints as we go, no complaints between one and another, but sincerity and truth, speaking the truth, holding the truth, doing what is right, feeding on Christ, and feeding on the principles of sincerity and truth as

		<a name=215>[Page 215]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		suggested in the unleavened bread.<a name=215:1></a> I believe that may be taken as a fair parallel between Israel's history and our own, as we go out.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing I would mention is the way in which God is helping us circumstantially.<a name=215:3></a> In the latter chapters of the Acts, Paul, being a prisoner, came under the charge of the centurion.<a name=215:4></a> The centurion was bidden to keep him, but not keep him in great hardship, not to keep him in distress.<a name=215:5></a> He was to keep him, but at the same time allowing him to be ministered to and to be refreshed by the visits of his friends (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#28:16">Acts  28:16</a> - 31).<a name=215:6></a> God is helping us in these days, by making the very "powers that be" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:1">Romans  13:1</a>, A.<a name=215:7></a>V.<a name=215:8></a>) favourable as we may stay here just a little longer.<a name=215:9></a> The centurion was the very sign in himself that the Roman Empire was there.<a name=215:10></a> Presently it will be revived in full by God to be judged for slaying His Son.<a name=215:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now God is using "the powers that be", just as He used the centurion, and the power which he represented, to preserve Paul for a time in some measure of comfort.<a name=215:12></a> Hence we have these occasions, and we have our fellowship meetings; we have our visits from our friends and our brethren; this is a part of the merciful ordering of our God.<a name=215:13></a> Alongside of that there is, as I said, this matter of the persons going out without any blame.<a name=215:14></a> Each of these men in authority from Claudius Lysias onwards down to Agrippa (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#23">Acts  23</a>- 26) says, in his own way, that Paul was without blame.<a name=215:15></a> There is no fault in him, nothing in him worthy of prison or bonds.<a name=215:16></a> What a testimony!<a name=215:17></a> We may well be concerned that we may go out
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=216>[Page 216]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		without blame, without stain as to the features of the testimony.<a name=216:1></a> It means practical righteousness; it means that all the features of our life are conducted properly; it means that piety must have its place so that God may be brought fully into all our circumstances.<a name=216:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would speak finally of Paul in relation to his standing before Agrippa .<a name=216:3></a>.<a name=216:4></a>.<a name=216:5></a> He says to Paul, "In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian" (chapter 26: 28).<a name=216:6></a> Paul says, "I would to God … that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as <i>I</i> also am" (verse 29).<a name=216:7></a> What an appeal!<a name=216:8></a> And what was the testimony of Paul in those circumstances?<a name=216:9></a> It was that he had seen a light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=216:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is not merely the third reference to his conversion; it is not really an historical matter; it is Paul putting on record his impression as to the light that shone about him.<a name=216:11></a> It is really Ephesian light, as Paul says to the Ephesians, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a>).<a name=216:12></a> It is Ephesian light; a light which we are enjoying in our own time now.<a name=216:13></a> It is the light under which we are to finish, the brightest light that has ever shone, the light of Christ in glory about to receive the assembly.<a name=216:14></a> So, he says, at mid-day he saw a light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=216:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would just appeal for a moment to us all, especially to our younger brethren, that these things might weigh with us, for if we are to be sons, and go out like sons, we must be sure that we are taking in that which belongs to the best portion, sonship's
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=217>[Page 217]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		portion.<a name=217:1></a> Paul was a son.<a name=217:2></a> He preached the Son of God, and God revealed His Son in him.<a name=217:3></a> He spoke about the Spirit of adoption.<a name=217:4></a> He was with God as a son; he was sympathetic with God.<a name=217:5></a> It is one of the marks of sons, that they are sympathetic with God, not only in regard of the great things to come, but in regard of the sufferings of the present time.<a name=217:6></a> It says, "the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:19">Romans  8:19</a>).<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul goes out thus; He says, in his closing words, "Use diligence to come to me quickly".<a name=217:8></a> Let us respond to this appeal to come to Paul quickly.<a name=217:9></a> Demas has forsaken him.<a name=217:10></a> Demas is now found in the world, going in for the elements of the world.<a name=217:11></a> It is left to Timothy and to those like him, and it is open to each one of us, to use diligence to come to Paul quickly; that is, to come in at the time of the glory, just as we are about to finish.<a name=217:12></a> So Paul goes out in power, like others before him, with no sense of weakness or defeat, a finished course behind him, no stain upon him, and the glory awaiting him.<a name=217:13></a> He is being preserved for the heavenly kingdom.<a name=217:14></a> What an incentive to us in these days to imbibe the spirit of Paul and to finish in dignity and in love.<a name=217:15></a>

		In reading these verses, I have no thought of confining myself to what they present; my thought is to show what accrues to God from the gospel as presented in this remarkable letter to the saints at Rome, namely, that believers as set up on the ground of redemption should be here for the will of God, or, to refer to the types, should become boards for the tabernacle (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#26:15">Exodus  26:15</a> - 25).<a name=225:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospel, as spoken of elsewhere, is perhaps more comprehensive than the letter to the Romans sets forth.<a name=225:2></a> We have "the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:11">1 Timothy  1:11</a>) spoken of; then we have also the "glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>), but Romans is "God's glad tidings" (chapter 1: 1), and has in view, as I said, that God should have men and women here on this earth, subject to His will, and whom He can employ, according to that will, in setting forth what they have proved Him to be in their own souls through the gospel.<a name=225:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavenly position is not in view in this epistle, although the basis for it is laid.<a name=225:4></a> The word 'heaven' is scarcely used in the epistle, indeed only in one instance, and in that instance it is to tell us that wrath comes from heaven, "For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety" (chapter 1: 18), so that it is not the glad tidings of the

		land, as we may speak, that is presented to us here.<a name=226:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>, you will remember, it is said that certain had the glad tidings presented to them, but it "did not profit <i>them</i>, not being mixed with faith in those who heard" (verse 2); that was the glad tidings of the land.<a name=226:2></a> It refers to the report, brought by the twelve spies who had been sent to investigate and report to Moses and the congregation what the land was (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13">Numbers  13</a>, 14); it is their report that is alluded to in that passage.<a name=226:3></a> That is the glad tidings of heaven; that God has a heavenly place for those who believe the gospel.<a name=226:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is not Romans.<a name=226:5></a> Romans is simply "God's glad tidings", and Paul, "a called apostle" (chapter 1: 1), is said to have been separated to it, as if to intimate that every primary movement in the gospel originated with God.<a name=226:6></a> The sending of the Lord Jesus Christ first of all, and the call of the apostle Paul, both speak of the initiative being with God; and so in regard of those in Rome that had received the gospel, they are said to be "beloved of God, <i>called</i> saints" (chapter 1: 7); that is, <i>He</i> had called them.<a name=226:7></a> It was not simply that they went by that name, but that they were called to that.<a name=226:8></a> Paul was a called apostle, and they were called saints.<a name=226:9></a> Then the apostle announces that he was not ashamed of the gospel, not because it spoke of a heavenly position, but because it was "God's power to salvation" (verse 16); but note it was "to salvation, to <i>every one that believes</i>"; as Paul says elsewhere, "to us that are saved it is God's power" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:18">1 Corinthians  1:18</a>), that is, the preaching of the cross.<a name=226:10></a>

		Now I want to ask the question, whether we, as believers, have come to that, for I assume that we are all believers here tonight, or nearly all, and I would put it to you as to whether you have come to it in your soul, that the gospel is the power of God.<a name=227:1></a> It is an immense thing to realise the power of God in your soul, for that is where it is operative now, the power that wrought in raising Christ from the dead is operative now in the souls of believers (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a>, 20); as it is said in a fuller sense in another scripture, "the power which works in us" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:20">Ephesians  3:20</a>).<a name=227:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what we get in the opening of this (Roman) epistle, and now I want to show you when the apostle comes to his point -- for one may say the early part of the epistle (that is, the first two chapters and the latter part of the third chapter), are introductory -- when he comes to the working out of the gospel, he introduces a thought that should ever be before our souls, namely, <i>the glory of God</i>.<a name=227:3></a> "All have sinned", he says, "and come short of the glory of God" (chapter 3: 23).<a name=227:4></a> That is a remarkable expression, and it is one that, as I said, should be ever before our souls, because it intimates a certain standard that God has before Him in regard to things on this earth.<a name=227:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As yet it is not a question of His glory in heaven, it is a question of what is on this earth.<a name=227:6></a> In order to show the bearing of the expression, I would refer you to the well-known psalm: he "gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:61">Psalm  78:61</a>).<a name=227:7></a> It referred to Christ; that is the ark, to use a type; the ark was the glory; it was

		that in which, figuratively, God could overthrow the enemy's power, and find a resting-place for His people, who in turn found a resting-place for Him.<a name=228:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to bear in mind what God has embodied in this way; that is, He has brought in in Christ One who delighted to do His will.<a name=228:2></a> A wonderful Person to have here on earth!<a name=228:3></a> He says, "To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a> 8).<a name=228:4></a> Even if that will involved His going down underneath the dark waters of death and judgment, He would take that way.<a name=228:5></a> So when the ark moved, Moses says, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thy face" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10:35">Numbers  10:35</a>).<a name=228:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was Christ going into death.<a name=228:7></a> "Let thine enemies be scattered", what a scattering there was of the enemies of God when Christ went into death and rose out of it!<a name=228:8></a> They were all banded together there, all the elements of evil were banded together at the cross against Jehovah and against His anointed, but the Ark went forward, and as the Ark went forward the enemies were scattered, and all that hated God fled before Him.<a name=228:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we read the records of the resurrection of Christ in the four gospels, our souls are filled with the sense of victory.<a name=228:10></a> You see the enemies melting away like snow -- scattering.<a name=228:11></a> "The guards trembled", as the angel of the Lord, whose countenance was like lightning, sat on the stone of the sepulchre (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:2">Matthew  28:2</a> - 4).<a name=228:12></a> What could man do with an angel whose "look was as lightning"?<a name=228:13></a> The guards trembled

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there was not only the moving, the setting forward of the ark, but there was the returning of the ark.<a name=229:2></a> When the ark rested, Moses said, "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10:36">Numbers  10:36</a>).<a name=229:3></a> Now you come to the circle of faith.<a name=229:4></a> If the ark found a resting-place for the people, if Christ has found a resting-place for our consciences and our hearts through His death and resurrection, what is it for, but that we should find and afford a resting-place for Him?<a name=229:5></a> I have no doubt that in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>we get the circle of the enemies -- "Bashan's strong ones", "dogs", an "assembly of evil-doers", "the lion's mouth" -- but in verse 21 the Lord says, "Yea, from the horns of the buffaloes hast thou answered me".<a name=229:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From that extreme point of evil where He stood for God, where He maintained God's righteousness and His holiness, God heard Him, and so in the next verse He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee".<a name=229:7></a> It was, as it were, the returning of the ark unto the many thousands of Israel; and I would have every one of us here tonight to know that we belong to <i>that</i> Israel, the Israel of God.<a name=229:8></a> God would have a resting-place in the midst of the myriads, the thousands of Israel.<a name=229:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>, we have not only the ark but the mercy-seat.<a name=230:6></a> The ark was made of shittim (acacia) wood covered within and without with gold.<a name=230:7></a> I suppose the gold is what is of God.<a name=230:8></a> Christ "went through all quarters doing good .<a name=230:9></a>.<a name=230:10></a>.<a name=230:11></a> because God was with him" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>).<a name=230:12></a> It was a question of showing forth what God is.<a name=230:13></a> But the mercy-seat was all of gold, and its dimensions were commensurate with the ark in the sense that it was the same length and the same breadth.<a name=230:14></a> The ark had the additional dimension of depth, and it contained the tables of the covenant.<a name=230:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the heart of Christ there was ever His delight in the law -- He delighted to do the will of God -- but the mercy-seat was all of gold, because it was in this that God was set forth.<a name=230:16></a> It was a delight for God to look into the heart of Christ, but God was in the mercy-seat for man.<a name=230:17></a> God has found One in whom He can set forth His righteousness, and that, too, in respect of the passing by of sins that had taken place before.<a name=230:18></a> Satan might have questioned the

		anxious that the truth shall be left amongst the brethren, the truth at its best.<a name=234:1></a> We are told that "if any one aspires to exercise oversight, he desires a good work" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:1">1 Timothy  3:1</a>).<a name=234:2></a> This is very closely connected with the development of eldership.<a name=234:3></a> The apostle Paul, in dealing with the Ephesian elders, speaks of them as elders and as overseers and as shepherds (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>); they are all connected, and these things should be in our minds.<a name=234:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter here is a man who, having already ministered to the saints, is ministering, perhaps, for the last time, and the question is what shall be left among the saints.<a name=234:5></a> What would an elder leave?<a name=234:6></a> We may say, perhaps, to ourselves, that there is not much likelihood of our becoming elders or taking on the features of eldership, but we may find great encouragement in Peter here (as we do in Jacob in the Old Testament), for he was a man who made many mistakes and yet was recovered.<a name=234:7></a> Peter was recovered from every one of them and, when his time came to minister, he ministered in power.<a name=234:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose there is no ministry so powerful as the ministry of a thoroughly recovered and adjusted person, whether it be Moses, or David, or Peter, or John or even Paul; the ministry of these devoted servants as recovered is without parallel.<a name=234:9></a> Peter, the one who, in the presence of a spiritual revelation, had descended immediately to the sentiment of the flesh; the one who, with others, had slept in the presence of the glory; who, with others, had slept in the presence of the sufferings of Christ; and yet he was

		fully recovered.<a name=235:1></a> The Lord paid special attention to him.<a name=235:2></a> Our attention has been drawn to this matter of recovery, and we would speak carefully and humbly to one another, for, if we are anything, we are recovered persons.<a name=235:3></a> If there is to be ministry it must be through recovered persons.<a name=235:4></a> Certainly the one who speaks tonight comes into that category.<a name=235:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter leaves some of the brightest possible features of ministry with the brethren in this dark setting of his second letter.<a name=235:6></a> He leaves a ministry of the Person of Christ, and there is nothing to affect our souls like that.<a name=235:7></a> He says, "we have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cleverly imagined fables, but having been eyewitnesses of <i>his</i> majesty".<a name=235:8></a> Then he speaks of the voice: "such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory".<a name=235:9></a> I suppose that refers to God the Father.<a name=235:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		… So this is one of the finishing features.<a name=235:11></a> Peter speaks as one whose tabernacle is coming down.<a name=235:12></a> It is remarkable to see the tabernacle coming down in a great servant, whether it be in scriptural times or in our own times.<a name=235:13></a> How affecting it is!<a name=235:14></a> But what remains is not so much the servant, but his impression of Christ passed on to us, as Peter passes it on here.<a name=235:15></a> It is not a cunningly devised fable, but the report of that which he has seen himself.<a name=235:16></a> Could we not encourage one another, in this way, to exchange our impressions in a holy way concerning the greatness of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=235:17></a> We are to know what He is to the Father; the voice being uttered to Him "by the excellent glory".<a name=235:18></a>

		We take our stand, as it were, with the disciples in the setting of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and hear a divine Person in manhood speaking to another divine Person in heaven.<a name=236:1></a> What a privilege this is!<a name=236:2></a> What impressions have we of it?<a name=236:3></a> Peter had this impression, which he leaves for us.<a name=236:4></a> Not only so, but there is what we have learnt to value likewise, namely, the prophetic word.<a name=236:5></a> It is not the prophetic word now as showing us where we are in the history of the assembly, or in the history of the times of the Gentiles, but the prophetic word now as helping us in view of the new day.<a name=236:6></a> It says here, "we have the prophetic word made surer, to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts".<a name=236:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the prophetic word, as known amongst us, dear brethren, is to help us to finish.<a name=236:8></a> It stands related to what is going to be finished here and be taken over in our persons into the heavenly realm.<a name=236:9></a> How convicting are the prophetic words of Scripture!<a name=236:10></a> We have to ask ourselves whether our prophetic words, as known in our assembly setting, are convicting; whether they carry power and reality; whether the prophet is himself in power.<a name=236:11></a> This is one of the things which Peter would hand down to us.<a name=236:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mind of God is to be known for the moment by way of the prophetic word in view of the day dawning.<a name=236:13></a> So it would be well if we had amongst us a ministry of Christ, according to His glory, and a ministry of the mind of God until the end -- the mind of God in relation to the assembly, all of us to be

		searched by it and built up by it, for "he that prophesies edifies the assembly" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:4">1 Corinthians  14:4</a>).<a name=237:1></a> Peter would leave us with that, as a kind of avenue to finishing well with Paul, "our beloved brother Paul", as he says (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:15">2 Peter  3:15</a>).<a name=237:2></a> He would hand us over to Paul as being equipped with great impressions of Christ and great understanding of the mind of God.<a name=237:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In coming to John I would add a word, speaking of John as the brother.<a name=237:4></a> I suppose sonship is what the saints are primarily for God, they are the sons of God, but the brother is the relation in which we stand to one another.<a name=237:5></a> It would involve, too, that great exalted setting in which the Lord Jesus says, "my brethren" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=237:6></a> The brother means love, not only love in a general way, but in a family setting.<a name=237:7></a> The brother introduces the family thought.<a name=237:8></a> As soon as Paul comes to the brother, in the end of Romans, he can begin to speak of the mystery.<a name=237:9></a> He indicates that as soon as he has referred to "the brother Quartus" (chapter 16: 23), he can open out what is in his heart in relation to the gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ and the mystery.<a name=237:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is a good thing to have right impressions of a brother, and John sets it out.<a name=237:11></a> He says, "I John, your brother".<a name=237:12></a> He sets it out in circumstances of pressure, in tribulation.<a name=237:13></a> He says, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>).<a name=237:14></a> So we rightly turn to his last writing to see how John treats this great matter of love.<a name=237:15></a> We may well encourage one another in it, not only the general expression of love, but what

	<div class="paragraph">
		it is to be lovable.<a name=238:1></a> John presents to us lovable persons.<a name=238:2></a> He speaks of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son.<a name=238:3></a> "The Father loves the Son", he says, "and shews him all things which he himself does" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:20">John  5:20</a>).<a name=238:4></a> He does it, we may say, because the Son is so lovable in Himself.<a name=238:5></a> He calls forth the Father's heart to show Him all that He is doing.<a name=238:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says later of the Spirit, "he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.<a name=238:7></a> All things that the Father has are mine; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce it to you", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a>, 15).<a name=238:8></a> He has the Father's things as well.<a name=238:9></a> The Father has shown them to Him, because of His lovableness.<a name=238:10></a> I am not seeking thus to limit the Lord's Person, of course, but that one feature which comes into that setting.<a name=238:11></a> The Lord Jesus, in His manhood, in His sonship, is so lovable here that the Father shows Him all that He is doing.<a name=238:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there are others.<a name=238:13></a> There is Lazarus, a sample person .<a name=238:14></a>.<a name=238:15></a>.<a name=238:16></a> They said, when Lazarus was, sick, "he whom thou lovest is sick" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:3">John  11:3</a>).<a name=238:17></a> Lazarus was a person like ourselves, who called out the Lord's love; not only His help and His mercy, but His love.<a name=238:18></a> I must confess to desiring to be loved by the Lord in this way.<a name=238:19></a> John himself, "That disciple … whom Jesus loved" (chapter 21: 7), finds a place in the Lord's bosom, because he was lovable, and the disciples share that place too, the place of love.<a name=238:20></a> "The Father himself", the Lord says, "has affection for you" (chapter 16: 27).<a name=238:21></a>

		lovable persons, so as to invite us into this great realm to which the brother really belongs.<a name=239:1></a> So we can understand the way in which John records, at the end of his gospel, the recovery of Peter, his brother.<a name=239:2></a> We have no astonishment now that John found it easy to work with Peter in the Acts, for he had seen or known of his recovery.<a name=239:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord had visited Peter.<a name=239:4></a> He said to him three times, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?<a name=239:5></a>", etc.<a name=239:6></a> That last time is peculiarly touching.<a name=239:7></a> It is as much as to say, Simon, do you find anything in Me that is lovable?<a name=239:8></a> Peter's answer is, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee" (verse 17).<a name=239:9></a> It was the love of personal attachment.<a name=239:10></a> He says, "Lord, thou knowest all things".<a name=239:11></a> That is what the Lord knew intuitively, in virtue of His Person; but when he says, "thou knowest that I am attached to thee", it is as if he said, 'Lord, Thou canst recognise in me now the signs that I do love Thee.<a name=239:12></a> Thou canst see the signs that I am really attached to Thee'.<a name=239:13></a> This is John, the brother, recording the recovery of his own brother.<a name=239:14></a> How he delights to record that at the end!<a name=239:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add, that while Paul speaks of his release, and Peter speaks of his departure, we do not read about John's departure.<a name=239:16></a> We have been reminded that, in a spiritual sense, John remains with us right up to our departing, and, we may say, what he represents stays with us for all time and goes into eternity, for what he represents is love, not love in terms merely, but real love which calls forth love.<a name=239:17></a>

		His writings assure us of the best.<a name=240:1></a> The good wine is kept until now -- the glory of the Person of Christ, the high levels of the ministry, reaching upward to "my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=240:2></a> It is the best, the highest.<a name=240:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what is reserved for us, according to John.<a name=240:4></a> If he speaks about the brother, he has in mind the Lord's words to Mary, "go to my brethren".<a name=240:5></a> He would think of the Lord Jesus, in His sonship, in His glory, as there above, and that He has sanctified Himself for us.<a name=240:6></a> That is, up there in glory, He so regards us here, according to His own position as Man in sonship.<a name=240:7></a> This is God's thought for man according to His counsels, God's counsels of love standing relative to man.<a name=240:8></a> So we may say, taking that into account, that he shows man at his best too; not only in Christ, but man according to the great race of which Christ is the Head.<a name=240:9></a> These are great thoughts, and I believe John would make them very attractive to us at the end, for he remains.<a name=240:10></a> The Lord says so, in this mysterious way, as we have heard.<a name=240:11></a> He remains, which means that all the best that love and glory have, remain too for us until the end.<a name=240:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So whether it be in the spirit of Paul going out in dignity, finishing in glory, whether it be in the great high levels of the testimony, or whether it be in these great relationships of love, as John presents them, we may comfort one another, clothing the brethren with these thoughts, so that we may together finish well.<a name=240:13></a> As the prophet says, that we may "flow together" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:12">Jeremiah  31:12</a>).<a name=240:14></a> We shall be caught up together,

		The remainder of the sixth verse adds the precious statement, "wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved".<a name=250:14></a> Marvellous portion!<a name=250:15></a> Set now in the full favour of God, by God Himself, according to His own thoughts about, and His own heart's delight in, "the Beloved"; not simply "in Christ", but "in the Beloved".<a name=250:16></a> It is Christ, of course; but here only in all the Scriptures is He called by this blessed name.<a name=250:17></a> Elsewhere He is owned of God the Father as "my beloved Son" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:5">Matthew  17:5</a>), but when He brings out the wondrous position of favour into which He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now remark, further, that in Ephesians the blessing is presented in the richest manner.<a name=251:17></a> The most expressive language is employed by the Holy Spirit to convey its fulness and extent.<a name=251:18></a> "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, <i>according to the riches of his grace</i>".<a name=251:19></a> Can you form an estimate of the riches of the grace of God?<a name=251:20></a> Can you reckon their amount?<a name=251:21></a> Can you

	<div class="paragraph">
		Other precious truths are unfolded in the remainder of this wonderful chapter, which begins so blessedly; but we must close.<a name=252:4></a> We would, however, briefly call the attention of our readers to the different ways in which the truth is presented in Romans and Ephesians.<a name=252:5></a> In the former, it commences with man's condition, brings out the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, and, in chapters 8 and 9, brings the believer up to the purposes of God.<a name=252:6></a> But the latter (Ephesians) begins with the counsels and purposes in the heart and mind of God, and gradually comes down to the ground on which we enter into the blessings of His grace in the seventh verse, at which we have been looking, but more fully, in chapter 2.<a name=252:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to David, how stimulating it is to see that his feelings as to Jerusalem find expression in song.<a name=258:3></a> Sentiments that do not centre in Jerusalem (for us, the assembly) only give rise to a dirge of complaints and to disintegration.<a name=258:4></a> God has no other city; in the early part of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>we see it as the "new Jerusalem" (verse 2) going into eternity.<a name=258:5></a> In the hearts of God's lovers, sovereignly enlightened as to the assembly, Jerusalem awakens the keenest feelings and emotions in relation to all that it stands for; for the assembly is indeed the touchstone of devotion to divine Persons and divine interests.<a name=258:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever may be claimed in favour of so-called useful activities current in the religious world, our measure in relation to divine Persons is bound up with the present and continual devotion to the assembly, upon which all our activities are to converge.<a name=258:7></a> Grace gives us the opportunity for this in our localities.<a name=258:8></a> Sad indeed is the portion of those permanently isolated from their brethren.<a name=258:9></a> To settle down to isolation, is to cut oneself off from all church education and privilege, and to deprive oneself of the living flow of the river of God, thus providing the foe in his subtlety with an easy prey.<a name=258:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that David's devotion to God and His supreme interest took root with him in early years.<a name=259:3></a> Who is there in the Scriptures who, as used specifically by God for His service, was not taken up young?<a name=259:4></a> David was probably still in his teens when he was thinking of the ark, and in communion with God about it as the centre of all God's thoughts.<a name=259:5></a> It was not when the ark -- the symbol of divine power -- was in Jerusalem that David made this vow of which <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>speaks, but when it was neglected in Kirjath-jearim (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:2">1 Samuel  7:2</a>, 3).<a name=259:6></a> "Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we found it in the fields of the wood;" David followed up the matter in spiritual energy.<a name=259:7></a> Many matters had to be settled prior to the ark being brought into its resting-place in Jerusalem; Goliath had to be dealt with, and issues with the brethren patiently borne in the testings that brought out the moral worth of God's anointed, ever furnishing God with the warrant for His sovereign selection.<a name=259:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		David links up with himself all the brethren in saying, "We heard of it … we found it".<a name=259:9></a> As his heart communed with God in relation to the ark, he instinctively understood that it was the gathering centre for all Israel, as it had been the centre in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love that distinguishes Christ personally is the love that can carry the brethren on one's heart in relation to Him in such conditions.<a name=260:5></a> God is centring a world of glory in the Man of His will, and He is bringing in already testimonially, assemblywise, persons who collectively stand together in subjection to divine commandment as to the assembly, and thus furnish in their localities a spiritual environment where the glory of the Ark shall radiate testimonially in a scene filled with man's will.<a name=260:6></a>

		Now with that in mind, the early part of the gospel of John shows us individuals who are led, held, and fitted for that, and this woman in the fourth chapter of the gospel of John is illustrative of it.<a name=270:3></a> What is so remarkable is that, in spite of what this woman is, we have the Lord personally serving her and dealing with her, and He introduces her to the truth of the Holy Spirit, the "living water" (chapter 4: 10), and He leads to the thought of the Father, and the Father seeking worshippers, individuals who are constituted worshippers, not, as I said, in any formal way, but in the character of what springs up within; for that is the figure used in regard of the living water.<a name=270:4></a>

		It is a great necessity, dear brethren, that every brother and sister should understand that the Lord is ready to serve him or her individually so that this might come to pass, and the Spirit is ready to serve him or her individually, and the Father is appreciative of our movements of affection and response toward Him.<a name=270:5></a> It is of great importance that every one should understand that the whole Godhead -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit -- are interested in us personally, and are concerned about our being set free from everything that would hinder us from

		The Lord was weary and sitting on this well to which the woman came.<a name=271:2></a> "Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain" (verse 6).<a name=271:3></a> That is, He sat there a weary Man.<a name=271:4></a> Why does it tell us that?<a name=271:5></a> I believe it is to convey to us how very near the Lord Jesus has come to us, so near that He could actually experience weariness.<a name=271:6></a> It is to convey to us how sympathetic He is, how tender He is, that He understands and enters feelingly, sin apart, into the experiences that we may ourselves have part in.<a name=271:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is further said in the book of Exodus that these boards were set up in sockets of silver, which typifies our being established on the ground of redemption; that is the truth of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>, I need not remark.<a name=275:2></a> The blood of Christ is the foundation on which we rest in the faith of our souls; that is our public position, the ground on which we stand in the wilderness in relation to Christ, and in relation to God.<a name=275:3></a> We are standing up, but we are not standing up severally, each on his own responsibility, we are standing up in relation to one another; that is, as it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, "For, as in one body we have many members .<a name=275:4></a>.<a name=275:5></a>.<a name=275:6></a> thus we, being many, are one body in Christ" (verses 4, 5); not <i>of</i> Christ, mark, but <i>in</i> Christ.<a name=275:7></a> Now that is the position we occupy as believers, according to this epistle.<a name=275:8></a> In other words, we are standing up, held together in that position in Christ.<a name=275:9></a>

		In regard to the binding principle, you have in the type that there were certain bars, set in certain rings, by which all these boards as standing together were held in unity, and then it says there was one bar which reached from end to end, which, I believe, refers to the Spirit.<a name=275:10></a> Now do you understand that you have the Holy Spirit as a believer?<a name=275:11></a> In chapter 5 He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is that one long bar, as one may say, extending from end to end, holding all together.<a name=276:2></a> How blessed is that position.<a name=276:3></a> I would, as I said, put it to every one here who is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, as to whether you apprehend that His will concerning you is that you should stand up here as a redeemed person, not on the ground of what you may be naturally, for that is all of no value to God, whatever it is; the ground on which you rest according to Romans is the ground of the redemption work of the Lord Jesus Christ, as it is said, "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus" (chapter 3: 24).<a name=276:4></a> That is the ground on which we stand publicly.<a name=276:5></a>

		In regard to the verses which I read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14">Romans  14</a>, you will see from what I have said that I do not intend to dwell on them, but only to show how the lordship of Christ is asserted.<a name=277:2></a> In this chapter the apostle enters a plea for the weak brother; and it is important to bear in mind that such a plea is entered by the apostle in this chapter.<a name=277:3></a> The weak ones are to be the subjects of special care among the people of God.<a name=277:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must always be on the look-out for the weak, because Amalek is after them (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#25:18">Deuteronomy  25:18</a>).<a name=277:5></a> Those who are weak, and cannot march on with the others, are always exposed to Amalek, and so, "<i>we</i> ought, we that are strong", the apostle says in the next chapter, "to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves" (chapter 15: 1).<a name=277:6></a> Oh!<a name=277:7></a> how much self-pleasing there is among the people of God, pleasing ourselves.<a name=277:8></a> But we read, "For the Christ also did not please himself" (verse 3).<a name=277:9></a> That is what the next chapter teaches; He is the Model; "as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me".<a name=277:10></a> That was the Lord Jesus; He did not avoid the darts that were aimed against God, He bared His breast, so to speak, to receive them.<a name=277:11></a> He was utterly devoid of self-pleasing.<a name=277:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, dear friends, to be in correspondence with Christ, as believers in Him, we are enjoined that we should not be self-pleasers -- self-pleasers cannot be boards in the tabernacle -- and I can conceive of nothing more honourable, or more to be desired at the present time, in a world of utter lawlessness, than

		It may be you are in some outlying place where you get little practical support from the Lord's people, but there is nothing more to be desired as here in this wilderness than to stand up in the will of God, to refuse to be conformed to this world, but on the contrary to be "transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a> 2).<a name=278:3></a> And so, as I said, the apostle in this chapter puts in a plea for the weak brother.<a name=278:4></a> We must not offend him; Christ has died for him; he is on a socket of silver the same as you are; you must watch him; and so the apostle says, If he regards the day, well, he regards it unto the Lord.<a name=278:5></a> He has the Lord before him.<a name=278:6></a> If he does not regard the day, well then it is to the Lord he does not regard it.<a name=278:7></a> You see the principle is making due allowance for the brother's conscience.<a name=278:8></a> And then in speaking of what may seem to be a trivial, insignificant subject, a weak brother, he brings in this great fact, that "none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself .<a name=278:9></a>.<a name=278:10></a>.<a name=278:11></a> both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's".<a name=278:12></a> Do you recognise that?<a name=278:13></a> That is what I call the proprietary rights of Christ.<a name=278:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord does not set up His standard in the way that different nations assert their proprietary rights, but He sets His mark on those that are redeemed; they belong to Him.<a name=278:15></a> May we be led to acknowledge it, dear friends, that "none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself .<a name=278:16></a>.<a name=278:17></a>.<a name=278:18></a> both if we should live then,

		The Lord also speaks of Himself in connection with the Comforter and His presence here, saying, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you.<a name=295:4></a> Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live".<a name=295:5></a> He indicates that in this present time, not only will He visit and come to us, but that by the Spirit we shall be preserved in the appreciation of Himself as living on high.<a name=295:6></a> We shall live by His life, and as in affection linked with Him by the Spirit.<a name=295:7></a> He goes on to say, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=295:8></a> That is one thing that the Spirit of God loves to keep before us, that Christ is in His Father, that He is in a settled place of love.<a name=295:9></a> It says, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=295:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After speaking of these things the Lord returns to this most important matter of His commandments and His word.<a name=296:3></a> A commandment is what is imperative; the idea of a commandment is that it simply must be obeyed.<a name=296:4></a> There are certain commandments indicated in Scripture which must be obeyed if we are to get anywhere in the truth.<a name=296:5></a> One is in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>, where it says, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity" (verse 19).<a name=296:6></a> It is an absolute commandment, and failure to observe it on the part of many of God's people has led to their being stranded, shipwrecked as regards the truth.<a name=296:7></a> They get nowhere as regards the truth of the assembly, although they have their title to it; they get nowhere in actual realisation and enjoyment of it.<a name=296:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As well as withdrawing from iniquity, there is the judging of it; and there is not simply withdrawing from iniquity -- that is, any system which is iniquitous in principle -- but also separating from vessels to dishonour.<a name=296:9></a> There is the authority in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>to withdraw from persons who are vessels to dishonour, a most important thing to get hold of, dear brethren.<a name=296:10></a> That is one of the commandments of the Lord.<a name=296:11></a> I would urge every brother and sister, especially those who have been brought up in the truth, to hold tenaciously to <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a> - 22, because it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am just going over this in order that we may see the ground on which we are, because it is of God.<a name=297:3></a> We are on it as having withdrawn from iniquity and separated from vessels to dishonour, and we are to follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=297:4></a> Following righteousness involves that we follow what is right in the sight of God; and, as doing that with others, we must govern ourselves by the truth given to the assembly, for there is no other truth to regulate the movements of saints together.<a name=297:5></a> Hence it is that the truth of the assembly is reached as individuals face the exercises of <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>.<a name=297:6></a> They find they are able to move together, and as moving together, they see that 1 Corinthians gives instruction for the assembly.<a name=297:7></a> The Scriptures are available to them, and they find that by the Lord's help, and the power of the Spirit, all that is set out in Corinthians is capable of being realised.<a name=297:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Corinthians is one great commandment of the Lord.<a name=297:9></a> "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a> 37).<a name=297:10></a> The whole of 1 Corinthians has that character.<a name=297:11></a> It is the Lord's commandment and must be kept.<a name=297:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel of John we read that the Lord gave a new commandment, that we are to love one another (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:34">John  13:34</a>).<a name=297:13></a> This is repeated in the first and

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2 Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>and 1 Corinthians are commandments of the Lord which regulate us in the public position, and <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, as taken up in the epistles of John, is a commandment to govern us in the inside position.<a name=298:4></a> They are all commandments that <i>must</i> be kept, and as they are kept, we will find that all the privileges of the assembly are open to us.<a name=298:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these verses 21 to 24 of <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, the Lord is occupied with the collective side of the truth, but He is bringing it down to an individual to provide for the weakest day, and also to stress that the collective side of the truth is to be entered upon by way of individual exercise: "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him".<a name=298:6></a> Judas, not the Iscariot, recognises that it is not individual truth.<a name=298:7></a> He says, "Lord, how is it that thou will manifest thyself to <i>us</i> and not to the world".<a name=298:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord then mentions something further which is very important, and that is, keeping His word: "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=298:9></a> The word of Christ, in contrast to His commandments, is what He is saying

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is very important, because, the conditions having been brought in among the saints in whom the truth of the assembly has been recovered, the Lord loves to speak continually and in no haphazard way, but in a constructive way, and it is most important that we should have an ear attentive to His word, to whatever He is saying to the whole assembly, and also to individual companies according to the local needs of those companies.<a name=299:3></a> It is only in that way that we shall progress in the truth, and be maintained in freshness, and that God will secure the full answer in the assembly that He is looking for, that is, as we are formed in our intelligence and affections, and enlarged, by the living word of Christ.<a name=299:4></a> "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=299:5></a> We have settled, abiding conditions, dwelling conditions, for the Father and the Son secured amongst the saints.<a name=299:6></a>

		And now, after speaking of what the Comforter would be to us as Teacher, to which I have already alluded, the Lord says, "Ye have heard that I have said unto you, I go away and I am coming to you.<a name=299:7></a> If ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father, for my Father is greater than I".<a name=299:8></a> That is, the Lord has a company loving Him, who keep His commandments and His word, and that company He is able to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember how David said as he turned to God, "thou art exalted as Head above all" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29">1 Chronicles  29</a> 11).<a name=300:3></a> That is what the Lord loves to do in the assembly as He carries the saints with Him to the Father.<a name=300:4></a> He says, "my Father is greater than I", and brings them into the presence of Him who has been revealed, and who receives back through the Son, and by the Holy Spirit, an answer which satisfies His own heart.<a name=300:5></a> These are the things we have been taken up for.<a name=300:6></a> The possibilities of the assembly are immense, and the Lord would encourage us to go in for them in increasing power and liberty and joy.<a name=300:7></a>

		I want to read one scripture from the New Testament, not in a way in connection with what I have read in Isaiah, nor to unfold what we are going to read in the New Testament, but I think you will see at once the force of what I am about to read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:4">Romans  15:4</a>, "For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction" -- it is instruction for us; we learn by being instructed, as it is said -- "that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope".<a name=301:1></a> So <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#7">Isaiah  7</a>was written for our instruction, and the instruction is in view of giving us endurance and encouragement as Christians.<a name=301:2></a>

		It is a simple thing to say, but it is a blessed truth that every bit of Scripture from <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>has been written for us; and I am sure, beloved brethren, of this -- I could not speak about myself with any assurance, but one can speak about the Lord with the greatest assurance, and I feel assured that the Lord has brought us together in this room, at this time, for our encouragement; and I am sure, too, beloved, that there is abundant encouragement for us in the chapter I have read.<a name=301:3></a>

		These seven chapters -- I mean those from chapter 6 to chapter 12 -- form a distinct section of the prophecies by Isaiah.<a name=301:4></a> And the great theme of these chapters is the remnant.<a name=301:5></a> It is a very complete and definite history of the remnant; it is very precise at

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there could not be a more precise and definite beginning than that.<a name=302:4></a> And what about the end?<a name=302:5></a> Turn to it for a moment: the end is in chapters 11 and 12.<a name=302:6></a> In chapter 11 it says, "And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall be fruitful; and the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah … And righteousness shall be the girdle of his reins … The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatted beast together, and a little child shall lead them" (chapter 11: 1 - 6).<a name=302:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now then, see chapter 12, "And in that day" (verse 1) -- mark what a definite end, for, as I have said, we get a very definite beginning and a very definite end.<a name=302:8></a> And, beloved, what a marvellous finish it is!<a name=302:9></a> So far as the actual statement of these seven chapters is concerned, Christianity is not mentioned; but then we have just read that "as many things as have been written before have been written for our

		There are two sides to the truth of the remnant as set forth in Scripture.<a name=303:4></a> There is one which you may call a dark side; but if there is a dark side, there is a bright side also.<a name=303:5></a> The dark side is on the side of God's people.<a name=303:6></a> There was no remnant in the days of King David and King Solomon.<a name=303:7></a> What would you want with a remnant then?<a name=303:8></a> God had just established His people.<a name=303:9></a> Whatever trouble there had been previously in connection with Saul, it was all wiped out, and now all the twelve tribes are there, and all are <i>one</i>, and we see the glory and magnificence of the kingdom as set up by God in the midst of His people.<a name=303:10></a> You do not want any remnant there; but another day comes.<a name=303:11></a> When does the remnant come to light?<a name=303:12></a> It comes to light in a day of failure, and breakdown, and declension.<a name=303:13></a>

		Now, Isaiah, in chapter 6, describes his own experience; he testifies as a man can testify if he has seen anything; he can tell what he has seen, and if he has heard anything he can tell what he has heard.<a name=304:15></a> As John says, "we have seen and heard we report to

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now (though it is not exactly right to speak about a remnant of the assembly), our own times are remnant times, and they have been remnant times for some time back, and that is the particular interest of this part of Scripture on account of its application to us.<a name=305:5></a> The conditions and the principles of the remnant must be <i>our</i> conditions and principles, otherwise no matter what your outward position may be, and it might be that you would pass muster in a way; for instance, you are breaking bread; that is all right -- (and hold on, beloved); but we must have things in reality.<a name=305:6></a> That is the particular value of this scripture.<a name=305:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now notice another thing about Isaiah, and a very important thing it is: What is the point of his experience here?<a name=306:6></a> -- <i>he learns deliverance</i>.<a name=306:7></a> Is it deliverance from what he has <i>done</i>?<a name=306:8></a> No, deliverance from what <i>he is</i>.<a name=306:9></a> He says, "Woe unto me!<a name=306:10></a> for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips" (verse 5).<a name=306:11></a> And then being clear about himself, of course he is clear about his associations.<a name=306:12></a> You often find people finding fault with their associations.<a name=306:13></a> They grumble about others: they do not like the sects and the systems; but they seem to like themselves pretty well.<a name=306:14></a> Such people are not in the remnant spirit.<a name=306:15></a> We touch here a very practical point.<a name=306:16></a> Ah, beloved, it must be an <i>individual</i> matter, and it must begin with deliverance.<a name=306:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has foreknowledge; He knows beforehand just what a person is capable of; but the person does not know, and so God introduces the idea of tests, which results in the number being reduced, it being God's plan to work with small numbers.<a name=314:3></a> It is not a question with God of masses of men having brass checks round their necks with a number on as their identification.<a name=314:4></a> God does not work like that in His military exploits.<a name=314:5></a> He works with known persons, every one having a name, a dignity, every one conscious of being loved by God, and loved by Christ, and they are tested persons.<a name=314:6></a>

		I want to speak about the <i>divine way</i> as leading definitely to a certain end, which I may speak of later, having in view a word in Hebrews, "the new and living way" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:20">Hebrews  10:20</a>).<a name=321:1></a> I would seek to point out that the saints of this dispensation are called upon to take up that which is wholly unknown to man in the flesh, and to the world; the path which, as the word says, "no bird of prey knoweth, and the vulture's eye hath not seen it; the proud beasts have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed over it" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#28:7">Job  28:7</a>, 8).<a name=321:2></a> It is new, wholly new, and, although quite clear to those who have faith, it is wholly unknown to those who have not.<a name=321:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a time when we may have to be reminded of the divine way; crises taking place in the history of God's people make it imperative that attention has to be called to it, for the enemy is ever seeking to divert us into byways.<a name=321:4></a> Deborah spoke of "byways" before her time -- "travellers walked through byways" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#5">Judges  5</a> 6, A.<a name=321:5></a>V.<a name=321:6></a>), so their attention at that time needed to be specially called to <i>the way</i> -- "walk ye in it" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#30">Isaiah  30</a> 21).<a name=321:7></a> In truth, there is but the one way, and the use of the word in the Acts, namely "the way", suggests that it was almost a synonym of Christianity in its true sense, the gospel and the fellowship that attached to it opening up a way for the people of God, a sure way.<a name=321:8></a> So that there is really but <i>one</i> way, and the enemy's effort at all times,

		especially when a crisis occurs, is to decoy the saints.<a name=322:1></a> We may become darkened in heart and mind so that we are uncertain.<a name=322:2></a> Hence the Lord, being ever the great Shepherd and the true Shepherd, calls us back to it.<a name=322:3></a> He goeth after the sheep and He calls them back to the way, so that, as we see in the case of the man, blind Bartimaeus, we are to follow Jesus in it; he "followed him <i>in the way</i>" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:52">Mark  10:52</a>).<a name=322:4></a> The Holy Spirit had His meaning in it.<a name=322:5></a> There is a prescribed way and it is for the saints to know it.<a name=322:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, there is, in regard to approach to God, "the new and living way".<a name=322:7></a> I hope I may be able to say a word about that; it is living.<a name=322:8></a> But first, I would point out from Numbers how that God graciously takes account of all the movements of our souls, whatever they be, so we have in that record the journeyings of the children of Israel, those who went out of Egypt: "These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt according to their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.<a name=322:9></a> And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah".<a name=322:10></a> I want to touch it briefly that you may be encouraged by divine interest in your souls, whatever movements you may be making.<a name=322:11></a> God does not sympathise with us in the activities of our wills, but He never draws His eyes from us, and He takes note of all the movements of our souls, of our spiritual journey.<a name=322:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The path from Egypt to Canaan was divided up in journeys.<a name=322:13></a> It was not all one journey as you will notice.<a name=322:14></a> The word is, "These are the <i>journeys</i> of the

		children of Israel".<a name=323:1></a> It ought to have been just one journey, an "eleven days' journey" as it is said "from Horeb by way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:2">Deuteronomy  1:2</a>).<a name=323:2></a> Instead of an eleven days' journey, there were forty years of journeys, and so the word is in the plural, God taking account of the spiritual journeys of His people until they reached the confines of the land, until they reached the Jordan, by Jericho.<a name=323:3></a> It is not put as if He directed the journeys.<a name=323:4></a> What is presented is <i>their</i> journeys, and so it is constantly repeated, "<i>they</i> journeyed", and "<i>their</i> journeys".<a name=323:5></a> In that way God assures us of His sympathetic interest in all our soul movements, for Moses did not record them of his own volition, but wrote them "by the commandment of Jehovah".<a name=323:6></a> Does it not appeal to you that God takes account of all your spiritual exercises and journeys, so that they are all recorded?<a name=323:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		They went out of Egypt.<a name=323:8></a> Mark that; the journeys are journeys of those "who went forth <i>out of the land of Egypt</i> according to their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron"; the people in view are those who, typically, have definitely left the world.<a name=323:9></a> They have taken up that position in a public way by baptism, and they are under the direction of the Lord to that extent, under the direction of Christ both in His authority over their souls and His sympathy as Priest.<a name=323:10></a> These are the people in view, so you can readily determine whether you are one of these.<a name=323:11></a> I know most here are those who have taken a position definitely outside of this world, and are under the

		Thus we journey on till we come to take account of the Holy Spirit, until we are not only guided by the objective truth with Christ as He is in heaven, but when you have come to recognise the Holy Spirit as indwelling you; thus you have a new means of guidance.<a name=324:6></a> The narrative proceeds and tells us that Aaron died at a certain point (verse 38) -- the one under whose succour they had been -- but still they go on in spite of the fact that he died.<a name=324:7></a> That is, you come to a position in the soul when you are led by the Spirit of God.<a name=324:8></a> Do we understand, dear brethren, that the Holy Spirit in the believer becomes his Leader in a spiritual way?<a name=324:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		For well nigh forty years the children of Israel were guided by the tabernacle.<a name=324:10></a> The tabernacle proceeded and the tribes proceeded in their order, but after the Holy Spirit is brought in, typically in the <i>well</i> (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a>, 18), the tabernacle is no longer in evidence.<a name=324:11></a> They arrive over against Jericho, the secret being that the movement is now a spiritual leading.<a name=324:12></a> And being led by the Spirit of God, we are marked

		When you come to the Psalms, you come to the estimate of a spiritual man of what is presented elsewhere in a spiritual way.<a name=325:7></a> In the psalm we read, we have the appeal, "Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good".<a name=325:8></a> You see, it is the estimate, as one might say, of a spiritual man in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#33">Numbers  33</a>.<a name=325:9></a> How he takes account of God's interest in His people, and so he says, "Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever.<a name=325:10></a> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the oppressor, and gathered out of the countries, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea.<a name=325:11></a> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way, they found no city of habitation; hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them: then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses, and he led them forth by a right way".<a name=325:12></a> The psalmist takes account now of divine leadership, and that leadership implies <i>a right way</i>.<a name=325:13></a> Are we in a right way?<a name=325:14></a>

		The point in God's dealings with these men was to make known to them that the ground on which He was acting was that of <i>resurrection</i>.<a name=370:3></a> I think that is a point of great moment to us, as to them; it is specially marked in Abraham; he received Isaac again from the dead in figure.<a name=370:4></a> It was at the end of God's dealings with him.<a name=370:5></a> Everything that comes out to others afterwards is upon that ground.<a name=370:6></a> These illustrations of faith follow one upon another.<a name=370:7></a> I will make that plain presently.<a name=370:8></a> Isaac follows upon Abraham, and Joseph follows upon Jacob, and Moses follows upon Joseph; there is a moral sequence.<a name=370:9></a>

		And so, too, in application to us, the truth is that "he that has died is justified from sin" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:7">Romans  6:7</a>), death is the end of the captivity of sin; then as to law, "<i>ye</i> also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>), the death of Christ is the end of that bond; and as regards the flesh, how could flesh pass death?<a name=371:6></a> It may take a long time before I get practically free, but God in His testimony presents Himself in Christ entirely outside of all these questions.<a name=371:7></a> He has nothing at this time to say to man on that ground.<a name=371:8></a> The One in whom God presents Himself to man is "a quickening spirit" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a> 45).<a name=371:9></a> There is but one Man before God in resurrection, and that is <i>Christ</i>.<a name=371:10></a> He has anticipated Adam in that respect; you have to learn that lesson, and that the one Man before God in resurrection is "a
