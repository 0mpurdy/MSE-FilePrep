		I have in mind, dear brethren, to say a word as to true greatness in manhood according to God.<a name=1:1></a> There is no doubt that what God is seeking to bring about is the development of manhood in the saints, manhood which takes its character from Christ.<a name=1:2></a> We need to have God's own thoughts as to what is truly great.<a name=1:3></a> Our natural tendencies are to have our ideas formed -- or at any rate influenced -- by what is in the world around us, whereas God would always keep Christ before the minds and hearts of His people, showing us what is really great according to His estimation.<a name=1:4></a> Paul, towards the close of his course, and as being in prison and having plenty of opportunity to weigh things over, says, "For let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:5">Philippians  2:5</a> - 7).<a name=1:5></a> Then, as though that were not enough, he says, "having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross" (verse 8).<a name=1:6></a> Then, following on that remarkable presentation of the mind that was in Christ Jesus, the Man of God's purpose and pleasure, he says, "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is

		above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings" (verses  9, 10).<a name=2:1></a> God intends to ensure that throughout the whole universe, even including infernal beings, there shall be a public recognition of the One whom He delights to honour.<a name=2:2></a> The world at present is marked by despisal as regards His name, but we, as God's people, are in the secret of what God's estimation of Christ is.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One has in mind, by the Lord's help, to seek to indicate three lines on which I believe we may be developed in manhood according to Christ.<a name=2:4></a> Not, however, that there are not other ways, for even the ministry which the Lord gives from His place of exaltation far above all heavens, is intended to that very end, as we were quoting in prayer, "Until we all arrive .<a name=2:5></a>.<a name=2:6></a>.<a name=2:7></a> at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>).<a name=2:8></a> I think these three passages of scripture, from Numbers, Genesis and Esther, may serve to indicate three ways in which God would develop greatness in the saints.<a name=2:9></a> The first is in having to do with God, and the second is in sowing to the Spirit.<a name=2:10></a> The first produces moral greatness according to Christ; the second produces greatness in spiritual wealth and in spiritual substance; and the third is by means of exercises that arise as having to face evil, especially in the assembly, and as proving faithful in relation to those matters.<a name=2:11></a>

		The Lord was here in the presence of evil, finding evil in His Father's house, for they were making it a house of merchandise.<a name=2:12></a> Morally, the position was such that He said it was a den of thieves.<a name=2:13></a> He rose up in true greatness, and made a scourge of cords and drove out those that sold, and

		overturned the tables of the money-changers.<a name=3:1></a> There was no resisting the power in which He acted.<a name=3:2></a> It was done spontaneously, His heart entering into it, because His Father's name was so dishonoured by what was going on in His house.<a name=3:3></a> Christ's greatness shone, as it was continually shining in different connections, but it shone there in faithfulness to God, and came into evidence as a result of finding itself in the presence of evil.<a name=3:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, first of all, in relation to Moses and what brought out his greatness, it says "But the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth".<a name=3:5></a> You will notice that in each of these passages I have read it refers to "the man".<a name=3:6></a> First, "the man Moses;" then, referring to Isaac, "the man .<a name=3:7></a>.<a name=3:8></a>.<a name=3:9></a> became continually greater;" and then "the man Mordecai", and how great he became.<a name=3:10></a> So that the thought is manhood, and true greatness in manhood.<a name=3:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>we are told that "the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth".<a name=3:12></a> That is the comment of the Spirit of God; "<i>above</i> all men", as though God would show that meekness, as being a feature to be learned only from Christ, is an element that enters into true greatness.<a name=3:13></a> One marked by it is, in His estimation, exalted "<i>above</i> all men that were upon the face of the earth".<a name=3:14></a> It was not the circumstances of rivalry in which Moses found himself that developed the meekness.<a name=3:15></a> The circumstances of rivalry brought it into expression, but no amount of rivalry or anything of that kind will, by itself, develop meekness.<a name=3:16></a> Indeed, by itself it would tend in the opposite direction, but what characterised Moses was that he was much in the presence of God.<a name=3:17></a> I know, of course, that he was a special

		servant, selected for a special mission, and specially privileged.<a name=4:1></a> Indeed, in some respects he is suggestive of Christ Himself.<a name=4:2></a> But at the same time, I am referring to what he was as having become meek, for, after all, he was not born meek.<a name=4:3></a> We may rest assured that not one of us is born meek.<a name=4:4></a> It is not innate in man naturally.<a name=4:5></a> It is not a feature of the flesh.<a name=4:6></a> It is something that has to be learned from Christ, and God intends that we should learn it from Christ.<a name=4:7></a> If He allows anything in the nature of rivalry, or anything that is testing to arise, it maybe amongst the saints, He has in mind that it should serve to bring into expression what He would form in us that is well pleasing to Himself.<a name=4:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses, as I said, was much with God.<a name=4:9></a> On two occasions he was with God alone for forty days and forty nights, and not only so, but God Himself showed him the pattern of the tabernacle.<a name=4:10></a> Think of the wondrousness of it, God indicating to Moses not only the detail and the pattern of the dwelling-place which God's people were to construct for Him, but no doubt letting him into the secret of what the different items represented.<a name=4:11></a> You can well understand God showing him the pattern, but Moses would not have had that instruction merely as carrying in his mind certain mechanical details, certain formal specifications, but his heart would be in it.<a name=4:12></a> You can understand with what pleasure God would speak to Moses of the tabernacle as typifying the whole universe in a coming day, in which He will find His pleasure, and in which He will be served, with all taking its character from the ark.<a name=4:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first item that God gave instructions to Moses about was the ark.<a name=5:1></a> When it came to constructing the tabernacle, the ark did not come first, but when God gave instructions as to the system in which He could take pleasure and dwell in complacently, the first thing He speaks of to Moses is the ark.<a name=5:2></a> Moses would be impressed as he began to take account of who it was that the ark typified.<a name=5:3></a> God said to him "They shall make an ark of acacia-wood; two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:10">Exodus  25:10</a>).<a name=5:4></a> Think of the wondrousness of it that a divine Person was to become Man, and to enter into such wonderful limitations as are there typified.<a name=5:5></a> They are not great measurements, but well within the compass of man.<a name=5:6></a> He, who was the Creator of heaven and earth, the God who upholds all things by the word of His power, He was to come in in such conditions.<a name=5:7></a> And in entering into manhood was to give character to, and impress His own precious features on, the whole system in which God would find His dwelling-place.<a name=5:8></a> Any thoughts of self-importance that Moses might tend to have in his own mind would be rebuked.<a name=5:9></a> How often do thoughts of self-importance arise in our minds.<a name=5:10></a> But how quickly they are rebuked, dear brethren, if we are in the presence of God, and see Christ there; Christ according to divine thoughts.<a name=5:11></a> One great enough personally and morally to bring in the moral universe, and secure it as marked by features that God could delight in and dwell in complacently.<a name=5:12></a> And yet our knowledge of Jesus is connected with His having come in in such a way that He could move amongst men.<a name=5:13></a> "The Word became flesh, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was there anything in the nature of self-assertion or self-display?<a name=6:5></a> No, dear brethren, He had entered into manhood for the pleasure of God.<a name=6:6></a> He would fill out the position into which He had entered in a way which would magnify it morally and make it glorious, with no element of independence, no thought of seeking a place for himself.<a name=6:7></a> His Father's will, His Father's glory, His Father's name, were always precious to His heart.<a name=6:8></a> I do not think it is in any way fanciful to think of God speaking to Moses about the ark, and He who it typified, and then the whole system that would be built up around it.<a name=6:9></a> All the principal parts of it were to be of acacia-wood, the same kind of wood of which the ark itself was to be made.<a name=6:10></a> The ark itself was to be overlaid within and without with pure gold, and the boards also were overlaid with gold.<a name=6:11></a> How Moses' spirit would be subdued.<a name=6:12></a> How it would be affected as God spoke to him of the whole system which He intended to bring in, which was typified in the tabernacle, but which was all to take its character from a divine Person entering into manhood, and becoming such a Man as He was.<a name=6:13></a> We find Him saying in the prophet Isaiah, "I was not rebellious; I turned not away back.<a name=6:14></a> I gave my back to smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:5">Isaiah  50:5</a>, 6).<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of the grace of it, dear brethren.<a name=7:1></a> Those that plucked off the hair, and so on, would call forth in any of us, save as we are formed by the Spirit of Christ, the very opposite of meekness.<a name=7:2></a> But the Lord Jesus could say, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:29">Matthew  11:29</a>).<a name=7:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, beloved brethren, I believe we shall only really appreciate the meekness and gentleness of Christ, the moral excellence and greatness of it according to God's estimation, as we are with God.<a name=7:4></a> I do not believe any amount of reading about it will impress us with it.<a name=7:5></a> But if we are in the presence of God, and get God's view of Christ and the system which takes character from Him, we shall begin to get an impression of the moral excellence of the spirit of meekness which has shone out in Jesus.<a name=7:6></a> In this scripture Miriam and Aaron were speaking against Moses.<a name=7:7></a> Miriam was the elder, and she apparently stepped out of a sister's place and took the lead, a very solemn matter.<a name=7:8></a> No one knows what may happen if things begin to develop like that.<a name=7:9></a> Here Jehovah Himself takes it up, taking the matter in hand, calling to these three and saying to them, "Come out ye three".<a name=7:10></a> Think of the solemnity of Jehovah calling on three saints, a sister and two brothers, and saying, Ye three, come out to meet God.<a name=7:11></a> I am not suggesting that there is anything of that sort present amongst us here.<a name=7:12></a> I am only speaking of the solemnity and the seriousness of it.<a name=7:13></a> If a sister steps out of her place, and begins to lead in rivalry, God may act suddenly in regard of her.<a name=7:14></a> "Jehovah spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three".<a name=7:15></a> Moses did not need to do a thing, or speak a single word.<a name=7:16></a> Jehovah came down,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and then He called Aaron and Miriam.<a name=8:1></a> It was Miriam and Aaron who spoke against Moses.<a name=8:2></a> Jehovah called Aaron and Miriam.<a name=8:3></a> He would have things in their right order, and He said, "Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak to him in a dream.<a name=8:4></a> Not so my servant Moses".<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can understand Miriam and Aaron for the moment despising Moses; he was so meek, but Jehovah says, "my servant Moses".<a name=8:6></a> What greater commendation could there be?<a name=8:7></a> "Not so my servant Moses: he is faithful in all my house.<a name=8:8></a> Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold.<a name=8:9></a> Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?<a name=8:10></a>" So that Moses, was one who had to do with God, being in the presence of God continually.<a name=8:11></a> In the end of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>we read that Moses went into the holiest to speak to God, and God spoke to him.<a name=8:12></a> God anticipated him.<a name=8:13></a> He would be impressed as God continually spoke to him.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the book of Genesis it is also a question of greatness.<a name=8:15></a> Not so much the moral greatness of being formed according to Christ, but the greatness that consists in spiritual substance.<a name=8:16></a> It says that "Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him.<a name=8:17></a> And the man became great, and he became continually greater, until he was very great.<a name=8:18></a> And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great number of servants".<a name=8:19></a> That is what the Spirit of God is stressing in Isaac.<a name=8:20></a> Not so much greatness in moral conformation to Christ, but rather great wealth of spiritual

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		substance.<a name=9:1></a> In that connection what is stressed is first of all where he sowed, and then secondly that he was active in digging wells.<a name=9:2></a> Those are two important principles, dear brethren, for us to recognise in connection with the acquisition of spiritual wealth.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there is a tendency sometimes amongst us, if any brother or sister is seen to be possessed of a certain amount of spiritual wealth, to think that it is all a matter of sovereign gift.<a name=9:4></a> I am not denying the sovereignty of gift.<a name=9:5></a> We always recognise that, but at the same time, spiritual wealth is not acquired only on those lines.<a name=9:6></a> The great principle is "he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:8">Galatians  6:8</a>).<a name=9:7></a> That is, spiritual wealth is not so much a matter of gift in sovereignty, it is a matter of having followed right lines.<a name=9:8></a> This is a farming country, and I need not say anything to the brethren about sowing and reaping.<a name=9:9></a> They know all about it.<a name=9:10></a> They understand perfectly that they will not get a crop if they do not sow; but then the same thing applies in spiritual things, that if we would acquire spiritual wealth we must see that we sow, and sow in the right land.<a name=9:11></a> It says, "Isaac sowed in that land;" that is, in the land of God's purpose.<a name=9:12></a> Sowing to the Spirit is very largely a matter of what we give our minds to.<a name=9:13></a> If we will allow our minds to be controlled as the Spirit of God would control them, the Spirit will not occupy them with worldly things, with fleshly things, with things that are of only transient importance.<a name=9:14></a> He will occupy them with the things that are eternal, with things that are pure, and just, and lovely, and of good report.<a name=9:15></a>

		Caleb, in Old Testament history, said of that good land which he had in his heart, "The land .<a name=9:16></a>.<a name=9:17></a>.<a name=9:18></a> is a very, very

		good land" emphasising the goodness of it, and saying, "If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#14:7">Numbers  14:7</a>, 8).<a name=10:1></a> There is no difficulty about that.<a name=10:2></a> "He that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life".<a name=10:3></a> The mind is the inlet to the affections.<a name=10:4></a> The great attraction of things above is that Christ is there.<a name=10:5></a> "Seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>, 2).<a name=10:6></a> That is to say, having His place there deliberately; as though to remind us that His interests are not bound up with the earth, save in respect of the fact that the assembly is here, but with heavenly things.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says that "Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him".<a name=10:8></a> But then there is not only the idea of sowing, but of digging, and that is evidently the exercise of getting rid of everything that would obstruct the free movement of the Spirit.<a name=10:9></a> He removed what would stand in the way of the water springing up.<a name=10:10></a> The Philistines were always stopping up the wells.<a name=10:11></a> That is what the natural mind working in the things of God nearly always does.<a name=10:12></a> It stops up the wells, so that there is no freshness.<a name=10:13></a> The natural mind attempting to compass divine things always robs them of their freshness, and we have to beware of the Philistines.<a name=10:14></a> Any tendency to hold the truth of God merely in the natural mind will fail.<a name=10:15></a> There may be a tendency to take on the truth in terms, and the tendency perhaps to place things in pigeon-holes, so to speak, and all that kind of thing.<a name=10:16></a> The truth of God cannot be held in that way.<a name=10:17></a> It must be held in the Spirit, and then it will be in constant freshness, just like a fountain of water springing up.<a name=10:18></a> It says, "Isaac dug again the wells of water

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and that the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them".<a name=11:1></a> The truth remains the same, but it is taken up afresh in fresh energy in the Spirit, so that it is held in freshness, in living power and enjoyment.<a name=11:2></a> The names are the same; the truth does not change, but, taken up in fresh exercise, it is held in a fresh and living way.<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As Isaac dug these wells, the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds, and said, "The water is ours .<a name=11:4></a>.<a name=11:5></a>.<a name=11:6></a> And they dug another well, and they strove for that also".<a name=11:7></a> The Philistine element in ourselves always has to be reckoned with.<a name=11:8></a> Whatever is brought forward in freshness, there is the effort, so to speak, to claim it in the power of the natural mind, and say, 'That is ours', but then a spiritual person will go on.<a name=11:9></a> Isaac went on.<a name=11:10></a> We must have the truth in freshness.<a name=11:11></a> There is nothing satisfying for the saints or for God if the truth is not held in freshness, so the more the Philistines strove, the more Isaac went on digging further wells, until he comes to a point when there is no more strife.<a name=11:12></a> He reaches the truth in such a way that the Philistines cannot rob him of it, they cannot claim it.<a name=11:13></a> Jehovah had made room for them.<a name=11:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just referred to that as a matter which we must carry with us all the time we are here, the importance of seeking to acquire spiritual substance so that we are not poverty-stricken.<a name=11:15></a> Jehovah said, "None shall appear before me empty" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:20">Exodus  34:20</a>).<a name=11:16></a> It is a shame to us if we are barren.<a name=11:17></a> God would not have barrenness in His land, or lack of substance in His house.<a name=11:18></a> The scripture speaks of the fatness

		of His house, but the enjoyment of that depends on our recognising, of course, that we are entirely dependent on the Spirit of God.<a name=12:1></a> It is largely dependent on us as to whether we will sow and dig, and maintain the exercise of digging so that the wealth God gives us in the way of the truth known substantially may be held by us in freshness.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then finally we come to the history of Mordecai, and he, I believe, represents one who became great because of the way he faced the working of evil.<a name=12:3></a> While we are here, we must expect to have to face the working of evil; not that one is setting a premium on evil in the assembly, far from it, but we have to remember that so long as we are here we are in the presence of hades' gates.<a name=12:4></a> There will be the constant plotting of evil to seek in a skilful and systematic way to nullify what is of God.<a name=12:5></a> We are in the presence of it.<a name=12:6></a> The Lord has said in regard to the assembly that "Hades' gates shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>).<a name=12:7></a> But hades' gates are there and we must recognise that, hence the need for continual watchfulness.<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that marks Mordecai is this constant watchfulness.<a name=12:9></a> He sat in the king's gate.<a name=12:10></a> Even after he had been led in triumph through the city as the man whom the king delighted to honour, it says, "Mordecai came again to the king's gate" (<a href="../bible/Esther.htm#6:12">Esther  6:12</a>).<a name=12:11></a> Nothing succeeded in diverting Mordecai from sitting in the king's gate.<a name=12:12></a> I understand that the king's gate is simply the principle of judging every matter as to how it affects God.<a name=12:13></a> The gate was always the place of judgment, and Mordecai sitting in the king's gate would mean that he was one who had habituated himself to looking at everything as it arose, as to how it affected God.<a name=12:14></a> He would have a spiritual

		Another thing that marked Mordecai and which constituted an element in his greatness, is what comes out in chapter 3.<a name=13:10></a> That is, that he would not under any circumstances yield to the flesh.<a name=13:11></a> This is very elementary, but it is very essential, and something that has to be maintained by us right through to the end.<a name=13:12></a> One has often referred to the apostle Paul, and one marvels at him.<a name=13:13></a> After he had been caught up to the third heaven and into paradise; even after that, with all the light he had, and even with the thorn for the flesh to buffet him, he says to the

		These are two elements of greatness in the presence of evil; that is, maintaining the principle of sitting in the king's gate, judging of every matter as to how it affects God; and along with that the purpose of heart that will not yield to the flesh.<a name=14:12></a> We know how successful it was eventually in this history in the book of Esther.<a name=14:13></a> We find that Mordecai is the one who is prominent, and also Esther comes in.<a name=14:14></a> She is the counterpart, so to speak, of Mordecai.<a name=14:15></a> Mordecai stands out as the responsible element; and Esther is the subjective answer to what is seen in Mordecai, for she was brought up by him, and even after she became queen she did as he told her.<a name=14:16></a> She sets forth the results of subjection, and of abiding under the influence of one Man.<a name=14:17></a>

		That is what characterised Esther, and so, I believe, there are two things of particular importance in her.<a name=15:1></a> She was subjected to a process with a view to being pleasing to the king, "six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices".<a name=15:2></a> One would say this to all the brethren, young and old, brothers and sisters, that one great thing to be pursued is to consider and cultivate what is pleasing to God.<a name=15:3></a> There is nothing spectacular about that.<a name=15:4></a> It may involve a considerable process of training.<a name=15:5></a> "Six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices" may have seemed a long while to Esther, but it had in view her becoming pleasing to the king.<a name=15:6></a> We can only cultivate that under the influence of one Man, and Esther secretly was under the influence of Mordecai.<a name=15:7></a> Actually she was in the charge of Hegai, the one who was placed over the virgins, possibly typical of the Spirit, and then as being pleasing to the king she acquired power with the king.<a name=15:8></a> The more pleasing we are to God, the more power we shall have with Him.<a name=15:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So another thing comes into view.<a name=15:10></a> When a crisis arises she is prepared to lay down her life for the brethren.<a name=15:11></a> She must go into the king whatever it costs, and she says, "If I perish, I perish".<a name=15:12></a> Then she puts on her queenly robes and goes in to the king, and the king holds out to her the golden sceptre, and Esther touches it.<a name=15:13></a> I believe God, so to speak, would set before us a golden standard, the standard of the divine nature.<a name=15:14></a> Do we love the brethren?<a name=15:15></a> If we love them we ought to lay down our lives for them.<a name=15:16></a> "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us; and <i>we</i> ought for the brethren to lay down our lives" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>).<a name=15:17></a> Am I up to this standard?<a name=15:18></a> If I am, I

		Esther drew near and touched the golden sceptre, and the king gave her her request.<a name=16:3></a> Esther's power with the king was largely the effect of Mordecai's influence, so in the verses read in chapters 8 and 9 the Spirit of God enlarges on the glory and greatness of Mordecai.<a name=16:4></a> In chapter 8 it says that "Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white".<a name=16:5></a> That is very suggestive.<a name=16:6></a> It is the day of his vindication.<a name=16:7></a> It is not at present the day of our vindication, save in a moral sense perhaps, at times.<a name=16:8></a> But there is this royal apparel of blue and white, the heavenly colour and what is pure, and "with a mantle of byssus and purple".<a name=16:9></a> All this is very suggestive of the greatness of Mordecai as developed in the presence of evil.<a name=16:10></a> Then in chapter 9 it says, "Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout the provinces; for the man Mordecai became continually greater".<a name=16:11></a>

		Well now, the cross of Christ has a double aspect.<a name=18:2></a> On the one hand it represents God's judgment of man in flesh, and a very severe and unsparing judgment it is.<a name=18:3></a> On the other hand it represents the world's estimate of Christ, and the world's estimate of those who are true to Christ.<a name=18:4></a> So that there are these two aspects of the cross of Christ.<a name=18:5></a> They are closely connected, and the more we are true in our own souls and walk to the cross of Christ as the expression of God's judgment of man in flesh, the more we shall come into despisal and rejection by this world, so that the two are closely related.<a name=18:6></a> The world is made up of man and his will, and his ambition and his independence of God and his glory.<a name=18:7></a> Jude speaks of those who speak great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.<a name=18:8></a> That is very characteristic of the world, and any person who appreciates the cross of Christ would completely disallow anything of that kind.<a name=18:9></a> He would not allow the very beginnings of it in his own soul; it would be entirely contrary to the bearing of the cross of Christ.<a name=18:10></a> As going through the world characterised by that spirit his very movements and attitude become a condemnation of the world, and he thus comes in for the same reproach and rejection, the same despisal as Christ did.<a name=18:11></a> He finds that the result of carrying in his soul the cross as representing God's judgment of man, and being true to it, is that he comes in for the world's judgment of Christ.<a name=18:12></a> The world has the same contempt for him as it had for Christ.<a name=18:13></a> Paul says, "But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is

		Now it is not all at once that we arrive at these things, and the section of the book of Numbers from chapters 11 to 21 has in mind that God's people should learn by experience what flesh in themselves is.<a name=19:4></a> God knew it from the outset.<a name=19:5></a> It was not a question of God having to discover it, it was a question of God's people having to discover it, in order that they might learn how God had dealt with it in the cross of Christ, and the answer to it in the Holy Spirit.<a name=19:6></a> We find when we come to chapter 21 that the children of Israel "journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to go round the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way".<a name=19:7></a> Edom was their brother, and a most unreasonable brother he was, as we may read from the previous chapter.<a name=19:8></a> Israel had only requested that they should be allowed to go through his territory; they promised to keep to the king's highway, they even promised to pay for any water they drank, and yet for all that Edom refused to give them passage.<a name=19:9></a> And here God does not say a word about Edom.<a name=19:10></a> What He had in mind in setting Edom in proximity to Israel was that, by Edom's contrariness and unreasonable attitude, what the flesh was in Israel should prove itself.<a name=19:11></a> And therefore, dear brethren, it may be sometimes that in God's ordering we find ourselves set amongst some who are a great test to us, but what has God in mind in it?<a name=19:12></a> God did not say a word about Edom; He would deal with Edom in due time.<a name=19:13></a> If we want to know what God thinks about Edom we can read

		The Son of man is a title of the Lord Jesus as the One who has come in as Man to take up all that God had in view for man.<a name=21:5></a> But before He could take up all that God had in view for man, He must also take up and remove all that lay upon man.<a name=21:6></a> Man being what he is, the Son of man must be lifted up on the cross.<a name=21:7></a> That is, He must, as made sin, endure the judgment of God against sin, so that sin in the flesh might be condemned.<a name=21:8></a> Thus it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>, "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=21:9></a> Now that is set before us objectively in the cross of Christ.<a name=21:10></a> There was a divine necessity that the Son of man should be lifted up, but then divine love entered into it, so it says, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>).<a name=21:11></a> So there is, as I say, the love of God, a wonderful expression of it, His only-begotten Son, and there is the love of Christ in it too, a twofold lever, as power in our souls to accept the truth.<a name=21:12></a> The answer to the look of faith, by which the truth is accepted, is life eternal, and this is in the Spirit.<a name=21:13></a> That is how God has met the position.<a name=21:14></a> He has set us in Christ, in the life of another Man, for the Spirit is

		Now the idea of the assembly of God is that of a dignified company with which the name of God is connected publicly.<a name=27:4></a> It stands in the place as a company, or vessel, with which God's name and testimony are identified.<a name=27:5></a> Now that is a great responsibility as well as a great privilege.<a name=27:6></a> The Lord Himself when here was the vessel of testimony.<a name=27:7></a> It was a testimony of grace, and He stood up in the synagogue of Nazareth where He had been brought up and said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a>) and so on.<a name=27:8></a> He stood up publicly as the anointed vessel of testimony for God in that place where He had been brought up.<a name=27:9></a> Now Christ having gone on high and the Holy Spirit having come, the assembly takes His place as the anointed vessel for the expression of God in each locality.<a name=27:10></a> So in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a> the assembly is spoken of as the Christ.<a name=27:11></a> Paul says, "so also is the Christ".<a name=27:12></a> He is referring to the assembly.<a name=27:13></a> That conveys the idea of the assembly of God as an anointed vessel, composed of persons set together in a place, bearing the name of God and intended to maintain a testimony to God.<a name=27:14></a> They are part of His habitation and therefore they are to maintain amongst themselves the conditions suited to God's

		I want to speak, dear brethren, of serving God, and to seek to show the encouragement there is in the Scriptures for everyone of us, whether it be brother or sister, to be here definitely as serving God.<a name=35:1></a> The scripture we commenced with in Isaiah is one of particular encouragement, for Jehovah says that it is the heritage of the servants of the Lord that "No weapon that is prepared against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that riseth against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn".<a name=35:2></a> He says, "This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah; and their righteousness is of me, saith Jehovah".<a name=35:3></a> It is as though God would say to everyone who is prepared to take up the exercise of serving Him, whatever form that service may take, that they can afford to do so in singleness of heart with the assurance that God will stand by them.<a name=35:4></a> He will, of course, afford to them any adjustment that they may need.<a name=35:5></a> He will have His own way with them.<a name=35:6></a> The Scriptures are full of God's ways with His servants, but He would at the outset say that the servant need not be concerned about what others think or say about them, if, in fact, they are in singleness of heart serving God.<a name=35:7></a> "Their righteousness", Jehovah says, "is of me".<a name=35:8></a> In speaking of serving God, one is not limiting one's thoughts to serving in ministry, or anything of that kind.<a name=35:9></a> I think the Scriptures read will show

		that <i>servants of God</i> is a term that goes far wider than serving in the power of gift in the ministry of the word, or in the gospel.<a name=36:1></a> Certainly there is no suggestion of any such thing in the case of Job, yet he is one of whom God speaks as "my servant Job".<a name=36:2></a> The thought of serving God is a very wide one.<a name=36:3></a>

		I want to refer to these cases of Job, Caleb, David and Anna in order to indicate different aspects in which serving God shows itself.<a name=36:4></a> I want also to show, not only, as the verse in Isaiah says, how God stands by those who serve Him, but also to show how He takes in hand any discipline that may be needed in order that they may serve Him more effectively.<a name=36:5></a> God will take that in hand Himself.<a name=36:6></a> I do not think you can read of any servant in the scripture who is not disciplined.<a name=36:7></a> In the case of Job the service that marked him in the first instance was that he was characterised by personal piety, concerned as to himself and his household to maintain practically what was pleasing to God.<a name=36:8></a> He was thus characteristically a servant of God, and God calls Satan's attention to him.<a name=36:9></a> That is a serious matter, you might say a surprising matter, that God should call Satan's attention to a servant of His, for God knew well that if Satan were allowed a free hand it would be in opposition to those who serve God.<a name=36:10></a> Yet God calls Satan's attention to Job, with the result that Satan was allowed to put his hand upon him to a remarkable extent, affecting him in his circumstances in a most grievous way, and affecting him also in his body and in his health.<a name=36:11></a> What God had in mind was to bring out, I believe, the indestructibility of His own work in Job.<a name=36:12></a>

		Now these are features which are to be seen amongst God's people today.<a name=52:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#93:5">Psalm  93:5</a> it says, "Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever".<a name=52:8></a> He has approached us by means of the precious death of Christ and we approach Him on that basis.<a name=52:9></a> As under the influence of the way that God has come out to us in Christ, we ourselves become formed in love; so that christianity is a system of constant sacrifice, not only in what we say to God, but more particularly in what we are as characterised by love.<a name=52:10></a> In this system, this sanctuary which the people of God were to provide for God's pleasure, the first item in the instructions which Jehovah gave to Moses was the ark.<a name=52:11></a> As the instruction unfolded it became clear that the ark was the centre of the system.<a name=52:12></a> It was not literally the centre

		in a physical sense, in that it was actually in the innermost place at the extreme end of the tabernacle.<a name=53:1></a> But it was the first item, the most prominent one, which God indicated in His instructions, and one, I think we may say, which was intended to give character to the whole of the rest of the system.<a name=53:2></a> As an example of that I may point out that not only was the ark of acacia-wood, but the boards and bars of the tabernacle were also to be of the same wood.<a name=53:3></a> So also were the table and the two altars, so you will see that the system was intended to take character from the ark.<a name=53:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is to be noticed in connection with the ark, viewed as the ark of the testimony.<a name=53:5></a> That is, it is always, save possibly in the instance in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#4">Joshua  4</a>, presented as covered.<a name=53:6></a> That is, either covered by the veil, being within the holiest and therefore to be seen only by one going into the holiest.<a name=53:7></a> Or when the system was in movement, covered actually by the veil, for the priests had to go in and take down the veil and with it cover the ark of the testimony.<a name=53:8></a> It was then covered with a covering of badgers' skins, and finally with a cloth wholly of blue.<a name=53:9></a> Thus covered it was carried.<a name=53:10></a> What I am seeking to point out is that the ark of the testimony is presented as hidden from view, and only to be apprehended by those who take up the exercise of going into the holiest, for only in the holiest could it be seen.<a name=53:11></a> That is important, because it is as we seek the presence of God, that we gain some impression of Christ as the ark of the testimony.<a name=53:12></a> That is to say, it is not something that is open to public gaze.<a name=53:13></a> It is not something presented, so to speak, in the initial testimony of the gospel.<a name=53:14></a> But it is something which is to be cherished, and cherished by God's people.<a name=53:15></a> For while in the old

		dispensation only the high priest had access to the holiest, and that but once a year, in christianity the way into the holiest has been made open to us.<a name=54:1></a> We are encouraged and exhorted in Hebrews to draw near and to enter the holiest.<a name=54:2></a> It is contemplated that we will make a practice of withdrawing into the presence of God, not for the purpose of making our requests known in relation to our own needs, not indeed necessarily for the purpose of praying at all.<a name=54:3></a> For the holiest itself is not connected with the thought of prayer, nor necessarily exactly connected with the thought of worship, though that would result, but more to contemplate what Jesus is and has established in the presence of God.<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:6">Psalm  40:6</a> - 8 because the Lord, in Spirit, is presented as saying, "Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire: ears hast thou prepared me.<a name=54:5></a> Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not demanded; Then said I, Behold, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me -- To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and thy law is within my heart".<a name=54:6></a> That gives us a clue to the idea of the ark of the testimony.<a name=54:7></a> It is Christ as having come into manhood with a view to establishing all that is in the will of God.<a name=54:8></a> And establishing it as cherishing it, as having it in His heart; not merely coming, so to speak, officially to do something as commanded to do it, but coming in as loving God's will and devoting Himself to it.<a name=54:9></a> So we read that the ark was to be made of acacia-wood.<a name=54:10></a> That is a particularly indestructible kind of wood, capable of much endurance, signifying, I believe, the distinctive and holy character, the incorruptible character, of manhood in which Jesus was found as having become Man.<a name=54:11></a> An order of manhood

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Christ came into this world He came in as cherishing all that was in the mind and heart of God to establish.<a name=55:7></a> He was going to carry it through and establish it whatever Satan or man might do, and the Lord carried through in triumph every item that was in the will of God.<a name=55:8></a> He surrendered nothing.<a name=55:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:34">John  4:34</a> we hear Him saying, "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work".<a name=55:10></a> Then again at the close we hear Him saying, "I have glorified <i>thee</i> on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:4">John  17:4</a>), showing that He had carried it through.<a name=55:11></a> What He had cherished in His heart He had completed.<a name=55:12></a> Not a single item of the will of God was left uncompleted.<a name=55:13></a> He went into death in order to establish the will of God forever.<a name=55:14></a> In His death a basis was laid upon which God could effectuate His thoughts in mercy.<a name=55:15></a> So we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		find that upon the ark of the testimony was placed the mercy seat, and from that standpoint God would speak with Moses and communicate His mind to His people.<a name=56:1></a> Moreover, in the ark was to be placed the "testimony that I shall give thee".<a name=56:2></a> It is mentioned once before the mercy seat is introduced, and after the mercy seat is introduced, it is mentioned again.<a name=56:3></a> It is set in the ark, "the testimony that I shall give thee".<a name=56:4></a> I believe the bearing of that is, that in answer to all that Satan brought into this world in introducing into God's creation a will contrary to God's will, God has first of all brought in in Christ One who loved His will and was governed wholly by it.<a name=56:5></a> He came in for the express purpose of effecting it, and then on the ground of mercy based in righteousness on His death, God is securing men of Christ's order, who likewise are governed by delighting in God's will, and are regulated by no other.<a name=56:6></a> That means in the full result that we see in Christ in God's presence the pledge of the bringing in and establishing of another world where the will of man in opposition to God is entirely set aside.<a name=56:7></a> A world composed of those who take character from Christ, and delight in God's will, so it is a world in which God can dwell complacently.<a name=56:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the testimony in regard of Christ now, as we have it in Ephesians is "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things" (Ephesians 4: 10).<a name=56:9></a> He has already gone up far above all heavens with a view to filling all things.<a name=56:10></a> There is nothing more striking than that.<a name=56:11></a> I urge the brethren to contemplate it, that there is a Man now in the presence of God, who is going to fill all things.<a name=56:12></a> Let the power of it sink

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing, and that is illustrated by Asaph in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>.<a name=58:2></a> It has its result in preserving us from becoming affected by influences that otherwise might have a harmful effect upon us in this world.<a name=58:3></a> Asaph was a godly man, but he says, "But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped".<a name=58:4></a> The reason for that being as he says that "I was envious at the arrogant, seeing the prosperity of the wicked.<a name=58:5></a> For they have no pangs in their death, and their body is well nourished.<a name=58:6></a> They have not the hardships of mankind, neither are they plagued like other men".<a name=58:7></a> Then in verse 13 he says, "Truly have I purified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency: For all the day have I been plagued, and chastened every morning".<a name=58:8></a> There is a child of God, one of God's people, and he is conscious of what it is to be continually under discipline.<a name=58:9></a> Every one of God's children is in greater or less degree under discipline.<a name=58:10></a> Not necessarily chastening in a severe form, scourging because of failure on our part, but every parent knows that his children, while they are children, always have to be in greater or less degree under discipline.<a name=58:11></a> That is to say there is a certain rule, involving sometimes limitations, which has to be maintained in the home for the instruction and preservation and development of the children.<a name=58:12></a> So with God's children, every brother and sister, if he is sensitive, knows that in some way or other he is constantly conscious of God's hand upon him, and necessarily so.<a name=58:13></a> We are conscious of the necessity for it, for we are to become partakers of His holiness.<a name=58:14></a> The more we understand God

		the more we realise the necessity for it, but Asaph was feeling that he was plagued all the day long, and chastened every morning.<a name=59:1></a> He looked upon the wicked and he saw their prosperity, apparently having no difficulties, and so on.<a name=59:2></a> That was the point of view that Satan was careful to present to Asaph.<a name=59:3></a> So powerful was the effect of this upon him that he said his feet had well nigh slipped, until, as he says, "I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end".<a name=59:4></a> That was his salvation; he went into the sanctuary of God.<a name=59:5></a> If we resort to the holiest we shall get an apprehension of Christ in His ability to establish God's will, and bring in a world entirely according to Himself for the pleasure of God.<a name=59:6></a> That means we see that this world, whatever conditions are like and however the wicked may seem to prosper for the moment, is bound to come to an end.<a name=59:7></a> You see the utter worthlessness of all that pertains to this world.<a name=59:8></a> If you have in your soul the light of One in a dominant position from which He will fill all things.<a name=59:9></a> That means the setting aside for ever of the system of things in which the wicked flourish.<a name=59:10></a> To have Christ in our hearts as the ark of the testimony is more than preservative.<a name=59:11></a> It gives us a right judgment as to what this world is morally, and enables us in a satisfied way to be completely apart from it, and wholly given over to the testimony of God to which we have been called.<a name=59:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I speak of Christ as presented in the ark of the covenant.<a name=59:13></a> The ark of the testimony, as I see it, is the One who enshrines a testimony which God is giving and which the saints are carrying, that a day is near when God's will will be established publicly.<a name=59:14></a> The ark of the covenant is the one who enshrines, and gives effect to, all God's thoughts

		of love concerning His people.<a name=60:1></a> It is a very great thing to appreciate Christ in that light also, as the One who is powerful to make good every thought of love and blessing which God has formed regarding His people.<a name=60:2></a> I have read the three passages, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>, <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3">Joshua  3</a>and <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8">1 Kings  8</a>, because they present the ark of the covenant in three positions.<a name=60:3></a> In Numbers we have Him as coming into view when the people of God first set out upon their first journey in the wilderness, as committed to His testimony.<a name=60:4></a> In the second we have Him as the ark of the covenant as setting aside the power of Jordan, so that God's people might pass over into their inheritance.<a name=60:5></a> In the third passage He is brought into His final resting place and the glory of God fills the scene.<a name=60:6></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>it is when the people were about to set out on their first journey as committed to the testimony.<a name=60:7></a> It says, "They set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them".<a name=60:8></a> Notice what is said, because often you hear it quoted that the ark of the covenant went three days' journey before the people.<a name=60:9></a> That is not what is said.<a name=60:10></a> What is said is, that <i>they</i> went three days' journey, and the ark of the covenant went before them in the three days' journey.<a name=60:11></a> That is, the three days' journey is their journey, only the ark goes before them in it to search out a resting-place for them.<a name=60:12></a> I believe what is intended to be conveyed in this is, that we may well afford to commit ourselves thoroughly to the testimony of God in the wilderness, whatever it entails, because the Lord Himself, in His love for us, will undertake everything that

		So we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:1">John  13:1</a>, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end".<a name=61:8></a> That is the Lord taking account of the fact that His own were now to be left in this world in His absence.<a name=61:9></a> That would constitute the world a wilderness, and they were to be left in the wilderness entrusted with God's testimony, and having that in mind, and knowing full well what the world was, the Lord set Himself to love His own right through to the end.<a name=61:10></a> That is most encouraging.<a name=61:11></a> Before we commit ourselves to God's testimony in this world, there is one thing we may be assured of.<a name=61:12></a> That is, that the love of Christ will see His people right through everything.<a name=61:13></a> Whatever has to be encountered, He will encounter it; that is what the Lord would assure us of, and that is what this movement of the ark conveys.<a name=61:14></a> When they began their journey, as identified

		with God's interests in this world, the ark went before them to search out a resting-place; to make sure that it is not all conflict, but that they should have resting-places.<a name=62:1></a> And in searching out a resting-place, to meet the enemy; as it says, "And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; And let them that hate thee flee before thy face.<a name=62:2></a> And when it rested, he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel".<a name=62:3></a> This was not the final resting-place that was in mind, the final place was Canaan.<a name=62:4></a> But this was a resting-place sought out while they were still in the wilderness.<a name=62:5></a> I believe it has its answer in what the Lord's supper affords to us on the first day of the week.<a name=62:6></a> For our position publicly is that we are in the wilderness, committed to God's testimony, and passing in it through all the exercises that are connected with it.<a name=62:7></a> But we appreciate that the Lord provides a resting-place in that position, a place where, for the moment, we may lay aside the exercises connected with the testimony, and enjoy His love and the way His love would serve us.<a name=62:8></a> We enter into that resting-place in the sense of His complete victory over every enemy that has challenged His way.<a name=62:9></a> So the ark of the covenant represents in that way Christ as great enough to give expression and effect to all that is in the heart of God in regard to His people.<a name=62:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>, is only a provisional resting-place while we are in the wilderness, but the great thought of God is that we should pass over into our inheritance, and finally that we should constitute His inheritance.<a name=62:11></a> Joshua presents to us our inheritance, while that which is arrived at under David and Solomon, in finality, represents

	<div class="paragraph">
		God's inheritance in the saints.<a name=63:1></a> So in the book of Joshua we have the ark presented to us again as the ark of the covenant.<a name=63:2></a> It is presented as moving into Jordan, and it says, "When they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (and the Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest), the waters which flowed down from above stood and rose up in a heap, very far, by Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan; and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain, the salt sea, were completely cut off.<a name=63:3></a> And the people went over opposite to Jericho".<a name=63:4></a> This presents to us Christ as entering in irresistible power into death in all that death meant, in order to break its power and make a way through, so that God's people should be able to pass over into the inheritance which God's love had provided for them.<a name=63:5></a> It has been well said that the ark in Jordan is not so much expressive of the love of Christ, though, of course, love is there, but it is particularly expressive of power, the power that disposed of death.<a name=63:6></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:61">Psalm  78:61</a>, "And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor".<a name=63:7></a> That refers to the ark.<a name=63:8></a> Christ is the power and the glory of God, and that was seen particularly as He entered into death, for when the Lord Jesus went into death, all that was involved in death as the judgment of God and the power of Satan, all was concentrated there.<a name=63:9></a> "The Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest".<a name=63:10></a> It was overwhelming to anything else but the ark, but the ark moves into it, and as the feet of the priests that bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water the waters went back.<a name=63:11></a> And the waters that flowed down toward the

	<div class="paragraph">
		sea failed, and the people passed over; so no water was seen and the victory was complete, and that is exactly what we have in the light of Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=64:1></a> It is true that it says here in verse 17 that the ark remained in the midst of Jordan until all the people had passed over, but that is rather to emphasise the completeness of the victory.<a name=64:2></a> For us the completeness of the victory is seen, not in Christ in death exactly, but in His resurrection, that is where death is seen to be completely overthrown.<a name=64:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The completeness of the victory which Christ has accomplished over death is to enter into our souls.<a name=64:4></a> We are to contemplate it, because what He has done has been in view of us, God having marked us out for an order of life and blessing which stands related to Christ beyond death.<a name=64:5></a> Therefore, if we see Christ going into death as the power of God to dispose of death and overthrow it, and rising triumphantly out of death, we understand that He is setting out what is in God's mind for us.<a name=64:6></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>, "Ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead".<a name=64:7></a> When we come together in assembly, and our hearts are freshly touched by means of the Lord's supper, and He comes in in response to the affectionate desires of His own, He is able to present Himself as for ever beyond the power of death.<a name=64:8></a> That is an actuality.<a name=64:9></a> We are not yet actually risen, but Christ is.<a name=64:10></a> The position is actually held by Christ, and faith apprehends that what has actually come to pass in Christ is God's mind for us, so faith enters into it.<a name=64:11></a> Just as the people had to keep their eyes on the ark and to move, their movements being determined by the movements that they discerned in the ark, so we keep our

		eyes on Christ.<a name=65:1></a> Not exactly Christ in death, but Christ as out of it, because the standing of the ark in Jordan until the people were passed over, was to demonstrate the completeness of the victory.<a name=65:2></a> That for us is seen in the position Christ has as risen from among the dead.<a name=65:3></a> So, not only is there faith in the operation of God who raised Him from the dead, but also quickening comes in.<a name=65:4></a> There is power in our souls, as our affections are quickened in relation to Christ where He is.<a name=65:5></a> The element of power enters into this matter of passing over the Jordan, in that there were twelve men who had power each to take up a stone from the bed of the Jordan and to carry it to the other side.<a name=65:6></a> I only touch on this as that which enters into our passing over in assembly to take up our proper position with Christ; to enter upon the position that is ours according to God's purpose.<a name=65:7></a> We are entitled in that position to view ourselves in the light of God's purpose as wholly of Christ's own order.<a name=65:8></a> God has quickened us together with Him, we who were in a state of moral death.<a name=65:9></a> This is witnessed to in the action of Joshua, who, doing it intuitively, took twelve stones and placed them in the Jordan; "in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this day" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#4:9">Joshua  4:9</a>).<a name=65:10></a>

		In closing I would refer to the passage in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8:6">1 Kings  8:6</a>, "And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim".<a name=65:11></a> I believe it refers to the way the saints, as having their own part with Christ consciously as brought into the immediate presence of God, and enjoying their part with Him in

		There is no doubt, dear brethren, that the history of Elisha, in its typical bearing fits in with the present time.<a name=69:1></a> For Elisha represents the saints as left here in the absence of Christ, who has gone into heaven, but set up in the power of the Spirit who has come down from the ascended Christ.<a name=69:2></a> Elisha was left here in the absence of Elijah, who had been taken into heaven.<a name=69:3></a> But he was left here to fill the position in the power of Elijah's mantle, suggestive of the Spirit of God; and I believe the passage in the second chapter is intended to instruct us how <i>we</i> are to be here in the absence of Christ.<a name=69:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice that it says in verse 1, "That Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal".<a name=69:5></a> That is, the suggestion is that the Lord wants to be with us.<a name=69:6></a> Indeed He says at the end of Matthew "<i>I</i> am with you all the days, until the completion of the age" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:20">Matthew  28:20</a>).<a name=69:7></a> That is what the Lord has in mind, the completion of the age, this wonderful age which is characterised by God making Himself known to men in grace.<a name=69:8></a> The age is to be completed in a way worthy of God, and with a view to that, the Lord is prepared to be with us, and so Elijah went with Elisha.<a name=69:9></a> But there are certain conditions under which the Lord is with His people, and that we get in one of the chapters of 2 Chronicles, where a prophet says to

	<div class="paragraph">
		king Asa, "Jehovah is with you while ye are with him" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#15:2">2 Chronicles  15:2</a>).<a name=70:1></a> That is the great point.<a name=70:2></a> But if we go off, so to speak, on lines of our own, we cannot expect the Lord to be with us, but He is prepared to be with us if we are exercised to be with Him.<a name=70:3></a> That is what follows in the chapter, that Elijah was testing Elisha as to whether he was prepared to be with him.<a name=70:4></a> He kept on saying, "Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me" first of all to Bethel, then to Jericho, then to Jordan.<a name=70:5></a> He was simply saying that to test him, to bring to light what was in Elisha, and each time Elisha answers, "As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee!<a name=70:6></a>" Elisha was determined to be with Elijah wherever Elijah was; whatever feature of the truth was being emphasised at the moment, Elisha was concerned to be with Elijah.<a name=70:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all that, dear brethren, is of great importance to us.<a name=70:8></a> The Lord is prepared to be with His people, even to the completion of the age, but if we would have that realised by us, we must be prepared, like Elisha, to say that at all cost we will go on with the Lord.<a name=70:9></a> Whatever feature of the truth He is calling attention to, and I have no doubt these different places that Elijah and Elisha visited are all different parts of the truth that Elijah was calling attention to, we have to be concerned to be with the Lord as to each.<a name=70:10></a> That involves constant movement, but only so can we expect to be able to complete our day here in testimony in a way that is pleasing to God.<a name=70:11></a> And so Elijah starts.<a name=70:12></a> Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.<a name=70:13></a> That was a good starting place.<a name=70:14></a> Elisha was already there.<a name=70:15></a> We cannot have any part effectively in God's testimony if we do not know what Gilgal represents, and if we are not there, so to speak, in

		our souls.<a name=71:1></a> Elisha was there.<a name=71:2></a> Gilgal, as is well known, represents the cutting off of the flesh; the place where the children of Israel were circumcised again as they came into the land, and the Lord said, "This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:9">Joshua  5:9</a>).<a name=71:3></a> It is a reproach to the saints, dear brethren, if we carry along with us any taint of this world.<a name=71:4></a> If any feature of the first man is in evidence it is a reproach to the saints.<a name=71:5></a> The saints are heavenly, and if we would be here in testimony to God, we have to be concerned that what has come to pass before God in the death of Christ, "the circumcision of the Christ", as it is called in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>, is made effective in us and maintained in us in power.<a name=71:6></a> Elijah went with Elisha from that point.<a name=71:7></a> Elisha was there in Gilgal.<a name=71:8></a>

		The first place they come to is Bethel, the house of God.<a name=71:9></a> The Lord would direct our attention to the house of God, which, Paul says is "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=71:10></a> The first epistle to Timothy is written especially that we might understand the importance of the house of God.<a name=71:11></a> The house of God is where God dwells, <i>His</i> dwelling place on earth.<a name=71:12></a> We ourselves, all of us, who have received the Spirit of God, are constituted the house of God.<a name=71:13></a> Let every believer understand that, that we are the house of God in virtue of God dwelling among us by the Spirit.<a name=71:14></a> We are not simply the house of God when we are assembled.<a name=71:15></a> We are always the house of God in virtue of the fact that God is dwelling in and among us by the Spirit, and hence it is something always to be borne in mind, that there is that which befits the house of God.<a name=71:16></a> Anyone who has a house expects to be able to have things in his own house suited to his own

		tastes.<a name=72:1></a> And God expects that His house should be such that those who have to do with it will get right impressions of God from what they see in His house.<a name=72:2></a> If you take notice of the features to be seen in a person's house, you get a fairly good idea of what the person is like to whom the house belongs.<a name=72:3></a> Believers are to bear in mind that there is a certain conduct, order and demeanour that befits those who are constituted God's house.<a name=72:4></a> So, for instance, Paul, in writing to Timothy, says, "I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men; for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity; for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:1">1 Timothy  2:1</a> - 4).<a name=72:5></a> That is one thing that is to mark the house of God, dear brethren, not simply at the prayer-meeting, but also in our homes.<a name=72:6></a> Supplications, prayers, intercessions, giving of thanks continually.<a name=72:7></a> We are to remember kings and all in authority, a most important thing in days when lawlessness is so much on the increase, and when government generally is so weak.<a name=72:8></a> I am not speaking in any political sense, or as having any biased view of matters.<a name=72:9></a> Government as such is constituted of God, but in the hands of men tends to be palpably weak.<a name=72:10></a> It is of the utmost importance that the saints of God should continue unceasingly, at home and in the meetings, praying for all men, for kings and all in authority.<a name=72:11></a> So that government, which is of God and has in mind the enforcement of what is right, and the repression of what is evil and the punishment of evil doers, should be maintained, and the saints go through leading quiet and

	<div class="paragraph">
		tranquil lives in all piety and gravity.<a name=73:1></a> And then it goes on to say that men ought to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath or reasoning.<a name=73:2></a> What men are to be characterised by in praying everywhere, is lifting up holy hands; that is, that in the recognition that we are having to do with God, holy hands are necessary, involving what we put our hands to.<a name=73:3></a> It is intended to raise wholesome exercises as to what we do, so that there may be no hindrance to our filling out the position proper to us as men in God's house.<a name=73:4></a> Then it speaks of women, and what is to mark them, their demeanour, their deportment, their dress.<a name=73:5></a> All these things are not to take character from the world around, but to be governed by the fact that God is dwelling amongst His people by the Spirit.<a name=73:6></a> What is suitable to God is to regulate us in all these matters, for the house of God is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=73:7></a> It is a question of our position in the testimony, and so Elijah calls attention, first of all, to this great idea of the house of God, the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=73:8></a>

		The apostle, in his epistle to Timothy, goes on to emphasise the importance of piety, which should characterise every brother and sister.<a name=73:9></a> It means bringing God into our ordinary circumstances of daily life, and moving in relation to God.<a name=73:10></a> "And confessedly the mystery of piety is great.<a name=73:11></a> God has been manifested in flesh" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>).<a name=73:12></a> Think of the wonder of that, beloved brethren, that God Himself should have come down into circumstances of human life in the Person of Jesus, and as having come down into these circumstances, filled them out in a way that glorified God.<a name=73:13></a> Jesus was always marked

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Elijah moves on.<a name=75:3></a> He says again to Elisha, "Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho".<a name=75:4></a> And Elisha says, "As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee!<a name=75:5></a>" He is prepared to go to Jericho and to see Jericho from Elijah's point of view.<a name=75:6></a> That is an important matter, dear brethren, to see all these features of the truth from the Lord's point of view.<a name=75:7></a> That is what Elijah had in mind, that Elisha was to be with him in these places, so he goes to Jericho.<a name=75:8></a> Now Jericho, I believe, represents the world as a great system built up by Satan, which seeks to oppose the saints and prevent them from entering into God's thoughts fully.<a name=75:9></a> At the day of Pentecost it was, for the moment, overthrown in those to whom the testimony came with power, and not only at the day of Pentecost, but in the subsequent ministry of the apostles.<a name=75:10></a> As they moved from place to place, and the testimony gained a place in the hearts of the saints in power, the world was largely overthrown in the souls of God's people, not publicly, but in the souls of God's people.<a name=75:11></a> In one place they said, "These men that have set the world in tumult" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:6">Acts  17:6</a>).<a name=75:12></a> That was their impression of the effect of the ministry of the apostles, that they had set the world in tumult.<a name=75:13></a> But then, alas, when we come to this day, although Jericho had been overthrown under Joshua, it had been rebuilt in Ahab's day.<a name=75:14></a> That is our great danger; lest, although it was overthrown in the souls of God's people in the early days of christianity, it should assert itself in renewed power and seek to capture the people of God and

		"Of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged" (verse 11).<a name=77:1></a> That, I believe, answers to our going with Elijah to Jericho, that we hold in our souls the same judgment of the world as the Lord has.<a name=77:2></a> I quite agree that at the end of this very chapter (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2">2 Kings  2</a>) there is a certain grace shown to Jericho.<a name=77:3></a> The men of the city come to Elisha and tell him that the situation of the city was pleasant but the water was bad and the ground barren, and Elisha tells them to bring him a new cruse and put salt in it.<a name=77:4></a> "And he went forth to the source of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness" (verse 21).<a name=77:5></a> I believe that refers to what provisionally took place in this world through the establishment of christianity, the new cruse being the assembly, a new vessel, and salt being the principle of life, that is, preservation.<a name=77:6></a> It introduced an entirely new influence for God in the world.<a name=77:7></a> God is operating provisionally in grace with the world, and in a sense that continues, but the truth is being rapidly given up.<a name=77:8></a> Eventually the world will prove apostate, so when Elisha went to Bethel, little boys, the rising generation, came out and said to the man of God, "Go up, bald head" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:23">2 Kings  2:23</a>).<a name=77:9></a> What would God think of that?<a name=77:10></a> That little boys should dare to speak to a man of God like that, and that is an illustration of what the rising generation will prove to be, utterly apostate in regard of the testimony of the Spirit of God down here.<a name=77:11></a> That will seal the world's doom; hence we need to be aware what the true character of things is.<a name=77:12></a>

		You can understand Elisha wondering however he was to be here without Elijah.<a name=79:6></a> He would be thinking to himself, 'Elijah was a great man and how can I be here without him?<a name=79:7></a>' And so he says, "let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me".<a name=79:8></a> It was the confession of his own felt inequality for the position.<a name=79:9></a> It is intended to teach us that, if we are to be here in any little measure in the testimony of God -- as the Lord Jesus was here so blessedly and perfectly, never surrendering anything due to God, but moving through this world in outward obscurity and smallness and content with that position -- we need the power of the Spirit of God in full measure.<a name=79:10></a> It says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:34">John  3:34</a> that God gives not the Spirit by measure.<a name=79:11></a> Thank God for that!<a name=79:12></a> That is, He does not <i>now</i> give the Spirit by measure.<a name=79:13></a> Past dispensations were marked by the Spirit in measure, but now the Spirit has fully come to indwell believers and to make it possible that the dispensation can be carried through in a way worthy of God.<a name=79:14></a> And so Elijah says, "If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so".<a name=79:15></a> We were speaking this afternoon of the disciples seeing the Lord Jesus as He was carried up into heaven, and of the impressions that they would get as they saw the manner in

		which He was taken up into heaven, the sense that heaven delighted in Him and the way He had carried on the testimony here.<a name=80:1></a> It must be carried on in the same way in which it had been filled out so blessedly in the Person of the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=80:2></a> The eyes of their hearts would be fixed upon Christ.<a name=80:3></a> You can understand how Elisha would say to himself, 'I will not take my eyes off Elijah'.<a name=80:4></a> You can see how it would impress upon Elisha the need of dependence, the need of keeping near to Elijah, and that, dear brethren, is surely a matter of the greatest importance to us.<a name=80:5></a> There is a great need of our keeping near to the Lord, and keeping our eye on the Lord, and being available to the Spirit and to God if we are to be here in any way pleasing to God.<a name=80:6></a> "And it came to pass as they went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire; and they parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the heavens".<a name=80:7></a> Now Elisha saw it and says a remarkable thing, "My father, my father!<a name=80:8></a> the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!<a name=80:9></a>" You might have said, he would say the chariot of Elijah and the horsemen thereof, but he says the chariot of Israel, as if he immediately grasped the idea that what was set out in Elijah as a man carried up into heaven, was God's thoughts for His people.<a name=80:10></a> He exactly set forth what God had in mind for His people, that they should have a place in heaven, and that there was power to set them there.<a name=80:11></a> It is a great thing to understand that our place is in heaven, that it is where He is, setting forth the place that belongs to the saints.<a name=80:12></a> If we are left down here in testimony, it is to come into the scene as from heaven; as the Lord did, after sending the message to His disciples, "I ascend to my

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, following on that it says Elisha "took hold of his own garments and rent them in two pieces.<a name=81:4></a> And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him".<a name=81:5></a> He first rends his own clothes in two pieces as if he would say, 'I entirely discard anything that has previously marked me'.<a name=81:6></a> Natural features are not to be employed in the testimony of God.<a name=81:7></a> It is a question now of the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=81:8></a> He took up the mantle of Elijah; that was to be the only thing of any use.<a name=81:9></a> Elijah had given him that impression when he first called him, when he first sought him out; commanded to do so by God Himself, he found Elisha ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, and Elijah went up to him and cast his mantle upon him.<a name=81:10></a> He gave him that impression at the outset, an impression that if he was to be here in the testimony, it must be in the power that had marked Elijah, and must be according to the measure of Elijah too, for the mantle would represent the measure of the man.<a name=81:11></a> You may say that it is a high standard, but then the Spirit of God has come down from heaven for that very purpose.<a name=81:12></a> Paul represents the same idea, when in view of his departure, he says to Timothy to take the cloak that he had left at Troas and bring it with him.<a name=81:13></a> The cloak would represent Paul's measure, and Timothy was to get that and bring it with him.<a name=81:14></a> Paul was about to be removed and Timothy was to

		Now, I read the incident in chapter 6 in order to show that we can well afford to commit ourselves to God's testimony, and to show the advantage we have in the presence of the Spirit of God here, the Spirit of truth, who, as it says, will guide you into all the truth.<a name=82:6></a> It says that the king of Syria warred against Israel.<a name=82:7></a> Israel represents the people of God.<a name=82:8></a> I would just say, in regard of Elijah and Elisha, that their ministry was in Israel; that is, to the ten tribes, not the two tribes.<a name=82:9></a> So that they represent the ministry of God really in christendom, for the ten tribes had departed from God's centre and had become largely idolatrous.<a name=82:10></a> They were still God's people, He had not entirely cast them off, but they had departed from God's centre and become idolatrous, and that is exactly the position of professing christianity.<a name=82:11></a> Christendom embraces those who are true, but many of God's people are captive to that which characterises christendom and going on with what is merely formal and in character idolatrous, and yet God in mercy maintains a testimony.<a name=82:12></a> We ourselves, though through grace morally apart from it, are publicly

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, dear brethren, to speak of the assembly as it is presented in the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=87:1></a> This epistle contemplates the assembly, not in its local aspect, as do the epistles to the Corinthians, but in its universal aspect, comprising all those who, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ have been sealed with the Holy Spirit from the day of Pentecost until the day when the Lord takes His own to be with Himself.<a name=87:2></a> The first passage read in chapter 3 is more restricted in the sense that it refers to the whole assembly as it is on earth at the moment.<a name=87:3></a> That is, it is a question of what is seen in the assembly now, although, of course, it covers the whole period of the assembly's history on earth.<a name=87:4></a> Obviously it refers to what is seen at any particular time in the assembly on earth at that moment.<a name=87:5></a> I trust all here are interested in the assembly, for it is the greatest conception of divine love and wisdom.<a name=87:6></a> It is to be, both in the world to come and throughout eternity, a vessel of divine glory, and it is the greatest conceivable privilege that you and I should have part in it.<a name=87:7></a>

		than he.<a name=88:1></a> That gives us some idea, dear brethren, of the especially privileged place that belongs to us in the sovereignty of God, as being privileged to form part of this wonderful vessel, the assembly which is the body of Christ.<a name=88:2></a> Hence I would urge on everyone here, old and young alike, to see that what little time remains to us before the Lord takes us, is devoted to seeking an increased understanding of what it is we belong to, and seeking help from the Lord to function in it according to His desire.<a name=88:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Ephesians, and, of course, all the epistles, are written from the standpoint of Christ having risen from the dead and ascended to the right hand of God, so that certain things are apprehended now as come to pass in Him.<a name=88:4></a> It says, for instance, in chapter 1: 3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us .<a name=88:5></a>.<a name=88:6></a>.<a name=88:7></a>" not 'who is going to bless us', but "who <i>has</i> blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ".<a name=88:8></a> Christ being now in His position in the heavenlies at the right hand of God, having accomplished redemption, and the Holy Spirit having come down, it may be said in that way that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=88:9></a> Because that is what is in God's mind for us, and <i>all</i> that is in God's mind for us can be realised at the present time by the Holy Spirit, who is the Earnest of the inheritance.<a name=88:10></a> When I say all, I mean <i>all</i>.<a name=88:11></a> There is, of course, the actual bodily condition, which is future.<a name=88:12></a> The bodily condition of conformity to Christ's own body of glory, and which is proper to heaven.<a name=88:13></a> But, subject to that limitation, there is no reason why believers should not enter already, in the power of the Holy Spirit,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=89>[Page 89]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		into the spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ which God has given us.<a name=89:1></a> Then, further, it says that He has taken us into favour, in the Beloved.<a name=89:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I speak of the scriptures I have read I would specially call attention to what is conveyed by "favour in the Beloved".<a name=89:3></a> I believe it is of great importance to apprehend the settled place that Christ is filling at the present time in the presence of God, in which He is presented to our hearts as the Beloved in a most absolute way.<a name=89:4></a> He is beloved of God and God would have us understand that Christ is now to be viewed in that position as loved of God in a settled way, the Beloved One commanding all the affections of the Father's heart.<a name=89:5></a> He is to be apprehended in that way, as the One in whom God has taken us into favour.<a name=89:6></a> There was no reason why Christ should have become Man if it were not that God had in mind for men the character of blessing which is now set forth in Christ as Man where He is.<a name=89:7></a> And therefore, if He is apprehended as He may be apprehended by us, as the Beloved, the Holy Spirit having been given to us, it is intended to convey to us that there has now come to pass in Christ in heaven, for ever beyond death and entirely outside of this world, a settled condition of love having its source in the Father, and its centre in Christ, and with ourselves embraced in it in Him; and all that, too, is according to divine purpose.<a name=89:8></a> It is not anything that we have devised, it is nothing we have thought of, it is something that God has purposed of Himself and for His own satisfaction before the foundation of the world.<a name=89:9></a> The bringing of the world into existence in due course, and all that has transpired in the history of the world, has just
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=90>[Page 90]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		constituted so to speak the platform and surroundings on which, and in the midst of which, God is steadily carrying out His own purpose.<a name=90:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would ask all to weigh that over, because I believe the more these things sink into our hearts, the more they will develop a spirit of worship Godward.<a name=90:2></a> That is what the Spirit of God is labouring to develop amongst us, that we should worship God, not as occupied merely with the way He has blessed us, but rather, so to speak, as losing sight of ourselves and having God Himself in His blessedness before our hearts; that He should have thought of such things!<a name=90:3></a> That He should have desired them, and then the wisdom by which they are effected, involving one divine Person becoming Man.<a name=90:4></a> The depths of love, too, in which they are effected, involving redemption through His blood.<a name=90:5></a> Then the power in which they have been effected, involving His being raised again from the dead and set down in the highest place at God's right hand in heaven.<a name=90:6></a> Then the coming in of another divine Person, the Holy Spirit, to bring the testimony of these things to our hearts and make them effective there, and to be in us the Spirit of God's Son, causing us to respond in sonship's affection to the blessed God.<a name=90:7></a> All these things are wonderful, dear brethren, and as we contemplate them and touch them they are intended to develop in us the spirit of worship, as Paul in introducing these things says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=90:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, coming to the scripture I read in chapter 1, what is touched on is the mighty power of God, which the apostle mentions in order that we might understand that the mighty power of God is operating towards us.<a name=90:9></a> That is,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=91>[Page 91]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we are not to think that the great things of God are so great that we cannot enter upon them, because the mighty power of God is operative towards us.<a name=91:1></a> If we allow its operation, so to speak, there is no limit to what we may touch in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=91:2></a> Speaking of the mighty power of God leads me to speak of the way that God has not only raised Christ from the dead, but that He has set Him down at His own right hand in the heavenlies, "above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come; and has put all things under his feet".<a name=91:3></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:8">Hebrews  2:8</a> says, "But now we see not yet all things subjected to <i>him</i>", but God has <i>already</i> established Christ in that invulnerable position, and having done that He is entitled, so to speak, to regard all things as put under His feet.<a name=91:4></a> They are to be so actually very shortly, but Christ is now in an invulnerable position at the right hand of God and therefore faith takes account of all things as already put under His feet.<a name=91:5></a> So it says, "and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all".<a name=91:6></a> That is one wonderful conception which we are to have in our minds, that the assembly is Christ's body.<a name=91:7></a> It is a very great vessel because, as I said, it is composed of all those who, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, from the day of Pentecost right on till the moment when the Lord takes us to be with Himself.<a name=91:8></a> Who can number them?<a name=91:9></a> It is the greatest expression of divine wisdom, that such a vessel, composed of those from every nation under the sun should be called out by means of the gospel and attached by the Holy Spirit to Christ, and
	</div>

		<a name=92>[Page 92]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		formed by the Spirit's work, as one body; co-ordinated into one body as a vessel in which Christ Himself shall find the perfect expression of His moral features in His love, in His wisdom, in everything that marks Him as Man.<a name=92:1></a> All is to find perfect expression in His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=92:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The filling of all things looks on to the coming day, when there will not be anything that does not come under the effect of the influence of Christ, and that influence is to be exercised by means of His body.<a name=92:3></a> It is, so to speak, the mediatorial position that Christ has established in His place as Head, for He will exert His influence by means of which everything in all is to be filled through His body, the assembly.<a name=92:4></a> If that be so, you can understand how much God has to work out in us.<a name=92:5></a> The work will be complete in a day very soon to come.<a name=92:6></a> It will be understood what God hath wrought.<a name=92:7></a> It will be seen.<a name=92:8></a> He is working in mystery at the present time.<a name=92:9></a> It says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:2">Proverbs  25:2</a>).<a name=92:10></a> That is our glory, because it is the saints who are referred to in the passage.<a name=92:11></a> It is part of God's glory that He can work all this out without the world's having the slightest conception of what is being done.<a name=92:12></a> It is no honour to us to be ignorant of divine things, for we have the Scriptures and the Holy Spirit, and it is positively dishonouring to God for us to be ignorant of divine things.<a name=92:13></a> If these things are to be our inheritance, it ought to be our greatest concern to be searching them out in dependence on the Lord and the Spirit.<a name=92:14></a> And availing ourselves of every help, both in the reading of the Scriptures; and the reading of the ministry which the Lord provides; and attending the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Passing on to chapter 3, it speaks there of the assembly as that in which the manifold wisdom of God is now to be known to principalities and powers in heavenly places.<a name=93:2></a> Up till now, in speaking of the closing verses of chapter one, I have referred to what is as yet future in the actual display of it, but this passage brings us down to the present, and hence it is of the greatest importance.<a name=93:3></a> The apostle says, "To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God".<a name=93:4></a> It is not hidden now, it is being made known through Paul's ministry.<a name=93:5></a> But what is the administration of the mystery?<a name=93:6></a> I hope every believer is interested in the thought of the mystery, because the idea of mystery means that we are initiated into something of which the world knows nothing.<a name=93:7></a> It is something that God has carefully concealed from the wise men of this world; as the Lord says, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.<a name=93:8></a> Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>, 26).<a name=93:9></a> And so, as I said, there is something mysterious which God is working out at the present time.<a name=93:10></a>

		You will remember how, in the early history of the assembly, Satan tried to blot out what God was doing by persecution.<a name=95:1></a> Later, after the decline had come in in the early history of the church the persecution was revived in the ordering of God, and for a long period it became very intense.<a name=95:2></a> Then by that means, which shows how completely God has the forces of evil under control, fidelity to Christ was revived.<a name=95:3></a> So that in the Lord's address to Smyrna, which contemplates that period in church history when persecution was particularly rampant, we find no word of rebuke, but the saints are viewed there as being faithful unto death.<a name=95:4></a> And thus, by the very means of Satan's animosity and opposition, God secured in the assembly at that time this quality of faithfulness unto death, a feature of Christ indeed, for He was supremely faithful to God, even unto death.<a name=95:5></a> I have no doubt that this was brought to pass actually by means of the faithful service of Christ, His love and sympathy, and by the service of the Holy Spirit; but then these things were unseen, but what is <i>seen</i> is what comes to light in the assembly.<a name=95:6></a> What came to light in the assembly at that period was that God is so wise.<a name=95:7></a> He was able to make use of the very means that Satan was employing in his animosity against the saints, to develop that particular feature of correspondence to Christ which forms part of what He has in mind for the assembly.<a name=95:8></a> Then as time went on, Satan changed his tactics; and as we know Thyatira contemplates the great system which obtains in the world still, under the name of the church, claiming to be the church, but truly abhorrent to Christ and to God.<a name=95:9></a> It is Rome, and Rome maintains a place in the world, claiming to be the church having a recognised

		Later on God began to work at the time of the Reformation, and He overthrew some of Rome's power, preparing the way for what was to follow.<a name=96:4></a> He established the great principle of justification by faith and, by doing so, undermined the authority of the church of Rome in the souls of many, and established the great ground on which, in subsequent years, recovery to assembly truth has been possible.<a name=96:5></a> The Holy Spirit was not availed of by the saints in a collective way for many years, or until within the last 120 years or so.<a name=96:6></a> But in these last days, God has been working in a powerful way, recovering the truth of the assembly, and that the assembly has a glorious Head in heaven.<a name=96:7></a> And that the Spirit of God is here, so that we can be free from all domination of the mind and will of man in the things of God.<a name=96:8></a> For no man has authority over the saints in the things of God.<a name=96:9></a> Christ is Head of the body, the assembly, and the Spirit is here as indwelling the saints.<a name=96:10></a> As these things have been practically recognised, what is contrary to God has been thrust out, and the ground has been brought in upon which the saints are able to move together as governed by the light of the assembly.<a name=96:11></a> Many of the saints are not in the gain of this: alas!<a name=96:12></a> that it should be so, but the ground is there, and the Lord says to Philadelphia, "I have set before thee an opened door,

		I feel impressed, beloved brethren, to say a word as to prayer, prayer characteristically and prayer specifically, both individual and collective, because prayer is one of the most important things that we are called upon to give ourselves to.<a name=107:1></a> It is not limited to those who are advanced in the faith, or specially spiritual, for the apostle in writing to the Thessalonian saints, who at the time were very young in the faith, only perhaps a few weeks old, said to them, "pray unceasingly" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:17">1 Thessalonians  5:17</a>).<a name=107:2></a> Moreover, he said to those same saints, "Brethren, pray for us" (verse 25).<a name=107:3></a> It is a remarkable thing that the apostle and his fellow-workers should desire and value the prayers of very young believers.<a name=107:4></a> I would commend that to young believers.<a name=107:5></a> Begin early to pray for other needs besides your own personal ones and your own exercises.<a name=107:6></a> To have to do with God and with the Lord in prayer, and to begin to take up in prayer divine interests, however simply it may be done, will be of great help to oneself as well as, of course, tending to promote the interests of God.<a name=107:7></a> We cannot cultivate being in the presence of God without being greatly helped by it.<a name=107:8></a> These are days in which it is of all importance that we should become stable in the truth and happy in it too, that we may have real liberty and also joy, mingled, of course, with right feelings, involving the sorrows of the testimony.<a name=107:9></a>

		Now in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>the Lord is presented as praying.<a name=108:3></a> It is where He first comes out under public notice in the testimony.<a name=108:4></a> He had been under public notice to some extent before, for it is said that He "advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:52">Luke  2:52</a>).<a name=108:5></a> Men had taken account of Him, but now as He is about to come out and take up His service publicly, He is presented not only as being baptised, but also as praying.<a name=108:6></a> We are not told what He was praying about, but the fact is simply stated that He was praying, and we are intended to gather from that, that it was characteristic of Him, that He was characterised by prayer, and that indeed is a feature of true manhood.<a name=108:7></a> It is man's true glory, that he is dependent upon God; that he does not assume to be self-supporting or self-sufficient, but that he needs God and depends upon Him.<a name=108:8></a> That is true glory in manhood, and it was specially set out in the Lord Jesus, when He first appeared to take up His service publicly.<a name=108:9></a> It was then the voice from heaven said, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=108:10></a> God is referring to what Jesus had been under His eye during the period of about thirty years which had then elapsed.<a name=108:11></a> That is an important matter to pay attention to, dear brethren, that if we are to have liberty and power with God in prayer, it is necessary that we should be pleasing to Him in the circumstances in which He has set us.<a name=108:12></a> There is

		So, dear brethren, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:18">Luke  9:18</a>, 28 we find the Lord praying alone, and further, He took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.<a name=111:8></a> "And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent".<a name=111:9></a> This shows that if we pray we may find ourselves introduced into heavenly scenes where, for a moment, we may leave behind the exercises that call for prayer, and find ourselves in a position of privilege.<a name=111:10></a> How suggestive it is, that it was "as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different".<a name=111:11></a> He took on, as it were, heavenly glory.<a name=111:12></a> All these things are delineated for us in the gospel of Luke, which particularly sets out the features of manhood

		according to God, as presented perfectly in Christ, and intended to be taken account of by His people.<a name=112:1></a> Again, in chapter 11: 1, the Lord is seen praying "in a certain place;" that is to say, prayer there has in mind local needs.<a name=112:2></a> That is something that every brother and sister ought to take up in prayer, not only at the prayer meeting, but privately as well.<a name=112:3></a> If I may be permitted, I would like to say to any brother who has not enjoyed much in the way of liberty in thanksgiving and praise in divine service, that I believe that if we cultivate private and specific prayer in relation to divine interests, it will promote liberty with God, and when the time for liberty arises, we shall find ourselves set free.<a name=112:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What comes into view in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>is not only the importance of praying in relation to local needs, but the need of being specific in our prayers.<a name=112:5></a> There is prayer as characteristic of us and indicating dependence, but there is also specific prayer.<a name=112:6></a> Hence the need of knowing what to ask for, and asking for it.<a name=112:7></a> So the Lord says, "But of whom of you that is a father shall a son ask bread, and the father shall give him a stone?<a name=112:8></a> or also a fish, and instead of a fish shall give him a serpent?<a name=112:9></a> or if also he shall ask an egg, shall give him a scorpion?<a name=112:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:11">Luke  11:11</a>, 12).<a name=112:11></a> The Lord is suggesting definiteness in prayer, that we are to know whether to ask for bread, or for fish, or for an egg.<a name=112:12></a> All these things are in relation to local needs, and the importance, therefore, of knowing what is needed in the locality, because the whole setting of that passage is that the Lord may come to visit that locality to see what is there.<a name=112:13></a> The one who prays is faced with the possibility that he may have nothing to set before Him when He comes.<a name=112:14></a>

		"Who among you", the Lord says, "shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, let me have three loaves, since a friend of mine on a journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:5">Luke  11:5</a>, 6).<a name=113:1></a> It is suggestive of the Lord coming unexpectedly to see what He finds in a certain locality, and the responsibility of those there who are concerned that the Lord will not find an absence of anything He can appreciate.<a name=113:2></a> So we are to pray, and know whether the need is food, which the bread might suggest; or whether there is a need for spiritual energy which the fish might suggest; or whether what is needed is, so to speak, life in embryo, which the egg might suggest, the need for the coming generation.<a name=113:3></a> The whole point, I believe, in the passage is that we should have regard for what the needs are, and be specific in our prayers.<a name=113:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To refer now to the passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>.<a name=113:5></a> We come to a most solemn moment in the path of the Lord Jesus, and it is a question of how the will of God is to be carried through to completion, for that is what was immediately before the mind of the Lord.<a name=113:6></a> The time had arrived when, so far as His service was concerned, matters were to be brought to completion.<a name=113:7></a> It meant for Him not only the severest suffering at the hands of men, but it involved specially the bearing of sin and being abandoned by His God.<a name=113:8></a> In that, of course, He stands alone.<a name=113:9></a> But the scene in Gethsemane's garden is not the actual abandonment.<a name=113:10></a> It is Satan bringing to bear upon the mind and spirit of the Lord Jesus, before the moment had actually arrived, what would be involved if He continued right through, and completed the work which had been given Him to do.<a name=113:11></a> In that sense, it

		may become pattern for us, not that we shall ever have to face any test that in the slightest degree approaches to the severity of this test.<a name=114:1></a> But, at the same time, what is seen is that the Lord was facing the question of carrying through the will of God to completion, and it was the realisation of what was involved in this that He rightly and in holiness shrank from.<a name=114:2></a> He was free to pray, "if thou wilt remove this cup from me: -- but then, not my will, but thine be done".<a name=114:3></a> The incident is rather one for contemplation, beloved brethren, than for much to be said upon it.<a name=114:4></a> Here is the Lord, faced with all that was involved in the carrying through of the will of God to completion, and as understanding all that it meant, in holiness shrinking from it.<a name=114:5></a> "Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: -- but then, not my will, but thine be done".<a name=114:6></a> God would have us watchful that no element of will that is contrary to His has place with us.<a name=114:7></a> Then it says that "an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him.<a name=114:8></a> And being in conflict he prayed more intently.<a name=114:9></a> And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth".<a name=114:10></a> A wonderful passage for us, showing that greater intensity of exercise is right at certain times than at others, not that exercise is not proper at all times, but it is fitting that certain matters should call for it in greater degree.<a name=114:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says to His disciples in verse 40, "Pray that ye enter not into temptation".<a name=114:12></a> Then in verses 45 and 46 it says, "And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.<a name=114:13></a> And he said to them, Why sleep ye?<a name=114:14></a> rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation".<a name=114:15></a> Now the point was that Satan was near, and Satan is near us, and we may rest assured that as the

	<div class="paragraph">
		testimony is being carried to completion, he will do his utmost to overcome the saints in some way or another.<a name=115:1></a> Hence the need of prayer; "rise up and pray".<a name=115:2></a> It is not the time for sleeping.<a name=115:3></a> I am not speaking, of course, of literal sleep; it is the time for rising up and praying, and praying that we may not enter into temptation.<a name=115:4></a> The dispensation is about to close and the Lord is looking to it that we should carry forward every feature of the truth to completion.<a name=115:5></a> It is urgent that we should be constant in prayer and not find ourselves in a position that we have not faith for, and thus be led into temptation and fail in regard of the testimony.<a name=115:6></a> There is no reason, of course, why we should fail.<a name=115:7></a> The Lord said, "rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation".<a name=115:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, passing from that, I wanted in the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>to show that the Lord contemplates that we should have power with God.<a name=115:9></a> I believe the Lord has in mind in this scripture, what will mark us as moving on together.<a name=115:10></a> I do not mean necessarily limiting it to collective prayer, though it would include that; but the point the Lord has in mind is that His disciples should be going on together as committed to God's testimony.<a name=115:11></a> And as feeling what it is to be in a world in which they are hated, the Lord stresses the importance of loving one another.<a name=115:12></a> "If the world hate you, know that it has hated me before you.<a name=115:13></a> If ye were of the world, the world would love its own" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:18">John  15:18</a>, 19).<a name=115:14></a> So it is contemplated that as we go on, and the nearer we reach to completion, the more we shall become conscious that the world hates us.<a name=115:15></a> But that is not to cause us to surrender or in any way to compromise, but we are to find support in the company of the brethren.<a name=115:16></a> The matter is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=116>[Page 116]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		imperative.<a name=116:1></a> It is one of the bulwarks of the testimony, that whatever has to be met in the outside sphere, the support needed for the position will be found in the circle of the brethren.<a name=116:2></a> Hence how important it is that we should cultivate love, and enjoy the mutual support and encouragement which the circle of love affords.<a name=116:3></a> So the Lord says in verse 7, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you".<a name=116:4></a> That is a remarkable statement, showing, as I said before, that it may be possible for us to effect far more by the power we have with God in prayer than by anything we can do ourselves, and this is evidently open to all.<a name=116:5></a> It is not a question of those who are gifted, but "If ye abide in me".<a name=116:6></a> As abiding in Christ we take character from Him; it develops that which will give us power with God.<a name=116:7></a> "If ye abide in me .<a name=116:8></a>.<a name=116:9></a>.<a name=116:10></a> ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you".<a name=116:11></a> It is a question of asking what we will and having it answered, which involves, of course, that our prayers are in keeping with the will of God and the needs of the moment.<a name=116:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are very encouraging statements, and then the Lord says, "In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit", indicating, I believe, that this would be a feature that marked the Lord personally, and now it is to be continued in the disciples.<a name=116:13></a> You remember how at the grave of Lazarus the Lord said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me; but I knew that thou always hearest me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:41">John  11:41</a>, 42).<a name=116:14></a> Think of that!<a name=116:15></a> He had already requested something in relation to the raising of Lazarus, but he says, "I knew that thou always hearest me".<a name=116:16></a> That is, every time He prayed, He was heard; every time He asked,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was asking according to God's will and it was being answered.<a name=117:1></a> Think of the power there is in prayer of that nature!<a name=117:2></a> Think of the character of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, beginning at the moment that had then arrived and continuing right to the time when we shall behold His glory!<a name=117:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What possibilities there are, beloved brethren, if we would only seek to cultivate the reality of abiding in Christ.<a name=117:4></a> Thus shall we become intelligent and understand what the testimony calls for and what the needs of the moment are, because the Lord will continue speaking to the end of the dispensation.<a name=117:5></a> There is no question about that.<a name=117:6></a> It is an evidence of His love.<a name=117:7></a> He says in His word to Philadelphia, "because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name .<a name=117:8></a>.<a name=117:9></a>.<a name=117:10></a> behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that <i>I</i> have loved thee" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>, 9).<a name=117:11></a> So that He will take us out of it to be with Himself; but He places it on the footing that we have kept the word of His patience.<a name=117:12></a> We were saying on a previous occasion that the Lord is patient, and we have to be patient.<a name=117:13></a> We have to go on with the testimony not knowing when it is coming to an end.<a name=117:14></a> Even the Son takes the place of not knowing the day or the hour.<a name=117:15></a> We know not what hour the testimony may end, but we may get impressions that the end is near at hand.<a name=117:16></a> Throughout the period of Christ's patience He will speak to those who love Him, and His speaking will afford us guidance; and as I was saying, He bases His promise to us on the fact that we have kept the word of his patience.<a name=117:17></a> It is for us to see that we do it and that we do it on these lines, that His word abides in us and we abide in Him.<a name=117:18></a> We

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		can affect the whole course of things in the company, or in the world of christian profession, by our prayers, if the testimony demands it.<a name=118:1></a> There is no limit to what we may do in our prayers if the testimony requires it.<a name=118:2></a> You will remember when Joshua was bringing the people into the land and a battle was being waged against the enemy, and, so to speak, the matter was not completed, Joshua called upon the sun to stand still.<a name=118:3></a> There was a man asking for what the exigencies of the moment required, in order that God's thoughts in regard of His people should be carried through then and there to completion.<a name=118:4></a> He called upon the sun to stand still, and the result was that the victory was completed, and God came into the matter, so that there were more slain by the hailstones which came down from heaven than were slain by the children of Israel.<a name=118:5></a> God will come into the matter if we pray as those who have power with Him.<a name=118:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I read the passage from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122">Psalm  122</a>in order to add a little increased definiteness to this matter of our prayers.<a name=118:7></a> The psalmist is speaking of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem for us means the assembly.<a name=118:8></a> Jerusalem was God's centre of interest upon earth, and that at the present time is unquestionably the assembly.<a name=118:9></a> Jerusalem is not exactly Zion.<a name=118:10></a> For I understand that Zion, in its typical bearing refers to the assembly according to God's thoughts regarding it.<a name=118:11></a> Jerusalem is more the concrete expression of those thoughts down here; that is to say, when it refers to Jerusalem, it is the assembly just the same, but viewed as in actual expression amongst the saints.<a name=118:12></a> So it says, "Jerusalem, which art built as a city that is compact together", stressing the importance of love among

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ourselves, for there is nothing so compacting in its influence as love among ourselves.<a name=119:1></a> That is something that Satan will always seek to attack, and we must therefore lay ourselves out to preserve love among us.<a name=119:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While I am speaking a great deal about prayer and the importance of making time for it, not only when we are together but also privately, it must not be thought that I am decrying right activity, for there is a call for right activity also.<a name=119:3></a> We are told to do whatever our hands find to do, with all our might.<a name=119:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>we see the activities of love in the good Samaritan.<a name=119:5></a> "Take care of him, and whatsoever thou shalt expend more, <i>I</i> will render to thee on my coming back" (verse 35).<a name=119:6></a> It is self-sacrificing love in care for the saints.<a name=119:7></a> So that while I am emphasising the great importance of prayer, it must not be thought that I am in any way belittling activity; there must be room made for both.<a name=119:8></a> We are to realise increasingly that divine things call for our whole time committal to them; there is no time for anything else.<a name=119:9></a> There are legitimate duties, of course, that have to be fulfilled, but the time is such, and the truth that the Lord is giving is such, and the state of the world is such, that divine things call for complete committal to them.<a name=119:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=123:1></a>G.<a name=123:2></a> It is clear from this chapter that the thought of mystery enters into christianity, the Lord saying to His disciples that it was given to them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to others it was not given.<a name=123:3></a> There is a certain element of what is judicial in the blinding of the eyes of those who reject the testimony.<a name=123:4></a> So that divine things are hidden from them, but to those who are subject to the Lord, and truly disciples, the things of God are presented in a way that is comprehensible to them, but not to others.<a name=123:5></a> That really involves the Spirit, so the Lord said, speaking of the Spirit, that He would beg the Father and He would give us another Comforter, "that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>, 17).<a name=123:6></a> So that the presence of the Spirit involves that there are certain things known to believers which are entirely unknown, and impossible of being known, to others.<a name=123:7></a> That brings in the thought of mystery as properly belonging to the saints, something that we should particularly cherish, that it is given to us to be initiated into the thoughts of God which are hidden from men in general.<a name=123:8></a>

		I think <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>presents things first of all from that standpoint.<a name=124:1></a> If there is to be anything for God there must be a divine sowing, as in the parable of the sower.<a name=124:2></a> But even that brings to light that there are certain adverse influences, the wicked one catching away the seed sown by the wayside, and tribulation and persecution, and thorns, cares of life and so on.<a name=124:3></a> Then there are the six subsequent parables, which are definitely called similitudes of the kingdom, divided into two threes.<a name=124:4></a> The first three giving the position of things publicly, and being intended to open our eyes as to the way that Satan is acting in opposition to what is of God.<a name=124:5></a> The last three give us what is really of God and are intended to give us to understand the true features of it.<a name=124:6></a> I think, as the Lord may help us, we shall see that the features which are found in the first three similitudes of the kingdom, all find their answer in the last three.<a name=124:7></a>

		A.J.<a name=124:12></a>G.<a name=124:13></a> Yes, I think that, and therefore it is of particular value for all of us to get a sense that to us it is given to know divine mysteries.<a name=124:14></a> It sets us apart from the whole course and outlook of this world, and gives us the consciousness that we have part in, and entrance into, a system of things which is of God, that the world has no part in and cannot possibly apprehend at all.<a name=124:15></a>

		J.M.<a name=126:10></a> Well, it may not be active, but divinely the position is guarded, so that those who have no part in it do not have a part in it.<a name=126:11></a> Yet it is open, as you have suggested, to those who are initiated and there is liberty to move as recognising that it is in mystery.<a name=126:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=126:13></a>G.<a name=126:14></a> Well, I think that is implicit in the presence of the Spirit, "whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>), the Lord says.<a name=126:15></a> So that in that way, by the gift of the Spirit, the Lord introduces His own into the things of God and excludes those who have no part in them.<a name=126:16></a> It is very important, I think, to see that the Spirit of God involves ability, capacity to enter into the thoughts of God fully, and it also involves a deliberate exclusion of those who have not the Spirit; the mind of man cannot possibly compass divine things.<a name=126:17></a>

		A.J.<a name=127:4></a>G.<a name=127:5></a> That is what I thought was one great value of these parables, and hence, if we take up the parable of the tares, what is clear is that an enemy is at work.<a name=127:6></a> The Lord definitely says so.<a name=127:7></a> He is at work in introducing publicly those who have the appearance of the true thing, for the tares resemble the wheat in outward appearance, but actually they are sons of the wicked one.<a name=127:8></a> The word is to let them both grow together; that is, God is not intervening publicly to alter that position.<a name=127:9></a> Then in the next parable of the mustard seed, that which commenced in what was very small, has now become outwardly very large -- what we speak of as christendom.<a name=127:10></a> It becomes such that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.<a name=127:11></a> That is, there is room in it for every kind of evil doctrine; the whole position, so to speak, being discredited, but that is the position publicly.<a name=127:12></a> Then finally in the parable of the leaven, there is a certain element introduced into christianity which pervades the whole thing.<a name=127:13></a> That, I believe, is that the first man, whom God has set aside judicially in the cross of Christ, has been re-introduced, so that what is of man instead of what is of Christ pervades christianity in its public aspect.<a name=127:14></a> Those, I believe, are the three outstanding characteristics of those three parables, and I believe we shall see in the other three, although not necessarily in that order, that all these elements are met in the vital thing.<a name=127:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.E.<a name=128:8></a> Would you say that these three elements, or principles, are working at the present time, the principle of admixture, which is always foreign to the work of God; then the tendency to assume proportions never divinely intended; then the subtle, secret working of evil as seen in the leaven?<a name=128:9></a> Are we constantly facing these principles in assembly matters, assembly sorrows and so on?<a name=128:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=128:11></a>G.<a name=128:12></a> I am sure that is right, and I think it helps to see that in the divine thought of the assembly, these evil principles are completely renounced and the opposite to them is established.<a name=128:13></a> So that, for instance, it seems to me that the parable of the treasure hid in the field is the answer to the parable of the mustard seed.<a name=128:14></a> That is to say, in contrast to that which assumes great proportions, the saints understand that the divine idea is that what is of God should be hidden.<a name=128:15></a> We accept that position, that our life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=128:16></a> The affections of the saints are bound up with Christ, and He being hidden we are content

		A.J.<a name=129:12></a>G.<a name=129:13></a> I have no doubt that the treasure links on with Colossians, as you say, and the pearl is peculiarly the beauty of the assembly as wholly for Christ.<a name=129:14></a> So that is no doubt before us in Ephesians, and I believe works out in a practical way in the exercises of the testimony.<a name=129:15></a> So that Paul in 2 Corinthians insists on the fact that he had espoused them unto one Man.<a name=129:16></a> I believe that is wherein the beauty of the pearl lies; its oneness, undivided affection for Christ.<a name=129:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=149:1></a>G.<a name=149:2></a> We were remarking this morning that the thought of mystery in divine things, as far as our entering into it is concerned, involves the presence of the Spirit, the Lord having told the disciples, "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>, 17).<a name=149:3></a> So that the coming in of the Spirit evidently involves, for those who have the Spirit, that they are set up in the possession of things that are entirely outside the range of this world.<a name=149:4></a> I think this passage in 1 Corinthians enlarges on that, in that the apostle intimates that he had wisdom to speak of.<a name=149:5></a> He had just said that he renounced entirely man's wisdom, but the Corinthians were to understand he had wisdom to speak of.<a name=149:6></a> It was necessary, however, that there should be a certain state in the saints in order to receive it, and that state, alas, was lacking with the Corinthians.<a name=149:7></a> In writing to them the apostle does not proceed to develop what it is he has to speak of, but just says sufficient to induce interest in these things on their part.<a name=149:8></a> He says, "we speak wisdom among the perfect".<a name=149:9></a> Then in chapter 3 he has to tell them they are far from being perfect, in that they were babes.<a name=149:10></a> Hence the point in this passage in Corinthians, I think, is just to stimulate our
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=150>[Page 150]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		interest in the hidden wisdom which Paul has to make known to us, and to make it perfectly clear that only in the Spirit can this hidden wisdom be entered upon.<a name=150:1></a> On the other hand, as we were saying this morning, it is to show us that there is no limit to what can be entered on in the Spirit.<a name=150:2></a> The scripture says, "for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God".<a name=150:3></a> So that, no doubt, while the apostle had in his mind the mystery, he does not call it the mystery in Corinthians, but simply says, "But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory".<a name=150:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, if one may just intimate what is in mind in the passage in Colossians, he definitely introduces "the mystery".<a name=150:5></a> He introduces it as something that is extremely great, speaking of it as "the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations".<a name=150:6></a> Then he shows that his great exercise was that the saints should be knit together in love; for unless we are united in love, there is no power to enter upon the mystery, however much we may think we understand it objectively.<a name=150:7></a> Then finally, he introduces what is the kernel of it, that is, in Christ "dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=150:8></a> So that nothing outside of Christ is needed by the assembly.<a name=150:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=150:10></a>S.<a name=150:11></a> Is it a challenge to us then in the use of this word <i>perfect</i>?<a name=150:12></a> Is there a link with the way he speaks of it in Corinthians and in Colossians where he desires to present every man perfect in Christ?<a name=150:13></a>

		A.J.<a name=150:14></a>G.<a name=150:15></a> I would say that.<a name=150:16></a> I think the idea of <i>perfect</i> in Corinthians does not go so far as <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, where the apostle says that he does not regard himself as being yet perfect.<a name=150:17></a> I think in Corinthians what he has in mind is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=151:9></a>G.<a name=151:10></a> Yes, everything in the way of subjective results in the saints is dependent on the Spirit.<a name=151:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:8">Matthew  13:8</a>, which has in mind the position publicly and dispensationally, it says, "one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty", showing that there is decline, and that the dispensation closes with what is outwardly very small.<a name=151:12></a> But in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:8">Mark  4:8</a>, the similar parable says, "one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred".<a name=151:13></a> Mark being the servant's gospel, and showing that the servant is to aim at a full measure of result.<a name=151:14></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:8">Luke  8:8</a>, in the corresponding parable, it says, "bore fruit a hundredfold".<a name=151:15></a> This would link with our own state of soul, "an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience" (verse 15).<a name=151:16></a> That is our side of the matter, not the servant's, that we on our part should not have anything less before us than the full measure of fruit.<a name=151:17></a>

		A.J.<a name=179:1></a>G.<a name=179:2></a> In chapter 1 of this epistle we have the thought of the mystery of God's will which He has made known to us.<a name=179:3></a> We are intended to be intelligent as to what is about to come in, the heading up of all things in heaven and on earth in Christ, and the assembly's portion as inheriting it with Him.<a name=179:4></a> But in chapters 3 and 5 we have the mystery as it is usually spoken of, that is <i>the</i> mystery -- "the mystery of the Christ", as it says in chapter 3, and a great mystery in chapter 5, which the apostle says is Christ and the assembly.<a name=179:5></a> In chapter 3 we have what the mystery of the Christ is, that those of the gentiles, the nations, "should be <i>joint</i> heirs, and a <i>joint</i> body, and <i>joint</i> partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings".<a name=179:6></a> So, as we were saying, in connection with <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>, there is great importance in our being united together in love.<a name=179:7></a> The apostle, when he introduces the thought of mystery, stresses this thought of "joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus".<a name=179:8></a> Then he goes on to show that in the mystery the principalities and powers in the heavenlies are intended to learn at the present time the all various wisdom of God.<a name=179:9></a> Hence the mystery is presented in chapter 3 largely in relation to God, whereas in chapter 5 it is presented in relation to Christ -- what it means to Him to have the assembly.<a name=179:10></a>

		A.J.<a name=180:4></a>G.<a name=180:5></a> Yes, I would say that; you are referring to the fact of Jew and gentile being made one.<a name=180:6></a> In chapter 3 the apostle is stressing the fact that it embraces the nations, he says, "that they who are of the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus".<a name=180:7></a> It is a very great conception, which was entirely new.<a name=180:8></a> It is a remarkable thing in God's ways that early in the history of man He separated Abraham's seed and made it a peculiar nation.<a name=180:9></a> He hedged it about, and forbade it to have much in the way of intercourse with other nations, so that for centuries there was one nation on earth that was peculiarly God's people.<a name=180:10></a> The revelation of the mystery, therefore, involved a complete departure in the ways of God, and the introduction of something that was entirely unknown, and in which the riches of divine grace and wisdom shine out.<a name=180:11></a> It is not just one nation, not simply Israel set aside and one other nation taken up, but it is a question of all nations, they who are of the nations.<a name=180:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=181:5></a>G.<a name=181:6></a> It is very striking that Simeon mentions gentiles first, showing that in the Spirit he became intelligent before his day, you might say, before the Spirit had come and before Paul had been brought on the scene.<a name=181:7></a> He really anticipated the mystery by saying, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel".<a name=181:8></a> It is a great witness to the influence of Christ, and of course to the power of the Spirit, that those who are naturally so utterly diverse can be joined together in one body.<a name=181:9></a> That really was what Peter was given to see in the sheet let down from heaven.<a name=181:10></a> It was a vessel, and it came down from heaven and went up to heaven.<a name=181:11></a> That is, it was heavenly in origin, as has often been said, and heavenly in destiny, and yet the constituents of it were all manner of four footed beasts and creeping things, and so on.<a name=181:12></a> But then the word was, "What God has cleansed, do not <i>thou</i> make common" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:15">Acts  10:15</a>).<a name=181:13></a> God cleanses the hearts of the nations by faith, and then gives them the Holy Spirit, and it seems to me to be a wonderful testimony to the influence of Christ that such constituents can be bound together, united together perfectly in love in one body.<a name=181:14></a>

		I desire to speak of the Son of man as He is presented in these scriptures in John's gospel.<a name=201:1></a> They are not the only passages in the gospel in which He is thus presented.<a name=201:2></a> There is, for instance, one in chapter 5: 27 where we are told that the Father "has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is Son of man".<a name=201:3></a> This is a remarkable statement, showing that God is infinitely fair and intends that His judgment should be seen to be so.<a name=201:4></a> So that men will be judged by a Man whose glory it is that He gave Himself a ransom for many, as the Lord says, "The Son of man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister, and give his life a ransom for many" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:45">Mark  10:45</a>).<a name=201:5></a> So that as men are judged, as it says in Revelation, according to their works, they will be judged by One who at all cost to Himself provided a means by which they might have been released from the guilt attaching to them and from the sinful condition in which they were.<a name=201:6></a> Hence the judgment will be manifested to be absolutely fair; not a single word will be able to be said against it, but I do not dwell on that, I wish to concentrate on these passages.<a name=201:7></a>

		"Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!<a name=202:1></a> who hast set thy majesty above the heavens".<a name=202:2></a> It was anticipatively directing the attention of faith to Him, who has gone up far above all heavens.<a name=202:3></a> God has established His glory above the heavens, and the Psalm goes on to speak of the Son of man, saying, "What is man", (i.<a name=202:4></a>e.<a name=202:5></a> Enosh, mortal man, see note <i>q</i>) "that thou art mindful of him?<a name=202:6></a> and the son of man", (i.<a name=202:7></a>e.<a name=202:8></a> the son of Adam, a more distinguished presentation, see note <i>r</i>) "that thou visitest him?<a name=202:9></a>" Then it proceeds to say, "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and splendour.<a name=202:10></a> Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands" (verses  4 - 6).<a name=202:11></a> That is the position that now obtains.<a name=202:12></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:8">Hebrews  2:8</a>, 9 brings it in, adding that we do not yet see all things put under Him, "but we see Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour".<a name=202:13></a> So the position is already established, although not yet in public display.<a name=202:14></a> Indeed Ephesians also refers to the Son of man, though the term is not used, but quotes from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, "and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, 23).<a name=202:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That brings in what is of greatest interest to us, dear brethren.<a name=202:16></a> The Son of man, as intended to have an exalted place over all the works of God's hands, was known in Old Testament times.<a name=202:17></a> <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:13">Daniel  7:13</a>, 14 says, "I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days .<a name=202:18></a>.<a name=202:19></a>.<a name=202:20></a> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom".<a name=202:21></a> But in those days it was hidden

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord in speaking to Nathanael, who had confessed Him as the Son of God, the King of Israel, basing his thoughts on <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, as much as says, Yes, but there is <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, which goes further than <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=203:4></a> "Thou shalt see greater things than these .<a name=203:5></a>.<a name=203:6></a>.<a name=203:7></a> Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man".<a name=203:8></a> The Lord was saying there are to be greater things than millennial glories and they are to come in now.<a name=203:9></a> "Henceforth;" that is, from this time, better things, greater things, heavenly things were to be opened up.<a name=203:10></a> So the Lord was intimating to Nathanael, while not yet introducing the thought of the assembly, which awaited Paul's ministry, that the present time was a time in which heavenly things, greater and better than millennial things were to be introduced.<a name=203:11></a> They were to be introduced in connection with One who was to be apprehended as supreme, One upon whom the angels of God ascended and descended.<a name=203:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>the Lord speaks of heavenly things, saying, "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?<a name=203:13></a>" (verse 12).<a name=203:14></a> Then He proceeds to speak of Himself as

		One who has come down from heaven to bring the light of heavenly things, but He speaks of Himself as "the Son of man who <i>is in heaven</i>".<a name=204:1></a> That is a statement that must arouse our attention, for the Lord was speaking to Nicodemus as a Man who was actually there on earth, and yet He says, "the Son of man who is in heaven".<a name=204:2></a> He does not say, who <i>was</i> in heaven, or who <i>will be</i> in heaven, but there He was as a Man on earth, speaking of Himself as the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=204:3></a> I have no doubt that it is an expression that is indicative of the truth of His Person.<a name=204:4></a> A divine Person was there in the Person of our Lord Jesus, a divine Person became Man, the second Person in the Godhead was there.<a name=204:5></a> These are truly heavenly things coming into evidence, wonderful things that a Man should appear under God's eye and before men, who could speak of Himself as the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=204:6></a> The very title, Son of man, refers to God's thoughts in relation to men which were to be taken up and made good in the Son of man.<a name=204:7></a> So we can see, dear brethren, that manhood of a supremely excellent order has now come into being in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=204:8></a> One who is in heaven, over all God blessed forever, has taken up manhood condition, bringing into manhood the moral excellence of God as made known through Christ.<a name=204:9></a> It is a marvellous conception, that God should have in mind to have man before Him abidingly for His pleasure.<a name=204:10></a> Not simply the Lord Jesus alone, but that others, through redemption and the gift of the Spirit, should have part in that heavenly order of manhood, and thus be suitable to be united to Christ, and to serve God eternally for His pleasure.<a name=204:11></a> This is the conception, and I am seeking to bring these things

		The exercises which are depicted in chapter 7 of this epistle have in mind to bring us to the recognition that we are, in fact, shut up to the power of God for deliverance from the power of sin working in the flesh.<a name=220:4></a> The apostle says of the law, "So that the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:12">Romans  7:12</a>).<a name=220:5></a> He says, "For we know that the law is spiritual: but <i>I</i> am fleshly, sold under sin" (verse 14).<a name=220:6></a> That is what he discovered.<a name=220:7></a> The more he sought to keep the law, the more he discovered the powerlessness that marked him.<a name=220:8></a> "The law had said, Thou shalt not lust" (verse 7), and immediately lust sprang up in his innermost being.<a name=220:9></a> He felt the authority of the commandment, as it applied itself to his conscience, but immediately sin revived, and he died.<a name=220:10></a> And so as he moved, with the most sincere desires to do what was right, he found out his inability to fulfil those desires.<a name=220:11></a> He had desires to do what was right, but all the time he was doing what was wrong, condemning himself for it, but finding no deliverance from this hopeless position in which he was.<a name=220:12></a> And so one great result of it is that he begins to analyse what is really the position, and he comes to this; he says, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man" (verse 22).<a name=220:13></a> He comes to recognise that there is a work of God in his soul which shows itself in having delight in the law of God, at any rate in an abstract way.<a name=220:14></a> This is a most encouraging thing, for no man naturally delights in the law of God, but the soul discovers that as the result of the work of God, there is in him that which is in affinity with Christ

		While what I have been saying is mainly on individual lines, you can see how it issues in assembly privilege and service.<a name=230:9></a> Assembly response to God is characteristically the response of sons.<a name=230:10></a> It takes character from Him who is the Son, and the language in which it is expressed is the language of the Son of God, "Abba, Father".<a name=230:11></a> It is wonderful indeed that human hearts such as we have, should be capable, by the Spirit of God, of expressing themselves in the very same language, and the same affections and feelings, as found expression in Christ as Man.<a name=230:12></a>

		I would like to say a little, dear brethren, about our eyes being opened so that the full situation at the present time may be known.<a name=235:1></a> It is not a very frequent matter, being recorded not many times in the Scriptures, so that we are in the presence of something which has quality and uniqueness about it.<a name=235:2></a> There are a large number of people who say they see, but as over against that we must remember that the Lord said to some who thought they saw, "Now ye say, We see, your sin remains" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#9:41">John  9:41</a>).<a name=235:3></a> It would not be going too far to say that it is part of the great lawlessness and assumption of christendom for people to say that they see, that they have clear vision.<a name=235:4></a> But as having in mind that the opening of eyes is a matter of quality we may perhaps learn to value it more, and be a little more exercised to have our full part in it.<a name=235:5></a> It is one of the great works of the returning Messiah to unstop deaf ears, and open the eyes of the blind.<a name=235:6></a> It took place when the Lord Jesus was here, a blessed foretaste of what spiritually belongs to our day.<a name=235:7></a> The day of the testimony, the day of the truth of the assembly, the day when everything emanates from Christ in glory.<a name=235:8></a> Everything which Jesus had part in must, of course, be unique and glorious when He was here in the days of His flesh, but we may say it is more glorious now, for Jesus, positionally and circumstantially, is more glorious.<a name=235:9></a> "He is glorified" as it

		Besides what is indicated in the scriptures we have read, there are many others which help in this subject.<a name=236:9></a> We must not limit God in what He can do sovereignly when He has a mind to show what He thinks of His people, and what He is going to do with them.<a name=236:10></a> He sovereignly used even a wicked man like Balaam and opened his eyes, so that Balaam describes himself as the man of opened eye, falling down but having his eyes open.<a name=236:11></a> God would do that in the face of men who despise God and despise His people.<a name=236:12></a> He would do that to show what He thinks of His people; He is doing it now and <i>He will do it again</i>.<a name=236:13></a> Before this dispensation closes, I believe there will be what the Lord Jesus speaks of to Philadelphia concerning "them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and

		In coming to the second book of Kings, I would speak for a moment about Elisha and this young man, because this is the day of Elisha's young men; perhaps more than of Elijah's young men.<a name=238:4></a> Elijah is a man of thunder, and a man of judgment, not to be despised at all, for the thunder is needed and the judgment is needed, both are needed in ourselves as self judged, or else there will be no real grace as in Elisha.<a name=238:5></a> You will notice that Elisha is introduced in Scripture in connection with what is agricultural, meaning not so much what shines out of heaven, but what comes up out of the earth, the subjective element, as we would say.<a name=238:6></a> In his first introduction he is found ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen and he with the twelfth.<a name=238:7></a> Whether he had all the twelve oxen before him, literally in front of him, we are not told, but he was a wealthy young man and he had great territory.<a name=238:8></a> He was attached to his home, but as one day the mantle of Elijah fell upon him, new impressions and new exercises came into his mind, impressions and exercises relative to the truth of the testimony.<a name=238:9></a> Much later on, Paul's mantle fell similarly on Timothy.<a name=238:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great day.<a name=238:11></a> Thus we expect things in Elisha's time to grow up graciously and prosperously, and they do.<a name=238:12></a> If you read the early chapters of this second book of

		I just touch this scripture having in mind that our eyes may be open to the true position which is shown by Elisha.<a name=239:14></a> It is first of all a national position.<a name=239:15></a> There is Syria warring against Israel, a very mighty host; and we are to be reminded that now in our time it is a question of national conflicts, and it will be.<a name=239:16></a> It is not a question of small tribal warfare inside the confines of a big country, but nation against nation, but even so, the national situation is not to

		It is in mind to say a little about restfulness, peace of mind and patience; these all being bound up suggestively with the matter of sitting.<a name=249:1></a> That is a deliberate attitude assumed by persons, not entailing for the moment activity, but rather patient waiting.<a name=249:2></a> Rest is an encouraging thing to speak about, because it has been initiated by God.<a name=249:3></a> God having introduced it very early according to Genesis, and connected a whole day with it, the seventh day, the sabbath.<a name=249:4></a> Thus when we read about the sabbath, our minds go back to that which God designed to provide restful conditions for Himself; and, along with that, joy in the contemplation of something that has been done.<a name=249:5></a> It is an amazing thing, and very attractive, to think thus of the first and second chapters of Genesis.<a name=249:6></a> God bringing in one thing after another in creation, arriving finally on the sixth day at the making of man.<a name=249:7></a> "Male and female created he them" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:27">Genesis  1:27</a>), and then resting at the completion of His work in the man that He had made.<a name=249:8></a> It is as if, in the spirit of it, we should understand that while God is God, and absolutely content and complete within Himself, yet He undertakes in His love to share things with men.<a name=249:9></a> And, I believe this great matter of rest is one of the things in which God delights, and which He would bring His creatures into.<a name=249:10></a> It enters into His great final thoughts as we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might speak also of the Lord Jesus, of whom it says that He is above, sitting.<a name=250:5></a> "Seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>).<a name=250:6></a> He has never come back publicly to see how things are being managed, either by the nations or even by the assembly.<a name=250:7></a> He is content to wait.<a name=250:8></a> Scripture has the expression "the patience of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#3:5">2 Thessalonians  3:5</a>), and He Himself says "the word of my patience" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>).<a name=250:9></a> What a wonderful thing to think of the Christ sitting, waiting patiently until the right time comes, until the Father gives the word.<a name=250:10></a> Then He will move and descend, but for the moment the Lord Jesus is content to sit according to the Father's word.<a name=250:11></a> I might also mention the saints as being seen in this attitude, according to John's vision in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>, the twenty-four elders are seen <i>sitting</i> on their thrones.<a name=250:12></a> The most drastic of judgments are about to be poured out on this poor world, and the saints are about to be taken into the confidence of divine Persons.<a name=250:13></a> John himself is told to write, and yet on the very threshold of all this, we find the saints, as typically presented in the elders, quietly sitting in undisturbed repose.<a name=250:14></a>

		and understanding of what God has in His mind.<a name=251:1></a> So this great matter of sabbath is to come into all our minds.<a name=251:2></a> Not that we are to break off exactly what we are doing, to celebrate a kind of sabbath with ourselves, but it is the principle of a <i>cessation</i>, affecting our minds, often in the midst of the most arduous toil.<a name=251:3></a> We find that there are many tasks which we can do, and yet at the same time be going on in our thoughts in restful communion with divine Persons.<a name=251:4></a> Let us start on and cultivate this great feature of restful communion.<a name=251:5></a> Let us, for instance, allow to rest in our minds some feature of the truth that we have heard, or read, or which may have come to us today.<a name=251:6></a> Keep it in our minds, turn it over, observe its scriptural connections, and see how it will enlarge before us.<a name=251:7></a> That is the idea of the sabbath, alongside of what may rightfully call for our practical attention.<a name=251:8></a>

		He appears to be asleep.<a name=252:1></a> It is not necessary to awaken Him, although if we do so, as by our prayers and may be in the weakness of our own faith, He will listen, and He will come in for us.<a name=252:2></a> But the great point, I judge, is to see who it is who is there and can do it.<a name=252:3></a> "Who then is this?<a name=252:4></a>" they say.<a name=252:5></a> We may well take note of that, rejoice in it, that we have such a great Person to do it.<a name=252:6></a> At the end of the chapter He <i>commands</i> that something be given to the young girl to eat.<a name=252:7></a> These commands indicate urgent necessity, for the Lord is seeking persons of a good, honest heart, as in the opening of this chapter.<a name=252:8></a> He wants room for the word of God.<a name=252:9></a> He is prepared to do a great deal to secure the persons for it.<a name=252:10></a> So He will even secure this demoniac, even commanding before the man said much, as if the Lord would urgently come in and command the devil to go out of the man, so that He might have the man for Himself.<a name=252:11></a> And He would secure us, for we need to understand that our own minds naturally are lawless and our clothes (that is, our associations) may be all wrong.<a name=252:12></a> The Lord is prepared to come in quickly to deal with us and He does.<a name=252:13></a> The outstanding moral element needed particularly is preparedness to be transparent in relation to our own condition.<a name=252:14></a> Luke is full of that, full of people who tell the truth.<a name=252:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another woman in this very chapter who falls down and tells all the truth before the Lord.<a name=252:16></a> That is a very great moral victory, that persons should be here in this world who are prepared to tell God the truth.<a name=252:17></a> It is the way into the great realm which God has prepared for us, so that we must be honest and truthful and transparent.<a name=252:18></a> When the Lord asked the man of his name, he said, "Legion".<a name=252:19></a> A

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now as we go on through Luke, we find that the standard is getting higher and that we are brought fully to our own day.<a name=253:15></a> For by the time that we read of Mary, sitting at the Lord's feet and listening to His word, we have passed by many other things.<a name=253:16></a> I do not engage you with them in detail, but I would remark one thing; that is, that the Lord Jesus has been seen in glory, on the mountain.<a name=253:17></a> As

		We are to read the following incidents in the light of that.<a name=254:11></a> So that Mary and Martha, divided in their behaviour in the house, are treating well, or treating badly, the speaking of this glorious Person.<a name=254:12></a> I would submit to the brethren that a touch of that is to be found in our own time.<a name=254:13></a> We are tested, in our houses, as well as in the meetings, by the attention to the glorious speaking of the Lord Jesus.<a name=254:14></a> Martha complained, "Martha was distracted", it says.<a name=254:15></a> The Lord said to her presently "thou art careful and troubled about many things; but there is need of one".<a name=254:16></a> We can easily get anxious and careful, distracted about many things, and they will divert us completely from what the

		In engaging you now with the other passages, I desire to show their connection, for both Mordecai and David are seated in service.<a name=256:5></a> The former in watching the welfare of the king's interests; the latter as fully in the flow of the worship of God.<a name=256:6></a> Mordecai's attitude sets out <i>our</i> attitude towards what we might call, perhaps, matters of administration; while the other scripture refers to our going in to God with great wealth in our souls.<a name=256:7></a> These two things are more nearly connected than many would think.<a name=256:8></a> For matters of administration call for a good deal of spirituality if they are to be taken up rightly, and we shall find that such matters are stronger or weaker according as we ourselves are in spiritual power enabled to approach God.<a name=256:9></a> The two go together, as is seen in the heavenly city.<a name=256:10></a> The heavenly city comes down with Christ to rule; that is, it is administration that is in view, but the heavenly city has already been in to God.<a name=256:11></a> She comes down, we read, out of the heaven, <i>from God</i>, having the glory of God.<a name=256:12></a> She has been in to God and she comes out as having had a great and intimate place with Him, coming out now to rule, in her own peculiar light, most precious.<a name=256:13></a> In principle, therefore, these two scriptures are not to be too much divorced.<a name=256:14></a>

		I would like to speak briefly from these scriptures of descending movements on the part of God, and also on the part of the saints, noting that in each case it is a question of coming down in <i>love</i>.<a name=265:1></a> That would seem to be the key to any descending movement such as we are contemplating now, for love must be the underlying motive; first of all seen in God Himself, and then able to be taken up by His people.<a name=265:2></a> I am not thinking of <i>any</i> descending movement, of course, for some are spoken of in Scripture as "falling".<a name=265:3></a> There are others described as "going down" which are of a character to be avoided, such as the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, a descending movement which is to be entirely avoided.<a name=265:4></a> For it means leaving a morally high level and going down on account of low ground in the soul.<a name=265:5></a> What is before us is descent in <i>love</i>; and where there is affection existing amongst the people of God, these descending movements are the more readily taken on.<a name=265:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first scripture read, Moses had, as it were, descended already, and I believe it would not be wrong to say that this made it morally pleasing for God Himself to come down.<a name=265:7></a> "I am come down", He says, "to deliver them".<a name=265:8></a> In referring to the movement of love in Moses, I have in mind that he was tending the flock; not his own flock, but he was carefully looking after the flock which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=266>[Page 266]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		belonged to someone else.<a name=266:1></a> It says, "Moses tended the flock of Jethro his father-in-law", and we would gather that this had been his character of behaviour all the time he had been in Midian.<a name=266:2></a> It was characteristic of Moses in his love, particularly for God's people.<a name=266:3></a> I believe that our love is tested more that way than in any other, as to whether we can give ourselves unselfishly to the care and attention of that which belongs to Another; not to Jethro now, but to <i>God</i>.<a name=266:4></a> If we love God's flock at all, how far does it extend?<a name=266:5></a> What we read about Moses is that he was prepared in his love to lead this flock into the very best, into the region of the mountain of God, at Horeb.<a name=266:6></a> We may love our brethren a little, perhaps, and pass on in ministry something that will just do, but the persistence and patience and depth of our affection for God's people are tested by how far and how long our service of love will go on.<a name=266:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention this to indicate that love was already working in Moses, and that made it, may I say again, morally pleasing for God himself to come down in love and tell Moses what He was going to do.<a name=266:8></a> This great matter of God appearing in the bush is a foreshadowing of the incarnation, nothing less.<a name=266:9></a> I know that, immediately, it refers to God coming down and dwelling amidst Israel.<a name=266:10></a> <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:6">Malachi  3:6</a> refers to it, "For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed".<a name=266:11></a> That is, we might say, a reminder of God in the burning bush, God amongst His people without consuming them, but dwelling there complacently.<a name=266:12></a> It is but a foretaste, in type, of what God would do as He came down in <i>Christ</i>.<a name=266:13></a> It is really the incarnation which is before us, and the wonderful descent in love seen there.<a name=266:14></a> Who could measure it?<a name=266:15></a> That God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the foreshadowing of this is seen here, and the deliverance out of Egypt of all that belongs to God.<a name=267:8></a> God speaks to Moses and says, "I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard on account of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.<a name=267:9></a> And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and spacious land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey".<a name=267:10></a> I wonder, dear brethren, with all the light we have, whether we all understand from this point of view why God has come down, and what His love will do for us.<a name=267:11></a> The incarnation was not just to touch us and leave

		and this beloved bondman comes in in chapter 21.<a name=270:1></a> It is true that in this chapter it is not stated as a historical event which had actually happened, the passage beginning, "If thou buy a Hebrew bondman", but the type remains there and is filled out in all its blessedness in <i>Christ</i>.<a name=270:2></a> He it was who said distinctly, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free".<a name=270:3></a> He said it, as it were, in the upper room.<a name=270:4></a> He said it in the garden.<a name=270:5></a> He said it on the cross.<a name=270:6></a> Did He not say in the garden, "Abba, Father .<a name=270:7></a>.<a name=270:8></a>.<a name=270:9></a> take away this cup from me; but not what <i>I</i> will, but what <i>thou</i> wilt"?<a name=270:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:36">Mark  14:36</a>).<a name=270:11></a> "I love my master".<a name=270:12></a> That is ascending love, ascending to God the Father.<a name=270:13></a> Then we have love on the level, horizontal love, as it were, "I love .<a name=270:14></a>.<a name=270:15></a>.<a name=270:16></a> my wife;" that refers to the assembly -- she is on His own level.<a name=270:17></a> "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>).<a name=270:18></a> "I love .<a name=270:19></a>.<a name=270:20></a>.<a name=270:21></a> my children" involves descending love, which comes down into the smallest details of the lives and circumstances of those who belong to Christ.<a name=270:22></a> How tenderly He cares for His children.<a name=270:23></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:5">John  21:5</a> He says, "Children, have ye anything to eat?<a name=270:24></a>" In chapter 14: 18 He tells His disciples, as the house-father, that He will not leave them orphans, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".<a name=270:25></a> This is the fatherly care of Jesus, speaking of His descending love in consideration for His children, "I love .<a name=270:26></a>.<a name=270:27></a>.<a name=270:28></a> my children".<a name=270:29></a> He says it pre-eminently on love's occasion, the Lord's supper; those of us here who have an interest in the Lord's supper, and partake of it, will understand fully that the Lord is near; this is His voice to us, "I am coming to you".<a name=270:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Someone may think that all these things going on among the saints are ordinary.<a name=272:7></a> Maybe, that is just what Eutychus was doing; he was in the presence of it all, but was utterly lacking in attention.<a name=272:8></a> So he fell.<a name=272:9></a> Thank God, he <i>was</i> recovered, for Paul says, his life was still in him: "Be not troubled", Paul says, "for his life is in him".<a name=272:10></a> It is a question as to whether we are recoverable; we cannot guarantee that our life will remain in us.<a name=272:11></a> A man may <i>not</i> be recoverable, a solemn thought!<a name=272:12></a> God said of Ephraim, "Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:17">Hosea  4:17</a>).<a name=272:13></a> What a terrible word for God to have to say, "Leave him alone"!<a name=272:14></a> Yet He waited for a move on Ephraim's part, and there comes a day when Ephraim says, "What have I to do any more with idols?<a name=272:15></a>" Then God says, "(I answer him, and I will observe him.<a name=272:16></a>)" And Ephraim continues, "I am like a green fir-tree".<a name=272:17></a> There is recovery to life and freshness.<a name=272:18></a> "From me is thy fruit found", says Jehovah, (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#14:8">Hosea  14:8</a>).<a name=272:19></a> That is recovery.<a name=272:20></a> But it is for <i>us</i> to ponder this matter of

		Then we have this reference to the assembly seen in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, "coming down out of the heaven from God".<a name=273:8></a> It is wonderful to think of this, the assembly coming down in love.<a name=273:9></a> She comes down, with the Lamb; He is not far away.<a name=273:10></a> As we read in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:17">1 Thessalonians  4:17</a>, where Paul is speaking of our being raptured, "and thus we shall be always with the Lord".<a name=273:11></a> So we may say that if the city is seen coming down, the assembly, the Lamb's wife, that <i>He</i> is there too.<a name=273:12></a> I am sure He is.<a name=273:13></a> He is coming down to exercise an influence for good, bringing in an administration of power and goodness and love, and the assembly is to be with Him.<a name=273:14></a> She is not brought in in this chapter as going up first.<a name=273:15></a> We know she will go up, but she is introduced as coming down out of heaven, as if she had never been anywhere else, as if she was seen for the first time just out of the presence of God!<a name=273:16></a> "Coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God".<a name=273:17></a> The shining of the glory of God is there; sonship is there.<a name=273:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lamb's wife is to appear in glory with Him, to take up what is in His mind, so she comes down <i>shining</i>.<a name=274:3></a> The light that will be seen literally then is morally here now, the transparency and the love.<a name=274:4></a> It is made up of persons; the transparency is to be seen in us, and the light and the love.<a name=274:5></a> It raises the question, is there transparency now?<a name=274:6></a> There is only one street in the city; the street refers to the movements of the saints, and it is "pure gold, as transparent glass".<a name=274:7></a> We do not have to tell anyone all that we are doing in our movements, but there should be no moral reason why this could not come to the light.<a name=274:8></a> Personally, domestically, assemblywise, and in our practical part before God, there is one street in the city, one set of movements, transparent as glass.<a name=274:9></a> The walls, too, and the whole city are on this principle.<a name=274:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We sometimes think of transparency as meaning that what is shining one side can be seen on the other, but here it is not that merely.<a name=274:11></a> What is inside the city shines through, and what is there is all of holy, precious worth.<a name=274:12></a> And it is being wrought out at the present time, the time of faith, wrought out in the grace of the Spirit, in love for Christ, love for God, devotedness and loyalty in testimony, love for the brethren, and love for the truth.<a name=274:13></a> These things may never be seen, or written down here on earth, but in the eyes of heaven they are full of substance.<a name=274:14></a> These blessed, glorious persons who make up the city are those who <i>have</i> the glory of God; they have it substantially, and they have

		But there is something still better to come, for what we have just been referring to is not the eternal setting, it is the millennium.<a name=275:3></a> The eternal side still remains, but it was not my thought now to go into that, but just to express a little of the blessedness of having part in the city which comes down from God out of heaven.<a name=275:4></a> She has no embarrassment in being in heaven in the presence of God: she is not a stranger in God's presence, and He is not a stranger God.<a name=275:5></a> All are well known.<a name=275:6></a> God is known, the Lord Jesus is known, the Spirit is known, and the saints are known.<a name=275:7></a> We shall know them all, and we shall know them as they are known; that is, as <i>God</i> knows them.<a name=275:8></a> They are known in heaven and are worth knowing.<a name=275:9></a> The assembly's place is up there, her origin is up there, her destiny is there, and she is coming down from there majestically.<a name=275:10></a> What a day, oh!<a name=275:11></a> what a day, a literal day when the city comes down out of heaven from God!<a name=275:12></a> I rejoice to anticipate having part with the saints in that wonderful time.<a name=275:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these are all movements of love, dear brethren, and we have been formed in love ourselves, so that we can happily rejoice in having our part in it.<a name=275:14></a> The point now, I would say, is that love might have its way with us, in our minds, and in our souls.<a name=275:15></a> The Lord in the gospels, in answer to the question raised as to which is the great commandment, says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:37">Matthew  22:37</a>).<a name=275:16></a> Have you noted that, "thy understanding"?<a name=275:17></a> Meaning that our love is not blind or

		Well, it is only <i>love</i> that will come down, dear brethren.<a name=276:2></a> Whether it be to reach a needy soul, or in the great matters of administration, love as formed in us is always ready to come down; its moral greatness is seen in its descent.<a name=276:3></a> In closing I would just refer the brethren to two of the names in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5">Genesis  5</a>in the great line of God's people; Mahalaleel, meaning <i>the shining of God</i>; and then Jared, meaning <i>descending</i>: a wonderful thing, these two are put together to help us in our souls.<a name=276:4></a> The shining of God in all His splendour is seen in His descending love.<a name=276:5></a> Love is the secret of it all.<a name=276:6></a>

		I should like to bring before you, dear brethren, some thoughts connected with the scriptural thought of the year, as the Lord Jesus calls it, quoting Isaiah, "The acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=277:1></a> It enables us to think of a fairly long time, and therefore the proposal of such a period would be full of encouragement.<a name=277:2></a> That is the main thought before us, that the Lord might fill us with a spirit of encouragement, that we might go on to fill out the year with all that is necessary for completion.<a name=277:3></a> This brings its exercises, because although the year may seem a long time, it comes to an end.<a name=277:4></a> The scripture speaks of years, months, weeks, days and hours.<a name=277:5></a> The shortest would be the twinkling of an eye and, in view of what is connected with the twinkling of an eye, how important it would be to finish out the year well and fully.<a name=277:6></a> So that the rapture may not find us immature and incomplete, but fully furnished with all that grace has in mind to supply.<a name=277:7></a> So I am thinking of the year now as the year of grace.<a name=277:8></a> Not exactly in a gospel setting, although it would be good to preach the gospel at all times, especially from this account in Luke.<a name=277:9></a> But I am thinking of it from the point of view of the Lord's service to us, that we might be helped to have our part before God.<a name=277:10></a> We may go back to the scripture in Isaiah which has in mind people being set up as priests of the Lord, and ministers of our

		God.<a name=278:1></a> It is in my mind, that we might consider a little the Lord's completed service to us in order that we might stand in the service of God as ministers and priests.<a name=278:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many will have noted in reading the gospel of Luke, how many persons who, on being served by the Lord, glorify God.<a name=278:3></a> Now that is Luke's secret, not just relieving our needs and leaving us there.<a name=278:4></a> Luke, and I might say, Paul, for undoubtedly Luke drew largely from Paul, believes in setting us up so that we can add something to the service of God.<a name=278:5></a> I believe it is a new day in our lives, and adds a ray of glory for our minds and hearts when we see that we are to be set up here to serve God.<a name=278:6></a> We need not look very far for illustrations of this, for Luke always provides his own, and there are none better.<a name=278:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a> the Lord, speaking as the anointed Preacher, says, "He has anointed me to preach glad tidings".<a name=278:8></a> It is a wonderful service in the Lord's hands, wider perhaps than some of us have thought, for it eventuates in God getting glory from the persons served.<a name=278:9></a> As the Lord finishes reading, and hands the book back, the eyes of all those that were in the synagogue were fastened upon Him.<a name=278:10></a> Not upon the book, nor upon the attendant who took the book, but upon Christ.<a name=278:11></a> That is really the secret of all successful ministry, that the eye is directed to Christ.<a name=278:12></a> In Him we find the verification of all the truth that is uttered, as here are foretold the lifting of every burden and the completing of every service.<a name=278:13></a> May that be in our minds, dear brethren, as we refer to these scriptures, that the eyes of all are fixed upon <i>Him</i>.<a name=278:14></a> And then the Lord adds another word, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears".<a name=278:15></a> That is, that every scripture applies to the person who reads it <i>when he reads it</i>.<a name=278:16></a> It is not just

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I would just refer to these persons.<a name=279:4></a> It says here, "He has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance, and to the blind sight, to send forth the crushed delivered".<a name=279:5></a> Luke brings forward the well-known woman in chapter 7, to show how the Lord can serve and how He can relieve and establish, and especially how He can serve where there is love.<a name=279:6></a> I believe the Lord finds it very difficult to serve persons in whom there is no love.<a name=279:7></a> The woman loved before she was served.<a name=279:8></a> That explains the Lord's remark, "which of them therefore will love him most?<a name=279:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:42">Luke  7:42</a>).<a name=279:10></a> The answer is, "he to whom he forgave the most".<a name=279:11></a> That is to say, love is there before the actual service in detail begins.<a name=279:12></a> Thus we would challenge ourselves to see if there is really any love for Christ, for the more love there is for Him, the more ready He will be to serve.<a name=279:13></a> How are we to tell?<a name=279:14></a> By the indications which love so readily furnishes, movements towards the truth, towards the brethren, towards the practice of self-judgment.<a name=279:15></a> These are the signs.<a name=279:16></a> Nothing would stop this woman from reaching the Lord, because she had love.<a name=279:17></a> The needs, therefore, become, I might almost say, secondary, incidental.<a name=279:18></a> The Lord says of her, "she loved much".<a name=279:19></a> I would suggest that perhaps some of our burdens have not yet been lifted because our love is so little, and therefore in the end we are not free to serve.<a name=279:20></a> This woman went out a rich woman,

		I wish to speak of the night-time, this being one of the ways whereby we may describe the present period while we are waiting for the Lord Jesus.<a name=289:1></a> It is a very solemn way of describing our time because it is the night in which Jesus was betrayed.<a name=289:2></a> It is in the midst of an external scene, which is marked by hatred and treachery where there are persons who partake of the character of the scene around them, and are called in Scripture the children of the night.<a name=289:3></a> It is very remarkable that the Lord's supper should be set in such a time; it surely is to be a great compensation for the hearts of those who have to share the night-time.<a name=289:4></a>

		We have not any difficulty now about describing how near the things of the day are to us for we well understand that the Lord Jesus has His formal place on high in glory in heaven, but we also understand that He comes near to us spiritually.<a name=290:1></a> He comes near to us, but as coming near to us He comes in all His glory.<a name=290:2></a> He does not come as He was on that dark night literally in Jerusalem.<a name=290:3></a> He comes gloriously, and directly He comes the light of glory begins to radiate.<a name=290:4></a> Have you not tasted these things, dear brethren.<a name=290:5></a> These are some of the things which help to occupy and light up the night, so that morally we are not children of the night.<a name=290:6></a> That is what the apostle says to the Thessalonians.<a name=290:7></a> There were some there doubtless who would drag them down and get them occupied with low thoughts, faithless thoughts, some saying that the Lord had come and that kind of thing.<a name=290:8></a> Now the apostle exhorts them not to be children, or sons, of the night, as much as to say that, although it is the night-time literally and morally, outwardly, we are not to conform to that.<a name=290:9></a> We are to be children of the day; and the day really involves the sun rising and that means Christ.<a name=290:10></a> It means that our time is lit up by Christ glorified.<a name=290:11></a> I hope that is true of all here.<a name=290:12></a> I can say quite soberly, that if that be not true of us we do not know what christianity is, for it consists primarily of Christ glorified, with its holy and corresponding characteristic that the Spirit is here.<a name=290:13></a>

		I would like in passing to say a word about the literal night, that it might not be altogether lost by us.<a name=291:4></a> Some stay up late literally in conversation amongst the brethren and the Lord helps.<a name=291:5></a> I do not think He would help if we were merely following physical pleasures, but He helps in speaking about the truth.<a name=291:6></a> Sometimes the Lord allows us to have sleepless nights.<a name=291:7></a> The Lord is prepared to fill those out too.<a name=291:8></a> One could say, "in the nights my reins instruct me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:7">Psalm  16:7</a>).<a name=291:9></a> The reins are those organs of the body which serve for discrimination of what is good and pure, and the refusal of what is injurious and poisonous.<a name=291:10></a> It is remarkable that David should use that expression, saying that his reins instructed him in the night season.<a name=291:11></a> Perhaps we may not find time or make time for the discriminating of things in the day-time, and the Lord therefore gets an entrance then.<a name=291:12></a> If He does it is a good thing.<a name=291:13></a>

		Without thinking of this matter in a purely human way relative to the Lord, it is marvellous to think where He spent His nights -- on the mount of Olives -- a great spiritual realm in touch with heaven.<a name=291:14></a> "And the Lord", it says, "remained abroad;" that is, He was free, not confined to one particular thought, but ranging abroad on the mount of Olives during the night season.<a name=291:15></a> How suggestive these things are for us and even if we just catch the spirit of one of them, how good it would be if we were with the Lord in that matter.<a name=291:16></a>

		Now I come back to these scriptures which are typical; that is, they help us to fill out the moral night, and I start with Leviticus for this is a word for the priests.<a name=292:1></a> It is something which affects us where we are most interested at the present time, namely the service of God.<a name=292:2></a> It is a word through Moses to Aaron and his sons about the altar.<a name=292:3></a> The fire on the altar was never to go out, <i>never</i>.<a name=292:4></a> "This is the law of the burnt-offering; this, the burnt-offering, shall be on the hearth on the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it".<a name=292:5></a> Let us think, dear brethren, what it is for God <i>now</i> to find something going up, not as of old, from the brazen altar in the court of the tabernacle system, but something going up from the ready altars of the hearts of the saints.<a name=292:6></a> Christ is there and the offering is going up so that God has before Him the burning of it, really we might say the incense of it, at all times from night until morning.<a name=292:7></a> I am speaking of our occupation from now onwards until the Lord comes, that there should always be something readily going up from our hearts which reminds God of Christ.<a name=292:8></a> It is a peculiar offering, the burnt-offering, in that the burning of it was just like incense, not burned to be eaten, not burned to be consumed, but burned like incense.<a name=292:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The instructions of the priests go further.<a name=292:10></a> They tell us in verse 12 that, "the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning on it: it shall not be put out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it", and so on.<a name=292:11></a> Then later, "A continual fire shall be kept burning upon the altar: it shall never go out".<a name=292:12></a> There is something by which the fire is kept going and that is the wood.<a name=292:13></a> Thus we have the fire, and then the wood, and

		Corinth was suffering very badly because the lamps were burning very dimly.<a name=296:8></a> The apostle Paul in his care, in the spirit of the true Aaron, was attending to those lamps, or rather I should say he was getting the saints to attend to the lamps, a great deal having to be done, mostly in the provision of the oil.<a name=296:9></a> That had to be done before the light could shine out.<a name=296:10></a> As it says, "shine out before it" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:37">Exodus  25:37</a>).<a name=296:11></a> I understand that to mean that there is a definite radiation of light from the candlestick spreading before it.<a name=296:12></a> This is dependent upon the attention during the night from the evening until the morning.<a name=296:13></a>

		I thought it necessary to read these four passages to cover our subject, which is the matter of awaking out of sleep; starting with God Himself, and referring also to the Lord Jesus, and then referring to ourselves, the saints of the assembly.<a name=303:1></a> The matter of sleep provides a very rich field for thought in the Scriptures, and must be regarded according to its context.<a name=303:2></a> It is quite clear, for instance, that the sleep of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, when God put Adam to sleep in order to bring out the woman, is a very different matter from the sleep of Peter and others on the mount of transfiguration.<a name=303:3></a> It is very different again from the sleep of the Corinthians, which meant that they had died, and died governmentally owing to spiritual lethargy.<a name=303:4></a> So we need to take every scriptural thought in its context.<a name=303:5></a>

		Now starting with God in this great matter helps me to refer a little to the way God has revived the truth amongst us during our own time.<a name=303:6></a> The central verse for our consideration being, "Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine".<a name=303:7></a> It is a simile, of course; it does not mean that God was ever literally asleep.<a name=303:8></a> It does not mean that God was ever overcome with anything, even by the wickedness of Israel, or ourselves typically.<a name=303:9></a> It is a simile to enable us to understand that God changed His tactics, changed His

		Asaph, one of the great Levites figuring prominently in the service of God, reminds us that even the most spiritual amongst us have to find their own level, and conduct themselves in their service on moral lines, as well as according to their gifts.<a name=304:7></a> So Asaph in this psalm writes about God's way with Israel, His gentle, careful, powerful ways, and also about their response, a matter very much applying to our day, God has been very gracious with His people.<a name=304:8></a> Difficulty after difficulty has arisen, even from the first century, for we read of John saying, in the first century, "Even now there have come many antichrists" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>).<a name=304:9></a> Think of it.<a name=304:10></a> Why should God go on with that?<a name=304:11></a> But he does.<a name=304:12></a> John says moreover, "the whole world lies in the wicked one" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:19">1 John  5:19</a>); and yet God has gone on.<a name=304:13></a> What a blessed God we have, to go on all this time.<a name=304:14></a> And I say these things to bring the parallel of Israel's history into our own time; for God has been very tender.<a name=304:15></a> It says, for instance, "He made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the other part of the story is the response.<a name=305:3></a> What have the saints, speaking generally, done by way of response to God?<a name=305:4></a> As we look at the history of the assembly, and read the Lord's seven addresses to the assemblies, and ponder what He has to say, beginning with "I know thy works", we discover that the Lord has been scrutinising all the time.<a name=305:5></a> "I have against thee;" that is a very gentle way of putting it, for He says what He can that is good; but the answer that the Lord gives after His scrutiny is a faithful one.<a name=305:6></a> And it is a history including downfall, and breakdown, until the end of the chapter, where the Lord is seen outside, standing, knocking on the door; the people are inside, as it were, saying they do not want Him.<a name=305:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in order that we may have the spirit of these things intelligently before us, I am using the history of Israel to indicate that God had great justification at the time when it says, "He forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men, And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor".<a name=305:8></a> It refers to God giving up the ark, and allowing it to go into the hand of the Philistines, in Samuel's time.<a name=305:9></a> Samuel personally seems to be withdrawn in those chapters in the early part of the book; from chapter 4 onwards he is not prominent.<a name=305:10></a> God withdraws him, perhaps so as to allow the true state of the people to come out.<a name=305:11></a> Sometimes God does that; He withdraws His servants.<a name=305:12></a> He put Paul in prison; He put Peter in prison, and

		He put John in limitations.<a name=306:1></a> He withdraws His servants so that the true state of things may come out.<a name=306:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find that God gave the ark into the hands of the Philistines.<a name=306:3></a> I suppose it corresponds largely in christendom with the time when there was no real outstanding ministry of Christ.<a name=306:4></a> For centuries there was nothing much that we can point to in the history of the assembly to enable us to see the full thoughts of God in Christ, or the service of God.<a name=306:5></a> He had, as it were, allowed things to lapse, outwardly.<a name=306:6></a> They had gone down to a very poor level; and the resulting confusion and wickedness, I believe, touches God's heart, that things should get into such a state, when He had such great thoughts in His own mind for Christ and His own, for Christ and the assembly.<a name=306:7></a> We may say, that He awoke like a man out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine.<a name=306:8></a> Even in our own time He raised up a man more than a century ago to take the sword from end to end of christendom, to issue the challenge of God's word against everything that was wrong.<a name=306:9></a> It was like Moses' command to go in and out of the camp from gate to gate, and slay every man his brother (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:27">Exodus  32:27</a>).<a name=306:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus God has, in these last days, brought back a state of things like that of which the psalmist speaks, forsaking the old order, choosing something new.<a name=306:11></a> Bringing us into great things -- Judah (praise) -- Mount Zion (the assembly) -- His sanctuary like the heights, and great high levels of the truth -- and David, the Lord Jesus Christ in the character of the Beloved.<a name=306:12></a> That is the present time, dear brethren.<a name=306:13></a> I do not think I am departing from the meaning of the truth when I say that the revival at the beginning of

		the last century is the fulfilment in an anti-typical way, of God awaking out of sleep, and bringing the best before us, so that we can enjoy it in our time.<a name=307:1></a> As we read down the Psalm, we find that things are there which have a most excellent name.<a name=307:2></a> It is Mount Zion, and David, and the heights, and there is feeling and tenderness and skill.<a name=307:3></a> This is what is going on.<a name=307:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Asaph, whose name means a gatherer (a very suggestive name for our time, the assembly time) would rejoice in reporting this great and powerful revival which has brought the very best before us in relation to the person of Christ, and His love, and the assembly, and the high levels of the truth and the skill in feeding God's people.<a name=307:5></a> So we may well ask one another whether we have awakened to see the kind of time in which we are.<a name=307:6></a> The Lord Jesus said on one occasion, commenting on the people's ability to discern the face of the sky and the earth, "How is it then that ye do not discern this time?<a name=307:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:56">Luke  12:56</a>).<a name=307:8></a> <i>This</i> time!<a name=307:9></a> We would have to say, Do these things mean anything to us?<a name=307:10></a> Do we react in a living way?<a name=307:11></a> Are we having part in this great system of elevation and glory that God has brought in in the way of revival?<a name=307:12></a> This record is in the third book of Psalms, which gives us an outlook upon all the people of God.<a name=307:13></a> It begins, "Truly God is good to <i>Israel</i>", -- <i>all</i> the people of God.<a name=307:14></a> Surely under this type we can say everything is ours.<a name=307:15></a> Ours is the tribe of Levi; ours is the service; ours are the oracles.<a name=307:16></a> Everything belongs to us, but let us remember that it is all based on moral features.<a name=307:17></a> We cannot get anything spiritually lofty, unless we approach it through the moral avenues of Asaph and the sons of Korah, the great men in this book.<a name=307:18></a>

		Now I speak of the Lord's awakening, and I turn to Mark's gospel for it, because there we have in a peculiar way the greatness of His Person.<a name=308:1></a> What is really in mind as to the Lord's awakening is that He is regarded as not actively intervening.<a name=308:2></a> He may awaken and intervene, but speaking in general, His intervention is not active for the moment, except on the part of those who belong to Him as being of His own.<a name=308:3></a> So I just bring this passage before you as suggestive of our own times.<a name=308:4></a> It is the evening time; it is the end of the day.<a name=308:5></a> "And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side".<a name=308:6></a> It is the end of the day, when all the results are coming in, and there is not much time left.<a name=308:7></a> The Lord's supper itself suggests that; supper is the last meal of the day, when there is nothing to follow but rest and ease and comfort.<a name=308:8></a> That is what is in mind, and that is partly what is in mind in the Lord's supper; that there is nothing more to come, but what is peaceful and glorious, and heavenly, and eternal.<a name=308:9></a> Anyone who takes the Lord's supper, and sits with the brethren in sincerity, will tell you that that is in mind.<a name=308:10></a> That is through grace our experience; without our being taken off the earth, for we do not move literally from where we are.<a name=308:11></a> Christ comes to us, and as He comes to us He glorifies us, in living links with Himself, and we may at the end of the day, by way of His Supper, enjoy the most glorious outgoings of the evening.<a name=308:12></a> "The outgoings of the morning and evening" are spoken of in terms of rejoicing (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#65:8">Psalm  65:8</a>).<a name=308:13></a> We are in the time of the outgoings of the evening; and we are coming into the best.<a name=308:14></a> Not to partake of the Lord's supper is not only to miss the best, but to miss what I might call love's command, and the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this matter we have read of is not exactly the privilege side of our tasting what is heavenly, although I would say it is included, in a sense.<a name=309:3></a> But it is a matter of travelling over to the other side, in the way of testimony, meaning that we are regarded here as being on a journey, not as settlers, but as heavenly pilgrims and strangers.<a name=309:4></a> We cannot be pilgrims unless we are strangers; the scripture says "<i>strangers</i> and pilgrims".<a name=309:5></a> The pilgrim depends upon the stranger; the pilgrim is the one who is making a journey, and he has something in view, but he has not reached it yet.<a name=309:6></a> He is on the way, and what helps him to keep on the way is the fact that nothing detains him; he is a stranger here.<a name=309:7></a> Moses, as to time, was detained in Midian for forty years, but he was a pilgrim, and whenever he could, he moved towards the best.<a name=309:8></a> If he had a flock of sheep to look after, he took them to the mount of God.<a name=309:9></a> He had something good in his mind; he was on a pilgrimage; and what helped him was that he was a stranger, as he said "a sojourner in a foreign land" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:22">Exodus  2:22</a>).<a name=309:10></a> If you are a stranger to the world, the world is a strange land to you.<a name=309:11></a> That is what it should be, and that helps us.<a name=309:12></a>

		The brethren will observe that these scriptures contain the account of some accusation or onslaught of Satan, against one or more of God's people, and I desire much help in speaking of them for it is a sobering subject.<a name=317:1></a> These attacks are to be met, and similar ones in our day, for we may well understand that the attacks of Satan are not finished.<a name=317:2></a> The way that they are suggested to us in the Scriptures is just a picture of what has been going on ever since the garden of Eden, and will go on until Satan is finally dealt with.<a name=317:3></a> In the very chapter in which he is cast out of heaven, he is described as, Satan, "the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he who is called Devil and Satan .<a name=317:4></a>.<a name=317:5></a>.<a name=317:6></a> the accuser of our brethren" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12:9">Revelation  12:9</a>, 10).<a name=317:7></a> This collection of titles is to show the kind of concentrated attack which we may expect by the enemy against every feature of God's work, and every feature of spirituality and encouragement in God's people.<a name=317:8></a> Now, let that not discourage anybody, because God is greater than Satan.<a name=317:9></a> We have heard during the last few months about the expanse and the way that Satan has invaded it, but the expanse does not belong to him.<a name=317:10></a> The expanse belongs to God and God is supreme in it.<a name=317:11></a> Not only is God in it, but the Lord Jesus is in it, and the Spirit is in it, and the saints

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord seems to bring one feature of the expanse in at His first mention of the assembly, as if to show that there would have to be the balance in our minds between the assembly and the gates of hades.<a name=318:3></a> He says, "I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>).<a name=318:4></a> No doubt, to any thoughtful person, that would have been something to ponder deeply, that the Lord should mention the gates of hades in the same sentence as the assembly.<a name=318:5></a> Whether Peter understood it then or not, we understand it.<a name=318:6></a> We understand that there is designed against the assembly a great body of wicked politics, described in several ways, for instance as the "authority of darkness" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>), and its personnel, its cabinet, as "the universal lords of this darkness" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:12">Ephesians  6:12</a>).<a name=318:7></a> The position of it is of wicked spirits in heavenly places, and the outgoings of it politically are described as "hades gates" (that is its administration).<a name=318:8></a> I mention that, dear brethren, to show that it is a very positive matter.<a name=318:9></a> Darkness is not just the absence of light.<a name=318:10></a> It is a great realm which is ruled over by Satan, and in which he propagates things.<a name=318:11></a> He has spiritual propaganda of darkness, full of accusation, and I would say that everyone here who is a believer, and especially an exercised believer, understanding his place in the assembly, would be, at some time or other, the object of some satanic attack.<a name=318:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in choosing these scriptures I did not wish to be exhaustive about them, but just to give an impression.<a name=318:13></a> In the first we have a man who is being tested as to his circumstances and his family, as well as to what there is in

		his own soul.<a name=319:1></a> It brings the matter down to each one of us individually.<a name=319:2></a> Moreover, the great matter depicted in this book, especially in the early part of it, is set on by God who described Job as an upright man, eschewing evil.<a name=319:3></a> "My servant" He says.<a name=319:4></a> So we have to bow in the presence of that.<a name=319:5></a> God has every right to test and challenge His own work and His own people and He will do it with us all.<a name=319:6></a> But He first of all draws Satan's attention to this, knowing that Satan would attack and would accuse.<a name=319:7></a> His name is Satan, "the adversary", not '<i>an</i> adversary', and so the early conversation here shows just what I have said that Satan is really accusing God, and alongside of his accusation of God he is accusing Job.<a name=319:8></a> He implies that God arranged Job's circumstances in such a way that nobody could get at him.<a name=319:9></a> The divine answer means that God is willing to test that.<a name=319:10></a> He allows Satan to affect all his circumstances, not to touch him personally.<a name=319:11></a> Satan does so, but all under God's control, of course.<a name=319:12></a>

		These animals that were ploughing, the oxen and the asses, were smitten, and of the servants only one escaped to tell Job the story.<a name=319:13></a> "While he was yet speaking", there came another servant to say that the sheep were smitten, and while <i>he</i> was yet speaking, there came a servant to say that the camels were gone.<a name=319:14></a> This is very striking, I suppose, as we consider other narratives in the Scriptures about camels.<a name=319:15></a> For if man has a camel he can get out of his distressing circumstances, but when God allows Satan to take the camels as well, then he must remain where he is.<a name=319:16></a> Finally Job's family is stricken.<a name=319:17></a> How touching this narrative is of what happened to an upright man, God's servant, eschewing evil, serving his family, offering up

		Then there is the second chapter of this drastic discipline, where God hands to Satan Job's body, except that he is not to take his life, with the resulting circumstances, illness, the botch, terrible disease.<a name=320:6></a> See Job in this terrible condition, sitting in a heap of ashes, in torment, and the woman, his wife, his companion adding to his troubles.<a name=320:7></a> "Curse God and die", she says.<a name=320:8></a> There is something in all this for us, that we might understand where we are with God, in our circumstances and in our very bodies.<a name=320:9></a> God gives some of us troubles in our bodies which we are not able to get rid of.<a name=320:10></a> We can send them off a little, but we can never get rid of them.<a name=320:11></a> Some here would know that.<a name=320:12></a> God does it, I believe, to keep us humble, to keep us near Him, to test our links with Himself and to test the links of other people.<a name=320:13></a> How do our wives and husbands take these things?<a name=320:14></a> This wife said "Curse God and die" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#2:9">Job  2:9</a>).<a name=320:15></a> But God was testing His work and Job comes out in the first case with a note of worship.<a name=320:16></a> He says there that he came out naked from his mother's womb, he brought nothing into the world, he could take nothing out and he worships God.<a name=320:17></a> "Jehovah gave", he said, "Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#1:21">Job  1:21</a>).<a name=320:18></a> What a man!<a name=320:19></a> I wonder whether our spirituality would go as far as that?<a name=320:20></a> And at the second onslaught in regard of his body, he said "We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil?<a name=320:21></a>" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#2:10">Job  2:10</a>).<a name=320:22></a> Wonderful thing.<a name=320:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like just to say a word as to how it was all met.<a name=321:1></a> There was weakness in Job, you see, and we have all to humble ourselves here, finding moral weaknesses in our souls.<a name=321:2></a> The weakness with Job was that, underneath it all, he was justifying himself and blaming God.<a name=321:3></a> His words were one thing and himself was another, and so, when his friends came, these three friends, they found a very ready material in a way for all their speeches, a good ear.<a name=321:4></a> They flattered Job and even Job at the end became disgusted with it, he says, "Grievous comforters are ye all" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#16:2">Job  16:2</a>).<a name=321:5></a> Grievous comforters, a devastating word to us, if we are trying to comfort a person in sorrow, without reality ourselves; we must be real to bring in comfort.<a name=321:6></a> In the end Elihu, the young spiritual brother, standing by respectfully waiting till his elder brethren had ceased, now speaks.<a name=321:7></a> I have a feeling that Elihu wrote the book of Job, or at any rate a part of it.<a name=321:8></a> Read what Elihu has to say as he heard Job justifying himself.<a name=321:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Elihu said, I have waited, and now I can speak, a man just like themselves, but in his speech he brought God in, and he had much knowledge of God to bring in.<a name=321:10></a> He says, "I am full of matter" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#32:18">Job  32:18</a>).<a name=321:11></a> The others might <i>think</i> it, but he <i>was</i> it.<a name=321:12></a> "I am full of matter".<a name=321:13></a> He says, "Why dost thou strive against him?<a name=321:14></a>" -- against God.<a name=321:15></a> For He giveth not account of any of His matters.<a name=321:16></a> We must not demand of God to explain Himself.<a name=321:17></a> He does not have to give an account of what He is doing.<a name=321:18></a> What a start, you see, to connect a suffering person with a God who can do as He likes, and raise the challenge as to whether after all, we are not striving against Him.<a name=321:19></a> And so he goes on.<a name=321:20></a> I do not pursue this, but it is the matter of the satanic attack, being

		met by God Himself, but by way of ministry, the ministry of the truth through a servant.<a name=322:1></a> So we want to be in the presence of the ministry, and of spiritual brethren all the time, or as often as we can.<a name=322:2></a> Here is a sick man, Job, but he was in the presence of one who was bringing God in in an intelligent way, for Elihu means 'Whose God is He'.<a name=322:3></a> Job was brought through really by the utterances, the ministerial utterances of Elihu, who brought him into the presence of God.<a name=322:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a remarkable thing that God used Elihu's ministry to come in Himself.<a name=322:5></a> I believe that would be the true test of ministry, whether God could link Himself on with it.<a name=322:6></a> One might give a word, but would God link Himself on with it.<a name=322:7></a> God linked Himself on with Elihu's word and I would like Him to link Himself on with my word now.<a name=322:8></a> That would be an honour indeed, but would be what was proper and right in connection with ministry.<a name=322:9></a> So presently God comes in, as if to say, 'I can follow up what Elihu said'.<a name=322:10></a> He answered Job out of the whirlwind and when He had finished there was not much of Job left.<a name=322:11></a> He did not have another word to say.<a name=322:12></a> He put his hand on his mouth he repented, he abhorred himself in dust and ashes, he was a recovered man and the satanic attack had failed utterly, for Job was fully recovered, reinstated now as a man going on with God.<a name=322:13></a> It is a wonderful thing, dear brethren, that an attack like that should fail as being met along these lines.<a name=322:14></a> It may be that in our own way somebody here may find that there is something going on of that kind.<a name=322:15></a> The truth of it is that God is going to reach His end in the matter.<a name=322:16></a> James speaks about the endurance of Job, and about the end of the Lord with him.<a name=322:17></a> That is the full victory reached and Job is

	<div class="paragraph">
		brought to correspond with God's end.<a name=323:1></a> Job is set up again, reinstated, full of substance, a wonderful monument to moral victory, in the presence of all this attack.<a name=323:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would speak of David for a moment, because David here in 1 Chronicles is where we all are; he is being recorded in a history which speaks of recovery.<a name=323:3></a> This is not in the books of Samuel or Kings.<a name=323:4></a> Chronicles speaks of days of recovery, the narrative being written after the people had not only been taken away, but brought back.<a name=323:5></a> It is the narrative gone over with a priestly hand in the days when the captivity had been turned, and that is where we are now.<a name=323:6></a> The history of the saints, the history of the testimony, the truth of the present time, is being recorded as we may say by priestly hands, with the accuracy of the scribe, and with all the priestly feelings which belong to the full recovery of God's people under His hand.<a name=323:7></a> So we are entitled to speak of David now in a very delightful set of circumstances, right in the midst of the glory of the recovery.<a name=323:8></a> The ark is in its place, Christ come back into His glory, with the service of God fully set on and added to, in refinement and spiritually delicate feeling, in the music.<a name=323:9></a> And here in the midst of it all Satan rises up and sets on an attack through the one who had been the instrument of all the recovery, namely David.<a name=323:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No man cared for the service of God like David, no man cared for the person of the Lord, typified in the ark, like David.<a name=323:11></a> There was no shepherd like him, no worshipper like him, no warrior like him, or psalmist, or lover.<a name=323:12></a> David is wonderful as a model before our eyes and yet here he is the tool of Satan.<a name=323:13></a> What a sobering thing!<a name=323:14></a> "Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to

		number Israel".<a name=324:1></a> What lay beneath it was the clerical principle.<a name=324:2></a> David saying, as it were, 'This is my people.<a name=324:3></a> Let me see how great they are'.<a name=324:4></a> That kind of thing -- oh let us beware of it.<a name=324:5></a> It does not take much to see through it; I may blind myself, but even the unspiritual can see through it, for Joab could see through it, even Joab, wicked man as he was.<a name=324:6></a> It does not need a spiritual man to see through it.<a name=324:7></a> Gehazi could see certain things that needed attention, Joab saw certain things which needed attention and so we need to beware doubly lest in some kind of pride we attach things to ourselves amongst the people of God.<a name=324:8></a> We know the thoughts of pride which would come into our hearts.<a name=324:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the people are numbered, and God now comes into it and offers David this solemn set of alternatives, three years, as it says, of famine; or three months fleeing before his enemies; or three days of pestilence and the divine sword.<a name=324:10></a> Now David is here having to do with God.<a name=324:11></a> Satan, you may say, set it on, yes, but David was the tool, for this is the record, the divine record in these otherwise bright days, and the truth is out.<a name=324:12></a> Well now, without going into detail again, how is it to be met?<a name=324:13></a> We find that there is still something which God can use for meeting such things.<a name=324:14></a> Amongst other things he uses our power to calculate rightly.<a name=324:15></a> That is a good thing, never to lose our power of calculation, soberly turning things over, in the presence of God and weighing things up without panic.<a name=324:16></a> So he said to the seer Gad, "I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray thee, into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercies are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man" (verse 13).<a name=324:17></a> He has power to calculate, even when it is a question of a penalty.<a name=324:18></a> May we never lose that, dear brethren, for it

		means that the Spirit is still there and while He may be grieved, He is not quenched.<a name=325:1></a> And so the penalty comes, the three days' pestilence and sword, and David is there too with the elders, in sackcloth.<a name=325:2></a> They are feeling it; they are not stoics; they feel it until the climax comes when David's priestly spirit is again in evidence as he sees the angel hovering over Jerusalem and he speaks to God, bowing down and speaking to God, he says, It was I who did this.<a name=325:3></a> "Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered?<a name=325:4></a> It is I that have sinned and done evil; but these sheep, what have they done?<a name=325:5></a> Let thy hand, I pray thee, Jehovah my God, be on me and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be smitten" (verse 17).<a name=325:6></a> How touching!<a name=325:7></a> That brings the end, a glorious end really, as it will always be, dear brethren, no matter what the attack.<a name=325:8></a> It will always be glorious as we judge ourselves in church matters, not merely in individual matters.<a name=325:9></a> David took to himself what belonged primarily to himself, but there were others ready to feel it with him, and the elders with him also took it on.<a name=325:10></a> Is it not a beautiful thing to find a brother or a sister to share such a thing with us?<a name=325:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The story goes to its end, Ornan the Jebusite was there.<a name=325:12></a> If David had neglected the people of God, carelessly, Ornan had not neglected them.<a name=325:13></a> He was threshing wheat and he had the oxen and the implements of wood and offered them all to David, for there was to be an altar there.<a name=325:14></a> That is morally the only place for an altar, where people judge themselves.<a name=325:15></a> What is the good of an altar which has no moral foundations?<a name=325:16></a> So David is recovered; he reached an end as God reached it, at this threshing floor and the threshing floor means that you

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		refuse the evil and choose the good, and go on with the good.<a name=326:1></a> And that is what David did, for he was able to say at this particular point, "This is the house of Jehovah Elohim, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:1">1 Chronicles  22:1</a>).<a name=326:2></a> This really means that all Solomon's beautiful house of glory was built upon the moral base of David's exercise.<a name=326:3></a> The foundation was laid at the place where David came to the victorious end of his searching time.<a name=326:4></a> He said "This is the house", and Solomon built it there, he said "this is the altar", and Solomon placed it there.<a name=326:5></a> Solomon's foundation in glory is laid upon David's moral foundation at the threshing floor.<a name=326:6></a> How marvellous it all is.<a name=326:7></a> Think of the gentile coming in, Ornan the Jebusite.<a name=326:8></a> Our minds of course at once go to Paul, and the nations, and the mystery, and the house, and the service.<a name=326:9></a> It all lies there you might say in embryo, a marvellous story.<a name=326:10></a> Satan is defeated, for things are laid here on a moral foundation which was later to receive a superstructure in untarnishable glory.<a name=326:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I just speak of Zechariah, for he helps us again in this matter of remnant days.<a name=326:12></a> What is in mind here is the service, and the people who are to have part in it.<a name=326:13></a> We are introduced in the early part of Zechariah's prophecy to positive things.<a name=326:14></a> We may be in days of weakness and days of attack, scattering and comparative fewness of numbers, but we are not in days of defeat, we are in days of what is positive.<a name=326:15></a> So in the end of chapter 1, God shows four craftsmen; God is going to construct something.<a name=326:16></a> It is like the positive features in the darkness of Jude's day, when we read of building ourselves up on our most holy faith, keeping ourselves in the love of God, praying in the Holy

		Spirit, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<a name=327:1></a> These are positive features in a poor day, bringing in the operations of divine Persons, in the economy of grace.<a name=327:2></a> And God has more to say too.<a name=327:3></a> Presently, there was a man with a measuring line and the question is, in chapter 2: 2, "And I [that is, Zechariah] said, Whither goest thou?<a name=327:4></a> And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof".<a name=327:5></a> There is something to measure, dear brethren.<a name=327:6></a> There is something to measure in all our localities where the assembly is represented and the service goes on.<a name=327:7></a> In fact when it comes to our system, the heavenly system, if it is the heavenly city in Revelation there are three dimensions.<a name=327:8></a> If it is the great realm in Ephesians, there are four dimensions.<a name=327:9></a> There is much more to measure in our time than there was in Zechariah's time.<a name=327:10></a> But whatever it be, it is positive, and God is going on like that.<a name=327:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then again, it says the Lord will be a wall of fire round about Jerusalem.<a name=327:12></a> In the midst of all Satan's attacks, and all that he might use men to do, God, so to speak, says, Where there is a positive thing worth measuring I will surround it with a wall of fire and nobody shall touch it, and the place shall be more and more populated; it will be full of people.<a name=327:13></a> These are the things that characterise this moment, and now here is the man that stands for the service of God, Joshua, the High Priest.<a name=327:14></a> We are not told the reason, but Joshua the High Priest is represented in filthy garments, meaning to say that things are not yet what they should be and Satan is standing there to resist.<a name=327:15></a> The word 'resist' contains the same root idea as the word

		I wish to speak about the coming of the Lord, not, however, as an event, or to have to say to what is prophetic, but rather from the point of view of <i>the using of the time</i> until the Lord does come.<a name=333:1></a> We do not despise anything that is to be known about the Lord's coming prophetically, for, especially in the early part of the recovery that we are now in, a great deal of useful time was spent indicating the assembly's own place in the great dispensations which God has unrolled.<a name=333:2></a> But the Lord is not dealing with that now, nor does He put much premium on the study of prophecy merely by itself.<a name=333:3></a> It tends rather to dry up the soul, whereas what is of the prime importance to us is to occupy well the present time while we have it, as Scripture says, "the rest of his time" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:2">1 Peter  4:2</a>).<a name=333:4></a>

		This does not depict a completely dead state; it is not God acting in the scene of death; it is the Lord, we might say, bringing in recovery for a half dead man, meaning that the person is recoverable.<a name=335:14></a> It is quite likely that some of us here now need recovering, need something done in our souls, need this touch which as I said involves the Spirit.<a name=335:15></a> The Spirit is clearly indicated in the oil and the wine and the beast, just as the assembly in a general way is indicated in the inn.<a name=335:16></a> Well, the Lord is still on that road.<a name=335:17></a> It is the road so fully suggested in the epistle to the Romans,

		Now I would speak of other things, and pass briefly over them.<a name=338:6></a> Chapter 19 speaks of trading, as the Lord says, "Trade while I am coming".<a name=338:7></a> This means that it is not so much the event, the last event; that is, the Lord putting the finishing touch on the waiting time, but it is how we fill it out.<a name=338:8></a> "Trade while I am coming".<a name=338:9></a> And He gives us a further illustration, to show how it is to be done.<a name=338:10></a> This allows us to speak a word now about listening, because this is the parable which the Lord added as they were listening.<a name=338:11></a> It is one of the practical ways in which the Lord adds things to us.<a name=338:12></a> He has His own way of doing it, but He is very interested when somebody is listening.<a name=338:13></a> The end of the chapter says, "The chief of the people sought to destroy him, and did not find what they could do, for all the people hung on him to hear" (verses  47, 48).<a name=338:14></a> I expect that marks all of us here a little, and that enables us to ask what the Lord has added to us.<a name=338:15></a> That should be answerable by us all.<a name=338:16></a> What the Lord adds here is in answer to their listening.<a name=338:17></a> It is a very important matter.<a name=338:18></a>

		Well, the Lord has a very strict word to say about that, a word of judgment.<a name=340:17></a> "Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked bondman".<a name=340:18></a> Oh, that the Lord should have to say that to any of us!<a name=340:19></a> "<i>wicked bondman</i>".<a name=340:20></a> Well, there it is, but I can avoid it, and the avoiding of it is by trading.<a name=340:21></a> The Lord does add a word which would have helped the man.<a name=340:22></a> Why did you not put my money into the bank, that at my coming again I might have reclaimed it with interest?<a name=340:23></a> We have gone all over this many times, dear brethren.<a name=340:24></a>

		Now, one of the great matters, perhaps the greatest matter of all in relation to fellowship, is the Lord's supper.<a name=341:10></a> So I speak of that for a moment, not thinking of it doctrinally, but thinking of it as having such a substantial place with us in our exercises.<a name=341:11></a> For when the apostle has finished speaking about what the Lord has to say, he himself adds a verse.<a name=341:12></a> The Lord's words are in verses 24 and 25: "having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me".<a name=341:13></a> And then again in regard to the cup saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me".<a name=341:14></a> Now that is the end of the Lord's word.<a name=341:15></a> It is <i>Paul</i> who continues, telling us a certain side of the matter which remains, affecting our testimony until the Lord comes.<a name=341:16></a> He says here, "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, it is a question of letting this great matter have its place with us, dear brethren.<a name=342:4></a> The Lord is more than satisfied with His Supper.<a name=342:5></a> He has appointed it as that which is to bridge the gap of time and to bring in the full furnishings of love, until the Lord returns.<a name=342:6></a> He is satisfied with it.<a name=342:7></a> He does not add anything else.<a name=342:8></a> There are two ordinances of a public character in christianity; one is baptism, and the other is the Lord's supper.<a name=342:9></a> And the Lord's supper is that which the Lord left, and uses to bridge every distance, and every longing of His heart until He comes.<a name=342:10></a> It is a kind of secret from that side as we say often, it has an 'inwardness' to it, which only those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, and break bread, can truly discern.<a name=342:11></a> If you have asked to break bread, and it is a happy matter, there are some beautiful touches in store for you.<a name=342:12></a> No doubt you have had hints of them already, as you have sat with the brethren, as they have broken bread together, the inwardness of this, the affections which begin to steal into the hearts of the saints, entirely beyond any outward action which is done.<a name=342:13></a> This inwardness, I say, is something which is remarkable.<a name=342:14></a> It is spiritual, and only a divine Person, really, could bring it in.<a name=342:15></a> The Lord indeed has appointed that way to come in Himself.<a name=342:16></a> Speaking as the house-father, he says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>).<a name=342:17></a> He does come, and that is one of His ways of coming.<a name=342:18></a> I would say it is His principal way, and the sweetest way.<a name=342:19></a> It is love's sweetest way of

		Then there is the outward side, and the outward side is connected with the testimony.<a name=343:4></a> It means that as certain lovers of Christ sit together, and the bread and the cup are there, publicly, and they partake of them, with certain thanksgivings, there is a testimony which anybody can see, that those present are missing the Lord, and they are waiting for Him.<a name=343:5></a> Somebody might even say that.<a name=343:6></a> They are showing something.<a name=343:7></a> The bread is one thing, connected with the Lord's body; the cup is another thing, connected with His blood, the body and the blood presented in that sense separately.<a name=343:8></a> Death has come in.<a name=343:9></a> The great Lover of the saints has died, and there are people here who are faithful to Him.<a name=343:10></a> That is not all that can be said, but that is one side; and that is the side which I would like to leave with you to affect you, the side of loyalty to the One who is our Lover.<a name=343:11></a> The 'Eternal Lover', as one could say.<a name=343:12></a> 'Towards me as e'er Thou'rt bright'.<a name=343:13></a> That includes all those who take the Lord's supper in sincerity, not only enjoying the inwardness of it, but having part in the announcing of the Lord's death until He come!<a name=343:14></a> "The death of the Lord", the great One.<a name=343:15></a> Not anybody's death, not even the death of a Stephen, or a David, or a Moses.<a name=343:16></a> This is <i>the Lord</i>.<a name=343:17></a> The word is not in the form of an adjective there, it is not 'the dominical death', it is the death of <i>the Lord</i>, THE LORD!<a name=343:18></a> Meaning that it is a very great matter, and a very great testimony!<a name=343:19></a> And Paul says as often as you have part in this, you are showing the death of the Lord, till He come.<a name=343:20></a> I would not like to give up.<a name=343:21></a> If even I have not broken bread for some time, I would like to get that

		John to do.<a name=345:1></a> To ask questions like that, or to make remarks like that, is like quarrelling with the place that one has on the breast-plate of the High Priest.<a name=345:2></a> The breast-plate is skilfully arranged by divine hands, in love, and every saint has a place there.<a name=345:3></a> Every company of saints has a place there, not only the persons, but the tribes, all have a place there.<a name=345:4></a> To quarrel with the place which one has, over against the place another has, is a matter which the Lord must have to say to.<a name=345:5></a> It is that kind of thing that Peter was doing.<a name=345:6></a> So the Lord says, "<i>If I will</i> .<a name=345:7></a>.<a name=345:8></a>.<a name=345:9></a>" Now let us note that.<a name=345:10></a> That is the sovereign disposal of the Lord's servants by Himself.<a name=345:11></a> "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=345:12></a> Follow thou me".<a name=345:13></a> He reminded Peter that He had given him his work and that he was to follow.<a name=345:14></a> And so we are to get to know our work.<a name=345:15></a> The Lord will help us to know it, and as we serve the brethren we will begin to know it, the Lord tells us through the brethren.<a name=345:16></a> Perhaps there is an invitation for us, we must prayerfully consider it to discover whether it is part of the Lord's opening of the door, because if so it will fit in with what He has in His mind about our service.<a name=345:17></a> And if the Lord opens the door by way of the brethren, then our happy and peaceful course is to take it.<a name=345:18></a> If He does not, we had better stay at home.<a name=345:19></a> He says this now, "If I will that he abide until I come".<a name=345:20></a>

		So now we can think of John and John's ministry, and the very beautiful things that the Lord has brought to us through John, all couched in love, all in terms of goodness, "the good wine till now".<a name=345:21></a> That is a kind of title over a certain part of John's presentation of the truth.<a name=345:22></a> "Thou hast kept the good wine till now" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#2:10">John  2:10</a>).<a name=345:23></a> We are having it at the end.<a name=345:24></a> I do not go over the things; they are all there,

		The thought, dear brethren, is the matter of revival, or according to the word in the New Testament "the washing of regeneration and <i>renewal</i> of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>).<a name=347:1></a> The word <i>renewal</i> signifying that what attaches to the Spirit is to bring about the feature of freshness in the saints.<a name=347:2></a> While we may have, in a certain sense, the same occasions over and over again, like the Lord's supper, yet what is to mark every occasion is the freshness of life, in the Spirit.<a name=347:3></a> This is one of the reasons for the Holy Spirit being sent, so that an occasion may, while being repeated as to its general title, yet be thoroughly living and different as compared with any one that has gone before.<a name=347:4></a> It is a very encouraging matter to consider, because it was to be seen in the Lord Himself; it was He who, through the prophet, spoke of being wakened "morning by morning".<a name=347:5></a> Every one of His days was fresh under the blessed awakening hand of God.<a name=347:6></a> No day was stale, no day was exactly like the one that had preceded it.<a name=347:7></a> According to Luke's account He refers to Himself in relation to "the green tree".<a name=347:8></a> He says to the daughters of Jerusalem, "If these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?<a name=347:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:31">Luke  23:31</a>).<a name=347:10></a> The days of the Lord's service were the "green tree" with all that it meant, without weariness, without languishing.<a name=347:11></a> Wearied in body it may be, but ever fresh in the service.<a name=347:12></a>

		What a day it was when He met and graciously dealt with the woman at the well of Sychar, "wearied", it says, "as He was".<a name=348:1></a> Yet what a triumph of divine grace was secured, what a vessel!<a name=348:2></a> Let us take note of that and imbibe that Spirit.<a name=348:3></a> A brother may say he was too tired to pray, too weary to take part.<a name=348:4></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>is always encouraging in relation to weariness, for the Lord secured one of the finest vessels when He sat by the well "wearied with the way he had come;" it says, "As he was!<a name=348:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many thoughts come into your mind as you think of this.<a name=348:6></a> The Lord in the epistle to the Hebrews is spoken of as the Mediator of a <i>new</i> covenant; it speaks of what is new, not merely different from everything that has gone before, but abidingly fresh.<a name=348:7></a> In our links with God we are to be kept fresh, and we never weary of them and God is ever new to us, because the Mediator is always new in His service -- fresh and beautiful!<a name=348:8></a> This is one of the integral parts of the system, the mount Zion system to which we have come, beginning with mount Zion and Jerusalem; we have come to the assembly, and to God, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant.<a name=348:9></a> The Lord Jesus is on high, never weary, there we might say, the keeper of Israel (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:4">Psalm  121:4</a>), and always ministering night and day fresh thoughts in regard of God.<a name=348:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then one could speak of the assembly too.<a name=348:11></a> The persons of the assembly may become weary and some of us do, but the assembly as such has a power which will shine one day in all the great spirit of renewal, a thousand years of reign with Christ not wearying her in the least, nor tarnishing her glory.<a name=348:12></a> She is described at the end of it; "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>).<a name=348:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thousand years are but the introduction of what shall be eternally true, she will never tarnish, she shall abide.<a name=349:1></a> How much that means for Christ, that His bride, His wife, should never weary, should be eternally fresh!<a name=349:2></a> These are the things we have part in, dear brethren, and the present desire is that we might be reminded of this feature which belongs to us.<a name=349:3></a> It is to take hold of us individually and no circumstances are to make any difference; circumstances of limitation and pressure are to make no difference to this because of the Holy Spirit <i>poured out</i>.<a name=349:4></a> How wonderful those words are, the washing of regeneration; that is to say there is a new kind of age and epoch in view, and we in the light of it, and then as having the Spirit poured out lavishly upon us, we are to be renewed every day.<a name=349:5></a> The spirit of this renewal permeates our scriptures.<a name=349:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#40">Genesis  40</a>we have men in circumstances of pressure, of limitation, and while our circumstances may not involve very drastic limitation, yet such it is.<a name=349:7></a> It is described here as a prison and God has in a sense put all His people in it, for we cannot do what we like nowadays!<a name=349:8></a> We are not in this prison on account of bad behaviour.<a name=349:9></a> I am not thinking of that, but of the way God has of putting His people under limitation.<a name=349:10></a> Because He has a purpose in it, and according to the narrative and the type, we can say that the Lord Jesus draws near to us in it, with sympathetic purpose in view.<a name=349:11></a> Joseph came and looked upon these prisoners and they were sad, and he asked them the reason and he elicited from them that each had had a dream.<a name=349:12></a> That is, I believe, God had given each man in those circumstances an impression.<a name=349:13></a> These dreams are from God.<a name=349:14></a> The dreams of Genesis, especially in connection with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is perhaps a healthy question for us to ask whether during the several years now of limitation of various kinds, doors not opening where they used to, and the lack of liberty to do what we like; it may perhaps be asked, Have we received any impression from God in the matter?<a name=350:4></a> Think of having a vine <i>in a prison</i>!<a name=350:5></a> An unheard of thing!<a name=350:6></a> But there it was, and not only so but it expands and grows, it develops, meaning to say that it is not merely some impression of Christ, but full fruit will come from it.<a name=350:7></a> So this man speaks of the buds and the blossoms and the fruit and the clusters of ripe grapes.<a name=350:8></a> And now see what an impression God would give this man.<a name=350:9></a> He says, "And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand".<a name=350:10></a> There would not be anything more wonderfully fresh than that, that the grapes should yield at once something for the pleasure of God.<a name=350:11></a> For I doubt not that Pharaoh here represents God, and here is the man being reminded that even out of these circumstances God is going to be served, and served through what Christ brings in in impressions of His own Person as the Vine.<a name=350:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have no need to elaborate that, save to ask for our pondering whether we have considered that, whether in our circumstances of pressure, of tightening controls, we have got some impression of Christ.<a name=350:13></a> If so that is hopeful, for it means that we shall begin now to have some part in ministering to God's pleasure.<a name=350:14></a> May I appeal to us

		Now we are led to enquire the difference between the butler and the baker.<a name=351:8></a> The baker says, seeing this was going so well, "I also was in my dream".<a name=351:9></a> How well we recognise this feature!<a name=351:10></a> <i>I</i> am in my dream, I can understand that God does not get anything!<a name=351:11></a> A man may be the centre of his dream, in his greatness or in his smallness, but if a man is in his own dream, then God gets nothing.<a name=351:12></a> The baker provided nothing and he lost his life.<a name=351:13></a> He lost spiritually.<a name=351:14></a> We may say the cup-bearer represents the <i>heart</i> man, the baker the <i>head</i> man.<a name=351:15></a> There is a word there for us, dear brethren, in relation to reviving spiritually so that we may give God what He has in mind.<a name=351:16></a> The idea of the cup goes right through into the Lord's supper and is a great thought.<a name=351:17></a> It means that persons are satisfied.<a name=351:18></a> It is called the cup of the Lord in the Lord's supper and it is, amongst other

		Now, this is but one portion of what belongs to this great subject.<a name=352:3></a> Some need recovery, and I am thinking of people who need recovery out of wrong links, wrong associations; I think of Ephraim.<a name=352:4></a> If you read through a certain part of the prophecy of Hosea you would say at one point, Ephraim is beyond recovery, for God said, "Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:17">Hosea  4:17</a>).<a name=352:5></a> And it has to be said of some, that they are not recoverable; they are lost.<a name=352:6></a> Paul says that.<a name=352:7></a> He says, "If also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled <i>in those that are lost</i>" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:3">2 Corinthians  4:3</a>).<a name=352:8></a> Very solemn word!<a name=352:9></a> But happily we find that Ephraim is not as far gone as that; it is as if the heart of God could not really leave him alone.<a name=352:10></a> So He speaks again in the last chapter of the prophecy, saying to His people, "Take with you words" (verse 2).<a name=352:11></a> I expect that is the difficulty with some, they cannot find the words that belong to repentance and recovery.<a name=352:12></a> "Take with you words".<a name=352:13></a> They do it and they have finished with idols.<a name=352:14></a> They are not now going to bring literal calves to offer to idols, but calves of their lips to God.<a name=352:15></a> Ephraim is a recovered man.<a name=352:16></a> Is there anyone here who needs recovering in a special way?<a name=352:17></a> Take with you words, acceptable words, to God, and bring the calves of your lips, "the fruit of the lips confessing his name" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:15">Hebrews  13:15</a>).<a name=352:18></a> What a marvellous recovery it is.<a name=352:19></a> Ephraim says, "What have I to do any more with idols?<a name=352:20></a>" That is it.<a name=352:21></a> Ephraim is a recovered man when he says that.<a name=352:22></a> God says "I answer him, and I will observe

		Now in this part of Samson's life he has to do with the Philistines.<a name=354:4></a> We translate this into terms of what belongs to ourselves; that is, he is dealing with the great mind of man, fleshly mental activity intruding among the people of God, and how is this going to be met?<a name=354:5></a> How <i>do</i> we meet it in our localities?<a name=354:6></a> It is not a question of thinking up a sermon, it is a question of what you can find that is fresh.<a name=354:7></a> Oh, what an exercise that is!<a name=354:8></a> Not that one cannot use the same scriptures, they will bear repeating indeed, but oh, the fresh power which must attach to the ministry.<a name=354:9></a> There is the <i>fresh</i> jawbone, and Samson finds it.<a name=354:10></a> The Lord Jesus <i>found</i> the place where it was written.<a name=354:11></a> He found the scripture suitable for that particular occasion, and Samson found the fresh jawbone of an ass.<a name=354:12></a> That is as being with God and under a touch of the Spirit, we are to find something in freshness from God, and how successful that is and that alone.<a name=354:13></a> No ordinary methods would have done for all these Philistines, "a heap, two heaps", he says, "With the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men".<a name=354:14></a> Think of it literally, dear brethren, one man and one jawbone and a thousand men laid low.<a name=354:15></a> Think of the victory of the word of God as ministered in this fresh power.<a name=354:16></a> A jawbone is interesting, the jaw is for mastication as well as for speaking; and that means in principle that we have taken in something before we speak, as David says, "The Spirit of

		Samson provides this in principle in this experience.<a name=355:11></a> But then, like every other servant, having finished his service he gets weary and he needs reviving; his mind, affections and his very being need reviving, so he cries to Jehovah and Jehovah revives him by, I would say, a touch of "the renewal of the Holy Spirit".<a name=355:12></a> That is, He cleaves the rock in Lehi and causes the water to flow and Samson assuages his thirst; he is a new man again, and so we go on, dear brethren, and that is the secret of it.<a name=355:13></a> You wonder how some of our dear brethren who serve us so constantly go on, but the secret of it is that "with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:24">Mark  4:24</a>).<a name=355:14></a> It comes out and God gives more.<a name=355:15></a> The ministry is over and the servant

		In Kings we come into the more collective setting of the saints in the house.<a name=356:9></a> As some of us know, the house in first Kings is a peculiarly attractive place.<a name=356:10></a> For what is really in the mind of the Spirit in speaking of the house in 1 Kings is not so much the processes by which we move into the truth, but the joy and liberty of dwelling in it.<a name=356:11></a> It is, we might say, more heavenly than Chronicles in this particular section, not in every section, but in this one.<a name=356:12></a> I said we are not so much engaged here with processes, and this is one of the things that the one who is called upon to minister must watch, that he is not always occupying the saints with moral processes.<a name=356:13></a> There are times when it is right and important to do so, but at other times the blessedness of things should be just placed before us, for our enjoyment, something like the opening verses of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>.<a name=356:14></a> We should open our hearts to it and enjoy it, and say: 'This is our God, this is what He has done, this is what He had in mind; this is what He will arrive at and nothing shall stop Him, and the persons include us'.<a name=356:15></a> Let us say these things; let us open our hearts and enjoy the truth.<a name=356:16></a>

		Then again, there is this second matter that I speak of, connected with the house, and its various wonderful chambers and cells.<a name=358:4></a> The very oracle itself is wonderful, where God speaks, where He speaks His mind, relative to Christ and the assembly, where He comes out with His most intimate thoughts.<a name=358:5></a> God cannot morally have an oracle except where there is separation and where there is spirituality, for the doors of the oracle are of olive-wood, meaning that there is spirituality there.<a name=358:6></a> If separation be not recognised and the Spirit not given room, how can God speak?<a name=358:7></a> He may speak in a fire, or in an earthquake, or in a tempest, but that is not what we are speaking of.<a name=358:8></a> We are speaking of God in His oracle in the assembly.<a name=358:9></a> I have no doubt that is referred to in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:17">Ephesians  3:17</a>, "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".<a name=358:10></a> That is the Ark brought into the oracle, and we understand it now, that it is Christ in His own place according to the full mind of God.<a name=358:11></a> And then as I read in the last verses of this chapter, it is the posts of the temple.<a name=358:12></a> That is the very entrance of it.<a name=358:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=435:1></a> In this section of Acts, chapters 16 to 20, we have the unparalleled energy of Paul, the Holy Spirit acting in him and through him, before us.<a name=435:2></a> It is thought well that we might just look briefly at the passage in chapter 15 before going on to it.<a name=435:3></a> The thought of spiritual quality has been before us, and we shall see it greatly augmented in this section, especially from chapters 16 to 21, where we have the unique section that we may call a distinctly Pauline section, where there is brought before us the stream of Pauline energy, unsurpassed and unprecedented.<a name=435:4></a> It is a remarkable thing that the section begins with a Cyprian, Barnabas, moving out of the stream, and it ends with a Cyprian moving in the stream -- "a certain Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21:16">Acts  21:16</a>).<a name=435:5></a> They were to lodge with him in Jerusalem, showing how remarkable the work of God is in that case.<a name=435:6></a> After the dissension between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark, Barnabas recedes into the background, beloved man as he was.<a name=435:7></a> The Spirit of God focuses our attention on Paul, the vessel of unparalleled energy in the Lord's work reaching to European parts.<a name=435:8></a> The work in all its precious quality comes before us in the different ones referred to -- Timothy, Lydia, Apollos, Aquila and Priscilla.<a name=435:9></a> But it was thought well that we should just for a moment look at chapter 15 as to the quality that appears there.<a name=435:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		S.McC.<a name=457:1></a> This chapter is a fitting conclusion to the enquiry that we have pursued together in these meetings.<a name=457:2></a> It is a very rich and full chapter, and it gives us a remarkable view of Paul and his great service, and especially referring to the subject of love as we have often noted.<a name=457:3></a> There are a number of things that bear out in the chapter the thought of spiritual quality which we have looked at together, such as the first embrace.<a name=457:4></a> Then the company that was with Paul (verse 4); the first day of the week; and the breaking of bread.<a name=457:5></a> Then the way that Paul, descending, falls upon Eutychus enfolding him in his arms.<a name=457:6></a> Then the remarkable way he goes over things in his words to the elders of Ephesus, and the remarkable feature that he touches upon in his word referring to the assembly in such a unique way, and all the counsel of God.<a name=457:7></a> Then referring to the extent of his care for them, and the way he went about in his service in ministering, working with his hands and labouring.<a name=457:8></a> All this sets out the idea of quality, and then the finish of the chapter when we get the embrace again when they fell upon the neck of Paul, and ardently kissed him.<a name=457:9></a> This points us to the reciprocity of love in this wonderful environment that <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>brings before us.<a name=457:10></a> These thoughts we should keep before us in finishing our enquiry, as we look into this chapter together.<a name=457:11></a> It is evident that Paul is contemplating the finishing of the apostolic period.<a name=457:12></a> There

		is no such thought as apostolic succession which some claim around us.<a name=458:1></a> It is perfectly clear from this chapter that there is no such thought as that, in that Paul appoints his service to no one following him particularly, in fact he leaves the brethren in the hands of God.<a name=458:2></a> "I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace" (verse 32).<a name=458:3></a> All these things should be kept in mind, so that our period would be particularly in mind by extension.<a name=458:4></a> The thought of revival enters into the chapter, and the recovery of Paul's ministry may be set out.<a name=458:5></a> So that it is a very full chapter in whatever way we may look at it, whether historically or dispensationally.<a name=458:6></a> The chapter is very full in regard of the thought of spiritual quality.<a name=458:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=458:10></a> I think it shows us that Paul's ministry, Paul's service and ministry involves this activity of love, and the more we are in touch with Paul and his ministry in this light, the more we shall understand this embrace.<a name=458:11></a> It says, "But after the tumult had ceased, Paul having called the disciples to him and embraced them, went away to go to Macedonia".<a name=458:12></a> Paul's commission was not just a mere arbitrary commission, to convey certain features of the truth that were in the dispensation that were committed to him.<a name=458:13></a> He is setting out the great feature that enters into the economy, extending from God, through Christ and the Spirit, and the servants to the saints, the feature of love.<a name=458:14></a>

		D.B.<a name=460:3></a> The school of Tyrannus preceded this.<a name=460:4></a> There is no thought of the embrace in the school of Tyrannus, but the opposite to that.<a name=460:5></a> Does that necessarily precede this?<a name=460:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=460:7></a> That is very interesting because there are different aspects and views of the position.<a name=460:8></a> While we have not had time to go into chapter 19, undoubtedly the school, of Tyrannus fits in in a distinct way with the subject of our enquiry -- quality.<a name=460:9></a> We know that in education, in school, things are pursued in an orderly way, not in a haphazard kind of way, but in an orderly definite and precise way, and I think it precedes what we have in this chapter.<a name=460:10></a> It underlies what comes to light in relation to Ephesus.<a name=460:11></a>

		Now I come back for a moment to Romans; it touches the first point I mentioned, the way the love of the Christ comes down into our circumstances here to free us for these great things.<a name=499:1></a> He has thought of us as children.<a name=499:2></a> If He had not done so we would not be free for these things; we would be held by the pressure that marks our condition down here.<a name=499:3></a> So Romans shows how the love of the Christ comes down into our circumstances.<a name=499:4></a> It is the love of a Man, with all the sympathies of a Man, a love which surpasses knowledge and will yet fill the universe from end to end, "the breadth and length and depth and height", and yet coming down into our circumstances here!<a name=499:5></a> So it says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=499:6></a>" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>has to do with us as children, but it speaks of sons as well, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God" (verse 14).<a name=499:7></a> In the full sense of the chapter we are awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body.<a name=499:8></a> Although already in our souls in the dignity and joy of it, our actual position is children, "the Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (verse 16).<a name=499:9></a> In this suffering position here the Christ is occupied with us.<a name=499:10></a> "Who is also at the right hand of God" (verse 34).<a name=499:11></a> He was occupied with us on the cross.<a name=499:12></a> This is not at the cross but the right hand of God.<a name=499:13></a> That is where the love is now, "who also intercedes for us".<a name=499:14></a> So the love of the Christ is active at the right hand of God.<a name=499:15></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a> says, "always living to intercede for them".<a name=499:16></a> We are always on His heart and on His shoulders, day and night.<a name=499:17></a> He never forgets His own.<a name=499:18></a> He is living for that very purpose.<a name=499:19></a> He is devoted to the assembly at the present time, and, in order that He may have us with Him on the highest plane even
