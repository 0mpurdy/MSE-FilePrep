		I would like to speak from these scriptures about being preserved in life.<a name=1:2></a> It is important that we should be preserved here in spiritual life amidst a scene where the deadening influences of Satan abound.<a name=1:3></a> Believers need to have before them the sphere where Christ is, in glory.<a name=1:4></a> Scripture speaks of our life being "hid with the Christ in God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>).<a name=1:5></a> What a great matter it is to lay hold of that truth.<a name=1:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, it says, "in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God" (verse ).<a name=1:7></a> What a thing to get a hold of in your soul -- that Christ is living to God!<a name=1:8></a> We are to live to God too.<a name=1:9></a> The apostle Paul could say, "but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=1:10></a> May we be exercised to be maintained in life and able to enter into the enjoyment of the heavenly things that God has in mind for us.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I read this portion in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#14">Joshua  14</a>to illustrate the fact that Caleb was a person who was conscious that God had kept him alive in the midst of so much unbelief.<a name=1:12></a> The men that had gone up with Joshua and Caleb to search out the land were marked by unbelief, and were not prepared to go into the land again.<a name=1:13></a> Caleb had the land in his heart.<a name=1:14></a> Joshua and Caleb said, "The land … is a very, very good land" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#14:7">Numbers  14:7</a>).<a name=1:15></a> Oh!<a name=1:16></a> that we might have a fuller impression of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the richness and fulness of that land that is beyond the Jordan.<a name=2:1></a> It typifies the heavenly land where Christ is, the sphere which divine Persons have purposed that we should enter.<a name=2:2></a> That is the land Caleb had in his heart.<a name=2:3></a> He had it by faith in his heart through the wilderness; he could speak well of it and bear witness of it.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Caleb reminds Joshua of what had been said before.<a name=2:5></a> He says, "Thou knowest the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses … concerning me and thee".<a name=2:6></a> There was a two-fold witness in Joshua and Caleb of what Moses the man of God had said.<a name=2:7></a> Caleb says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart.<a name=2:8></a> And my brethren that had gone up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God".<a name=2:9></a> I commend it to every one here, that we should acquire a knowledge of God, so that we can each say, 'My God', as having relations with Him.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are to know God and His love.<a name=2:11></a> "If any one love God, <i>he</i> is known of him" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:3">1 Corinthians  8:3</a>).<a name=2:12></a> God would have us to be whole-hearted.<a name=2:13></a> The unbelief of others did not turn Caleb aside.<a name=2:14></a> How many, alas, have been turned aside!<a name=2:15></a> We need to keep our eye on Christ and on that sphere of blessing, the land.<a name=2:16></a> Moses swore to Caleb that day that the land whereon he stood would be his and his children's assuredly.<a name=2:17></a> Caleb was in no doubt whatsoever.<a name=2:18></a> He was holding fast and could bear witness to the fact that God was with him and would bless him and his household too.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what we look for, beloved, that the saints and their households should be blessed.<a name=2:20></a> These dear young people are growing up in a place of wonderful
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		privilege; may they be preserved from the world, for there are terrible things going on there.<a name=3:1></a> May the young be preserved as growing up among the saints where God is known and where the things of God are spoken about and cherished.<a name=3:2></a> It is a wonderful thing in our household readings to have the impression of how God can help and encourage us.<a name=3:3></a> It gives a wonderful sense of victory, as passing through such a world as we are in.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At eighty-five years of age, Caleb was still strong.<a name=3:5></a> He had not lost any of his strength.<a name=3:6></a> I think that flowed from the maintenance of his links with God.<a name=3:7></a> Our spiritual strength lies in waiting upon God in order that we might be maintained here until the Lord comes to take us to be with Himself in glory.<a name=3:8></a> We have, as it were, to dispossess enemies who have no right to be in the land.<a name=3:9></a> We have to understand that, until the end of our christian pathway, there will be conflict, and we need to understand that we are to take our part in it.<a name=3:10></a> We are to go out for war in dependence upon God, and come in to enjoy the fruits of the land.<a name=3:11></a> In addition, Caleb being a man of faith, asks for the mountain that God had spoken of.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is an important matter.<a name=3:13></a> God had in mind for His people to bring them into the mountain of His inheritance, and Caleb lays hold of it in faith, even though the Anakim were there.<a name=3:14></a> He says, "If so be Jehovah shall be with me, then I shall dispossess them".<a name=3:15></a> Those who are with God and move in dependence upon Him, are strengthened by the Spirit to lay hold of the inheritance.<a name=3:16></a> I commend that to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		each one of us at this time, so that we may lay hold of the purpose of God, and enter into the enjoyment of it with one another.<a name=4:1></a> Caleb's inheritance, Hebron, was built "seven years before Zoan in Egypt" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13:22">Numbers  13:22</a>).<a name=4:2></a> It thus, typically, antedates the whole world system, and Caleb had the light of another world in his soul.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The inheritance is something we can enjoy together; it is both present and future.<a name=4:4></a> The Spirit is "the earnest of our inheritance" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>), and before we enter into the fulness and blessedness of God's purpose, He gives us a foretaste of it even now.<a name=4:5></a> How blessed it is to share these things!<a name=4:6></a> God would help us to enjoy with one another the great things that He has designed for us in the purpose of His love.<a name=4:7></a> How great it is!<a name=4:8></a> So it repeats, "Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb … to this day, because he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel".<a name=4:9></a> Note that: "the God of Israel".<a name=4:10></a> God always had the whole twelve tribes before Him, and, despite the defection of the two-and-a-half tribes, He would bring about His purposes and bless His people.<a name=4:11></a> That is what He had in mind.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a man Caleb was!<a name=4:13></a> We have no record of his death.<a name=4:14></a> That may suggest continuity in the maintenance of what he represents.<a name=4:15></a> He said, "Jehovah has kept me alive".<a name=4:16></a> May we all have a sense of that; God is keeping us alive in relation to a spiritual order of things which is for His pleasure, which exists in the power of the Spirit, and which we can enjoy with one another.<a name=4:17></a> The psalmist says, "dwell in the land,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and feed on faithfulness" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#37:3">Psalm  37:3</a>).<a name=5:1></a> These words are to encourage our hearts.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the scripture in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#6">Deuteronomy  6</a>, God anticipates that the young would raise questions.<a name=5:3></a> "When thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?<a name=5:4></a>" The young persons would, no doubt, see what their parents are enjoying, and ask what led them into the understanding and enjoyment of these things.<a name=5:5></a> What a blessed matter it is, if we are marked by obedience to God's commands and testimonies.<a name=5:6></a> All this is in view of the preservation of life.<a name=5:7></a> I believe that is what God has in mind in these days.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the children of Israel were to say that they had been delivered: "We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a powerful hand; and Jehovah shewed signs and wonders".<a name=5:9></a> We should all be able to speak a little of the wonderful deliverance God has effected for us through the death of Christ, and in the power of the blessed Holy Spirit.<a name=5:10></a> He would give us some appreciation of Christ as the great Deliverer of His people.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we have this beautiful touch -- and we need to be reminded of it: "and he brought us out thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers".<a name=5:12></a> Let us have that continually before us.<a name=5:13></a> God brought us out -- that is one part of His operations in the glad tidings -- extricating us from evil in ourselves and the world system.<a name=5:14></a> It was all in view of bringing us, typically,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		into the land flowing with milk and honey, "the land which he swore unto our fathers".<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have the apostles' teaching (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>) and Paul's teaching (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:10">2 Timothy  3:10</a>) which have been handed down to us, and we can be thankful for that.<a name=6:2></a> Many of us have an appreciation of what has come down to us through spiritual fathers.<a name=6:3></a> We have had rich impressions of the enjoyment that belongs to the land.<a name=6:4></a> And Moses says, "Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good continually".<a name=6:5></a> May we understand what is for our good; God acts as a Father to us, and in His tender care and love toward us He may pass us through circumstances that perhaps are not congenial to us, but it is in view of bringing us to know His love better, and to bring us into the sphere which His love has designed for us.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "that he might preserve us alive, as it is this day".<a name=6:7></a> May we be preserved in life, through however many days may ensue in the history of the testimony.<a name=6:8></a> Apostasy is increasing on every hand, but God has in mind to maintain in His people a testimony to life.<a name=6:9></a> What a great matter that is, to see that the saints are going through such a world and being preserved in life because they have their aspirations and longings in relation to another world, where Christ is, in glory.<a name=6:10></a> What an object for our souls!<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That feature comes out in Joseph at the end of Genesis.<a name=6:12></a> He says to his brethren, "Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as it is this day, to save a great people
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		alive" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#50:20">Genesis  50:20</a>).<a name=7:1></a> So you can see how prominent this thought is with God, that His people should be preserved in life.<a name=7:2></a> It is our privilege thus to love God and obey His commandments in view of being preserved at the present time.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the scripture in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4">Proverbs  4</a>, it is a father that is speaking.<a name=7:4></a> Think of the tender appeal that comes out in this scripture.<a name=7:5></a> "Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father".<a name=7:6></a> Oh!<a name=7:7></a> how God loves to instruct us.<a name=7:8></a> If we are to be instructed, we must be obedient, and in subjection, and pay attention to what God is saying.<a name=7:9></a> As we understand that it is a Father's love that is behind it all, it makes it easier for us to accept it.<a name=7:10></a> It says, "attend".<a name=7:11></a> We have to attend to these things, and as we do we shall prove that "the liberal soul shall be made fat" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#11:25">Proverbs  11:25</a>).<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says, "I give you good doctrine".<a name=7:13></a> May we learn the good doctrine in the presence of fathers who know God.<a name=7:14></a> That is what marks fathers -- they know God, and have proved Him, and are able to give good doctrine, so that we who follow in their footsteps may be preserved in life.<a name=7:15></a> Then he says, "forsake ye not my law".<a name=7:16></a> What an appeal that is!<a name=7:17></a> Remember how God appealed to His people of old, and how He watched over them in the wilderness in view of their preservation.<a name=7:18></a> "Forsake ye not my law".<a name=7:19></a> May we understand that is a "law": The word means 'teaching' (footnote <i>f</i>).<a name=7:20></a> Love lies behind a Father's law.<a name=7:21></a> There is a man in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>who loved God's statutes and His commandments.<a name=7:22></a> That is the kind of man that is able to have part in the service of God.<a name=7:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.<a name=8:1></a> And he taught me".<a name=8:2></a> What a great matter it is to come under divine teaching!<a name=8:3></a> The Lord Jesus said in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23">Matthew  23</a>, "one is your instructor, the Christ" (verse 10).<a name=8:4></a> How blessed it is to sit at the feet of Jesus, as Mary did, and to listen to His word (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:39">Luke  10:39</a>).<a name=8:5></a> It is important that we should set aside a part of our life daily to pay attention to what the Lord is saying, and to receive divine instruction.<a name=8:6></a> If you have come to that in your soul, then you will not be moved, nor swayed by "every wind of <i>that</i> teaching, which is in the sleight of men" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:14">Ephesians  4:14</a>), such as is about today.<a name=8:7></a> I commend it to each one of us at this time.<a name=8:8></a> We, as believers, are all children of God.<a name=8:9></a> Let us heed the exhortation, "Hear, ye children".<a name=8:10></a> We have come into a wonderful relationship as children of God, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ.<a name=8:11></a> We will soon be with Him and share with Him in that wonderful scene where He will be supreme.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says "Hear" again in verse 10: "Hear, my son, and receive my sayings".<a name=8:13></a> I think it is very important that we give place to the Spirit if we are to receive these precious things.<a name=8:14></a> What preservation lies in that!<a name=8:15></a> Many of us have proved it.<a name=8:16></a> How wayward we have been, yet God in His love and tender care has instructed us in the way that we should go, so that we might be preserved in life in view of giving pleasure to Him.<a name=8:17></a> I think that is what God has in mind in these verses.<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other blessed features: it says, "Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of it are the issues of life" (verse 23).<a name=9:1></a> I think that is God's great appeal at the present time, that His people might be maintained in life, in the enjoyment of the heavenly calling.<a name=9:2></a> May it be our portion to continue in these things.<a name=9:3></a> That involves that we may have to be adjusted sometimes in the acceptance of God's will, but the result is that we come into a fuller knowledge of God Himself and are able to serve Him more acceptably.<a name=9:4></a> Discipline is necessary for each one of us.<a name=9:5></a> We may not like it at the time, but as we accept it there will be results for God.<a name=9:6></a> That is what God would have in mind.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in our last scripture, Jude is writing, in a dark day testimonially, about what has come in among believers.<a name=9:8></a> He speaks of those who "have gone in the way of Cain, and given themselves up to the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core" (verse 11).<a name=9:9></a> These three examples are set before the people of God, so that we might take warning.<a name=9:10></a> He says, "But <i>ye</i>, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they said to you, that at the end of the time there should be mockers, walking after their own lusts … not having the Spirit" (verses 17 - 19).<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again he says, "But <i>ye</i>, beloved".<a name=9:12></a> Now he addresses the saints in this endearing way because of his affection for them.<a name=9:13></a> Jude tells us at the outset that he meant to speak of "our common salvation", but he had to turn aside and to write "exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints" (verse 3).<a name=9:14></a> Oh!<a name=9:15></a> may we indeed hold fast to that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which has been committed to us.<a name=10:1></a> "The faith" involves a system of teaching by which, if we are subject to it, we will be preserved in life and kept here for the pleasure of God.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Jude speaks of the antidote: "building yourselves up on your most holy faith".<a name=10:3></a> Jude stresses holiness: "holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:14">Hebrews  12:14</a>).<a name=10:4></a> Holiness is an absolute necessity as we have to do with God.<a name=10:5></a> It says in regard to His house, "holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#93:5">Psalm  93:5</a>).<a name=10:6></a> There is no relaxation of that matter, because God is a holy God.<a name=10:7></a> It is important to become more acquainted with the faith, the christian faith, and how it has come down to us through the apostles' doctrine.<a name=10:8></a> The Spirit is unfolding in these days the great things of God.<a name=10:9></a> He is opening up to the saints an order of things in which they will be preserved here in a scene of rising apostasy.<a name=10:10></a> Jude has in mind the preservation of the saints.<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature of the last days is "praying in the Holy Spirit".<a name=10:12></a> What a need there is to be cast upon Him for help and instruction in relation to what may come into the pathway here.<a name=10:13></a> What a great matter it is to know the Holy Spirit as One who dwells in us.<a name=10:14></a> He is One to whom we can appeal, and we should be here as those who are continually praying in the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:15></a> "Keep yourselves in the love of God".<a name=10:16></a> We are to be in that state, always enjoying the love of God who has purposed us for blessing.<a name=10:17></a> Then we can enter into something of the fulness and blessedness of God's love as it has reached us in Christ, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		appreciate His giving us the Holy Spirit as Comforter to help us here below.<a name=11:1></a> He is the One we are to know.<a name=11:2></a> "Ye know him", the Lord says (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>).<a name=11:3></a> We are to know the help that He can afford as we are subject to the will of God.<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jude says, "awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life".<a name=11:5></a> We are looking forward to that.<a name=11:6></a> Wonderful mercy has been shown us.<a name=11:7></a> I believe we need to deepen in a sense of divine mercy that has taken each one of us up, while passing others by, and has preserved us here right up to the present time.<a name=11:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May we be encouraged by these thoughts, and, like Caleb, continue in the line of faith, be prepared to receive the instruction of a father, and take advantage of these features that Jude brings before us, so that we may be preserved in life until that moment when the Lord will come and take us to be with Himself.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May He help us, and bless His word, for His Name's sake!<a name=11:10></a>

		I desire to say a word about manhood, the divine thought being that God should surround Himself with men, with families no doubt, but with men, for it is said as the heavenly city comes down from God out of heaven, that "the tabernacle of God is with men" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:3">Revelation  21:3</a>).<a name=11:12></a> So that God's thought for us now

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, in coming to the New Testament what is presented is a Man.<a name=12:3></a> The saints in the Old Testament times could not be men in the sense in which I am speaking, except in a typical way.<a name=12:4></a> I have no doubt that Jacob, in type, arrived at manhood in the wrestling with the angel.<a name=12:5></a> He had strength, and he received a name which indicated manhood, his name being changed from Jacob to Israel, for "thou hast wrestled with God, and with men, and hast prevailed" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:28">Genesis  32:28</a>).<a name=12:6></a> So we find that Jacob, in his interview immediately after with Esau, has tender sympathies that belong to manhood.<a name=12:7></a> These are expressed to those who come under his care.<a name=12:8></a>

		Well, now, the epistle to the Ephesians, I need not say, is written from the standpoint of the exaltation of Christ, as, indeed, we are told in this very epistle that God has "set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a>, 21).<a name=23:8></a> We are in the presence, in this epistle, of the greatest conceivable exaltation,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The greatest thoughts of God are now to be opened up to us, and Christ is already there as Man in the position from which those thoughts are unfolded.<a name=24:2></a> That is a great thing to take account of.<a name=24:3></a> In olden times, Abraham and others saw things as God revealed them to them distantly.<a name=24:4></a> "Abraham", the Lord says, "exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>).<a name=24:5></a> At the same time, what he saw was still in the distance, but things are no longer in the distance.<a name=24:6></a> Christ is already in the place which God's purpose has marked out for Him, and the Holy Spirit is here, the Earnest (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>), and in the Earnest there is the power in the saints to enter at the present time into all that will soon be ours in glorious actuality.<a name=24:7></a>

		Indeed, dear brethren, one frequently reminds oneself that it will only take a twinkling of an eye; <i>that</i> is all the time it will take to prepare us for the place, and in the bodily condition, in which these blessings are to be realised in their fulness and for eternity (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:52">1 Corinthians  15:52</a>).<a name=24:8></a> It only requires a twinkling of an eye to complete the matter so far as our bodily condition is concerned, but there is that completion to go on in the meantime in our souls in a formative way, and that is what we are concerned about.<a name=24:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what one wants to reach, that the day for these things is now.<a name=25:3></a> We are not to put them off till the future, and so the apostle says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us".<a name=25:4></a> The apostle can speak in that way.<a name=25:5></a> He is dealing with God, and with God's standpoint, so to speak, and, as I say, Christ is already in that position, and, in Jesus where He is, is the setting out of what God has in His thoughts for us.<a name=25:6></a> It is well for us to take that in, and so the apostle can say that God "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ".<a name=25:7></a> He has chosen us, he says, "in him before the world's foundation".<a name=25:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable the scope that is covered in one or two verses, going back to before the foundation of the world, eternity in the past (if one may speak of the past in relation to eternity), going back to that, and then looking on to what is called the administration of the fulness of times -- which is the day that is to come; then in chapter 3, going on to all generations of the age of ages, which is eternity in the future.<a name=25:9></a> The apostle, in a very short span, so to speak, so far as words are concerned, covers an immense scope as regards time or eternity.<a name=25:10></a> He says, God "has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will".<a name=25:11></a>

		We have often gone over these things, dear brethren, but it is well to go over them again to get our minds and spirits saturated with the sense of the blessedness of God operating entirely from His own side; not presented as actuated by any question of need on our part or desire, for indeed these matters go back to before the foundation of the world, but choosing us for His own pleasure, choosing us in Christ.<a name=26:1></a> One sees, dear brethren, what divine purpose is, how marvellous it is!<a name=26:2></a> How, from the very outset, when once the thoughts of divine love were conceived, the incarnation was in view, as, you might say, the keystone of all that God was going to effect.<a name=26:3></a> He chose us in Christ.<a name=26:4></a> The explanation of it, of course, is that all is "according to the good pleasure of his will".<a name=26:5></a> It is not a question of what might meet our most exaggerated thoughts or desires; it is a question entirely of what will satisfy the heart of God.<a name=26:6></a> You might say, why should God desire it?<a name=26:7></a> Well, it is a matter for us to consider, why indeed?<a name=26:8></a>

		I was speaking of different ones who were moved in a spirit of worship.<a name=26:9></a> Paul, himself, is another remarkable instance.<a name=26:10></a> So blessedly did he know God that, in writing an epistle like Romans, he constantly bursts out in doxology.<a name=26:11></a> In chapter 1, he refers to God as Creator, saying of men, that they "honoured and served the creature more than him who had created it, who is blessed for ever.<a name=26:12></a> Amen" (verse 25).<a name=26:13></a> Then in chapter 9, he speaks of Christ coming in of Israel, according to flesh, and then in order to establish the truth of His Person, he says, "who is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		over all, God", but then he has to add, "blessed for ever.<a name=27:1></a> Amen" (verse 5).<a name=27:2></a> That is the spirit in which Paul handles divine things.<a name=27:3></a> As he thinks of God and as he thinks of Christ, a spirit of worship arises in his heart, and that is what the Lord would help us in, lest we should become academic or formal in these holy things.<a name=27:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, Paul traces God's ways and, as he does so, he says, "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=27:5></a> how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!<a name=27:6></a> For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?<a name=27:7></a>" (verses 33, 34).<a name=27:8></a> And then he says, "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever.<a name=27:9></a> Amen" (verse 36).<a name=27:10></a> That is how Paul is affected as he thinks of God.<a name=27:11></a> If he thinks of Christ, who He is, he is affected in the same way.<a name=27:12></a> If he thinks of God's ways, he is also affected in that way, and as he thinks of the mystery, he is similarly affected, according to the end of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16">Romans  16</a>.<a name=27:13></a> The spirit of worship is intended to characterise the saints as they take account of God.<a name=27:14></a>

		As far as I understand the church, it was set up here entirely in the power of the Holy Spirit; I do not think the apostles had anything much of administration before them.<a name=28:2></a> They have a place in administration -- they are to "sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:28">Matthew  19:28</a>).<a name=28:3></a> But there is something greater than administration, and that is the church's relation to the Father; the identification with Christ of the many sons that God is bringing to glory.<a name=28:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is the seat of perfect administration as the assembly of the living God; but it is the assembly of the firstborn which are written in heaven (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>), and that is morally a greater thought.<a name=28:5></a> If you apprehend the God of resurrection, you cannot limit God to administration, any more than you can limit God's blessing to the line of the flesh, and it is in that way that I understand that Jacob blessed both the sons of Joseph.<a name=28:6></a> That is what he did when this world was fading out of view; and he worshipped, leaning on the top of his staff.<a name=28:7></a>

		There are two things that mark Joseph at the end: he made mention of the departing of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.<a name=28:8></a> Resurrection is the ground upon which God delivered His people out of Egypt; and the fact is this, except God acted on the ground of resurrection, there are questions which God would have to raise with men.<a name=28:9></a> But the blood was the witness of death; God's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brightest moment of Jacob's life, if I might say so, was his death; the fathers died in faith, and Jacob's brightest moment was perhaps when he died.<a name=29:2></a> So with Joseph: all his greatness in Egypt was gone, everything had faded from view, and what comes before him was that his brethren were in Egypt, and he makes mention of their departing; God would come in for them, and deliver them out of the land of Egypt.<a name=29:3></a> And yet Egypt had been the scene of Joseph's glory; his children were born there, his links were there, but, in the hour of his dying, Egypt was gone from him.<a name=29:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My conviction is that if Joseph had lived in the time of Moses, Joseph would have done what Moses did, for Moses carried out that of which Joseph spoke.<a name=29:5></a> Joseph had light to speak about it, but the time was not yet come for action; still, it formed part of the testimony of the God of resurrection, and all of that testimony will be made good in the power of resurrection.<a name=29:6></a> God does not deliver Israel out of Egypt again; it was the God of resurrection who brought them out.<a name=29:7></a> They never understood that, but, nevertheless, He was in that light, delivering His people out of the bondage of Egypt.<a name=29:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph had not only light in that way, but he "gave commandment concerning his bones"; he would not leave any memorial in Egypt, and yet

		Egypt was the land of his greatness.<a name=30:1></a> After the flesh he might have looked to have a statue in Egypt, but he would not leave even his bones there.<a name=30:2></a> That is where Joseph shines out as a man of faith, and, as I said, had he lived in the time of Moses he would have been the instrument of God's deliverance from Egypt.<a name=30:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The strength and ability of Moses after the flesh could not deliver the people of God, only God could do this; faith brought in the light and the power of God, and therefore had Joseph lived in the time of Moses he would have been the deliverer of Israel.<a name=30:4></a> Joseph and Moses are brought together in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>, both as being in the first instance rejected of the people, and yet ultimately the instruments of God to deliver them.<a name=30:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph lived in his own day, and had to enjoy the light that God gave <i>him</i>; and a man can never go beyond his faith, he can act only on the light he has from God.<a name=30:6></a> But if Joseph had lived in our day, he would have understood that he was risen with Christ!<a name=30:7></a> I gather that from the fact that he would not leave a memorial in Egypt.<a name=30:8></a> Most of us have some kind of a name there, and I believe that until a person has entered into the mind of God for him by faith, until he sees that God's mind toward him is that he is risen with Christ, he will not be willing to give up his name in the world.<a name=30:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is just as much the mind of God for us that we are risen with Christ, as that we are justified, and until it can be said of us that we are risen with Christ, I do not think we are clear of the reproach of

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was when the children of Israel reached Gilgal that the reproach of Egypt was rolled away.<a name=31:4></a> People are not cleared of the reproach of Egypt when they are justified.<a name=31:5></a> It is a blessed thing to enter into deliverance from sin and the flesh and law; but it is a greater thing to be in spirit outside of all that is national and religious, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free, but where Christ is all and in all, where everything is pervaded and regulated by the affections of Christ.<a name=31:6></a> If Christ is all and in all, He is in all in the sense of divine affections, and that is the scene which God has for His people.<a name=31:7></a> We do not find people always prepared to give up the Jew and the Greek; they cling a good bit to distinctions after the flesh, but these things have no place in God's mind for us; it is just as much His mind for us to know our place in the christian circle as that we are justified.<a name=31:8></a> You would be wise to accept the thought of God about you.<a name=31:9></a> Joseph and Moses would have done so had they lived in our day.<a name=31:10></a>

		Now, beloved, we accept the mind of God, and this is by <i>faith</i>; but then, if you enter into the <i>mind</i> of God, the <i>work</i> of God is corresponding to it.<a name=31:11></a> He has "quickened" you "with the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:5">Ephesians  2:5</a>), so

		But to be quickened with Christ means to be rejected in the world, and perhaps, too, not to have a very great place in the providence of God -- you may not be favoured in that way.<a name=32:3></a> His providence is a veil behind which God hides Himself.<a name=32:4></a> But if you are sharing Christ's rejection you will certainly get glory with Him.<a name=32:5></a> If you suffer with Him now, you will be associated with Him in the day of His glory; you form part of the heavenly city which has the glory of God, and in which God will Himself be in connection with the whole universe of bliss.<a name=32:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The exercise in reading these scriptures is, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to speak about the testimony of our Lord at the present time.<a name=33:1></a> Many of us, especially those of us who are older, tend to dwell somewhat on the past, and that has its own worth.<a name=33:2></a> There is much that has gone on in the testimony that is well worth remembering and going over.<a name=33:3></a> Indeed, I think it is useful to have some understanding of the history of the church, from the beginning.<a name=33:4></a> And, of course, we look forward to the coming of the Lord -- that should be ever in our minds, too.<a name=33:5></a> But what is in mind, in reading these scriptures, is to speak about the present time.<a name=33:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scripture we began with in Hebrews says, "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, Today …".<a name=33:7></a> If we were asked about the testimony, 'What is the Lord doing today', it would be an exercise as to how we might answer; and yet it is vitally important, because if we only look back (blessed as that is) and look forward (encouraging and bright as that is) the tendency is, perhaps, to go on somewhat aimlessly, looking only on the weakness of present conditions, and feeling it too, no doubt.<a name=33:8></a> But, what <i>is</i> the Lord doing today?<a name=33:9></a> Well, He is still working; that is certain.<a name=33:10></a> There has been evidence of it among the young in these parts, and indeed in the localities of the saints.<a name=33:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=34>[Page 34]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The expression "Today" as used here refers to a period of time, but one takes the liberty of applying it to ourselves, just at the present juncture in the testimony: "Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation".<a name=34:1></a> That applied to Israel initially, but then it has a bearing on us too.<a name=34:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I am not charging brethren with hardness of heart, but what I <i>am</i> saying is that we need to be kept alive and tender in our affections towards Christ, first of all, and then to keep His interests constantly before us at the present time, because there are many distractions around us.<a name=34:3></a> Some one asked me recently as to what <i>my</i> church was doing about conditions in Sudan; why were we not furnishing a lorry and sending out goods (I do not despise these things; they have their place)?<a name=34:4></a> My reply was that I do not think that the assembly of Christ, the assembly of God indeed, has as its primary function, meeting needs in the world of that kind.<a name=34:5></a> I am not saying we might not do so as individuals, but it is a personal matter.<a name=34:6></a> Paul, was enjoined to remember the poor: "which same thing also I was diligent to do" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a> 10) -- that has its place.<a name=34:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say this because the enemy would seek to distract us by any means possible from the real function of the assembly, which is to be here faithful to Christ and His interests, and to minister to His heart and to minister to God.<a name=34:8></a> The Lord emphasized that side of things when He said, "ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:8">John  12:8</a>).<a name=34:9></a> That is, He was to be their first Interest, as He should be with us.<a name=34:10></a>

		The Spirit of God goes on (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:10">Hebrews  3:10</a>) to speak of Israel's erring in their heart, and so on, but what I wanted to come to was the reference in verse 12 to "the living God", and the injunction of not "turning away from the living God", because, to my mind, that bears very particularly on the present time.<a name=35:1></a> We can speak about how God brought about recovery of the truth early in the nineteenth century, and how He has maintained the truth; but what about the living God?<a name=35:2></a> that is, the God who is active today in the testimony.<a name=35:3></a> And how are we in relation to what He is doing now?<a name=35:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says, "See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God".<a name=35:5></a> What is the antidote?<a name=35:6></a> "But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called Today".<a name=35:7></a> "Encourage yourselves <i>each day</i>".<a name=35:8></a> One of the booklets available from the Kingston Bible Trust called, simply, "<i>DAILY</i>", deals with this very matter, and it is a very important part of our lives.<a name=35:9></a> What is daily connects with the testimony.<a name=35:10></a> There is what is weekly too -- beginning with the Breaking of Bread on the Lord's day -- but what is daily is vitally important in our lives: reading the Scriptures, praying, etc.<a name=35:11></a> You say, 'Well, we have heard all this before'; but do you do it?<a name=35:12></a> Do <i>I</i> do it?<a name=35:13></a> Let us keep close to the Lord, keep short accounts <i>daily</i>, for there is nothing so weakening as when a cloud comes between our spirits and the Lord.<a name=35:14></a>

		this may sound as if I am pursuing a rather negative line, but I know my own heart; the routine of things, the sheer pressure of being in the world from day-today, what we have to contend with <i>tends</i> to harden us, unless we are kept close to Christ and kept <i>living</i> in our links with Him.<a name=36:1></a> Remember, it is the living God that we have to do with; that God of whom it is said that He neither slumbers nor sleeps (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121">Psalm  121</a> 4).<a name=36:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, when we come to the judgment seat of the Christ (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:10">2 Corinthians  5:10</a>), we will not only get a review of our responsible pathway here, but we will see how much God has saved us from in order to preserve us in view of the testimony.<a name=36:3></a> Think of Balaam, for instance, and his attempts to curse Israel (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#22">Numbers  22</a>- 24).<a name=36:4></a> Israel knew nothing of the fact that Balaam was there on the mountain seeking time after time to bring cursing on them.<a name=36:5></a> Who prevented it?<a name=36:6></a> God did, in His gracious intervention, and He put in Balaam's mouth words of blessing.<a name=36:7></a> What a God He is!<a name=36:8></a> The living God with whom we have to do, each day.<a name=36:9></a>

		I go on now to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>where the connection with "Today" might not be immediately evident, but I would suggest that this section bears very much on the present phase of the testimony.<a name=36:10></a> Israel had had distinctive leadership in Moses and Aaron, and from them they learned God's will for them.<a name=36:11></a> They had come now to a time when Aaron had died (chapter 20: 28), and Moses was soon to be taken from them.<a name=36:12></a> If we consider our own history, for many years there was what was spoken of as a universal lead, and

		with it a definite and clear line of ministry, which had the Lord's support.<a name=37:1></a> It seems clear that the emphasis now is on what this section speaks of, which is as we have been taught, inward leadership; that is, the leadership and the power of the Holy Spirit known at the present time.<a name=37:2></a>

		The Spirit is addressed here therefore, typically, and it is interesting, in this poetic section from the middle of verse 14, the number of references to water: "brooks", "stream" and then the "well" to which they sang.<a name=37:3></a> I believe that our salvation lies at the present time in having to do with the living God; and that includes our relations with the Holy Spirit, keeping them clear and being sensitive to His promptings.<a name=37:4></a> You may say, 'Well, does that mean that the Lord has a lesser place?<a name=37:5></a>' Most <i>emphatically</i> not; but the scripture we will come to shortly in Joshua, shows that the ark -- a type of the Lord Himself -- became greater in Israel's view than ever before as they came to the Jordan.<a name=37:6></a>

		I would refer briefly to the fact that, when the Lord left His own, (and I am thinking particularly of John's gospel chapters 14, 15 and 16), the way in which He spoke of the Holy Spirit -- His coming, first of all, as sent by the Father, and as sent by the Son ("I will send", chapter 15: 26), and then as coming of Himself -- should emphasise to our minds and hearts the fact that the Spirit of God would have a very great place with the saints in the present dispensation.<a name=37:7></a> The Lord Himself said, "He that believes on me … shall do greater than these" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:12">John  14:12</a>).<a name=37:8></a>

		That is, the building upon the foundation which the Lord had laid in regard of God's great thoughts as to the assembly, was to be continued and amplified in this present dispensation.<a name=38:1></a> I would repeat what has often been said in recent times, (again, one speaks of one's own experience), that there is a danger of thinking that the testimony is fading away.<a name=38:2></a> The truth of the matter is that God is still working, the living God is working.<a name=38:3></a> We have not come to the present phase of the testimony by accident.<a name=38:4></a> We may feel the effects of God's government, and rightly so; we would not minimise that, but the fact of the matter is that God is completing what was set on at Pentecost; He is doing it in these last days, and we are to have our part in it.<a name=38:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:24">Proverbs  8:24</a>, Solomon writes, "When there were no depths, I" (wisdom) "was brought forth", but there came a time when depths came into evidence, and one of the greatest depths that came into evidence was when God's Beloved went down into death and judgment that we might receive forgiveness of sins.<a name=53:10></a> The depths have come into evidence, and God has brought in wisdom in order that we should be furnished with that which is intended to appeal to our hearts and enrich them with a sense of how blessed God is.<a name=53:11></a> Paul prays that God would give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.<a name=53:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having introduced this thought of sonship, we get the further thought then that God has abounded towards us in the riches of His grace in making known to us the mystery of His will.<a name=54:5></a> He wants us to be fully intelligent, and all this, dear brethren, is to take shape now.<a name=54:6></a> It is not at all the thought that it should be put off to the future.<a name=54:7></a> There is no object in putting off to the future our becoming intelligent as to the administration of the fulness of times, because when the fulness of times has come the administration will be seen, but what God wants us to be intelligent about is what He is doing before it actually comes to pass, and so He has made known to us the "mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him, in whom we have also obtained an inheritance".<a name=54:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Adam being in that position, God said, "It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a> 18).<a name=55:4></a> There is the deep sleep and the rib taken out of the side of Adam, and the building of the woman, and the bringing her to the man.<a name=55:5></a> She was brought to the man in that position, and that is exactly what is before us here: "In whom", that is, in Christ, "we have also obtained an inheritance".<a name=55:6></a> We have an inheritance with Christ because He is to inherit all things, and we are to have part with Him in His inheritance.<a name=55:7></a> The point is, dear brethren, Are these things to affect us now?<a name=55:8></a> It is a wonderful thing that these things are ours, but how are we to be fitted to have part with Christ in that day?<a name=55:9></a>

		Adam rejoiced when he saw someone brought to him whom he could recognise as being worthy of him, and capable of entering intelligently with him into the position in which God had placed him.<a name=55:10></a> He said, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>).<a name=55:11></a> That is, there was, in feminine form, in the affections and grace connected with the feminine idea, that which was the exact counterpart to the man.<a name=55:12></a> That is what we are to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fifth chapter of this epistle (Ephesians), we have Christ's side of the matter (Christ viewed in this position as the One in whom all things are to be headed up); "the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word, that <i>he</i> might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless" (verses 25 - 27).<a name=56:3></a> We only arrive at what is holy and without blemish as we are brought into correspondence with Christ, and hence that is what we come to in chapter 4, what God is working for at the present time in the assembly.<a name=56:4></a> We read in chapter 4 that Christ has gone up far above all heavens.<a name=56:5></a> "Wherefore, he says, Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men.<a name=56:6></a> But that he ascended, what is it that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=56:7></a> He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens".<a name=56:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was speaking a moment ago of the exalted position in which Christ is.<a name=56:9></a> He is there permanently, never to be dislodged from it.<a name=56:10></a> He is to be taken account of there.<a name=56:11></a> It says, "He … has also ascended up above all the heavens".<a name=56:12></a> In the first chapter He is presented as being set by God in this exalted position; in this chapter He is presented as gone there in His own right and power, "ascended up above all the

		heavens".<a name=57:1></a> We get a wonderful view of Christ, the One whom God has supremely exalted on the one hand, and the One who has in His own Person the inherent right and power to go far above all heavens, beyond the created sphere, and hence we are in the presence of the greatest conceivable thing: a divine Person in manhood, and yet we are to be united to Him.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not to have part in Deity, of course, but, at the same time, to be brought near, to a most intimate and most holy place, to be united to a Man who has part in Deity.<a name=57:3></a> "He … has also ascended up above all the heavens".<a name=57:4></a> He has gone there in His own right and power, far outside the created sphere.<a name=57:5></a> What a glorious Christ!<a name=57:6></a> Then from that position, so to speak, unaffected by conditions down here -- that is, not operating from that standpoint but operating entirely from the standpoint of divine counsels -- He has given gifts, but then Paul calls attention to the fact that before He ascended He descended first into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=57:7></a> All that had in mind the formation of the assembly.<a name=57:8></a> The body of Christ is to be brought into view, and is to be brought into view as corresponding with Himself, as formed under the influence of His love expressed in death.<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam went into a deep sleep, and the woman was formed out of what was taken out of his side in the deep sleep, and Christ has gone down into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=57:10></a> It means complete identification in love with the position in which we were; not, of course, that the assembly has any past history, I am not suggesting that, but then the assembly,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=58>[Page 58]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as the body of Christ, is to be formed in moral features, formed in features that are of God, formed in love, in righteousness, in holiness, and these things are learned in the light of the death of Christ.<a name=58:1></a> Those who are to compose the body of Christ are those who have had a past history, though viewed as the subjects of the work of God they have no responsible past history.<a name=58:2></a> So the process of formation goes on, and Christ has ascended up above all the heavens, and from that position He has given gifts.<a name=58:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Later in this same chapter, we read, "But <i>ye</i> have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus; namely, your having put off according to the former conversation the old man which corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts; and being renewed in the spirit of your mind; and your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (verses 20 - 24).<a name=58:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question, I believe, of the way the work of God goes on.<a name=58:5></a> On the one hand, there is Christ personally before us: "But <i>ye</i> have not thus learnt the Christ", and then the entire disallowance of one order of man in order that an order of manhood created according to God in righteousness and true holiness should come into view.<a name=58:6></a> That truth is learned in Christ and in the light of His death: "<i>ye</i> have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus".<a name=58:7></a> Now the work of God is going on in the formation of the body of Christ.<a name=58:8></a>

		We should bear in mind that what is in view is the formation of this vessel that is to be the fulness of Christ, the complete answer to all that is found in Him as a Man.<a name=59:1></a> There are two means which God employs, and the first is the gifts from an ascended Christ, and the second is what we ourselves do amongst ourselves as holding the truth in love.<a name=59:2></a> These are the two means by which God is effecting His present thoughts in the saints.<a name=59:3></a>

		The result of the activity of the Holy Spirit as thus seen would be to bring about what we get in this verse; that although the saints had lain among the sheepfolds, they should be as "wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with green gold".<a name=74:3></a> That is the end reached; in other words, the believer is brought by the operation of the Holy Spirit in him to conformity with Christ.<a name=74:4></a> You should be as the wings of a dove, only covered with silver.<a name=74:5></a> The dove which came upon our Lord did not need that.<a name=74:6></a> We are not told what the wings are like or the plumage.<a name=74:7></a> It could add nothing to Christ in these respects, for all divine beauty was embodied in Him.<a name=74:8></a> The Holy Spirit came and abode upon Him; that is, there was a divine resting-place there.<a name=74:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jerusalem in Scripture nearly always sets forth the truth of the assembly in actual expression among the saints, not in the abstract thought of it, which is more Zion, but in actual expression among the saints, and that was in enemy hands.<a name=90:3></a> A king of the Amorites was king of Jerusalem and it was a question of the people of God coming into their inheritance.<a name=90:4></a> They went to battle and the people themselves effected a great deal, and then, in addition to what the people effected, God effected a great deal.<a name=90:5></a> He cast down hailstones from heaven so that there was a complete victory gained by this two-fold means: what the people themselves did, how they slew the enemies, and then what God Himself did from heaven, casting down hailstones upon them.<a name=90:6></a>

		It is a question of appealing, so to speak, that the full shining of Christ should be brought to bear powerfully upon the saints.<a name=91:9></a> "Arise, shine!<a name=91:10></a> for thy light is come" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60:1">Isaiah  60:1</a>).<a name=91:11></a> The apostle says, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a>).<a name=91:12></a> It is a question of prayer that calls upon God to cause the light of Christ and all that it means to shine powerfully upon the present situation, that the saints should be brought into their inheritance.<a name=91:13></a>

		So Paul, in the epistle to the Ephesians, doubtless feeling that it was beyond even his ability to set out at great length what the thoughts of God were, and indeed if there were any attempt to define them it would but limit them, whereas in fact, they are illimitable, just sets out enough to convey the mind of God in outline and to incite interest in it on our part, and then he prays.<a name=92:1></a> He tells us in chapter 1 at great length what he prays, and in chapter 3 he prays again, that the Father would strengthen us with might by His, the Father's, Spirit "in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith in your hearts" (verse 17).<a name=92:2></a> It is as though he is crying to the Father that He would cause the Christ to shine, and to shine unchallenged upon the hearts of the saints.<a name=92:3></a> That is what Paul does, he prays, he bows his knees.<a name=92:4></a>

		Now Joseph reached, in due course, the glory of which he had testified; he may have been the greatest man of his time; he was in a peculiar position, second to none but Pharaoh; he had everything at his disposal; the administration of Egypt was committed to him, and his brethren had to come down and bow themselves to him.<a name=118:10></a> They did not at first know him, but eventually he makes himself known to them, and he sends by them to his father the tidings of his glory in Egypt.<a name=118:11></a> That is now my point.<a name=118:12></a> Then his father was to come to him in Egypt, for that was the object of Joseph sending; and if Jacob had not come down to Joseph in Egypt, he would have come to want (verse 11).<a name=118:13></a> Joseph was urgent in the matter; he lays

		Joseph is, no doubt, in a great deal of his history, figurative of Christ; he is spoken of in that way in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>.<a name=119:3></a> We see him there as the deliverer of his brethren, though first rejected of them; he is, like Moses, a figure of the Deliverer of God's people.<a name=119:4></a> But I do not see in what is before us that Joseph was quite a figure of Christ, though you get certain points which illustrate the position and activity of Christ at the present moment.<a name=119:5></a>

		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>Christ speaks of going to the greatest place -- the place of supreme honour and glory; and He would send down here a testimony to His glory; when He goes His way to Him that sent Him, He sends down the Holy Spirit.<a name=119:6></a> The Lord says to them, "It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:7">John  16:7</a>).<a name=119:7></a> He speaks of the coming of the Comforter, and of what the Comforter will do: "he receives of mine and shall announce it to you" (verse 15) -- He was to bear witness to the disciples of the glory of Christ, so that their hearts might be attracted to Him.<a name=119:8></a> They were to reach Him in that sense; if they did not act on the testimony that came to them, the effect would be that they would come to spiritual poverty.<a name=119:9></a> So in regard to the present day: if Christians do not act on the testimony that has come down to them, they come to

		All this is much like Joseph in the land of Egypt, hidden from his brethren, in a position of great honour and glory.<a name=120:7></a> And what led Joseph to send word of his glory to his father was that he had strong affection for his father.<a name=120:8></a> I think he had affection too for his brethren, badly as they had treated him; but he had been the favourite son of his father, and loved his father.<a name=120:9></a> I do not think Joseph sent to his father simply to preserve his life from famine and death, but he had pleasure in the thought of the company of the one he loved; and that is the difference between love and philanthropy.<a name=120:10></a> A philanthropist does not necessarily care for the company of those he ministers to; a millionaire may give much to benefit man, but the evidence of love is that it delights in the company of those upon whom it showers favour.<a name=120:11></a>

		"Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead.<a name=123:11></a> There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him.<a name=123:12></a> Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment".<a name=123:13></a>

		All three go to make up the christian character, and all three should be exhibited in every christian assembly.<a name=124:1></a> We consider it a very great moral mistake to set any one of these features in opposition to the others, inasmuch as each, in its proper place, is lovely; and, we may add, each should find its place in all.<a name=124:2></a> We should all of us know what it is to sit at table with our blessed Lord, in sweet communion.<a name=124:3></a> This will most assuredly lead to profound homage and adoration; and we may rest assured that, where there is the communion and the worship, there will not be lacking the loving activities of true service.<a name=124:4></a>

		The reader will observe that, in the above beautiful scene, there is no record of any collision between Martha and Mary.<a name=124:5></a> Each had her place to fill.<a name=124:6></a> There was room for both.<a name=124:7></a> "Jesus loved Martha and her sister" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:5">John  11:5</a>).<a name=124:8></a> In verse 1, we read of "Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister".<a name=124:9></a> Here, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, Martha is put first.<a name=124:10></a> Looked at from a divine standpoint, there is no need why anyone should in the smallest degree collide with another.<a name=124:11></a> And further, we may add, there is no necessity whatever for comparing the sphere of one with that of another.<a name=124:12></a> If Christ be our one absorbing Object, there will be lovely harmony in action, though our line of things may vary.<a name=124:13></a>

		Is not all this conveyed to us in that one sentence, "There therefore <i>they</i> made him a supper"?<a name=125:5></a> It was not one more than another.<a name=125:6></a> All had part in the precious privilege of making a supper for the one peerless Object of their heart's affections; and, having Him in their midst, each fell naturally, simply, and effectively, into his and her proper place.<a name=125:7></a> Provided the beloved Master's heart was refreshed, it mattered not who did this, or who did that.<a name=125:8></a> Christ was the Centre and each moved round Him.<a name=125:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is uncommonly fine.<a name=126:6></a> The blessed apostle presents in this exquisite passage a true sample of self-forgetting devotedness.<a name=126:7></a> He expresses Himself as ready to be poured out as a drink-offering upon the sacrifice and service of his beloved Philippians, utterly regardless of himself.<a name=126:8></a> It mattered not to him who contributed the component parts of the sacrifice, provided only that the sacrifice was presented as a sweet odour to Christ.<a name=126:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought we might find encouragement in considering the scripture we have just read.<a name=161:1></a> We need to take account of the setting of Scripture.<a name=161:2></a> I think the epistle to the Ephesians has its own peculiar character.<a name=161:3></a> In this epistle we find ourselves in the presence of perhaps the largest scope of divine things found in any epistle in the New Testament, both with regard to Christ personally and with regard to the assembly -- the church, His body.<a name=161:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While the heavenly side of things is prominent and emphasised in the beginning of the epistle, the scope of it cannot be limited even to heaven.<a name=161:5></a> Nothing less than the universe is in view in it, and I believe it is a matter of great moment that we should be able in some measure to take account of the largeness of it.<a name=161:6></a> I have no doubt we all suffer more or less from smallness.<a name=161:7></a> If we take sober account of ourselves in the presence of God, we are obliged to admit that we are very small.<a name=161:8></a> We never can become great in ourselves.<a name=161:9></a> The only possible way of becoming in any sense great is to be occupied with God's great things.<a name=161:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our time would not permit us to go into much detail with regard to the body of the epistle, but we can readily see that we find ourselves, in the very opening of it, in the presence of the counsels, or purposes, of God.<a name=161:11></a> Indeed, so far as the saints are concerned, the highest note is struck.<a name=161:12></a> "Blessed be the

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to our Lord Jesus Christ, this epistle views Him distinctly as Man.<a name=162:10></a> I do not think you could find one single statement in it that speaks of Him as a divine Person.<a name=162:11></a> He is a divine Person.<a name=162:12></a> He is always and everywhere a divine Person, but Ephesians views Him distinctively as Man.<a name=162:13></a> The first sight of it will speak to us as to this in a very simple way -- He is viewed as having been dead.<a name=162:14></a> We are not told about His death or the manner of it; but as having been dead, He is raised up and seated in the heavenlies (chapter 1: 20), and in connection with His being raised up and seated we have the most wonderful expression of the power of God to be found in Scripture.<a name=162:15></a> It far exceeds creation -- it is the climax of the power of God.<a name=162:16></a> He is raised up and He is seated, and the Spirit of God labours to set forth the greatness of

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=164:9></a> This epistle is not much occupied with that; it is more occupied with what is to come out in the assembly by-and-by.<a name=164:10></a> So, if we are quickened together and raised up together, and made to sit down together in the heavenlies, what is in view?<a name=164:11></a> "That he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus" (chapter 2: 7).<a name=164:12></a> I think that Colossians gives us more what is to come out in the saints now, not in the way of testimony exactly, but what is to come out in the saints <i>now</i> for the satisfaction of the heart of God.<a name=164:13></a>

		I wondered, dear brethren, if we might consider some of the resources that are available to help us in spiritual discernment.<a name=171:2></a> Paul says, "<i>we</i> have received .<a name=171:3></a>.<a name=171:4></a>.<a name=171:5></a> the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God", and he speaks of the things of the Spirit "being spiritually discerned" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:12">1 Corinthians  2:12</a>, 14).<a name=171:6></a> It is a great matter to prove the Spirit being with us to help us to discern.<a name=171:7></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>, the writer speaks of those who failed to get the blessing because of "not hearkening to the word" of God (verse 11).<a name=171:8></a> It says, "For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".<a name=171:9></a> Well, that is what God's word would do to each one of us.<a name=171:10></a> There is nothing hid from God, as the scripture says, "there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do".<a name=171:11></a>

		ONE OF THE PRAYERS OF CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		We read, and we believe, the marvellous fact that Christ intercedes for us, as a living Man in the presence of God (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:34">Romans  8:34</a>); but what things, we may reverently ask, does He seek for us?<a name=179:11></a> The object of this paper is to suggest one of these things, which will serve to illustrate the nature of His desires for us.<a name=179:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our Lord, when here on earth, was marked by prayer.<a name=179:13></a> It must be so.<a name=179:14></a> Not only did He pray on specific occasions, for example, the seven recorded in the gospel of Luke, but His whole life here was summed up in such a word as, "Behold, I come .<a name=179:15></a>.<a name=179:16></a>.<a name=179:17></a> to do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and

		thy law is within my heart" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:7">Psalm  40:7</a>, 8).<a name=180:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When He left the earth He did not cease to intercede.<a name=180:2></a> True, He was no longer Himself in conditions of need, but He still interceded for His disciples who were; indeed, it is only as exalted that He fully takes up His intercessory activity as High Priest in the presence of God for us (see <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a> - 8: 2).<a name=180:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He assumed that His disciples would take for granted that He would continue to speak to God for them: "In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you, for the Father himself has affection for you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:26">John  16:26</a>, 27).<a name=180:4></a> The Spirit, that great Gift, was given at His request: "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>).<a name=180:5></a> The primary expression of life itself, in a man, is, properly, prayer to God; and of Christ we read, generally, that "in that he lives, he lives to God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:10">Romans  6:10</a>), and specifically, as our High Priest, that He ever liveth to make intercession for them that come unto God by him (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a>).<a name=180:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The intercession of Christ is strikingly introduced in the middle of the challenges thrown out by Paul in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:31">Romans  8:31</a> - 39: "What shall we then say to these things?<a name=180:7></a> .<a name=180:8></a>.<a name=180:9></a>.<a name=180:10></a> Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect?<a name=180:11></a> .<a name=180:12></a>.<a name=180:13></a>.<a name=180:14></a> who is he that condemns?<a name=180:15></a> It is Christ who has died, but rather has been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God".<a name=180:16></a> We might have thought that was the climax; but no, there is, shall we say, an unexpected addition to these words of strong assurance: "<i>who also</i>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=181>[Page 181]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>intercedes for us</i>".<a name=181:1></a> The chorus of triumph which fills these verses seems to pause for a moment while this softer, this more intimate note is struck, and we are not surprised that it is immediately followed by the question: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=181:2></a>" His intercession for us implies strong desire, which is inseparable from His love; just as, in the breastplate, Aaron bore on his heart before Jehovah the names of His people (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:29">Exodus  28:29</a>).<a name=181:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if Christ intercedes for us now, what sort of desires find their expression therein?<a name=181:4></a> We can learn something about this from the desires He expressed for His disciples in the days of His life here.<a name=181:5></a> Let us look at one example.<a name=181:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift you as wheat; but <i>I</i> have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and <i>thou</i>, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:31">Luke  22:31</a>, 32).<a name=181:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Even to Peter himself and the other disciples the outlook at the moment was dark; they were conscious of impending calamity.<a name=181:8></a> But the full trial -- the power of Satan, the hostility of the world, and, worst of all, their own inability to stand up to it -- these were only known to Jesus Himself, and in the full knowledge of it all He could pray for Peter in particular that his faith might be brought through it.<a name=181:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is at the corresponding point in the fourth gospel that the Lord, after warning Peter of his approaching failure, continues, "Let not your heart be troubled; <i>ye believe in God, believe also on me</i>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"That thy faith fail not".<a name=182:2></a> Do we not often, in our weakness, in smaller trials than Peter's, feel the need that our faith should be sustained in strength and joy?<a name=182:3></a> In all kinds of ways the Lord's people are under pressure from those trials which are merely personal, and affect us as they affect all men, to those more honourable afflictions which are immediately associated with the interests of Christ.<a name=182:4></a> How easily the question arises in our hearts, How can God love me and be supporting me if He allows this pain of body, this trial in my surroundings, natural or spiritual, to happen to me, and to remain with me?<a name=182:5></a> And we want to get rid of the affliction, forgetting that it is exactly by it, and through it, that we can glorify God, and glorify Him in the sheer fact of going through it with Him, and having our faith in Him sustained and strengthened through it all.<a name=182:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"That thy faith fail not".<a name=182:7></a> Does it seem a small thing to pray for?<a name=182:8></a> The Lord did not think so; and doubtless Peter had these words of the Lord in his mind when, many years after, he wrote in his epistle: "that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:7">1 Peter  1:7</a>).<a name=182:9></a> Not merely "your faith", but the very trial of it is precious.<a name=182:10></a>

		"That thy faith fail not".<a name=183:6></a> Abraham "<i>found strength</i> in faith, giving glory to God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:20">Romans  4:20</a>).<a name=183:7></a> But it is through the sense of weakness that the strength of faith is reached and maintained.<a name=183:8></a> We see this in the strongest men.<a name=183:9></a> Moses, the leader of a host of six hundred thousand men of war, seemed (to himself) to be allotted an impossible task in dealing with their apathy, their murmurings, their rebellion.<a name=183:10></a> His only resource was to spread out everything before God.<a name=183:11></a>

		We were speaking this afternoon, dear brethren, of Joseph in relation to his brethren, and all the feelings which were found with Joseph.<a name=193:2></a> I have read these scriptures as indicating, I believe, something of the feelings of Christ in regard of the saints of the assembly as finding expression through Paul, because every right feeling in regard of the saints has been derived from Christ.<a name=193:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>we have, in Aaron clothed with the garments of glory and beauty, a type of Christ in His present position and service on high as personally sustaining the whole service of God in the assembly down here on earth.<a name=193:4></a> If you will remember, on the skirts of the cloak of the high priest were pomegranates and bells (verses 33, 34), the pomegranates being very suggestive of the local assemblies, each pomegranate being complete in itself and yet each setting out the idea of unity in itself.<a name=193:5></a> Then along with the pomegranates, suggestive of the local companies in their unity and fruitfulness under the eye of God, there were golden bells, suggesting that there is not only what is for the pleasure of God in the local companies, but also there is to be testimony, the bells undoubtedly referring to that.<a name=193:6></a> Paul says in 1 Thessalonians, "the word of the Lord sounded out from you" (chapter 1: 8).<a name=193:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remarkable thing is that all these are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=194>[Page 194]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		presented as on the skirts of the cloak of the high priest; that is, they are all sustained and supported by the high priest personally.<a name=194:1></a> When you begin to think of what there is in the world today of true assembly character in all but one, at any rate, of the continents, you can understand how immense is the service of Christ in sustaining that for the pleasure of God day in and day out, and I might say night in and night out, for "he that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:4">Psalm  121:4</a>).<a name=194:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing to be remembered is that it is supported feelingly, for the people of God were carried on the high priest's shoulders according to their birth (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:7">Exodus  28:7</a> - 12), referring, I believe, to what the Lord Jesus is doing as interceding for every one of us individually at the present time.<a name=194:3></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:34">Romans  8:34</a> states that and adds, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=194:4></a> tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?<a name=194:5></a>" (verse 35).<a name=194:6></a>

		All finds its answer in the intercession which Christ is carrying on at the present time, and not only so, but the names of the children of Israel were borne in four rows of three on the breastplate of the High Priest (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:17">Exodus  28:17</a> - 20), the breastplate of judgment, and the four rows of three undoubtedly allude to the four camps of three tribes each in which the people of God were set around the tabernacle; that is, it refers to the saints as committed publicly to the testimony of God in their various local settings -- tribal settings, using the type -- and in that setting also, not merely in the individual needs

	<div class="paragraph">
		and pressures and testings of the saints, but in connection with the exercises which they have as seeking to move together in their respective localities, the saints are being borne up before God by the Lord Jesus continually on the breastplate of judgment, meaning that He has a perfect judgment as to the conditions that exist in every locality.<a name=195:1></a> He has a perfect knowledge of them, and a perfect judgment as to them; a judgment as to what is the cause of anything that is lacking or unsatisfactory; a judgment as to what is the need in each locality.<a name=195:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to have a sense that Christ is caring for the saints, but caring for them, if I may venture to use the expression, feelingly and intelligently; that is, caring for them in relation to what the thoughts of God concerning them are, and having no less desire than that there should be a complete answer to those thoughts amongst the saints.<a name=195:3></a> We see that in Epaphras in Colossians.<a name=195:4></a> He had learned from Christ, for he continued urgently in prayer that the saints at Colosse should "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (chapter 4: 12).<a name=195:5></a> He was not content with half measures; however far they might have attained, he wanted them to go still further, and we may rest assured, dear brethren, as knowing something of the Lord Jesus, as knowing how characteristically He is devoted to the will of God, that He will not rest content until a perfect answer to God's thoughts is found amongst His people.<a name=195:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have said that much by way of introduction, but also to impress us with this thought of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=196>[Page 196]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		feelings of Christ, and how those feelings will find expression and reproduction in those who are near to Him.<a name=196:1></a> That is particularly seen in Paul, for I have no doubt Paul stands out head and shoulders above anyone else in this matter of feeling for the saints.<a name=196:2></a> He says in 2 Corinthians, "the crowd of cares pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies" (chapter 11: 28), and at the same time it was not limited to the state of the assemblies, but his interest in the saints was individual as well; so he says further, "Who is stumbled, and I burn not?<a name=196:3></a>" If he heard of one stumbled soul, one young brother or sister it might be, who was stumbled, his heart burned at the thought of it, his spiritual indignation, so to speak, was awakened as he heard of even one soul amongst the saints being stumbled.<a name=196:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Paul could be marked by these feelings, there is no reason why we should not be also, in our measure.<a name=196:5></a> I do not think it was exactly apostolic, although no doubt his position as apostle largely contributed to it, but feelings of this kind are not a matter of gift, they are a matter of being near to the Lord, and of getting an impression in nearness to Christ of what His own feelings are in regard of the saints.<a name=196:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle, as concluding his second letter to the Corinthians says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice".<a name=196:7></a> That is his final word to them.<a name=196:8></a> The Corinthian epistle, as we know, deals with the saints in their local settings as committed in the locality where they live to the testimony of God; whereas the Colossian saints are viewed in connection with
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=197>[Page 197]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heavenly truth, the universal setting of the assembly, and in both settings we get the apostle's feelings in regard of the saints coming out in these verses we have read.<a name=197:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to the Corinthians, Paul had addressed them in both epistles as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=197:2></a> Brethren will, I am sure, understand that in nothing I am saying am I assuming that the saints in this place, or anywhere else, moving together in the truth, claim to be the assembly of God, or can claim to be that.<a name=197:3></a> That would be presumption, because we represent only a fraction of the whole number of saints that there are, but in the mercy of God we have been delivered from captivity; for the church as a whole is in captivity to the world, but we are living in days in which God has wrought to deliver some of His people from captivity, and we are among those set free; that is our position.<a name=197:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just as in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, those who came up from captivity were enabled of God to build the house and to set up the service of God in it; and to build the wall and dedicate it with the gates proper to it, so in this our day those saints who have been set free from what is contrary to God, are in a position -- if they will go on with the Lord and with the Spirit, and govern themselves by the truth that relates to the assembly -- to enjoy every feature of the truth, although it be only in outward smallness and weakness.<a name=197:5></a> Therefore we may take up humbly the thoughts of God regarding the assembly; and, indeed, dear brethren, if we do not, we are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=198>[Page 198]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		unrighteous, for there is no other truth than the truth of the assembly that can possibly regulate saints going on together.<a name=198:1></a> It is a matter of positive righteousness as we seek to go on together to regulate ourselves by the light that governs the assembly.<a name=198:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said that, I return to what I was saying, that the apostle addressed both his epistles to the Corinthians to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=198:3></a> That is something to rejoice in, dear brethren.<a name=198:4></a> He says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice", the idea being that at Blenheim, or any place you like to name, where any saints are available as delivered from what is opposed to the truth, there should be in that place something that answers to the thought of God's assembly.<a name=198:5></a> There should be a company in the place which the Lord claims as His own, "my assembly" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>), and which He is prepared to sustain, provided the conditions necessary are there; and in spite of all the evil that is around, in the very presence of it, that there should be what is available under the hand of Christ to maintain the service of God for His pleasure, and to maintain in the midst of the evil around a true light as to God, light as to His holiness and faithfulness, in unity amongst ourselves, and with the ability to deal with evil, if it should show itself, in a way according to God.<a name=198:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things are features of glory, things that properly belong to the assembly of God, and it is a matter to rejoice in, dear brethren, that it is open to us to have our part in these great things.<a name=198:7></a> The time for it will soon be gone, the opportunity will soon be

		past.<a name=199:1></a> The days of our receiving up are near, and therefore the urgent need that we should all be of one mind, to provide under the hand of the Lord the conditions in which He can maintain the service of God and a true testimony to His name.<a name=199:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice".<a name=199:3></a> In each epistle he had linked a brother with himself -- Sosthenes in the first epistle, and Timotheus in the second -- in each case calling him "the brother".<a name=199:4></a> That is, these two elements are always necessary if there is to be a prosperous condition of things in a local company.<a name=199:5></a> There must be what is authoritative on the one hand, not in the assertion of authority on the part of one not having it, but authoritative in the sense of the apostle's doctrine, and what is brotherly on the other.<a name=199:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace".<a name=199:7></a> There is only one mind that is properly characteristic of the assembly, dear brethren.<a name=199:8></a> The apostle develops it in Philippians.<a name=199:9></a> He presents it in a most exalted form in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>, saying, "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men" (verses 5 - 7).<a name=199:10></a> No reputation!<a name=199:11></a> A bondman's form!<a name=199:12></a> What a mind to shine out in One who is God, yet did not claim for Himself the glory and dignity proper to Deity, but took a bondman's form.<a name=199:13></a> It is possible that this mind should be in us.<a name=199:14></a>

		You will remember how Abigail was attracted by the light of God's anointed as found here in wilderness conditions, and how David sent a message to her that he wished her to become his wife (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25">1 Samuel  25</a>).<a name=200:1></a> That is exactly what the Lord would say to us.<a name=200:2></a> He is here in testimony in His people in wilderness conditions and He wants His assembly to be thoroughly united to Him in one mind and one thought; and Abigail said, "Let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord" (verse 41).<a name=200:3></a> She was, so to speak, of one mind with Christ who took a bondman's form.<a name=200:4></a> She says, 'All I want, my greatest aspiration, is to be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord'.<a name=200:5></a> That is the spirit in which things will prosper in any local company.<a name=200:6></a> How that will develop mutuality, and affection, and consideration for one another, just one or two moving in that spirit, with no other thought before them.<a name=200:7></a> And so she became united to David.<a name=200:8></a> So the apostle says, "be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you".<a name=200:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "Salute one another".<a name=200:10></a> He is concerned about mutual feelings among the brethren.<a name=200:11></a> "Salute one another with a holy kiss".<a name=200:12></a> It is a salutation that is to be holy.<a name=200:13></a> One is not suggesting that it be taken up literally in an actual kiss, but whatever form the greeting may take, whether kiss or handshake, greet one another with it in holiness.<a name=200:14></a> Let love be expressed in the salutation.<a name=200:15></a> "Salute one another with a holy kiss.<a name=200:16></a> All the saints salute you", that is, the saints at the place from which he was writing.<a name=200:17></a>

		Then Lot is captured, and Abram goes to rescue him.<a name=206:5></a> Lot had no claim upon Abram.<a name=206:6></a> In choosing the well-watered plain of Jordan, Lot had treated him in a most unbrotherly way.<a name=206:7></a> Like Demas he had loved this present evil world (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:10">2 Timothy  4:10</a>).<a name=206:8></a> But Abram dwelt by the oaks of Mamre.<a name=206:9></a> He was not, as it were, in the world; he settled by stable things, things that abide.<a name=206:10></a> And he was Abram the Hebrew, the separate man.<a name=206:11></a> As sure as we put on the initial idea of the brother we shall be found dwelling by stable things.<a name=206:12></a> We "receiving a kingdom not to be shaken" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:28">Hebrews  12:28</a>).<a name=206:13></a> Abram lived in relation to that, and had three hundred and eighteen trained servants born in his house at his command.<a name=206:14></a> What headway, what progress, he made!<a name=206:15></a>

		These scriptures speak of the Lord Jesus as sitting: "sitting at the right hand of God", sitting "as a refiner and purifier of silver" and "sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven".<a name=225:2></a> It is wonderful to think of the Lord Jesus sitting.<a name=225:3></a> When He was with His own down here He went up into the mountain, as recorded in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>, "and having sat down .<a name=225:4></a>.<a name=225:5></a>.<a name=225:6></a> and, having opened his mouth, he taught them" (verse 2).<a name=225:7></a> It was His delight to be found sitting in the circle of His own, serving them and bringing out the great truths of God which He had come to announce.<a name=225:8></a> But when His work was done, then He could sit above: "Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110:1">Psalm  110:1</a>).<a name=225:9></a>

		Then he says, "Aristarchus my fellow-captive".<a name=237:5></a> That is another commendation, suffering for the truth's sake with Paul.<a name=237:6></a> That is a great commendation.<a name=237:7></a> "And Mark, Barnabas's cousin, concerning whom ye have received orders, (if he come to you, receive him)".<a name=237:8></a> He is an evidence of recovering grace.<a name=237:9></a> Onesimus is expressive of the grace in the gospel to pick up an unlikely person and set him amongst the brethren, making him a faithful and beloved brother.<a name=237:10></a> Now, Mark, sister's son to Barnabas, is evidence of recovering grace.<a name=237:11></a> "(If he come to you, receive him,) and Jesus called Justus .<a name=237:12></a>.<a name=237:13></a>.<a name=237:14></a> These are the only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me".<a name=237:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be that there are plenty of people we know who have no light in their souls as to Christ, and no appreciation of Him.<a name=238:6></a> How is it then that we have?<a name=238:7></a> Simply because God has operated sovereignly, and thus we can take account of ourselves as blessed, and rejoice in it.<a name=238:8></a> Why has He done it?<a name=238:9></a> After the Lord said that to Peter, He said, "<i>I</i> also, I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter".<a name=238:10></a> That is to say, You are a stone.<a name=238:11></a> God has not wrought in you in order that you should fritter your time away in the transient things of this life, but that you should fulfil your responsibility in relation to the assembly.<a name=238:12></a> That is what the Lord said to Peter, and that is what every one is to understand, that the sole reason we are here is to fill out our place in the assembly of God.<a name=238:13></a>

		Then he brings in Luke: "Luke, the beloved physician, salutes you".<a name=240:4></a> He is one whose influence would be healing, binding, a comforting influence, a brother who always kept himself out of sight, always in the background, content to be one of the 'we' that we hear of in Acts; hiding himself behind Paul and his company, but going along with Paul and supporting him to the last, as it says in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>, "Luke alone is with me".<a name=240:5></a> He goes right through with Paul to the very end.<a name=240:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Luke, the beloved physician", Paul says, "salutes you, and Demas".<a name=240:7></a> It is most sorrowful the way he says, "and Demas".<a name=240:8></a> He has nothing to say about him.<a name=240:9></a> Not long afterwards he writes about Demas and says, "Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:10">2 Timothy  4:10</a>).<a name=240:10></a> Paul had to say that not long after he wrote this epistle.<a name=240:11></a> Here, we might safely say, Paul was sensing something of that sort, and so he says, "and Demas".<a name=240:12></a> He wanted to be included in the salutation and Paul includes him, but says nothing about him.<a name=240:13></a> It would be with sorrowful feelings that Paul added, "and Demas".<a name=240:14></a> There are sensibilities amongst the saints -- "the spiritual discerns all things, and <i>he</i> is discerned of no one" (<a href="../bible/1 Corinthians.htm#2:15">1 Corinthians  2:15</a>).<a name=240:15></a> You can almost sense the feeling of sorrow that the apostle Paul had as he just said, "and Demas".<a name=240:16></a>

		"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul.<a name=241:11></a> Remember my bonds".<a name=241:12></a> There is this touching appeal for sympathy and affection on the part of the saints with Paul, and all that he stands for -- he stands for the truth of the assembly in relation to Christ and in relation to God, and all that enters into it.<a name=241:13></a> Paul stands for that, and he wants us to be thoroughly sympathetic with the heavenly truth that he ministered.<a name=241:14></a>

		Well now, passing on to the incident in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7">Mark  7</a>, the man that was deaf and speechless, you will notice that it is said that he came from the coasts of Decapolis, which means 'ten cities', and I suppose may refer in Mark's gospel to the actual condition of the professing element on earth, which in a formal way carried on the work of teaching and feeding.<a name=242:5></a> The man was deaf, and he could not speak right; I suppose meaning that he was unable to articulate; his utterances were a confusion of unintelligent sounds.<a name=242:6></a> And they bring this man to the Lord, and He took him aside out of the crowd, showing how the Lord reaches an individual in the great professing mass.<a name=242:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to understand that you have the preciousness of the Lord's sympathy in sorrow.<a name=245:9></a> It is not that He feels <i>for</i> you, He does that; but He does infinitely more, He feels <i>with</i> you.<a name=245:10></a> "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus" (verse 5).<a name=245:11></a> And He spoke beautifully of him; "<i>our</i> friend" (verse 11), not your friend, not mine, but our friend Lazarus.<a name=245:12></a> The Lord felt this bereavement, and the depth of His feelings was shown in His tears truly, but what is stated by the Spirit of God, as showing us what was in His heart, is that He groaned and shuddered.<a name=245:13></a> Such is the intensity of the Lord's feelings, and we should in our measure have these feelings for His bereaved and sorrowing people.<a name=245:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With <i>the second class</i> of preachers, <i>the main point is pressing on their hearers the forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ</i>.<a name=251:3></a> These know justification -- they preach Christ risen as the receipt for the debt paid -- that He was "delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>).<a name=251:4></a> Many of their converts, being justified by faith and having received the Spirit, have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=251:5></a> They rightly press the work of God's grace, that it is all His own work.<a name=251:6></a> This is objective truth, and most important in its place.<a name=251:7></a> It is what we must begin with, but many do not get beyond it, and if they do not, they do not enjoy the deliverance which the Spirit of God would effect in their souls if they truly sought it.<a name=251:8></a>

		What is to be noted here is Satan's power in a combination which interferes with the right of legitimate journeying.<a name=258:2></a> Satan would thus challenge the rights of God.<a name=258:3></a> God had sent His servants, who were ill-treated and slain, and finally He sent His Son, and Him the husbandmen killed.<a name=258:4></a> This terrible deed was committed at Jerusalem.<a name=258:5></a> When on His way to that city a Samaritan village refused Him.<a name=258:6></a> It is said, "they did not receive him" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:53">Luke  9:53</a>), but that is not a question of danger: it may denote hatred, but a non-reception is not in itself an attitude of violence.<a name=258:7></a> The violence was at Jerusalem; Satan had power there and so it had slain the prophets and finally it slew the Lord Jesus.<a name=258:8></a> Paul says of them, "who have both slain the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have driven us out by persecution" (<a href="../bible/1 Thessalonians.htm#2:15">1 Thessalonians  2:15</a>).<a name=258:9></a>

		This is all through the sovereign goodness of God to you, when you appropriate it in faith; He has accepted you in the Beloved.<a name=279:3></a> But now you have to learn that not only has God removed everything from His own eye, but by the power of His Spirit He delivers you from the old man, and that you are in Christ, and that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" makes you "free from the law of sin and of death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>).<a name=279:4></a> You have begun life in Christ, and you can say, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, <i>I</i>, but Christ lives in me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=279:5></a> If you are established in this grace you know that Christ is formed in you, and you are then ready to apprehend the great range of His grace for you.<a name=279:6></a> Except as you are free of the old man, you are not in the life of Christ, and never could know Him now as the living Stone, nor as Head, nor realise your union with Him in heaven.<a name=279:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In our own day when God vouchsafed to give a restoration of the knowledge of His full purpose in grace, it was seen that the first part, the certainty of our salvation, was to be appropriated by faith, which is blessedly true; it was apprehended that God in His grace transferred a believer from Adam to Christ.<a name=280:2></a> But subsequently it was taught, and insisted on, that not only the first part, but all the purpose of His grace for us, could be appropriated and realised by faith, which is an imperfect apprehension of the truth.<a name=280:3></a> The truth is that our salvation must be appropriated by faith, but as the believer is on new ground in Christ, it is only by the Holy Spirit that we can appropriate and enjoy the range of God's purpose and grow up to the Head; the Spirit only can lead us into it.<a name=280:4></a> Thus, by the craft of the enemy, the great goodness of God to us in this latter day has been in a great measure lost sight of, and some are asserting that they know all the purpose of God in grace without having the great blessing which would result from being practically in each step.<a name=280:5></a> Surely this is enough to make the Lord's warning very emphatic to us in this day, "Take heed .<a name=280:6></a>.<a name=280:7></a>.<a name=280:8></a> how ye hear" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:18">Luke  8:18</a>).<a name=280:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I press the great contrast between the two latter classes.<a name=280:10></a> They both begin aright.<a name=280:11></a> They believe that the whole range of God's purpose is to be first apprehended by faith, and that the first step, our salvation, is appropriated by faith; that salvation

		is that God in His grace transfers the believer from Adam to Christ; but the former class do not see that all the rest of the purpose of God is only known as you are in Christ by the Spirit of God.<a name=281:1></a> Their mistake is that they think that because salvation is appropriated by faith, all the other parts of His grace can be likewise appropriated.<a name=281:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For example, they assert that you get deliverance by the reckoning of faith, and do not see that you start on new ground, and therefore that your deliverance can only be in the life of Christ, and if you do not take the first step you cannot enjoy any of the rest.<a name=281:3></a> Hence while those who say that all can be appropriated by faith are zealous as to doctrine, they really are not in the power and blessing of what is true for them.<a name=281:4></a> They believe in separation to God for all the children of God, and they gather together in the name of Christ, looking for His presence, refusing human ministry, and are correct in detail according to the letter of the word, but they have not got it vitally, they have not really learned <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>; they have not crossed over to where Christ is, and they have not come to Him as the living Stone.<a name=281:5></a> They could not, because they are not practically in the life of Christ.<a name=281:6></a> They can speak clearly and interestingly of the Lord's presence in the assembly; of His being Head of the church and of our union with Him, but they are not in the enjoyment of this great position.<a name=281:7></a>

		God's intention is that all His children should be making contributions of a spiritual kind to His service; to the welfare of His assembly on earth; to the interests of Christ, and to the prosperity of the glad tidings.<a name=286:2></a> The understanding of this would preserve them from descending into a mere congregation, holding certain views and accustomed to meet in a particular building.<a name=286:3></a> It would lift them above all formal religiousness; for the holy service of God is to be supported by voluntary contributions, brought to God willingly and from the <i>heart</i>.<a name=286:4></a>

		The Scripture in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#35">Exodus  35</a>says: "<i>they came</i>"; that is a lovely expression!<a name=286:5></a> It is a wonderful joy to look out upon the children of God and say, "they came"!<a name=286:6></a> But they did not come empty-handed, or in a formal, religious manner, because it was a certain hour or a certain day: no, they came with their hearts moved, their minds occupied and their hands full!<a name=286:7></a> God requires that no one should appear before Him empty; the word "consecration" means 'with hands full' (cf.<a name=286:8></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8:28">Leviticus  8:28</a>, footnote <i>c</i>).<a name=286:9></a>

		The idea of a Christian accepting all the blessings of God and settling down in them without any spiritual movement in offering Godward, or any movement in compassion towards men, is entirely contrary to the thoughts of God.<a name=287:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We read of the Lord Jesus, who is presented to His followers as the great Example, that He "went through all quarters doing good" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>).<a name=287:2></a> He served God in lowly grace, bringing light, joy and blessing to men.<a name=287:3></a> Thus His disciples should be on this line of contributing -- first of all, what is due to God.<a name=287:4></a> That which is manward and for the benefit of the people of God is to have its place, but the great primary thought is that service must be first Godward, affording Him what is acceptable and for His joy -- rendering to Him adoration, praise and worship.<a name=287:5></a>

		We are destined to be for ever in the presence of God as worshippers; but even while here on earth, what an honour it is to bring something -- however small a contribution, according to our judgment -- which will give delight to the heart of God!<a name=287:6></a> Let us speak to Him of Jesus -- of His glories, His love, His Person, His work and His grace!<a name=287:7></a> We all have something we can bring, if there has been a work of God in our souls; some feature of Christ which has impressed us will furnish a basis to fill our hands with Christ, so that we may draw near to God.<a name=287:8></a>

		I believe it is characteristic of believers today to be together; the divine nature working in us causes us to gravitate towards one another, and it is a great and blessed matter that we should be together -- what a preservative for saints today!<a name=289:10></a> Satan is active to divert persons from being together to hear the Lord's word, but he will not triumph -- "hades' gates shall <i>not</i> prevail" against the assembly (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>).<a name=289:11></a> How comforting it is to know that.<a name=289:12></a> God will triumph in the end, and what should help us most, I believe, in these closing days, is this matter of gathering together.<a name=289:13></a>

		The thought for this occasion, dear brethren, is the matter of revival, or, according to the word in the New Testament, "the washing of regeneration and the <i>renewal</i> of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>), the word "renewal" signifying that the Spirit would bring about the feature of freshness in the saints.<a name=299:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		While we may have, in a certain sense, the same occasions over and over again, like the Lord's supper, yet what is to mark every occasion is the freshness of life, this being one of the ways in which the Spirit is supplied, so that an occasion may, while being repeated as to its general title, yet be thoroughly living and different as compared with any one that has gone before.<a name=299:3></a> It is a very encouraging matter to consider, because it was to be seen in the Lord Himself; it was He who through the prophet spoke of being wakened "morning by morning" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:4">Isaiah  50:4</a>); every one of His days was fresh under the blessed awakening hand of God.<a name=299:4></a> No day was stale, no day was exactly like the one that had preceded it.<a name=299:5></a>

		A brother may say he was too tired to pray, too weary to take part.<a name=300:4></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>is always encouraging in relation to weariness, for the Lord secured one of the finest vessels when He sat by the well "wearied with the way he had come"; it says, "as he was"!<a name=300:5></a> Many thoughts come into your mind as you think of this.<a name=300:6></a>

		The Lord in the epistle to the Hebrews is spoken of as the Mediator of a <i>new</i> covenant; it speaks of what is new, not merely different from everything that has gone before, but abidingly fresh (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a> 24 and footnote <i>c</i>).<a name=300:7></a> In our links with God we are to be kept fresh, and we never weary of them and God is ever new to us, because the Mediator is always new in His service -- fresh and beautiful!<a name=300:8></a> This is one of the integral parts of the system, the Mount Zion system to which we have come, beginning with Mount Zion and Jerusalem; we have come to the assembly and to God and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant.<a name=300:9></a> The Lord Jesus is on high, never weary, there we might say, 'the Keeper of Israel' (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:4">Psalm  121:4</a>, 5), and always ministering night and day fresh thoughts in regard of God.<a name=300:10></a>

		These are the things we have part in, dear brethren, and the present desire is that we might be reminded of this feature which belongs to us.<a name=301:5></a> It is to take hold of us individually and no circumstances are to make any difference; circumstances of limitation and pressure are to make no difference to this because of the Holy Spirit "<i>poured out</i>".<a name=301:6></a> How wonderful those words are, the washing of regeneration; that is to say, there is a new kind of age and epoch in view, and we are in the light of it, and then as having the Spirit poured out lavishly upon us, we are to be renewed every day.<a name=301:7></a> The spirit of this renewal permeates our scriptures.<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#40">Genesis  40</a>we have men in circumstances of pressure, of limitation, and while our circumstances may not involve very drastic limitation, yet such it is.<a name=301:9></a> It is described here as a prison and God has in a sense put all His people in it, for we cannot do what we like nowadays!<a name=301:10></a> We are not in this prison on account of bad behaviour; I am not thinking of that, but of the way God has of putting His people under limitation, because He has a purpose in it, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph came and looked upon these prisoners; they were sad, and he asked them the reason and he elicited from them that each had had a dream.<a name=302:2></a> That is, I believe, God had given each man in those circumstances, an impression.<a name=302:3></a> These dreams are from God.<a name=302:4></a> The dreams of Genesis, specially in connection with Joseph, are to be understood and interpreted according to divine impressions.<a name=302:5></a> And as Joseph enquires of the butler, he finds he is pondering his dream; he says, "In my dream, behold, a vine was before me".<a name=302:6></a> Typically, Christ was before him.<a name=302:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is perhaps a healthy question for us to ask whether during the several [wartime] years of limitation of various kinds, doors not opening where they used to, and the lack of liberty to do what we like, it may perhaps be asked, Have we received any impression from God in the matter?<a name=302:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cup-bearer says, "a vine was before me", and not only so, but it expands and grows, it develops, meaning that it is not merely some impression of Christ, but full fruit will come from it.<a name=302:9></a> So this man speaks of the buds and the blossoms and the fruit and the clusters of ripe grapes.<a name=302:10></a> And now see what an impression God would give to this man.<a name=302:11></a> He says, "And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand".<a name=302:12></a> There would not be anything more wonderfully fresh than

		that, that the grapes should yield at once something for the pleasure of God, for I doubt not that Pharaoh here represents God, and here is the man being reminded that even out of these circumstances God is going to be served, and served through what Christ brings in in impressions of His own Person as the Vine.<a name=303:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have no need to elaborate on that, save to ask for our pondering whether we have considered that in our circumstances of pressure, of tightening controls, we have received some impression of Christ.<a name=303:2></a> If so, that is hopeful, for it means that we shall begin now to have some part in ministering to God's pleasure.<a name=303:3></a> May I appeal to us all, dear brethren, as to this, for there are some who take no active part in the service of God -- may I just appeal that the result may be something for God on the principle of freshness.<a name=303:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no time here for the ordinary processes of winemaking, maturing and so on; the indications are of rapid growth and early full development; God is to get something <i>at once</i> and in the very circumstances where we are.<a name=303:5></a> The cup-bearer was free for God in the prison, and when Joseph interpreted the dream, he understood it.<a name=303:6></a> He understood that it was going to be a reality, and not just merely an idle tale, for in three days he <i>was</i> returned to Pharaoh and he <i>did</i> hand the cup into Pharaoh's hand.<a name=303:7></a> But one important thing he forgot -- that was about Joseph.<a name=303:8></a> We also are likely to forget Christ, it may be -- a sobering matter indeed -- but he did not

		Now we are led to enquire the difference between the butler and the baker.<a name=304:2></a> The baker says, seeing this was going so well, "I also was in my dream" (verse 16).<a name=304:3></a> How well we recognise this feature!<a name=304:4></a> <i>I</i> am in my dream; I can understand that God does not get anything!<a name=304:5></a> A man may be the centre of his dream, in his greatness or in his smallness, but if a man is in his own dream, then God gets nothing.<a name=304:6></a> The baker provided nothing and he lost his life.<a name=304:7></a> He lost spiritually.<a name=304:8></a> We may say the cupbearer represents the <i>heart</i> man, the baker the <i>head</i> man.<a name=304:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a word there for us, dear brethren, in relation to reviving spiritually so that we may give God what He has in mind.<a name=304:10></a> The idea of the cup goes right through into the Lord's supper and is a great thought.<a name=304:11></a> It means that persons are satisfied.<a name=304:12></a> It is called the cup of the Lord in the Lord's supper (<a href="../bible/1 Corinthians.htm#10:21">1 Corinthians  10:21</a>), and it is, amongst other things, to bring in this great feature of satisfaction, so that being engaged with such a portion we want nothing else.<a name=304:13></a> What we partake of in the liberty and joy of the love of Christ is to completely satisfy us.<a name=304:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this is but one portion of what belongs to this great subject.<a name=304:15></a> Some need recovery, and I am thinking of people who need recovery out of wrong links, wrong associations; I think of Ephraim.<a name=304:16></a> If you read through a certain part of the prophecy of Hosea you would say at one point, Ephraim is beyond recovery, for God said, "Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:17">Hosea  4:17</a>).<a name=304:17></a> And it has to be said

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet exhorts Ephraim in the last chapter of the prophecy, saying to His people, "Take with you words" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#14:2">Hosea  14:2</a>).<a name=305:5></a> I expect that is the difficulty with some, they cannot find the words that belong to repentance and recovery.<a name=305:6></a> "Take with you words".<a name=305:7></a> Ephraim will do it and have finished with idols.<a name=305:8></a> They are not now going to bring literal calves to offer to idols, but calves of their lips to God.<a name=305:9></a> Ephraim is a recovered man.<a name=305:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there anyone here who needs recovering in a special way?<a name=305:11></a> Bring with you words, acceptable words, to God, and bring the calves of your lips, "the fruit of the lips confessing his name" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:15">Hebrews  13:15</a>).<a name=305:12></a> What a marvellous recovery it is.<a name=305:13></a> Ephraim says, "What have I to do any more with idols" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#14">Hosea  14</a> 8).<a name=305:14></a> Ephraim is a recovered man when he says that.<a name=305:15></a> God says, "I answer him, and I will observe him".<a name=305:16></a> God is not finished with him.<a name=305:17></a> It is going on, for God does not take things for granted.<a name=305:18></a> God says, "I will observe him"; I will look at him, I will watch how he is getting on.<a name=305:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Ephraim speaks again, "I am like a green fir tree", in all the reality of revival in life before God.<a name=305:20></a> Then God has the last word: "From me is thy fruit found!<a name=305:21></a>" not from idols, but <i>from Me</i>!<a name=305:22></a> Do we

	<div class="paragraph">
		The green fir tree is there reminding us of the greenness and freshness of manhood in a recovered person, and there is nothing like it.<a name=306:3></a> They tell us that a broken bone, set properly and healed, is stronger than ever it was.<a name=306:4></a> What a word for a recovered person, to forsake his idols, to "Take words" and come to God.<a name=306:5></a> Such a person is possibly the freshest person in a locality, a mighty encouragement indeed.<a name=306:6></a>

		These two portions of scripture are well known as describing the way in which the grace of God has acted toward <i>us</i>.<a name=313:1></a> In chapter 10 it is the <i>inn</i>, the roadside inn -- the place for the stranger.<a name=313:2></a> In chapter 15 it is the place called <i>home</i> (Authorised Version).<a name=313:3></a> By these expressions the Lord indicates that He leaves us strangers where He was a Stranger, and He gives us to know as our home the place which is home to Him.<a name=313:4></a> Thus, though the character of the places be very different, both show us how perfectly identified we are with Him in the thoughts of God.<a name=313:5></a>

		The expression in chapter 10 gains force from what has gone before.<a name=313:6></a> The seventy disciples returned to Jesus full of joy, because even the devils were subject to them through His name.<a name=313:7></a> It was the display of divine power setting aside in a measure the power of Satan here upon earth.<a name=313:8></a> He speaks to them of the complete overthrow of Satan's power, and further, tells of power which He will give to enable them to tread unhurt the path of His will: "Yet", He adds, "in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rather rejoice, because your names are written in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:20">Luke  10:20</a>).<a name=313:9></a> It is at that moment that He rejoices in spirit, and, turning to His Father, the word comes from His lips which corresponds with the end of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>; He stands there, though rejected by men, as the One known of the Father, and knowing Him, and the Revealer of Him to whom He

		Then, at once, taking occasion by the question of the lawyer, He depicts in the most graphic way the ruin of the Jew, the most privileged man here upon earth.<a name=314:4></a> It was ruin which was irretrievable and hopeless as far as the earth was concerned.<a name=314:5></a> Nothing that had been set up on earth, even by the institution of God, could reach the need; the priest and Levite passed by.<a name=314:6></a> But when He speaks of "a certain Samaritan", we understand that He speaks of Himself; He hides Himself under this figure.<a name=314:7></a> He was a Stranger in virtue of the place from which He came, and man gave Him no place here.<a name=314:8></a>

		This stranger crosses the path of the needy traveller, coming not by chance, as did the priest and the Levite, but "journeying".<a name=314:9></a> We see how, in the deep compassion of His heart, He binds up the wounds, pouring in the oil and wine, and then, setting him on His own beast, He brings him to an inn and takes care of him.<a name=314:10></a> He not only meets the depth of his need, but, from the time of his complete ruin, up to the moment when he sees His face again, He fully provides for him.<a name=314:11></a> "Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt expend more, <i>I</i> will render to thee on my coming back".<a name=314:12></a> He puts him under the shelter of the roadside inn, and whatever his need may be, he is cared for at the sole expense of his Benefactor.<a name=314:13></a> We

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, further, it is not only that his need is met, but His own way of doing it attracts the heart to Himself.<a name=315:5></a> That peculiar touch, and the sight of the face of that heavenly Stranger, morally constitutes the one who has gazed upon it a stranger here on earth.<a name=315:6></a>

		In chapter 15, we have the fulness of His grace.<a name=315:10></a> The key to the chapter no doubt is in its beginning.<a name=315:11></a> The religious men of the day reproached Him, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them".<a name=315:12></a> It was perfectly true, so far as it went, but it was short of the truth.<a name=315:13></a> We should never expect a perfect exposition of the grace of God from its adversaries.<a name=315:14></a> They might see the grace and yet despise Him in whom it was expressed.<a name=315:15></a> He shows the full, blessed truth.<a name=315:16></a> He not only receives sinners, but He seeks

	<div class="paragraph">
		His far-reaching grace thus goes after that which is lost, "<i>until he find it</i>".<a name=316:4></a> But when found, to what place does He bring it?<a name=316:5></a> To that which is called "home"!<a name=316:6></a> "And when he cometh <i>home</i>" (Authorised Version).<a name=316:7></a> There is no setting it down until in the very place where He Himself abides.<a name=316:8></a> It is the place which is <i>home</i> to Him, where He ever rests in divine affections; to that place He brings the objects of His love.<a name=316:9></a> The latter part of the chapter continues the story in its own way; the Father's love, His kisses, the perfect fitness for His own house, which He bestows, and the soul set in all the deep eternal joy of the Father's presence.<a name=316:10></a>
