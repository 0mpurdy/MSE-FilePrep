		I desire, dear brethren, to speak of the Lord's personal interest in His witnesses.<a name=1:2></a> It is a very affecting word that He says to the apostles, "ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in Judaea .<a name=1:3></a>.<a name=1:4></a>.<a name=1:5></a>" Think of the Lord's interest in each one of them.<a name=1:6></a> It is a great thing to have a sense of that in our hearts and a desire to be more of a witness for Him in the present time amid increasing darkness and departure from the truths of Christianity publicly.<a name=1:7></a> What a privilege and an honour it is to be found faithful to the truth, and with the assurance in our hearts of the Lord's personal interest.<a name=1:8></a>

		The ascension of Christ is a very important matter.<a name=2:10></a> It says that He "was carried up into heaven" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:51">Luke  24:51</a>), and also "whom heaven indeed must receive" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:21">Acts  3:21</a>), and there He is in glory at this present moment.<a name=2:11></a> None can dislodge Him; He is there "crowned with glory and honour" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:9">Hebrews  2:9</a>).<a name=2:12></a>

		Now in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22">Acts  22</a>we see the Lord's interest in Paul personally.<a name=3:16></a> He was to be a witness.<a name=3:17></a> It is very interesting that Ananias should say to Paul that God "has chosen thee beforehand to .<a name=3:18></a>.<a name=3:19></a>.<a name=3:20></a> be a witness for him to all men" (verses 14, 15).<a name=3:21></a> What a wonderful thing it is to hear the voice of Christ speaking to you personally.<a name=3:22></a> This is what goes to make a convicted witness, one who is sure about things, who has heard the voice of the Son of God personally.<a name=3:23></a> Paul was to be one of the Lord's witnesses, yet he was one of the most unlikely persons.<a name=3:24></a> He gives a list of the things that he had been doing, imprisoning and persecuting the lovers of Christ.<a name=3:25></a> Yet the Lord said to Paul, Go, you are to serve and be a witness.<a name=3:26></a> Think of the way God took with the beloved apostle, and what a witness he was for Christ.<a name=3:27></a> "Be my imitators, even as

		<i>I</i> also am of Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:1">1 Corinthians  11:1</a>).<a name=4:1></a> Think of what was manifested in the apostle Paul.<a name=4:2></a> He, it seems, never saw Jesus on earth, but he heard His voice from heaven, and the light of that Man in glory blinded him: "I could not see, through the glory of that light".<a name=4:3></a> What did he need to be blinded about?<a name=4:4></a> -- the Jewish system that he had been connected with and which he was so devotedly serving, and which was being eclipsed by the glory of that light.<a name=4:5></a> What went on in Paul's mind in those days when he was blind, I do not know, but I am quite certain of this, it brought to an end in his heart all that he was in his supposed superior religiousness.<a name=4:6></a> And what was left was the glory of the One who had spoken to him from on high.<a name=4:7></a> How personal these links were for one who was a chosen witness.<a name=4:8></a>

		Ananias comes along in a most brotherly way and tells Paul, "the God of our fathers has chosen thee beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth; for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard".<a name=4:9></a> It was the Lord that had spoken to him, and Paul asks, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=4:10></a>" He was brought immediately under the control of the Lord.<a name=4:11></a> We cannot be witnesses for Him unless we recognise His lordship.<a name=4:12></a> He must have the supreme place.<a name=4:13></a> Our will needs to be subjected to Him.<a name=4:14></a> Paul was not only "to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth", but to "know his will".<a name=4:15></a> How quickly Paul came under the subduing influence of divine grace.<a name=4:16></a> He might have been smitten down in

		God's sovereignty is a remarkable thing.<a name=5:5></a> We are not just to drift through life with a little knowledge of Christianity, but rather as conscious that we have been sovereignly chosen by God for a purpose.<a name=5:6></a> Peter writes to those dispersed throughout Asia Minor, and he speaks of them as "elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>).<a name=5:7></a> God knew that they would be dispersed, and those that were dispersed were going through much suffering, but Peter refers to them as "elect".<a name=5:8></a> Heaven was interested in such a company, for it was known before time that they would be such.<a name=5:9></a> Is the Lord taken by surprise by the present situation in which we are?<a name=5:10></a> Not at all.<a name=5:11></a> He knows the whole history of the assembly from beginning to end.<a name=5:12></a> The Holy Spirit has come to maintain a witness right through to the coming of the Lord.<a name=5:13></a> I must take care lest I should die out of the testimony.<a name=5:14></a> That is the exercise that I would like to raise so that we might be encouraged to maintain what is due to the Lord in faithfulness right through to the end, with the assurance in our hearts of the Lord's personal interest in problems and difficulties that may confront us.<a name=5:15></a> Let us not lose heart.<a name=5:16></a> The Lord is very interested in every one who

		It is a great thing to understand that we have a city.<a name=13:3></a> It may be you do not attach importance to that, but every man of faith had a city before him.<a name=13:4></a> Abraham is the great model of faith in Scripture, and he looked for a city, and I think that what you get in him was what marked them all.<a name=13:5></a> Why did he look for a city?<a name=13:6></a> I believe that everybody in the world is dependent upon a city, and I think if you took away the cities you would find that most men had lost that which they require as their centre.<a name=13:7></a> It does not necessarily follow that you must live in a city to have one.<a name=13:8></a> Men as they are in the flesh are not self-supporting.<a name=13:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4">Genesis  4</a>you get the first mention of a city, and my belief is that the builder of that city felt that he was not.<a name=13:10></a> I refer to Cain.<a name=13:11></a> I think he felt, as banished from God, that he could not be self-supporting.<a name=13:12></a> He built a city, and called it after the name of his son.<a name=13:13></a> I think Cain's city may be taken to represent the cities of this world.<a name=13:14></a> It was built by a murderer, and would of necessity bear the marks of its founder.<a name=13:15></a> The world-city of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>bears Cain's character; our Lord was crucified there.<a name=13:16></a> It is spiritually called "Sodom and Egypt" (verse 8).<a name=13:17></a> Violence and corruption mark the cities of the world, and of course none of them is free.<a name=13:18></a> Do you think a murderer could build a free city?<a name=13:19></a> No murderer could be a free

		I wish to turn to Lot for a moment to explain my point that everybody is dependent upon a city.<a name=15:7></a> The gospel is that which produces the desire to take the path of faith.<a name=15:8></a> If the light of the gospel comes into your soul, it leads you to refuse and turn away from the present world, and if it has not done that for you, you have not rightly received it.<a name=15:9></a> The gospel is the light of another and completely new system, with a new centre entirely (Christ), a new city, and directly the light of that enters your soul, your course is altered.<a name=15:10></a> Now Lot had taken up that position.<a name=15:11></a> He was really one of the Lord's people.<a name=15:12></a> We are not told that he was called to forsake his country, and kindred, and his father's house, but he did it, and he did what was perfectly right.<a name=15:13></a> He took the path of faith; he went into the land of Canaan; he took up the heavenly position in company with Abraham.<a name=15:14></a> He did what was perfectly right, as I said, and it is what every man ought to do.<a name=15:15></a> He took up the ground of faith.<a name=15:16></a> Now faith is simply this: the gospel brings to

		But Sodom is to be destroyed, and it is when the time of the execution of the divine sentence against the city arrives we see demonstrated how intensely possessed Lot was with the idea of a city, and how much he depended on one.<a name=18:2></a> The angel says, "escape to the mountain".<a name=18:3></a> Lot replies: "Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is small: I pray thee, let me escape thither -- is it not small?<a name=18:4></a> -- and my soul shall live".<a name=18:5></a> He depended upon a city, no matter how small, so he fled to Zoar.<a name=18:6></a> He says, "my soul shall live"; but Abraham's soul had lived without a present city!<a name=18:7></a> He did not have a visible city great or small, neither did he possess a house, nor any outward support, and yet he was perfectly secure; he did not suffer any discomfort at all when the cities of the plain were destroyed.<a name=18:8></a>

		I do not know that I can say much about Abraham, but he stands out in wonderful contrast to Lot, who is a figure of the worldly Christian.<a name=18:9></a> See Abraham in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18">Genesis  18</a>.<a name=18:10></a> That chapter presents him in the full position which the light that had come to him involved: he is outside of the whole course of the world, and is in the circumstances of a pilgrim -- sitting in the tent-door.<a name=18:11></a> Such a man is fit morally to receive a divine visitation, and he does receive it.<a name=18:12></a> If you are connected with any kind of a city, even though it be only a small one, you will have no divine visitation; but if you live in a tent, if you take

		Now it is by the combination of these two aspects that we reach the measure of our separation: <i>morally</i>, it must be according to our place before God; <i>positionally</i>, it must be according to our identification with a rejected and suffering Christ on the earth -- "without the camp".<a name=20:11></a> Let us look a little at these two things.<a name=20:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First -- Morally, then, our separation should be according to the place in which we are set before God; and, since we are brought into that place through the death and resurrection of Christ, it is a place of perfect separation from all evil.<a name=20:13></a> The
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=21>[Page 21]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		difficulty, however, lies in the application of the principle; but there are three things clearly noted in Scripture in connection with this subject.<a name=21:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are said to have "died to sin" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:2">Romans  6:2</a>); to have been made "dead to the law" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>); and "the world is crucified to me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:14">Galatians  6:14</a>) -- of course through and in the death of Christ; and it must ever be remembered that there is no separation before God, excepting through death.<a name=21:2></a> For our present purpose we may omit 'death to law'; so that 'death to sin', and 'death to the world' will embrace and define the moral character of the Christian's separation.<a name=21:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>gives us the first of these -- the obligation being founded upon the profession of death with Christ.<a name=21:4></a> "We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?<a name=21:5></a> Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death?<a name=21:6></a>" And then, after stating what this involved, the apostle says: "So also <i>ye</i>, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:2">Romans  6:2</a> - 11).<a name=21:7></a> Such is the obligation resting upon all believers; an obligation which, whatever may be the sense of failure, will be acknowledged by all, for no real Christian will contend for liberty to sin.<a name=21:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second -- 'death to the world' -- is involved in every passage which speaks of our being dead with Christ, e.<a name=21:9></a>g.<a name=21:10></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:20">Colossians  2:20</a>; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>, etc.<a name=21:11></a>, because by His death He has passed (and we in that death) out of this scene into a new sphere,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		altogether and completely outside of the world.<a name=22:1></a> Hence our obligation to be practically dead to (and this is entire separation from) the world -- an obligation which was realised by one who could say, "But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:14">Galatians  6:14</a>).<a name=22:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stated then in its hardest form, our separation from the world should be as complete as the separation of a dead man from it.<a name=22:3></a> For the Christian has passed, in the death of Christ, clean out of all that constitutes the world, as completely as Israel had passed out of Egypt -- morally, the world -- when they had crossed the Red Sea.<a name=22:4></a> Hence the retention of a single trace of Egypt is not only a dishonour to Christ, but is also a practical denial of the place into which we have been brought before God.<a name=22:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it should be inquired what constitutes the world, the answer is found in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:15">1 John  2:15</a> - 17.<a name=22:6></a> There we have the positive and absolute exclusion of the world, and the things that are in the world, from the affections of the believer, and we are taught that the things of the world consist of all that the flesh can desire, all that can attract and please the eyes, and all that I can take pride in as a natural man.<a name=22:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us, then, ask ourselves whether there is anything in our houses, dress, habits, or manners, that ministers to the flesh, the eyes, or the pride of life; whether we have applied the cross to these several gateways to our hearts; whether, indeed, like the apostle, we have applied the cross to the world,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and also to ourselves, and thus effected a complete separation by death.<a name=23:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is sometimes the case that while we are personally faithful, personally separate, we are not so faithful in the application of the cross in dealing with our children and our households.<a name=23:2></a> Thus there may be sometimes seen in the houses of saints, who are personally separate from the world, splendid pictures, worldly books, and music, together with sumptuous furniture; and these things, if not excused, are often said to be retained because of relatives, or for the sake of the children; and in this way, the believer's responsibility for his household is forgotten or overlooked.<a name=23:3></a> No; there can be no exception in anything that pertains to me or my responsibility from the application of the cross; for the obligation equals my place before God, and hence the separation must be absolute and complete.<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second -- Our positional separation is expressed by the term, "without the camp".<a name=23:5></a> Judaism was the camp in apostolic times, but Christianity succeeded Judaism in responsibility on the earth (see <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>) and has failed in that responsibility as completely as its predecessor.<a name=23:6></a> The camp therefore includes the whole of organised Christianity, all that Christianity has become in the hands of man; all the religious systems and denominations which men have made.<a name=23:7></a> Hence, again, now, as in former days, we have to go forth unto Christ without the camp, bearing His reproach (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:13">Hebrews  13:13</a>), and the position we occupy, as gathered out to the name of Christ, is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=24>[Page 24]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the assertion of this necessity, as well as of the obligation of complete separation from all that composes the camp.<a name=24:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the question that needs to be put today is: are we really occupying our place of separation?<a name=24:2></a> We are bound to have a heart for every child of God (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:1">1 John  5:1</a> - 3), and we must be the more careful to insist upon this, because of the need of separating from their evil ways, systems and doctrines.<a name=24:3></a> But it must never be forgotten, that, if we are in the place of separation according to the mind of the Lord, we are bound to maintain in our individual walk the same character of separation as is professedly maintained by the assembly; in other words, the individual path should be in harmony with the path of the assembly.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, if without the camp, is it according to God that I should link myself individually with those religious institutions or associations that form part of the camp?<a name=24:5></a> If, with those gathered to the name of the Lord, we refuse fellowship with those who hold, or are associated with, evil doctrines, is it pleasing to the Lord that I should connect myself individually with such, or allow the members of my household to be associated with such?<a name=24:6></a> If I am on God's ground, is it according to His will that I should seek fellowship with, or use, those who are not, for the publication or dissemination of truth?<a name=24:7></a> These questions have only to be put to be answered; and yet who does not perceive the dangers that are gathering in these several directions?<a name=24:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=25>[Page 25]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Sardis, while there is corporate association with evil, there are individuals as already seen, who have not defiled their garments.<a name=25:1></a> In Philadelphia the danger is in the opposite direction; and indeed it is often seen that there are individual members of the assembly, who, while on the ground of separation, are yet associated with many of the evils, out of which we have been professedly brought.<a name=25:2></a> The reason is not far to seek.<a name=25:3></a> In the course of time there are many who have been attracted from different causes who have never passed through any exercises of soul, and who consequently have never understood the need for, or the power, or the measure of that separation which such a place demands.<a name=25:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It cannot, therefore, be too earnestly insisted upon, that, if we are "without the camp", the position thus indicated must govern the individual believer as well as the assembly, or that the separation in the one case must be as complete as in the other; for if we have gone out to Christ we cannot remain with Him, be in fellowship with Him, or have Him before our souls, unless we constantly and faithfully occupy the outside place.<a name=25:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing to be remembered, namely, that our separation must cover the whole area of our individual responsibility.<a name=25:6></a> This has already been touched upon, though not formally stated.<a name=25:7></a> Whatever, then, the circle of my responsibility before God, the whole of it must be brought under the principle of separation.<a name=25:8></a>

		Thus take once more the case of households.<a name=26:1></a> Abraham is commended because, Jehovah said, "he will command his children and his household after him", etc.<a name=26:2></a> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:19">Genesis  18:19</a>); Eli, on the other hand, is judged, "For", said Jehovah, "I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:13">1 Samuel  3:13</a>).<a name=26:3></a>

		The difficulties in the way of fidelity in this direction are often extreme, especially where different members of the family are connected and interconnected with the systems around; and it needs great grace to render, on the one hand, what is really due to natural relationships, and to be, on the other hand, faithful to the Lord.<a name=26:4></a> But we have to do with One who is all-sufficient for us in every emergency, and who, if He permit the storm to arise, can calm it with a word; and hence there must be no compromise, no excusing of worldliness, or laxity of associations on the ground of family relationships.<a name=26:5></a> These, it is true, must be maintained inviolate, as long as they can be maintained together with fidelity to Christ.<a name=26:6></a> But, if by fidelity to Him these relationships have even in appearance to be slighted, the result must be received as a part of the reproach of Christ.<a name=26:7></a> It were sad, indeed, if family claims, obligatory as they are within their own sphere, should be allowed to nullify the testimony to which we are called, to be put in fact before the claims of

		It is my desire in this and a few subsequent articles, if the Lord will, to consider from a practical point of view the way in which we take up our place as forming part of the assembly as the bride of Christ, and indeed as the one who is the antitype of Eve, the assembly as the complement of Christ.<a name=27:8></a> In doing so I shall necessarily have to dwell upon the features that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=28>[Page 28]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are proper to the assembly in these respects, but I shall endeavour to keep to a practical line, and not merely consider the truth itself, for what is the use of truth if it remains merely as a lovely picture?<a name=28:1></a> Its real gain is when it becomes formative and issues in practical result.<a name=28:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has often been said that there are seven types or illustrations of the assembly in Scripture, namely, Eve, Rebecca, Leah, Asnath, Zipporah, Abigail, and Solomon's wife, Pharaoh's daughter.<a name=28:3></a> The way I purpose considering the subject will make it desirable to take up these types in another order, however.<a name=28:4></a> The fullest type of the assembly is undoubtedly Eve; the others emphasise one or another particular feature seen in the assembly.<a name=28:5></a> I shall not, however, consider Eve first, but last.<a name=28:6></a> There are many lessons to be learnt before we can consciously enjoy our portion as set forth in that striking type.<a name=28:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is my purpose first to refer to Abigail.<a name=28:8></a> There are some very attractive features presented in Abigail; one which is common to every believer is that, typically, she appreciates Christ.<a name=28:9></a> In her case, of course, it was David, but David was Jehovah's anointed and a type of Christ.<a name=28:10></a> The apostle Peter speaks of this feature as common to the family of faith: "Unto you therefore which believe he is precious" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:7">1 Peter  2:7</a>, Authorised Version).<a name=28:11></a> There may be much we have to learn, much to unlearn; soul history, involving deep and real exercise may be before us, ugly features of the flesh may yet have to be dealt

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with; liberty in a fuller way may have to be learnt; but although this is so, the heart of every true believer answers to the simple test, "What think ye of Christ?<a name=29:1></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:42">Matthew  22:42</a>, Authorised Version), by the sweet reply, 'He is precious'.<a name=29:2></a> Our appreciation of His preciousness will undoubtedly grow, that is, if we make any progress at all; but little as it must necessarily be, all who believe have an appreciation of Christ.<a name=29:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I proceed further, may I ask the reader if he appreciates Christ?<a name=29:4></a> It is the one great mark of distinction between those who are the Lord's and those who are not.<a name=29:5></a> Hence the solemn words of the apostle, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" [footnote <i>i</i>, Meaning, 'Accursed -- the Lord cometh]' (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>).<a name=29:6></a> Had we asked any of those who were gathered in that upper room referred to in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>if they appreciated Christ, how simple their reply would have been.<a name=29:7></a> Did Mary Magdalene appreciate Him?<a name=29:8></a> Would not blind Bartimaeus have given us a reply leaving us without any doubt, if he had been there?<a name=29:9></a> And all the others too, each probably differing in their measure, but all alike possessing the sweet feature, appreciation of Christ.<a name=29:10></a> And is it less so today, dear reader?<a name=29:11></a> Not a bit.<a name=29:12></a> "Unto you therefore which believe he is precious" is still true.<a name=29:13></a> There may be religiousness and much else, but this essential quality lacking.<a name=29:14></a> If this is so, obviously such a one is not Christ's -- he is not a believer.<a name=29:15></a> How solemn this

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is.<a name=30:1></a> But "Unto you therefore which believe he is precious".<a name=30:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The appreciation Abigail had of David, however, was something more than that which would set forth our earliest thoughts of Christ.<a name=30:3></a> David was Jehovah's anointed, and yet he was a fugitive, hunted as a partridge on the mountains, and it needed no little perception to discern that this persecuted wanderer was the rightful king and would eventually have the kingdom.<a name=30:4></a> Then, too, she recognises that he fought Jehovah's battles and that evil was not found in him, hence his life was bound up in the bundle of life with Jehovah.<a name=30:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great moment when our appreciation of Christ extends to what He is for God.<a name=30:6></a> We usually begin by recognising what He is for us, the One who died for us and who put our sins away, the One in whom we are accepted and who lives for us now and supports us in our pathway here.<a name=30:7></a> But this is what the Lord is as to ourselves.<a name=30:8></a> What is He for God?<a name=30:9></a> How enlarged our view of Christ when we see He fought Jehovah's battles, as it were; that when He went to the cross He wrought to remove the foul blot of sin from God's fair universe; that He is God's Centre and His appointed Head, under whom all His world is to be ranged, and that He is the Sun of righteousness -- not one element of evil is in Him.<a name=30:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How glorious He then becomes in our eyes; what is any other then?<a name=30:11></a> He may be Saul or the highest dignity in the world today, but if he be against Christ, how degraded he is in our eyes.<a name=30:12></a> So it was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=31>[Page 31]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with Abigail; she says of Saul: "if a man is risen up to pursue thee".<a name=31:1></a> David -- for us that is Christ -- is everything; we are glad to be identified with Him.<a name=31:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature in Abigail is that she is self-judged.<a name=31:3></a> Being Nabal's wife, the stigma of his sin attached to her, and this she is ready to admit; but she judges the sin and confesses the true character of Nabal.<a name=31:4></a> It is a great thing to name what we are as in the flesh; in so doing God enables us morally to sever ourselves from our sinful state.<a name=31:5></a> If there is an appreciation of Christ in the heart, there is obviously some work of God there, an inward man, as <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:22">Romans  7:22</a> puts it, that which delights in what is of God.<a name=31:6></a> This is quite the reverse of what is sinful.<a name=31:7></a> But we find that while we delight in what is of God and appreciate Christ, it is equally true that as in the flesh we are sinful.<a name=31:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the exercise developed in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, and it is illustrated in Abigail.<a name=31:9></a> When once we judge our sinfulness, we are entitled to regard what we judge as no longer ourselves, but sin.<a name=31:10></a> (See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:20">Romans  7:20</a>).<a name=31:11></a> We could not be a fit companion for Christ if we were sinful, but as judging sin, we are no longer identified with it.<a name=31:12></a> In Abigail's case, we know God came in and Nabal died, and after he died David communed with Abigail and she became his wife.<a name=31:13></a> It is said that Abigail was of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance (verse 3), and in this way she resembled David, to whom she was to be united.<a name=31:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite clear that we cannot consciously take up our place in the assembly unless these
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=32>[Page 32]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		experiences have in some measure been ours.<a name=32:1></a> We appreciate Christ and we judge ourselves.<a name=32:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A further feature is seen in that Abigail shows her appreciation of David in practically expressing it to his followers (see verse 21).<a name=32:3></a> This is a very important feature.<a name=32:4></a> This practical expression of love to Christ, shown in love to the brethren, exhibited itself very early in the history of the assembly.<a name=32:5></a> The unselfishness recorded in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, the surrender in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>, the contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>, all speak of this.<a name=32:6></a> How happily Gaius set it forth (<a href="../bible/3John.htm#5">3 John  5</a>) and Priscilla and Aquila (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:3">Romans  16:3</a>, 4).<a name=32:7></a> These were the expressions of love, and this is a true feature of the assembly.<a name=32:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How very beautiful is Abigail's expression as she comes to David; she is ready to take the most menial place; for anything is honourable if it is service to David.<a name=32:9></a> What an honour to wash the feet of the saints!<a name=32:10></a> In how many ways we can serve our David, the Lord Jesus Christ, if only this spirit marks us.<a name=32:11></a> Even an apostle can pick up sticks to light a fire if it is to serve the saints.<a name=32:12></a> How many difficulties that exist among God's people would soon be solved if we more really possessed the features of Abigail, and only as we possess these features are we of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance morally, and only thus are we pleasing to Christ and are enabled to take up our place as His fit companion for days of suffering down here.<a name=32:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read the verses in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72">Psalm  72</a>, the final prayer of David.<a name=34:5></a> I would like to pray like this.<a name=34:6></a> How do you pray?<a name=34:7></a> We pray for our needs, of course, and God knows our needs before we pray for them.<a name=34:8></a> He delights to hear His children ask for what they need, but I think God is looking for more than that.<a name=34:9></a> He delights in persons who, in His presence, are able to speak to Him of Himself, and of the glory of all that He has done.<a name=34:10></a> This Psalm is remarkable: it is headed, "For Solomon", and David is looking on to the day of Solomon's reign in glory, to the universal dominion of Jesus.<a name=34:11></a> Oh!<a name=34:12></a> what it will be when He takes up His rights; but David concludes this Psalm with an outburst of praise, and that is what will occur in the millennial day, for the earth will be vibrant with the praise of the Lord.<a name=34:13></a> Well, those things are to be known and enjoyed now in the assembly.<a name=34:14></a> It is a wonderful privilege to have part amongst those who love the Lord Jesus at the present time and are free in the praise of God.<a name=34:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How wonderful this verse is, "who alone doeth wondrous things!<a name=35:6></a>" Great men and women in the history of this world have done certain things, but what are they in relation to what God has done?<a name=35:7></a> The Scriptures tell us of the greatest of all -- what God did in Christ.<a name=35:8></a> Think of the wonder of the incarnation, and of Jesus being here, of the works that He did -- they were His Father's works.<a name=35:9></a> What Jesus did was a reflection of what God was doing.<a name=35:10></a> How wondrous those works were!<a name=35:11></a> I believe it is good to sit down quietly in the presence of God and think a little about what He has done, and, surely, out of that will flow an appreciation of who God is, some increased knowledge of Himself, so that we can speak to God as One that we know and love, as One that has loved us.<a name=35:12></a> Then we learn to love Him.<a name=35:13></a> If you love a person, you will want to present the best to them, will you not?<a name=35:14></a> So if we love God, what a privilege it is, beloved brethren, to be able to say something to Him

		In Nehemiah we have a day of recovery; and we too are in a day of recovery.<a name=40:9></a> This remarkable recovery began in Ezra's day when God sovereignly charged king Cyrus to send the people back to Jerusalem to rebuild the altar and the house.<a name=40:10></a> Then Nehemiah rebuilds the wall according to the divine thought.<a name=40:11></a> That in itself was not the end, for the end was that the service of God should be re-established, and that is the point that I wanted briefly to refer to here.<a name=40:12></a> Having accomplished this work, these Levites then come forward, and there is this command, "Stand up, bless Jehovah your God from eternity to eternity.<a name=40:13></a> And let men bless the name of thy glory, which is exalted above all".<a name=40:14></a> I think what is said here is very similar to what David said in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29">1 Chronicles  29</a>, showing that the recovery had in mind the re-

		The recovery that began some 170 years ago, began with the re-assertion of divine principles, and if you follow the ministry that was given, and particularly the ministry in the first half of this century, you will see the result in the fulness and blessedness of the service of God.<a name=41:2></a> I think the Spirit has been helping us ever since to fill out the divine service under the headship of Christ.<a name=41:3></a> In one sense the truth is all out, but we do need to have fresh unfoldings of the variety and the blessedness of what is available to us in the assembly in the service of God.<a name=41:4></a> I believe it is very encouraging, in this revival in Ezra's and Nehemiah's day, to see that the great end was that the service to God should be re-established as it had been under that great servant David, the sweet psalmist of Israel, the one who had spent a lifetime in accumulating substance and wealth for the house of God, and for His service.<a name=41:5></a>

		It might be a matter of interest to us to pay a little attention to what one may call a first and last word of Christ to the church, that our attention might be taken up with the things that are.<a name=44:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John was charged to write the things which he had seen, which I take to refer to the vision of Christ in chapter 1.<a name=44:3></a> "The things that are", that is, the church as a witness here, and "the things that are about to be after these" (verse 19), after the church has ceased to occupy the place of witness here on earth.<a name=44:4></a> The proper place of the church down here is that of witness.<a name=44:5></a> In the ways of God the church is set to be a faithful witness, or light-bearer; that thought is conveyed to us under the symbol of the seven golden candlesticks.<a name=44:6></a> The thought of God has always been that there should be a witness of Himself; even among the idolatrous Gentiles God did not leave Himself without witness.<a name=44:7></a> Israel was established as a witness in the earth on the part of God.<a name=44:8></a> In Isaiah God continually refers to Israel as such -- a witness against idolatry.<a name=44:9></a> The time came when Israel ceased to be a witness for God; that moment had arrived long before Christ came; then Christ came, and <i>He</i> was the true witness.<a name=44:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now at the present moment, until Christ comes again, the church is the witness; the church was established as a witness here to the Man in heaven, at
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the right hand of God, in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=45:1></a> The Holy Spirit has come down as witness to the glory of that Man; but the Holy Spirit must have a vessel in which the wit-ness is maintained; that vessel is the church: hence you get here the symbol of the golden candlesticks.<a name=45:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important to understand the place the church has as witness.<a name=45:3></a> In the end of chapter 3 you get Christ coming in as the faithful and true Witness when the church has not proved to be a faithful witness.<a name=45:4></a> Christendom is not a true witness of Christ, for the witness of Christ to be effectual must be a witness morally, not merely by word of mouth; and Christendom is not that.<a name=45:5></a> The church has not maintained that place, hence we get these epistles written to the seven churches; and now the time is near when Christ will appear as "the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:14">Revelation  3:14</a>).<a name=45:6></a> Adam was not the beginning of the creation of God, he was historically the first man; Christ is the Beginning of the creation of God, and He is the faithful and true Witness when everything has failed.<a name=45:7></a> What will come to pass is that Israel will come again into the place of witness in connection with Christ; the golden candlestick in the holy place was symbolic of Israel in that way in the world to come; that is the issue of things here on earth.<a name=45:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I want to touch upon is the <i>first</i> word of Christ to the church after its defection.<a name=45:9></a> If you pass on to the close of the next chapter you get the <i>last</i> word of Christ to the church; it is extremely
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		important to take these into account.<a name=46:1></a> If by the grace of God we have been led to return, in any measure, to first things, you may be pretty sure that history will repeat itself in us, and the defection will be much of the same character as at the outset.<a name=46:2></a> It is a fatal mistake now to set up to be anything here on earth.<a name=46:3></a> If we have returned to the first things in any measure, we are exposed to the same defection that overtook the church at the beginning.<a name=46:4></a> I am going to speak a little as to what that was, and at the same time to say a word as to the promise to the overcomer.<a name=46:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The overcomer is essentially individual, and the promise is not to the church, but to the overcomer: the very thought of an overcomer implies that the current is against you, and if you do not go against it, you will not be an overcomer.<a name=46:6></a> It is a proof of vital energy to go against the current; the Lord has pleasure in the overcomer.<a name=46:7></a> I have often thought of the promise to the overcomer in Laodicea when things had got to the worst.<a name=46:8></a> The Lord says, "He that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my throne; as <i>I</i> also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:21">Revelation  3:21</a>).<a name=46:9></a> The Lord will have the company of the overcomer with Him there; such a thought as that ought to engage the attention of every Christian.<a name=46:10></a> It is wonderful encouragement that the Lord will have the overcomer to be associated with Him, that He will have his company with Him in His throne.<a name=46:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point of departure which marked the church was that it had left its first love; it is extremely important to see the principle and character of the defection.<a name=47:1></a> The Lord commends everything that it was possible to commend, but in leaving its first love it had given up its place of witness.<a name=47:2></a> There was no longer fidelity in the place of witness; nothing can be more important than to understand that the church was left here as a witness in the absence of Christ.<a name=47:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Bridegroom is in heaven, and the bride on earth; the church should be mourning the absence of the Bridegroom, and yet have the Bridegroom dwelling in the heart by faith; that is the true position of the church.<a name=47:4></a> Not going in the current of the world, not overcome by the power of present things, but in a sense desolate in the absence of the Bridegroom, and yet not desolate because Christ is dwelling in the heart by faith.<a name=47:5></a> The practical effect would be the Bridegroom set forth in the bride, and at the same time the bride entirely taken up with the interests of the Bridegroom.<a name=47:6></a> That is what I understand by Christ dwelling in the heart by faith, and for that everything depends upon the appreciation of Christ.<a name=47:7></a> There was evidently a drawing back in the church, and the appreciation of Christ was obscured, and that was the point of departure.<a name=47:8></a> Worldly, chilling influences came in, and the effect was like with the children of Israel when turning back in heart to Egypt -- they forgot the pleasant land.<a name=47:9></a>
	</div>

		Now a word with regard to how we are led into the appreciation of Christ.<a name=47:10></a> Christ is presented to us in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the gospel in the first instance as a point of attraction; even in the Old Testament we have the figure of the Sun of righteousness; you cannot entertain the idea of the sun without the thought of a power of attraction.<a name=48:1></a> The Lord says, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me" (verse 32).<a name=48:2></a> If Christ is to draw to Himself, it implies that there must be a power of attraction in Himself; and that power is that every thought of grace on the part of God towards man is presented to men in a Man, and that Man is Christ -- "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>); that is what I should understand to be the principle of attraction which resides in the Sun of righteousness.<a name=48:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite true that nobody is drawn to Christ unless God works, but that does not alter the power of attraction in Christ.<a name=48:4></a> The fact that men do not come to Christ proves the terrible deadness and insensibility on the part of man to all that is of God; as I said before, you cannot entertain any thought of grace on the part of God towards man save in a Man, and that Man has taken up every liability under which men were, in order that in Him the grace of God might be presented to man, so that he might be attracted to the Sun of righteousness; it is the first principle in the ways of God in regard to man.<a name=48:5></a> The next point is you become attached to Christ, and that attachment is brought about by the Spirit which Christ gives to the one who is responsive to the grace

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by attachment to Christ that we shall be kept from the evil of the world.<a name=49:3></a> The Lord says, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture" (verse 9).<a name=49:4></a> You do not want the shelter of a fold; you are kept, whatever the condition of things in the world, by the power of attachment to Christ; you are saved, are in liberty, and find pasture.<a name=49:5></a> The most gifted intellect in the world could not explain how a Christian is kept down here, preserved from evil and temptations and allurements, and at the same time finding pasture.<a name=49:6></a> He does not go to the world's fields to find pasture, he is independent of them.<a name=49:7></a> The secret of it all is attachment, which exists in the Spirit of Christ, the living water which Christ gives, and which springs up in the believer unto everlasting life.<a name=49:8></a> What follows is that you get the knowledge of Christ.<a name=49:9></a> "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine" (verse 14).<a name=49:10></a> The apostle Paul says, "I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:8">Philippians  3:8</a>).<a name=49:11></a> It is a great point to arrive at the appreciation of Christ; then it is we are prepared to part with ourselves, because we have found in Christ that which is supremely excellent; and in result we have Christ dwelling in the heart by faith.<a name=49:12></a>

		I want to say a word, dear brethren, as to what the Lord is prepared to be to us as in the path of discipleship here, for that is our position, or is intended to be that while we are here waiting for the

	<div class="paragraph">
		coming of the Lord, we are in a path of discipleship; that is, those who are publicly known as disciples of Jesus.<a name=54:1></a> Discipleship involves that we learn from our Teacher and are disciplined so that we might be formed in accordance with what we learn.<a name=54:2></a> Disciples stand in relation to their Teacher; bondmen stand in relation to their Lord.<a name=54:3></a> The Lord says, "The disciple is not above his teacher", but He goes on to say, "but every one that is perfected shall be as his teacher" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#6:40">Luke  6:40</a>).<a name=54:4></a> So that the teacher is intended to be not only a teacher, but one marked -- as of course is the case supremely with Christ -- one marked by moral power as being himself the exemplification of what he teaches.<a name=54:5></a> I need scarcely say that that was seen perfectly and supremely in Jesus Himself.<a name=54:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a good thing for us, as we take account of ourselves as disciples of Jesus, to understand that, if we are in the path of discipleship, we are not to expect anything better than was meted out to the Lord, "The disciple is not above his teacher".<a name=54:7></a> But we have the Teacher Himself before us as the pattern of what discipleship is intended to lead to.<a name=54:8></a> "Every one that is perfected shall be as his teacher".<a name=54:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the Psalms have particular interest because they are the expression of actual experiences of godly persons.<a name=54:10></a> Some of them, of course, breathed the Spirit of Christ.<a name=54:11></a> Some of them are the expression of Christ's own feelings.<a name=54:12></a> Most of them are the expression, in the power of the Spirit, by grace of feelings begotten in the people of God.<a name=54:13></a> Many of the Psalms are not exactly christian experiences, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=55>[Page 55]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		therefore, a good deal of care needs to be taken in reading the Psalms, because the Psalms were primarily written in view of God's earthly people who will again be brought into blessing, and many of them express the exercises which they will go through in a coming day, and many of them express and call for vengeance on their enemies.<a name=55:1></a> That will be right in that day, when the world has become apostate, and God's earthly people, in whom He works, will be standing in the world for the rights of God which are completely denied Him.<a name=55:2></a> It will be right then to speak of judgment and to pray for vengeance, but clearly it is not right for Christians to take up that strain, for God says, "Vengeance is mine" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:35">Deuteronomy  32:35</a>), but it will be right in a coming day.<a name=55:3></a> Therefore, as I say, we have to be careful in reading the Psalms, understanding we cannot apply all the expressions to believers of today.<a name=55:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, the Psalms have this about them, which is of great value to us, and that is they represent the exercises of the godly in a world of un-godliness.<a name=55:5></a> I think it will be seen that that character is found in them.<a name=55:6></a> They represent the exercises of the godly in a world of ungodliness.<a name=55:7></a> Many of them suggest what can be taken up by the saints of today, and we find great comfort and support in them.<a name=55:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, as we know, the book of Psalms commences in the first psalm with a pronouncement of blessedness on the man that "walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners" (verse l).<a name=55:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, the first experience that we come to in the psalm is the experience of one who has learned that it is important to be entirely apart from the way or fellowship of the ungodly.<a name=56:1></a> Then it goes on to say, "But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he meditate day and night" (verse 2).<a name=56:2></a> It goes on further to speak of the prosperity and fruitfulness of one who takes that line: "And he is as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and all that he doeth prospereth" (verse 3).<a name=56:3></a> That is very attractive, dear brethren.<a name=56:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have all to make our way through this world as in it for God's will, but there is a prescription which He provides that whatever we do will prosper if we take the lines of the first three verses of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>.<a name=56:5></a> It leads to a condition in which prosperity according to God is assured.<a name=56:6></a> It is not necessarily, of course, material prosperity, for God does not attach great importance to that.<a name=56:7></a> He tells us, "having sustenance and covering, we will be content with these" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:8">1 Timothy  6:8</a>).<a name=56:8></a> But this is spiritual prosperity, the consciousness of the blessing of God, the consciousness of possession of spiritual wealth.<a name=56:9></a> That is to be greatly desired, and the first three verses of the first psalm indicate lines on which true prosperity will be enjoyed.<a name=56:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I wanted to speak briefly on these psalms from which we have read.<a name=56:11></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>is a most important and attractive psalm.<a name=56:12></a> It depicts the principle of piety by which the Lord Jesus lived as a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man here.<a name=57:1></a> Piety is the thought of bringing God into everything.<a name=57:2></a> How important that is!<a name=57:3></a> We read in the fifth chapter of Hebrews that the Lord was heard on account of His piety.<a name=57:4></a> God would not deny, would not belie the confidence of one who puts his trust in Him.<a name=57:5></a> It says, "Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears" (verse 7).<a name=57:6></a> It speaks, no doubt, of the feelings and experiences of the Lord in Gethsemane.<a name=57:7></a> "To him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears".<a name=57:8></a> Not save Him 'from' it, but "out of" it.<a name=57:9></a> And it says He was heard on account of His piety.<a name=57:10></a> Now He has moved on those lines in order to commend those lines to us.<a name=57:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The psalm depicts various elements which enter into true piety, "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee" -- dependence on God!<a name=57:12></a> How easy it is to say it, but how important it is to practise it, that we may be pre-served in it.<a name=57:13></a> God came in in the person of Jesus in order that He might not only express God on the one hand, but that He might perfectly express man in relation to God on the other.<a name=57:14></a> The mystery of piety was set out in its wonderfulness in Jesus here, and His language is, "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee".<a name=57:15></a> You might say, But surely was He not God Himself?<a name=57:16></a> Could He not command all the forces of nature and all the resources of the world?<a name=57:17></a> Yes, that is so, but that would not be moving in piety and setting out what was open to all His people.<a name=57:18></a> Therefore, He would move in a character of life which could be

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=58>[Page 58]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		taken up by His saints, the character of true piety, bringing God into everything.<a name=58:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So He commences with this, "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee".<a name=58:2></a> It is a remarkable thing that when the Lord, as it says, became flesh (not that John's gospel presents Him in His infancy, for John's gospel presents Him as immediately here in full manhood) but when He who in His person is God, took up human condition, He came in as a Babe.<a name=58:3></a> That is referred to in the verses in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=58:4></a> You may well say the mystery of piety is great, that He who is God, should become a babe, to set out the feature of dependence perfectly.<a name=58:5></a> You could not get a greater expression of dependence than a babe.<a name=58:6></a> Jesus came in that way to set out from the very beginning true dependence on God.<a name=58:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, as we read, "I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mother's belly", and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee".<a name=58:8></a> That is, He was expressing in the spirit of grace through the psalmist, the true principle of dependence on God, the first element that enters into piety.<a name=58:9></a> The next verse is, "Thou my soul hast said to Jehovah, Thou art the Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; -- To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said, In them is all my delight".<a name=58:10></a> There you have another element, the element of lowliness, lowliness in spirit, and finding all one's delight in the saints.<a name=58:11></a> That is what God intends we should be marked by.<a name=58:12></a> How important it is!<a name=58:13></a> How manifest it becomes insofar as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=59>[Page 59]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we are marked by these things.<a name=59:1></a> In the world where just the opposite of lowliness is seen on every hand it befits us to be lowly.<a name=59:2></a> The Lord says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:29">Matthew  11:29</a>).<a name=59:3></a> And the Lord was exemplifying it.<a name=59:4></a> The spirit of Christ in the psalmist would set it out.<a name=59:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thou my soul hast said to Jehovah, Thou art the Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; -- To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said, In them is all my delight".<a name=59:6></a> Is our delight wholly in the saints?<a name=59:7></a> Do we regard them as the excellent of the earth, or have we any reserves about them?<a name=59:8></a> Have we any links with those outside who have no appreciation of Christ?<a name=59:9></a> Do we find any friendship with those in the world?<a name=59:10></a> He says, "to the excellent thou hast said, In them is all my delight".<a name=59:11></a> He was content with those whom God provided for Him for His companions.<a name=59:12></a> He did not have much in the way of companionship, but He did have something, however the disciples may have failed at times, at the same time the Lord says, "to the excellent thou hast said, in them is all my delight".<a name=59:13></a> "All my delight".<a name=59:14></a> That is an important word for us, dear brethren, to work out for our salvation.<a name=59:15></a> It will, if we take it up.<a name=59:16></a> If there are any here who have the tendency to have friendships in the world, I would say it is most damaging to the soul.<a name=59:17></a> "Friendship with the world is enmity with God" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#4:4">James  4:4</a>).<a name=59:18></a> We do not want to be amongst the enemies of God!<a name=59:19></a> But here the Lord says, "To the saints that are on the earth, and to

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it goes on to say, "Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, and I will not take up their names into my lips".<a name=60:3></a> We do not want to have any other object than God before us.<a name=60:4></a> There are those in the world who have their objects, their pursuits, things they devote themselves to; it may be different things with different persons.<a name=60:5></a> I suppose if a person devotes his life to something, some object, it is a drink-offering of blood.<a name=60:6></a> It might be a particular person, or a hobby, or a career, that the people of the world devote lives to, and lay them out in drink-offerings of blood.<a name=60:7></a> "Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, and I will not take up their names into my lips.<a name=60:8></a> Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot".<a name=60:9></a> How delightful it must have been to the heart of God to hear language like this from the lips of Jesus.<a name=60:10></a> We can thank God, dear brethren, in our day, the blessedness of the assembly is coming more and more before us .<a name=60:11></a>.<a name=60:12></a>.<a name=60:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so we want to touch this, "Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.<a name=60:14></a> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage".<a name=60:15></a> That is what God allotted to Jesus as a Man here.<a name=60:16></a> It is like
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=61>[Page 61]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what we were touching this afternoon, "present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service .<a name=61:1></a>.<a name=61:2></a>.<a name=61:3></a> that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:1">Romans  12:1</a>, 2).<a name=61:4></a> And here the Lord says, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places".<a name=61:5></a> If someone in the world had looked at the allotment that God made to Jesus here, they would not have thought it had fallen to Him in pleasant places.<a name=61:6></a> The world has different ideas.<a name=61:7></a> Think of Him as being laid in a manger when born, and then brought up at Nazareth in the house of a carpenter -- most undesirable, they would say.<a name=61:8></a> These did not look like pleasant places.<a name=61:9></a> They were God's will for Him and He found the joy of answering to the will of God by uncomplaining obedience, finding His joy in God and God answered it by giving Him a sense of His portion.<a name=61:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He goes on to say, "I will bless Jehovah, who giveth me counsel; even in the nights my reins instruct me.<a name=61:11></a> I have set Jehovah continually before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved".<a name=61:12></a> Now you will no doubt have noticed that these last four verses, verses 8 - 11, are quoted in full by the apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost.<a name=61:13></a> They are the summing up of the moral perfection of Jesus as Man here in His life in relation to God, the complete dependence on God finding its expression all the way through.<a name=61:14></a> And he is exulting, rejoicing and exulting.<a name=61:15></a> What does it mean?<a name=61:16></a> He is looking forward to death, to perfecting the will of God by going into

	<div class="paragraph">
		death; yet He has such confidence in God, He is prepared to go right into death and right through death.<a name=62:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol, neither wilt thou allow thy Holy One to see corruption.<a name=62:2></a> Thou wilt make known to me the path of life".<a name=62:3></a> These are moral exercises, dear brethren, that are not set before us just as pleasant pictures; what God has actually had under His eye in this very world in which we are; and the present activities of the Holy Spirit have in mind, amongst other things, to bring the saints into correspondence with Jesus.<a name=62:4></a> There is no other standard before God, and the Spirit of God is here, and Christ is in glory, the One whose path and spirit are depicted in this psalm, now exalted to the right hand of God, and the Spirit has come down, to bring about correspondence to Him in His saints down here.<a name=62:5></a> As I said, on the day of Pentecost Peter quotes these last four verses in full, as though to say this is the kind of man to give character to Christianity, and the Spirit is here to produce it in the saints.<a name=62:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are to take it up in that light.<a name=62:7></a> I say that as feeling the need of it for oneself, and for the saints, because we tend so readily to have other standards than God's, to fall in with man's ideas and standards, when we should have divine standards before our hearts, and the intention of the Spirit of God is that they should be kept before our hearts so that they should become formative.<a name=62:8></a> "Thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol, neither wilt thou allow thy Holy One to see corruption.<a name=62:9></a> Thou wilt make known to me the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thou wilt make known to me the path of life: thy countenance is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore".<a name=63:4></a> That was the culmination of the path of Jesus and that will be what we shall come to very shortly, the presence of God with Christ.<a name=63:5></a> "Thy countenance", he says, speaking to Jehovah, "is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore".<a name=63:6></a>

		What has impressed me whilst we have been together is that the Lord would, on occasions like the present, appeal to the affections of His people.<a name=65:1></a> He would endeavour to have the affections of His people aroused, and this is brought to pass by the presentation of Himself to us by the ministry of the Spirit.<a name=65:2></a> I think that was exactly what He had in view in raising this question with the disciples as to Himself, as to who He was.<a name=65:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew, you may recall, Peter's confession was that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God (chapter 16: 16); Mark, on the other hand, records that Peter's reply to Christ was that He was the Christ -- "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ", he says (chapter 8: 29).<a name=65:4></a> But in Luke we have recorded that Peter's reply was, "The <i>Christ of God</i>".<a name=65:5></a> Now it is just because of that that I have felt encouraged to bring Luke's account of this incident to your attention.<a name=65:6></a> It may appear that Peter's confession in Matthew involves more the truth of Christ's Person, but my impression is, that the truth of Christ's Person is not exactly the point in Matthew.<a name=65:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew's account has in view the establishment of that which would be invulnerable down here in relation to the testimony, and what is stated as to the Lord's Person is in this connection.<a name=65:8></a> The testimony had been connected with Israel, and the presence of Christ in the midst of Israel brought to light their

		When we come to Luke, what is in view is <i>the intervention of God for the deliverance and blessing of humanity</i>.<a name=67:3></a> That is what Luke is engaged with by the Spirit.<a name=67:4></a> He relates to us certain features of the Lord's life and ministry which set forth the fact that God had intervened for the deliverance and blessing of man.<a name=67:5></a> So that, in chapter 4, He stands forth as the anointed Vessel; not there exactly as the Vessel of the testimony, but as the Vessel of divine grace to man, so that, they marvel at the words of <i>grace</i> that proceed out of His mouth, when He begins to preach.<a name=67:6></a> As the narrative goes on, everything is connected with God; God had come in on man's behalf.<a name=67:7></a> Up to the beginning of chapter 8, the Lord is engaged in this blessed service alone, the result being that many become attached to Him, amongst them certain women who ministered unto Him of their substance.<a name=67:8></a> The twelve were with Him; not as serving in conjunction with Him; but they were <i>with</i> Him, and having them with Him, He begins a certain course of instruction, so as to fit them to become vessels of the same service of grace; and in chapter 9, He sends them forth to preach the kingdom.<a name=67:9></a> That is to say, He had instructed them what to do, and then He sends them forth to work and preach the kingdom.<a name=67:10></a> Then they return to record what they had done, and He takes them aside to a desert place and

		With the Spirit's help, I would like to say a brief and simple word in relation to the features that are to mark us, as believers, as the children of God.<a name=76:8></a> Paul, as we know, often refers to believers as sons -- our position as relating to divine purpose -- though he speaks of "children of God" in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:16">Romans  8:16</a> and <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a> (see also <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>, 2).<a name=76:9></a> But John speaks of believers largely as children of God, a very delightful title.<a name=76:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The verses read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>remind us of the way in which we have been given the right to take the place of being children of God as receiving Christ: "as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God" -- the right to take that place -- "to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=76:11></a> So that places a wonderful dignity

		upon us as being begotten of God, of being children of God.<a name=77:1></a> What characterises the children of God practically is that they are marked by righteousness and love.<a name=77:2></a> There are two lines that are concurrent, that go along side by side, that John speaks of in his epistle: the children of God, and the children of the devil.<a name=77:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those two lines, what is of God and what is of the devil, came out in the very beginning of man's history in Cain and Abel.<a name=77:4></a> The first man that was born into this world was Cain.<a name=77:5></a> He would have been regarded as a child by his parents, Adam and Eve, but the first brother that was born was Abel (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:1">Genesis  4:1</a>, 2).<a name=77:6></a> As soon as the thought of the brother was introduced, the thought of the family was developed, and Satan immediately attacked it, and he has been attacking it ever since.<a name=77:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4">Genesis  4</a>, after the birth of Abel is recorded, you will find that there are six references to him as a brother, as though that thought was prominent in connection with the introduction of Abel.<a name=77:8></a> He was a brother, and the family thought was being developed.<a name=77:9></a>

		There are four interesting features that mark Abel, one who was of God.<a name=77:10></a> He is, first of all, said to be a brother, as we were saying; he was also a shepherd, the first shepherd; and he was also a prophet.<a name=77:11></a> The Lord refers to him in that way: "the blood of all the prophets .<a name=77:12></a>.<a name=77:13></a>.<a name=77:14></a> from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:50">Luke  11:50</a>, 51).<a name=77:15></a> He was the first prophet, although we do not read of anything that Abel actually said, and yet, "having

	<div class="paragraph">
		The breakdown of the family unit is very manifest now in the world, with the increasing evidence of lawlessness and immorality and the darkness of apostasy becoming increasingly apparent.<a name=78:5></a> "Men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant .<a name=78:6></a>.<a name=78:7></a>.<a name=78:8></a> profane .<a name=78:9></a>.<a name=78:10></a>.<a name=78:11></a>" These are among the many features that the Spirit of God describes in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>, and they are to be seen today.<a name=78:12></a> Over against that there is the family of God which is to be marked by righteousness and love, and the feature of the brother.<a name=78:13></a> Brotherly love is one of the important and very attractive features that mark the family of God as over against the appalling darkness which is becoming increasingly manifest in the world.<a name=78:14></a> It is a darkness that can be felt.<a name=78:15></a> But over against that there is light and joy, and liberty and unity, to be found among the children of God.<a name=78:16></a> That is the line that John would present to us: family affections and the feature of a brother, true brotherly love, and they are to be found among us at the present time.<a name=78:17></a>

		Well now, "The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof".<a name=92:9></a> As we take it up in faithfulness to Christ and, of course, take up the remembrance desiring that He should have a place in our affection, when we come to the end of the psalm it says, "Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye ever-lasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in".<a name=92:10></a> I know this is sometimes taken to refer to when the Lord ascended and went into heaven.<a name=92:11></a> I am not finding fault with the suggestion, but I doubt whether it is the real import.<a name=92:12></a> I think the real import is that He will come into this world to take up His rights, it is a call to the faithful in Israel.<a name=92:13></a> It is a question of coming into His rights, and I believe in the meantime, as the saints gather together to the Supper in faithful-ness to His Name, we can all lift up our hearts, the everlasting doors of our hearts, and the Lord will come

		"There was no more spirit in her", is the description given of the queen of Sheba after she had seen all Solomon's wisdom and glory (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#10:5">1 Kings  10:5</a>).<a name=94:2></a> It was not from any lack in her own circumstances, for she had come with a very great train -- her spices were a very great store, but the beauty and brilliancy of Solomon's glory so overpowered and captivated her heart, that she lost consciousness of all her own high and royal estate.<a name=94:3></a> She was like Paul in the third heaven, when he proved the superiority of divine things to the things of man (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>).<a name=94:4></a> This is a great lesson.<a name=94:5></a> It is not that the rude force of evil has blighted the top-shoot of our hearts, so that any gleam of real light is eagerly sought by us; but because of association with our Solomon in His own things which are so infinitely superior to the beauties of nature, that the best are eclipsed in our eyes.<a name=94:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If you are the widow that has lost her only son (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>), you have lost all interest in this world, because bereaved of what was dearest to your heart; you go through it with the feeling that nothing can repair the blank, and you rejoice to find outside it a gleam of light, and assurance of joy and rest with Christ; but if it be only this, the things that could have attracted you if bereavement had not withered your heart, are not really displaced, because not eclipsed by what is superior.<a name=94:7></a> The grapes are sour to you only because your heart refuses to reach to them.<a name=94:8></a> Now, if you are like the queen, you are introduced

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between the two practically is this: the one who has been widowed here by bereavement is relieved by gleams of brightness from above, and thus learns to bear up and thread her way through this dark and dreary scene right up to glory; while the one for whom the brightest things here have been eclipsed by the glory of Christ takes a true and divine estimate of everything.<a name=95:2></a> She has learned what suits Christ, and she refuses everything of man as unworthy of Him.<a name=95:3></a> She <i>begins</i> with refusing herself.<a name=95:4></a> She has no more spirit in her.<a name=95:5></a> A widow has suffered from death in this scene, and looks to Christ to cheer and sustain her onward and upward.<a name=95:6></a> The queen is deadened to this scene because of what she has found outside of it, and therefore is more truly a widow in it.<a name=95:7></a> If she had not seen all Solomon's wisdom, she could not have become insensible to all the brightness here.<a name=95:8></a> The inclination to enjoy things below has gone, because of the things above, casting everything into the shade.<a name=95:9></a> She is not looking for gleams of light and cheer, but the full circle of Solomon's glory so engages her heart that she is dead to the things here.<a name=95:10></a> The widow can comfort a widow as she has been comforted herself --

		but the queen can give proof of the insignificance of earthly things because of her acquaintance with things above -- she can detect the incongruity of everything here with the mind and purpose of God.<a name=96:1></a> If I turn to the glory merely for relief and comfort, I can be mixed up with a great deal here, nay, with everything that does not touch my heart or my conscience; but if I have been deadened to earthly things by the superior circle of things above, <i>nothing</i> here suits me, and I find that many a thing which once I had allowed or tolerated with an unupbraiding conscience, I now see to be incongruous and uncongenial to me as formed and influenced by another order of things.<a name=96:2></a> The glory of Christ eclipses the most beautiful things here, and what once would have awakened sensations of delight has now no charm for me.<a name=96:3></a> God disciplines us to make us seek resource in Christ in glory; but when we are in company with Him there we are so enriched that there is no more spirit in us.<a name=96:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Take care of lending yourself to the beauties of nature; if you do, you will have no heart for Solomon and his things.<a name=96:5></a> It is only intimacy with Christ in the sphere and order of His glory, which so absorbs the heart, that all of man is really excluded as incongruous; you practically become dead to that which has lost its interest to you and thus, while you are a queen in <i>that</i> scene, you are a widow in <i>this</i>.<a name=96:6></a>

		THE VALUE OF LOCAL ASSEMBLIES

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:1">John  12:1</a> - 3, 7, 8; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:1">1 Corinthians  1:1</a> - 9; <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#22:1">1 Samuel  22:1</a>, 2, 20 - 23; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:22">Psalm  22:22</a> - 24
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought in mind, beloved brethren, in reading these scriptures is to speak, with the help of the Holy Spirit, about the value of local assemblies.<a name=97:1></a> Some of the scriptures read refer to the assembly in its entirety, but no doubt what belongs to the assembly as a whole may be seen in measure in local companies.<a name=97:2></a> I believe that the Lord has peculiar pleasure in seeing what is of Himself coming into expression amongst the saints in a local setting.<a name=97:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is to be found in a local assembly is suggested in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>where it speaks of the garden which God planted in Eden.<a name=97:4></a> It says that He "made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food", and He set man in it "to till it and to guard it" (chapter 2: 9, 15).<a name=97:5></a> In the constitution of a local assembly, not only are the saints set together to the best possible advantage, but it is furnished with all that is needed to meet the demands of the testimony in that place.<a name=97:6></a> One might wonder as to why the thought of guarding comes in in Genesis when no evil had occurred, at least in the scene which is referred to, and I think that there is a suggestion that God knew that the enemy, who was no doubt taking account of what had taken place, would attack it.<a name=97:7></a> It brings out, I believe, one of the characteristics of God's ways, and that is, that whatever arises in the testimony in the way of opposition or difficulty, has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		already been prepared for, otherwise God, if we may use the expression reverently, would be taken aback by what arises in the testimony, and that could never be.<a name=98:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is evident that God has in mind that local assemblies should continue to the end, for the Lord says on the last page of Scripture, "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=98:2></a> That is, there are still companies which express in measure God's thoughts of the assembly.<a name=98:3></a> There is no doubt that the enemy is set against this, and whilst we do not want to stress that side unduly, we should be aware of it because he would seek to destroy anything that would be pleasing to God at the present time.<a name=98:4></a> We should not underestimate the value of what God now receives from His saints in a collective way.<a name=98:5></a> The Lord values what He finds in local companies.<a name=98:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read first in John's gospel because, whilst it is not exactly an assembly setting, yet I believe we see there one of the cardinal features of a local company, and that is, it is a place where Christ is loved.<a name=98:7></a> Now that is of paramount importance.<a name=98:8></a> We might say it is so evident that it need hardly be stated, but where there is true love for Christ, and His rights are acknowledged, then everything else falls into place.<a name=98:9></a> There may be difficulties and exercises, and there will be, but where Christ is truly loved and owned then the whole company takes character from the One who is loved.<a name=98:10></a> And so we have here the statement, "There therefore they made him a supper,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=99>[Page 99]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him".<a name=99:1></a> The Lord had His true place there.<a name=99:2></a> Every one here of responsible years, I believe, loves the Lord; that is something to give thanks for.<a name=99:3></a> It is in sovereign mercy indeed, and divine grace, that we have been brought to know Christ as Saviour and to love Him.<a name=99:4></a> But something is added in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>persons are together in seeking to provide what is pleasing to the Lord.<a name=99:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In other instances a supper was made and the Lord was invited (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14:12">Luke  14:12</a>), but here it says, "There therefore they made him a supper".<a name=99:6></a> He was the Centre of their affections; He was the Centre of their arrangements; I believe that is something that is peculiarly precious to the heart of Christ.<a name=99:7></a> Again it is not to set aside what other believers may do, because we all own the same Saviour, but I believe that affection for Christ, truly followed up, would lead to assembly formation and assembly activity, that is, that we come to the point where His interests are paramount with us.<a name=99:8></a> Now to know that, and to understand it, involves being near to Him, and I believe these dear saints mentioned here were held by their love for Him.<a name=99:9></a> Martha is serving, as is recounted in other scriptures, but she is not distracted by her service.<a name=99:10></a> She did it well.<a name=99:11></a> Mary also was active in her place, and that is the effect, typically, of Christ having truly the place that is His in a local company -- everything is in its place.<a name=99:12></a> You can see from the earlier teaching in this gospel how that comes about, particularly in chapter 10.<a name=99:13></a> He is

		the good Shepherd, and the sheep move in relation to Him, and He knows them.<a name=100:1></a> When we come together for the Supper, we are reminded of all the saints whom the Lord loves.<a name=100:2></a> It is good to think thus, but <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>tells us that "he calls his own sheep by name" (verse 3), and the point of that, I believe, is that however many there may be (myriads, if we consider all the saints together), the fact is that every one is known and loved personally by Christ.<a name=100:3></a> Paul puts it very simply when he speaks about "the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=100:4></a> Do you ever have a sense of that at the Supper?<a name=100:5></a> -- He loved me and gave Himself for me.<a name=100:6></a> What an impetus it gives in our souls, and surely He becomes the Centre of the company.<a name=100:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, Mary served too, and in a way that was entirely suitable.<a name=100:8></a> She anointed the feet of Jesus: "having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment".<a name=100:9></a> What an effect true love for Christ has!<a name=100:10></a> Mary loved Him.<a name=100:11></a> She was not drawing attention to herself.<a name=100:12></a> Her thoughts and her affections were focused on this Man, this Person, whom she knew and loved so well, but the effect of what she did filled the house.<a name=100:13></a> The Lord commended her for what she had done.<a name=100:14></a> He has His own way of showing approval.<a name=100:15></a> It is not that we are publicly rewarded, but in one of the addresses to the overcomer in the beginning of Revelation, it says, "I will give to him a white stone" (chapter 2: 17), that is, a token of His own

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>we have a different aspect (and we never cease to marvel at the wisdom of the Spirit of God in causing Scripture to be written as He did), because here we have what we might call an ideal picture, or outline, of what a local assembly is.<a name=101:3></a> Now plainly Corinth was not up to that in practice, and yet the apostle uses these choice expressions: "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,) so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you to the end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=101:4></a> What words these are!<a name=101:5></a> As we read the body of the epistle we discover the conditions that actually existed, and we might well have cause to wonder.<a name=101:6></a> We could understand Paul writing thus to the Ephesians perhaps, and yet, as remarked, we see the wisdom of the Spirit of God in it, because if Paul could write this to the Corinthians as they then were, then it would help us in relation to the view that we take of local companies.<a name=101:7></a> We would begin to see them as God sees them, and to value what is there as God values it.<a name=101:8></a> This is the view, in one sense, that Balaam was obliged to give

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We might go further on into this first chapter of 1 Corinthians and find there that God has chosen the weak and the ignoble things of the world (verse 27, 28).<a name=102:8></a> Who of us has a claim to be anything?<a name=102:9></a> We have been chosen by sovereign mercy, we have been maintained by divine grace, and God in His wisdom has chosen to set saints together in order that the finest thoughts that divine Persons have conceived may be worked out amongst them.<a name=102:10></a> Paul here speaks of himself as an apostle, and "Sosthenes the brother".<a name=102:11></a> It is interesting that he allies himself with a

		What has God for such as repent?<a name=109:3></a> Well, He has Christ for all such.<a name=109:4></a> It is not merely some change or blessing in ourselves that we get, but Christ.<a name=109:5></a> God has no remedy, no resource, no blessing for man but Christ.<a name=109:6></a> Repentance and the reception of Christ lead to the great gain of having the Spirit.<a name=109:7></a> The apostles' teaching was the setting forth of Christ.<a name=109:8></a> I should like to call your attention to seven things which are found here, and which may be said to constitute the apostles' teaching.<a name=109:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, Jesus the Nazaraean was "a man borne witness to by God" (verse 22).<a name=109:10></a> Christ is the subject of every divine testimony.<a name=109:11></a> Look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:32">John  5:32</a> - 39.<a name=109:12></a> Here we see a fourfold witness to Christ -- that of John the baptist, of His own works, of the Father and of the Scriptures.<a name=109:13></a> Every divine testimony really centres in Christ.<a name=109:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing, beloved friends, to see that God's pleasure is to introduce that blessed Person to our hearts.<a name=109:15></a> God is set on filling us with blessing in Christ.<a name=109:16></a> We cannot find blessing anywhere but in Him, but we shall find everything to meet our consciences and satisfy our hearts if we receive God's witness to His beloved Son.<a name=109:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#81:10">Psalm  81:10</a> - 16 we see what God had in His mind for Israel, but they would have none of Him.<a name=109:18></a> They closed their hearts against His testimony.<a name=109:19></a> No doubt God will in a coming day bring them into

		blessing, but meantime we are in His thoughts for blessing.<a name=110:1></a> God is saying to us, "open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it".<a name=110:2></a> He is waiting to feed us with the finest of the wheat and to satisfy us with honey out of the rock.<a name=110:3></a> How important that we should not miss this!<a name=110:4></a> How careful should we be not to miss the blessed testimony of the Holy Spirit to Christ now!<a name=110:5></a> God has no blessing for us outside Christ -- no delight or pleasure but in Him.<a name=110:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, "him, given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (verse 23).<a name=110:7></a> Why was He thus given up to death?<a name=110:8></a> Because if we were to be filled with blessing in Him, He must die to remove us and our sins.<a name=110:9></a> We have to see that that is the way that God has taken.<a name=110:10></a> God has, if I may so say, relieved Himself of all that in us which was obnoxious to Him.<a name=110:11></a> Sins were before Him -- Christ has become the propitiation for them.<a name=110:12></a> Man the sinner was there -- Christ has come in the likeness of sinful flesh and gone into death to bear his condemnation and to put him out of God's sight, not only in holy judgment but in holy love.<a name=110:13></a> God has been glorified about all we have done and all we are, and He can now speak to us of Christ.<a name=110:14></a> How near this brings the love of God to us when we see the way He has taken to set us aside so that He might fill us with the blessedness of Another, and that His own beloved Son!<a name=110:15></a> To know the love of God we must look at the cross.<a name=110:16></a> We can never measure its depths, but it is a delight to see that God, by the death of Jesus, has cleared the ground righteously so that we might be fully blessed in Him.<a name=110:17></a>

		Third, "ye, by the hand of lawless men, have crucified and slain" (verse 23).<a name=111:1></a> This shows us the place Christ has in the estimation of the world.<a name=111:2></a> He is not allowed a place here; He is disallowed indeed of men.<a name=111:3></a> So much so that if you find a person really giving Christ a place you feel sure it is a work of God.<a name=111:4></a> People think that things have changed because of the progress of religion, etc.<a name=111:5></a>, but there is no place for Christ in the unconverted heart today any more than there was then.<a name=111:6></a> The man who does not receive Christ is really in the same spirit as those who crucified Him.<a name=111:7></a> He says in his heart, 'I do not want Him, I have no room for Him'.<a name=111:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it not a wonderful thing, beloved friends, that the finger of God has touched us, and made room for Christ in our hearts?<a name=111:9></a> It is having Christ that puts the Christian outside the world, whether politically, socially or religiously.<a name=111:10></a> If he speaks of Christ to his political friends, or at the social party, all are made uncomfortable; a cloud comes over the scene and he is told, 'This is not the place for such subjects'.<a name=111:11></a> It is the same in the religious circle.<a name=111:12></a> You may talk of the minister, the choir, the bazaar for charitable purposes, etc.<a name=111:13></a>, but speak of Christ -- of His love, His death, His resurrection, His glory -- and there is no response; you find you are not wanted.<a name=111:14></a> There is no more place for Christ in the religious world of today than in the land where He was crucified.<a name=111:15></a> If Christ really has a place in your heart it will put you outside things here; you will find that you cannot go along with the world.<a name=111:16></a>

		The disciples must have had the thought that when Christ got a place here they would share it with Him.<a name=113:6></a> But He gets a place <i>there</i> and shares that place with His own.<a name=113:7></a> He has companions in His joy; God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions.<a name=113:8></a> He has sanctified us by His death in order that we might share His joy.<a name=113:9></a> Is it not a wonderful thing to belong to such a Person, and to have such a portion with Him?<a name=113:10></a> But, remember, it is all on the resurrection side.<a name=113:11></a>

		Fifth, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God" (verse 33).<a name=113:12></a> Christ is rejected here, but exalted there.<a name=113:13></a> Men try to make it appear as if Christ had a place on earth -- a place of honour here -- but it is not so.<a name=113:14></a> The world that cast Him out and slew Him now builds costly and magnificent edifices

		And now having arrived in our thought at this the highest of the three broad categories of service mentioned (page 372, <i>MOW 1996</i>), let us notice that activities which we might think of in the first instance as falling within the first or second categories (pages 372 - 376, <i>MOW 1996</i>) ought to be viewed, and undertaken, in this priestly way -- with our souls very near to God -- if they are to be carried out in a manner acceptable to God (and this, let us remind ourselves in passing, is the test of true 'success').<a name=124:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, referring to the first category -- the sense in which our whole lives are to be lived in the service of God -- the apostle Paul, in writing to the Romans, in chapter 6 speaks simply and generally of yielding ourselves to God for the service of righteousness; but in chapter 12: 1 - 3, after the outburst of worship with which chapter 11 closes, he brings forward this practical exhortation in a developed and deepened form, with a more intimate appeal and an added refinement of thought: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to <i>present</i> your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service".<a name=124:3></a> The word for "service" here is the same priestly word, just as the word "present" brings before the mind the act of placing our bodies on the altar once for all for the service of God; a sacrifice, but a living one.<a name=124:4></a> This

	</div>

		done, we shall be ready for the levitical and other services which the rest of chapter 12 brings before us.<a name=125:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An interesting practical example of this priestly mind in connection with more ordinary services will be found in the narrative of Paul's voyage in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27">Acts  27</a>.<a name=125:2></a> Brought into contact with soldiers and sailors, among whom he was a prisoner, he is able to take a practical interest in their welfare in circumstances of much distress; yet however considerate and helpful his action towards his fellow-travellers, he is, first and always, serving God in his spirit, so that he can speak naturally to them, and in a way that must have carried conviction, of the God "whose I am and whom I serve" (verse 23).<a name=125:3></a> And when he encourages them to take food for their bodily needs it is deemed worthy of record that having "taken a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all" (verse 35) -- again a priestly action, not by any means to be omitted.<a name=125:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are illustrations of the priestly character which should not be absent from services of a simple kind.<a name=125:5></a> Equally those services which we should naturally regard as in the second category (pages 372 - 376, <i>MOW 1996</i>), which has been called levitical, should be carried out with the same spiritual mind which serves God continually in prayer and thanks-giving.<a name=125:6></a> Among all services which seem naturally to fall into this category -- that is, what we usually think of as service -- the preaching of the gospel is the most obvious, yet it is in just this connection that the apostle introduces the thought of priesthood and

		sacrifice: "God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always beseeching at my prayers" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:9">Romans  1:9</a>).<a name=126:1></a> And in chapter 15 he speaks of carrying on his work among the Gentiles as a sacrificial service, "the message of glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit" (verse 16).<a name=126:2></a> If the service of the gospel is taken up with this mind it will not lack that character of spiritual refinement, as of the fine flour of the meat-offering, which properly belongs to it.<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus these three categories of service run into one another; we may distinguish them to help our thought, but our distinctions must not be too rigid, or they will hinder our further understanding.<a name=126:4></a> To classify the truth of God is like trying to classify the stars of heaven; it may not be impossible, but at least there is more in it than meets the eye, and our first attempts will be subject to revision.<a name=126:5></a> Thus our endeavour to understand the meaning of the service of God by viewing it broadly under three categories has brought us to see that all service should properly be governed by what we are in the highest category, that is, as priests, worshipping God and offering to God.<a name=126:6></a> This is no arbitrary conclusion, no accident; the principle may be seen in type in Israel, where in the service of God both Levites and people were directed by the priests.<a name=126:7></a> Only in Christianity all are properly priests, besides being also Levites and common people.<a name=126:8></a>

		It comes to this then, that if we are to "serve God acceptably with reverence and fear" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:28">Hebrews  12:28</a>) we must learn what it is to be priests to God.<a name=127:1></a> And we find our place in spirit in that priesthood, if, having "tasted that the Lord is good" -- which is the first great step in blessing -- we come to Him as the One disallowed of men, but chosen of God; this is the second great step.<a name=127:2></a> "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=127:3></a> If we have found our place in that holy priesthood toward God we are then to be, in relation to men, "a <i>kingly</i> priesthood .<a name=127:4></a>.<a name=127:5></a>.<a name=127:6></a> that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:3">1 Peter  2:3</a> - 5, 9).<a name=127:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We find the same order of thought as to sacrifice and service in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13">Hebrews  13</a>.<a name=127:8></a> First, and generally, "We have an altar", that is, we Christians; actually the contrast there is with the Jews who still served the tabernacle; "We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle".<a name=127:9></a> In other words, there are established in Christianity the true basis and conditions of worship and fellowship.<a name=127:10></a> Secondly, these conditions are dependent on our coming to the One who is disallowed of men: "let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach".<a name=127:11></a> Hence, thirdly, the exercise of our holy priesthood: "By him therefore let us offer the

	<div class="paragraph">
		sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of the lips confessing his name".<a name=128:1></a> And fourthly, such worship of God is to be accompanied by beneficent activity towards men, in the exercise of a royal priesthood: "But of doing good and communicating of your substance be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:10">Hebrews  13:10</a> - 16).<a name=128:2></a>

		If we want to see still further how these principles work out in practice, we may notice how the three categories of service alluded to (pages 372 - 376, <i>MOW 1996</i>) are all comprehended in the reference to the widows in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5">1 Timothy  5</a>.<a name=147:2></a> Some people might be disposed to think that widows were not a class whose opportunities of service would be the widest or most varied.<a name=147:3></a> However that may be, we may learn something from the illustration; and the reader will be able to find for himself in the Scriptures innumerable examples of services appropriate to men, or women, or both.<a name=147:4></a>

		After the remark that "she who is a widow indeed .<a name=147:5></a>.<a name=147:6></a>.<a name=147:7></a> continues in supplications and prayers night and day" (a truly priestly activity), the apostle commends those who "have brought up children .<a name=147:8></a>.<a name=147:9></a>.<a name=147:10></a> have exercised hospitality .<a name=147:11></a>.<a name=147:12></a>.<a name=147:13></a> have washed saints' feet .<a name=147:14></a>.<a name=147:15></a>.<a name=147:16></a> have imparted relief to the distressed .<a name=147:17></a>.<a name=147:18></a>.<a name=147:19></a> have diligently followed every good work" -- surely a liberal variety of service!<a name=147:20></a>

		"Have brought up children": this is a work which falls to the lot of thousands in the ordinary course of nature; but what a service to God and men if done in the fear of God!<a name=147:21></a> What patient labour and unremitting care are demanded, what difficulties to be overcome and questions to be solved, major problems many, and minor troubles every day, calling for firmness and kindness, wisdom and grace; but offering too,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Have exercised hospitality": this may also be regarded as a duty of ordinary life, but in its context here the reference, as in other passages in the Epistles and the Acts, is primarily to the provision of hospitality for those brethren whose occupation, whether in the Lord's service or perhaps in their ordinary calling, led them to travel from place to place.<a name=148:2></a> For a sister or a brother to receive such 'strangers', in heathen cities where congenial accommodation might not be easy to find, was a service often of a 'levitical' character, and in any case of no mean order.<a name=148:3></a> (Compare <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:2">Hebrews  13:2</a>; <a href="../bible/3John.htm#5">3 John  5</a>- 8).<a name=148:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Have washed saints' feet": here we are back to a service of the highest class, peculiarly priestly, only possible to be done in close communion with God; for the reference is surely to no material act, but to that rare service of spiritual contact and help which can only proceed from one who is living near to God; that 'washing of the feet' which, with a humility which avoids any occasion of offence and a delicacy which hardly pretends to offer help, yet succeeds in bringing refreshment, purification, and comfort to the soul of another.<a name=148:5></a> The kindest act that any saint can do for any other is thus practically to bring the grace of Christ afresh to bear upon him.<a name=148:6></a> We are reminded of the Lord's words, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me .<a name=148:7></a>.<a name=148:8></a>.<a name=148:9></a> He that

		"Have imparted relief to the distressed": a service which, according to circumstances, might come into any or all of the three categories mentioned on pages 372 - 376, <i>MOW 1996</i>; and the need for it is always with us.<a name=149:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Have diligently followed every good work".<a name=149:3></a> It is unfortunate that in the common speech of Christians the expression 'good works' should so often be used in a technical sense, narrowing it down to what are called, with a restriction of meaning not justified, 'christian works', 'works of charity', etc.<a name=149:4></a> The result is that we rather miss the meaning of such a scripture as "Let your light so shine before men, that they may <i>see your good works</i>, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:16">Matthew  5:16</a>, Authorised Version).<a name=149:5></a> The meaning is not, of course, that men may take notice of any specific christian 'works of service' in us -- that would be likely to glorify <i>us</i> -- but that all our actions should be such as to represent truly before men the character of God, whose holy Name is called upon us.<a name=149:6></a> The idea of good works in the Scripture is comprehensive, as well as pure: "the God of peace .<a name=149:7></a>.<a name=149:8></a>.<a name=149:9></a> perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you that which is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for the ages of ages.<a name=149:10></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:20">Hebrews  13:20</a>, 21).<a name=149:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Reflecting on the examples of service given in the passage, we may note certain general features.<a name=150:4></a> The deeds mentioned, invaluable as they are, are not generally such as to bring the servant himself (or herself) into any special prominence.<a name=150:5></a> Nor are they altogether those that would occur to an enthusiastic Christian who, starting out (like Peter, see <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:33">Luke  22:33</a>), ready to do something of note, looks either to himself or to the organisations of men for direction.<a name=150:6></a> Yet they seem to be natural enough to anyone who, not putting the idea of his own achievement or his own service in the middle of the picture, desires simply and wholeheartedly, in humility and sacrifice of self, to please his Lord and do that which is right and show love, especially in activities which lie near home (where charity begins), without any thought of the approval of the world -- even the religious world -- or of pursuing some interest of which men can take cognisance.<a name=150:7></a> Such services might not, any more than those of the household of Stephanas, readily lend themselves to a descriptive article in the newspapers.<a name=150:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many other passages in both the Old and the New Testament, while throwing light on the ways in which the "bondman of God" may unaffectedly serve Him, indicate clearly that the idea of service as set before us in the Scriptures, starting as it does from a definite acknowledgment of the will of God --

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is beautiful to note how the Lord pours out His heart to this company in Philadelphia.<a name=156:3></a> There is no blame, no remonstrance, but He speaks to them with perfect confidence, exhorting them to hold fast till He comes, and adding, "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God".<a name=156:4></a> If you love the interests of Christ, you will be prepared to stand for all that is set forth in the temple, and the result is, you will be a pillar.<a name=156:5></a>

		Then it goes on, "and I will write upon him the name of my God".<a name=156:6></a> His Name covers all His interests today, and as we move together in brotherly love, those interests engage and control our hearts, so that together we espouse what is for the pleasure of God.<a name=156:7></a> The Lord would remind us we have not long to wait, "I come quickly", He says, "hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".<a name=156:8></a> Then, as we were saying, He addresses the overcomer.<a name=156:9></a> He would have us to be overcomers, He would have us carry in our hearts today a sense of triumph.<a name=156:10></a>

		I read the passages in Zephaniah because I felt that inasmuch as they describe the comfort vouchsafed to the remnant in a trying day just at the close of a dispensation, they are applicable to our hearts at a moment like this.<a name=157:3></a> So in chapter 2 the prophet addresses himself to those set for the Lord's interests.<a name=157:4></a> "Seek Jehovah, all ye meek of the land, who have performed his ordinance; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger".<a name=157:5></a> It reminds one of what the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, <i>I</i> also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=157:6></a> The remnant in the prophet's day were preserved -- hid -- under the hand of the Lord; we, on the other hand, are to be taken up out of the evil, those who are not earth-dwellers are to be taken away from the scene of judgment.<a name=157:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, referring again to our scripture in Zephaniah, we have the Lord's promise of support to the "meek of the land", then it says, "Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites!<a name=157:8></a> The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant".<a name=157:9></a> I think it is important to see the Lord taking account in this way of the public thing which

		The Lord Jesus makes this fresh appeal: "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies".<a name=203:11></a><a name=203:8></a> In the closing days of the dispensation, beloved, I think there will still be local assemblies because that is the way that God has taken in His wisdom to work out these great thoughts of His.<a name=203:12></a><a name=203:9></a> And the Lord is testifying in the assemblies, "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star".<a name=203:13></a><a name=203:10></a> We often sing, 'The Star's in the sky' (<a href=".<a name=203:14></a>.<a name=203:15></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=203:16></a>htm#194:1">Hymn 194</a>), but I think the Star should be in our hearts, the Harbinger of the day, the One who brings in the day.<a name=203:17></a> It is the Lord Jesus Himself that we are looking for.<a name=203:18></a> Soon He will come to take all His own to be with Himself.<a name=203:19></a> And there is this characteristic answer even now, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=203:20></a> I think that involves His appearing, when He will come into His rights, and will display to a wondering world all that God has effected in His saints.<a name=203:21></a> Again He says, "He that testifies these things says, Yea, I come quickly".<a name=203:22></a> The appeal here is that we might be with the Lord, and the Spirit, and saying, "come, Lord Jesus".<a name=203:23></a> May we be able indeed now to say, Come, to the Lord Jesus, for it would deliver us from things here, and keep our eyes ever looking towards that glorious day when He will appear and

		I want to speak of what Peter says to us as brethren.<a name=204:4></a> I suppose we all have a kind of fondness for Peter, because a good deal of his history is recorded for us and provides much help, practical comfort and encouragement, and correction, too.<a name=204:5></a> He was a great lover of the brethren, just as John was, and Paul, and all the apostles.<a name=204:6></a> The Lord would not have commissioned an apostle after His resurrection if he was not a lover of the brethren, and coming down to our lesser service in these days, the Lord looks for it in all those who serve His people, that they are lovers of the brethren.<a name=204:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember how in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>when the Lord probed Peter three times about his attachment to Him, every time Peter answered, the Lord referred him to the brethren.<a name=204:8></a> First of all He said, "Feed my lambs" (verse 15); then He said, "Shepherd my sheep" (verse 16), and finally He said, "Feed my sheep" (verse 17).<a name=204:9></a> All those services, dear brethren, are the services of those

	<div class="paragraph">
		who love the brethren.<a name=205:1></a> So Peter is well qualified to speak to us about our love for one another.<a name=205:2></a> That is what I want to speak about particularly, the way Peter enjoined others, as he says here, to "love one another out of a pure heart fervently".<a name=205:3></a> There will not be much for Christ in these days if brethren are not found loving one another out of a pure heart fervently.<a name=205:4></a> We were talking about revival.<a name=205:5></a> When the revival comes in towards the end of church history in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>, it is in a place the name of which means 'brotherly love' -- Philadelphia.<a name=205:6></a> So that is what has happened in the last days.<a name=205:7></a> Saints have been attached to Christ by the Spirit, and as that attachment grows and becomes more fervent, they become more attached to one another and learn together to maintain what is for Christ and for God's pleasure.<a name=205:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Peter is telling us to be on that line.<a name=205:9></a> He says here in chapter 1, "Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently".<a name=205:10></a> We have, I trust, become obedient to the truth.<a name=205:11></a> That is how our souls are purified and it leads to unfeigned brotherly love.<a name=205:12></a> That is what we need; not just a pretext, nor something that is only displayed from time to time, but something that is continued and which goes through every kind of circumstance.<a name=205:13></a> Brethren find, in these days when the enemy has attacked and is attacking so much, that we get comfort in unfeigned brotherly love.<a name=205:14></a> Through it we become a support to one another in relation to what is for Christ and for God, and that flows out of what we

		<a name=206>[Page 206]</a>

		might call the new nature.<a name=206:1></a> That is what he says here: "being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God".<a name=206:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These affections then are the product of the divine work, not just that we have natural affinities, that I like so-and-so and am attached to him or her, but that we have spiritual affinities.<a name=206:3></a> They are the affections of persons who have been born again "by the living and abiding word of God".<a name=206:4></a> What a great thought it is, dear brethren, that God has operated like this by His word so that something now has come into view that is not of the first man at all, but the product of God's own action by His word; we are born of incorruptible seed "by the living and abiding word of God".<a name=206:5></a> What a wonderful thing to be connected with things that are incorruptible.<a name=206:6></a> A generation has come into view that is of incorruptible seed so that what is for God can be maintained according to God.<a name=206:7></a> The conditions in which we are in flesh and blood are corruptible and mortal.<a name=206:8></a> Thank God there is something incorruptible in the brethren.<a name=206:9></a> They have been born again "not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God".<a name=206:10></a>

		There is the flesh and its glory; the world system is organised to make way for that.<a name=206:11></a> The world does not make way for what is spiritual.<a name=206:12></a> Certainly it promotes what is of the flesh and the glory of the flesh, but these enlightened persons, born again, know that "all flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass.<a name=206:13></a> The grass has withered and its flower has

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter says these things to us, dear brethren, in order that we might be in a circle of affection where there is unfeigned brotherly love, where we love one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is to be an incorruptible line of things.<a name=208:8></a> The flesh and its glory come to nothing, but love will not come to nothing.<a name=208:9></a> No, love will abide and the work and service of love at the present time towards one another will produce results which will abide and go through into the world of glory that the Lord Jesus will shortly introduce.<a name=208:10></a> Let us be encouraged then to love one another fervently out of a pure heart so that we are bound together as those who belong to one another and belong to the Lord; for it is true that we belong to one another, and so we are in this family.<a name=208:11></a> John opens up the family side more than Peter does, but they both knew it.<a name=208:12></a> Peter opened up more the kingdom side of things, but he knew the family.<a name=208:13></a> All these things interlock in Christianity.<a name=208:14></a> You will not be in the good of the family if you do not know the kingdom, and you will not know much of the kingdom if you do not know the family.<a name=208:15></a> It is a great thing to know, dear brethren, that there is power to carry us through.<a name=208:16></a> The kingdom is the great thought of power; the family is the great thought of love.<a name=208:17></a> Do you

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"This is the word which in the glad tidings is preached to you", the word that abides to eternity.<a name=209:8></a> This is not the popular gospel, but the disseminating of all that is involved in the glad tidings for men.<a name=209:9></a> The word of God abides for eternity.<a name=209:10></a> So we go on with the gospel preaching; it is our privilege to continue it, and if we say we only preach to ourselves, this is ourselves: "the word which in the glad tidings is preached to you", not to sinners exactly here.<a name=209:11></a> The preaching of the gospel goes on amongst the people of God because we are to get more and more into the depths of the gospel, the mystery and the glory of the glad tidings.<a name=209:12></a> "The word of the Lord abides for eternity", not merely for a temporary state of things; eternity is in view in what is being preached in the glad tidings.<a name=209:13></a> So we go on with it; but let it spring out from a company where love is active, and Peter is promoting that in this epistle.<a name=209:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Externally the people of God are suffering.<a name=209:15></a> Peter speaks much of that; suffering for the testimony, suffering for Christ's sake, but the answer to the external suffering is to be in the inside, in the affection of the circle of love.<a name=209:16></a> We would be strong in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the external testimony, dear brethren, if we knew the blessedness of love within.<a name=210:1></a> These things react on one another.<a name=210:2></a> At the beginning it was so: "And having been let go, they came to their own company" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:23">Acts  4:23</a>).<a name=210:3></a> What would they find there?<a name=210:4></a> They found the answer to all the persecution without.<a name=210:5></a> Brethren do not persecute one another; that is not in the mind of the Lord.<a name=210:6></a> You expect persecution from the world but you do not expect it from your brother.<a name=210:7></a> Why should we do that?<a name=210:8></a> We are to love one another.<a name=210:9></a> The circle within is to be the answer to the persecution without.<a name=210:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Peter encourages the brethren; He says in chapter 3, "Finally, be all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded", precious features of the christian circle.<a name=210:11></a> "All of one mind" -- that is a test, is it not?<a name=210:12></a> Scripture never puts anything before us which is unattainable.<a name=210:13></a> We have to exercise ourselves to be marked by these features.<a name=210:14></a> "Sympathising" helps towards one mind.<a name=210:15></a> "Full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded".<a name=210:16></a> These features, I have no doubt, marked Peter himself.<a name=210:17></a> How he loved the people of God!<a name=210:18></a> He carried out the commission the Lord gave him, this epistle being written to some of the scattered sheep of Christ.<a name=210:19></a> He is thinking of the Jews who were scattered around in the various places he mentions.<a name=210:20></a> He cannot be with them, but his letter is with them.<a name=210:21></a> And, dear brethren, if we have not the presence of the apostles now, we have the presence of one another.<a name=210:22></a> Let us make the best of one another.<a name=210:23></a> Why should we not?<a name=210:24></a> Why should the Lord place certain brethren in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scriptures have doubtless very much in mind the day in which we live.<a name=211:6></a> The Lord said that in the last days, "because lawlessness shall prevail, the love of the most shall grow cold" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:12">Matthew  24:12</a>).<a name=211:7></a> I think that has happened and is happening, but He did not say the love of <i>all</i> would grow cold; "the love of the most".<a name=211:8></a> The word of Christ shows what the general trend would be, but if you are in the minority, be in it fervently for Christ and for His people.<a name=211:9></a> The Lord knew that there would be some who would maintain affection for Him and who would love one another in the last days.<a name=211:10></a> So let us not be influenced by the general current around.<a name=211:11></a> If there is one thing we have to watch and judge constantly, it is the Laodicean atmosphere and influence that is everywhere, selfishness and empty pride marking so many with lack of affection for Christ.<a name=211:12></a> Their love has grown cold.<a name=211:13></a> The Lord said, "thou art neither cold nor hot" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:15">Revelation  3:15</a>).<a name=211:14></a> What a state!<a name=211:15></a> Let us be fervent; that is Peter's word, and in this section, "full of brotherly love".<a name=211:16></a> The way to work these things out amongst ourselves, dear

		Solomon's wife, Pharaoh's daughter, is another type of the assembly.<a name=217:13></a> This type will find its full answer when the assembly appears with Christ and is associated with Him in His reign of glory.<a name=217:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three thoughts which stand out prominently in this type.<a name=217:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) Solomon's wife was a <i>gentile</i> bride.<a name=217:16></a> This circumstance as a type does not conflict with the view of the assembly as composed of those from both Jews and Gentiles, as brought before us in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> and <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:4">Ephesians  3:4</a>.<a name=217:17></a> It rather emphasises the fact that the dispensation, as such, has distinct reference to the Gentiles, and that the blessing of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jew or Israel is not the characteristic of the present period.<a name=218:1></a> The apostle Paul, to whom the mystery was revealed, was characteristically the apostle of the Gentiles.<a name=218:2></a> He speaks of himself thus in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:13">Romans  11:13</a> and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:16">Romans  15:16</a>; and in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:1">Ephesians  3:1</a>.<a name=218:3></a> He speaks of himself as a "prisoner .<a name=218:4></a>.<a name=218:5></a>.<a name=218:6></a> for you Gentiles" (Authorised Version).<a name=218:7></a> The epistle to the Galatians also refers to his distinct labour among the Gentiles (chapter 2: 9).<a name=218:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this view of the assembly that is especially developed in the epistle to the Colossians, and as I have already remarked, the mystery is spoken of in that epistle as "Christ in you the hope of glory" (chapter 1: 27).<a name=218:9></a> The thought of Christ being in or among the Gentiles must have appeared a most remarkable fact to a Jew.<a name=218:10></a> It is the sovereign nature of the activity of grace that is thus magnified.<a name=218:11></a> That we who had no hope and were in all the darkness of heathendom, should be blessed in such a manner and called to such a place, is indeed grace.<a name=218:12></a> "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set him among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:8">1 Samuel  2:8</a>).<a name=218:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) This suggests another feature that comes before us in connection with Solomon's gentile bride.<a name=218:14></a> The assembly is to appear with Christ in glory, and before the day of display comes we are entitled to know our part as associated with Christ in His place of exaltation.<a name=218:15></a> It is this that gives Christianity such a remarkable character -- not only is the future glory for the assembly, but even now we are to know that Christ's place is ours.<a name=218:16></a> What a wonderful fact this is!<a name=218:17></a>
	</div>

		<a name=219>[Page 219]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though outwardly of poor account in the eyes of man, as the type of Leah suggests, the assembly is destined to share with Christ His place of glory.<a name=219:1></a> Hence the apostle's appeal in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>to set our minds on things "above where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God".<a name=219:2></a> Our life is hid at present; its display in glory is still future.<a name=219:3></a> Suffering and rejection are for the moment the actual portion of the assembly, yet enshrined in the heart of each one of that wonderful company can be found the deep and sustaining joy, that soon a wondering world shall see the One who was the rejected Nazarene crowned in glory, and universally owned as rightful King and Lord of all; and when Christ appears we also shall appear with Him in glory.<a name=219:4></a> The glory is only known to faith at present, and only by the power of the Holy Spirit is it possible to enjoy our privileged place of association with Christ; but it is none the less real.<a name=219:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unless we know something of the lessons taught us in the types of Abigail and Asnath, we shall not be able spiritually to occupy the position suggested in the type of Pharaoh's daughter.<a name=219:6></a> It is in no sense on the ground of what we are as in the flesh that we are so placed.<a name=219:7></a> We must see that Nabal, so to speak, must die.<a name=219:8></a> (See <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25">1 Samuel  25</a>).<a name=219:9></a> Flesh is flesh and as in that state we could not possibly have a place with Christ in glory.<a name=219:10></a> But we are privileged through Jesus' death and resurrection to recognise the removal of what we are as in the flesh, and identify ourselves with what we are as the product of the work of God -- the "inward man", as it is called in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>-- our new "<i>I</i>".<a name=219:11></a> This,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as we saw, is typically brought before us in Abigail's beautiful countenance and good understanding.<a name=220:1></a> These features were like David and what is like Christ can share with Christ the place of glory, of which Christ alone is worthy.<a name=220:2></a> We may well forget our own people and our father's house.<a name=220:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) The other feature that comes before us in Solomon's wife is that she was associated with Solomon in his <i>reign</i>.<a name=220:4></a> The house which Solomon built for his bride was like the porch which he built for the throne of judgment; her dwelling partook of the character of Solomon's throne.<a name=220:5></a> The reigning time for us is not yet.<a name=220:6></a> The apostle chides the saints at Corinth with this, "ye have reigned without us" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:8">1 Corinthians  4:8</a>); as much as to say, <i>Our</i> reigning time is coming, and if you reign now, you reign alone -- we shall reign when Christ reigns.<a name=220:7></a> The way we affirm Christ's right to reign is by refusing to reign until He does so.<a name=220:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although the day of the kingdom is still future, and the assembly is not yet called to judge the world, or angels, yet faith would anticipate the moral gain of that future day, and bring to bear on its present circumstances the import of the fact that presently it will be called to occupy such a place.<a name=220:9></a> "Do ye not know", the apostle inquires in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:3">1 Corinthians  6:3</a>, "that we shall judge angels?<a name=220:10></a>" Saints had been going to law one with another before unbelievers.<a name=220:11></a> Think of the degradation of such a thing, as if any human court of justice could settle a matter for the saints!<a name=220:12></a> We may well be thankful for the measure of righteousness

		maintained in human courts of justice, but the basis of their judgment is different from that of the assembly.<a name=221:1></a> The perfect judgment of the cross is the basis of the assembly's judgment.<a name=221:2></a> A spiritual man judges things by this measure now; man's judgment would be very different; and if we know what our place will be in the future, it would certainly prevent our turning to the world for right judgment or vindication now.<a name=221:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that we are to be associated with Christ in His judgment and reign would also make us desire to learn how to act for Him.<a name=221:4></a> The present is our time of education.<a name=221:5></a> The first thing is to learn to judge ourselves; many of us greatly fail here.<a name=221:6></a> There can be nothing of greater importance in its place than the habit of self-judgment.<a name=221:7></a> I do not mean self-occupation; the man who has judged a thing is not further occupied with it -- it is refused.<a name=221:8></a> Self-occupation is sometimes an indication that we have <i>not</i> really judged ourselves.<a name=221:9></a> We also have to learn morally to judge things which come before us -- to discern things.<a name=221:10></a> We are unable to do this unless we form the habit of self-judgment; but if we judge ourselves, we shall more easily discern matters that we have to deal with.<a name=221:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Purely spiritual matters are the most difficult to have to discern.<a name=221:12></a> The wiles of Satan are connected with these things, and one who appears as a minister of righteousness may, in fact, be the reverse; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:14">2 Corinthians  11:14</a>).<a name=221:13></a> Conflict in spiritual matters needs the corresponding spiritual state; we have to take the

	<div class="paragraph">
		J. N.<a name=222:10></a> Darby
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My attention has been drawn to the use of 'walking worthy'.<a name=222:11></a> In Ephesians we see its connection with the noticed force and character of the epistle.<a name=222:12></a> This treats of the Christian and then of the church's privileges, and the saint is to "walk worthy of the calling" here (chapter 4: 1), especially in church place, and the worthiness to be of that.<a name=222:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Colossians, where the glory of the Person of Christ is brought out as they were slipping away from the Head -- I do not say His headship, but the glory of Him who is Head -- they are to "walk worthily of the Lord" (chapter 1: 10).<a name=222:14></a> It is in this part that God and Father, the Lord and the Spirit are brought out.<a name=222:15></a>

		Father -- "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:1">1 Thessalonians  1:1</a>) having not intermediate and indeed demon powers, but being in direct, immediate relationship with the one true God, they are called to "walk worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory" (chapter 2: 12) -- so they were "turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God" (chapter 1: 9, 10).<a name=223:1></a>

		Philippians, in which we have the experimental condition of the Christian, and the gospel is spoken of as in conflict in the world (Paul being in the bonds of it) they were to "conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ" (chapter 1: 27).<a name=223:2></a> So Paul was "set for the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings" (chapter 1: 7) -- he speaks of the "beginning of the gospel" (chapter 4: 15) -- Timothy had served with him "in the glad tidings of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:2">1 Thessalonians  3:2</a>) -- the women had "contended along with me in the glad tidings" (chapter 4: 3) -- Paul was set "for the defence of the glad tidings" (chapter 1: 17) -- they had fellowship "in the furtherance of the glad tidings" (chapter 1: 12).<a name=223:3></a> So it will be seen that when they are called to walk worthy of it, conflict is also spoken of, for which a right walk was needed, but they were not to be terrified by their adversaries.<a name=223:4></a> The true gospel was as a cause, as a person in conflict in the world -- they who stood by it as one they contended along with, were to walk worthy of it.<a name=223:5></a> They were "labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings" (chapter 1: 27), contending along with the faith of the gospel in the world -- not 'for' the faith, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is thus in the three 'walkings worthy', I think, a practical difference though essentially the same.<a name=224:2></a> In Thessalonians it is the essential measure and its nature -- "worthy of God", imitators of God as dear children, "who calls you to his own kingdom and glory".<a name=224:3></a> Then the manifestation of what this is in a divinely perfect expression of it in Christ, "worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing".<a name=224:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>we have more our own present place in it by the Holy Spirit -- "the calling wherewith ye have been called" -- all our privileges and place being known to us through the Holy Spirit sent down when Christ was glorified -- the place we are in in connection with Him glorified now.<a name=224:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord said, "Martha, Martha".<a name=229:16></a> The Lord called her <i>twice</i>; this implies that she had acquired a certain place in the Lord's mind, she was in His mind for blessing, and something will come in for her good.<a name=229:17></a> Her name is down for blessing -- it may be through rebuffs, reproofs, knocks, but the list is there, and her name is on it for blessing.<a name=229:18></a> In Matthew

		Well, <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>keeps the village in mind, and Martha, and Mary, and Lazarus.<a name=230:12></a> We do not get Lazarus in Luke; we do get a Lazarus (chapter 16), but not this one.<a name=230:13></a> He is added in John, because if the circumstances for God in a town are to be improved, a brother and two sisters in it are better than two sisters only.<a name=230:14></a> This is a comfort to us in our day.<a name=230:15></a> So that if local conditions are to be improved, there will be personal addition; an increase in quantity as well as an increase in quality.<a name=230:16></a> What is needed generally is increase in <i>quality</i>.<a name=230:17></a> Increase in quantity without

		The next thing I call attention to is verse 5: "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus".<a name=231:10></a> Martha is mentioned first.<a name=231:11></a> At the beginning of the chapter Mary is clearly the principal one in the Lord's mind.<a name=231:12></a> She is specially drawn attention to.<a name=231:13></a> "It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick" (verse 2).<a name=231:14></a> She has the chief place among the three.<a name=231:15></a> In the three mighty ones mentioned in connection with David, there is one that is greater than the others (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23">2 Samuel  23</a>).<a name=231:16></a> Mary is the chief one here; you cannot alter that; but Mary is not my subject, it is Martha.<a name=231:17></a> The Lord has something in mind when He mentions Martha first.<a name=231:18></a> Mary is spiritual, she is never easily irritated.<a name=231:19></a> She is not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is said that Jesus loved Martha and when Jesus came (verse 21), Martha spoke to Him.<a name=232:4></a> I go on from that to point out what she needed in the way of instruction.<a name=232:5></a> She is, I may say, not very concerned about doctrine, and yet it is very necessary.<a name=232:6></a> Now, sisters -- you will pardon me for saying it -- are not generally interested in doctrine.<a name=232:7></a> They often ignore it, sad to say, and are not concerned about it.<a name=232:8></a> Lydia was very attentive to doctrine.<a name=232:9></a> The Lord opened her heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul, and, dear sisters, <i>we</i> all need to attend to the things spoken by Paul.<a name=232:10></a> Well now, Martha needed the doctrine, and we cannot have good local conditions without good doctrine.<a name=232:11></a> When Jesus came, Martha said, "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died".<a name=232:12></a>

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>is a most exhilarating psalm.<a name=321:2></a> There is a fulness about it that should stir all our hearts.<a name=321:3></a> Even the heading introducing the psalm brings in many interesting things in regard of the subject that the psalmist was about to open up: "To the chief Musician.<a name=321:4></a> Upon Shoshannim" -- which means 'lilies' -- "Of the sons of Korah.<a name=321:5></a> An instruction; -- a song of the Beloved".<a name=321:6></a> One would desire that there might be instruction for us today concerning our Beloved.<a name=321:7></a> Oh!<a name=321:8></a> that our hearts would be set aglow with fresh affection for the Lord Jesus.<a name=321:9></a> I think I can see some-thing of the inward joy of the psalmist as occupied with the object of his affections.<a name=321:10></a> When he was communicating something touching the king, it seemed as if he was entirely set free in order to present his thoughts concerning this glorious Person.<a name=321:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, the bridegroom tarrying, it is recorded, sadly, that all the virgins slept.<a name=322:4></a> May we be preserved, beloved brethren, from falling asleep just immediately prior to the coming of the Bridegroom, our Beloved.<a name=322:5></a> He is about to come.<a name=322:6></a> If there was any time when it was necessary for the spiritual senses of the saints to be active, I would say it is now.<a name=322:7></a> The psalmist refers to touch, "touching the king", and when he was contemplating this subject it set him aglow.<a name=322:8></a> Spiritual senses provide the capacity within us to be actively engaged with Christ.<a name=322:9></a> We have that capacity by the Spirit, and we need, as the scripture says, to have our "senses exercised" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:14">Hebrews  5:14</a>).<a name=322:10></a> If we do not, we may fall asleep and may miss the choicest things that the Spirit of God would engage us with towards the end of this dispensation.<a name=322:11></a> The Lord would lead us, as it were, into that river to the ankles, to the knees, to the loins, until we reach the depth and fulness of waters to swim in (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47">Ezekiel  47</a>).<a name=322:12></a> Oh!<a name=322:13></a> beloved brethren, let our senses be exercised that we may take full advantage of the period we are in, when our Beloved should be before our affections, and when He is about to come.<a name=322:14></a>

		None of us here could ever have proposed anything so glorious, but it was in the affections of the Lord Jesus concerning His own, who were the objects of His love.<a name=323:1></a> We are privileged to have recorded for us that wonderful communication between the Lord and His Father, "I desire that where I am they also may be with me".<a name=323:2></a> Think of the desire of the Lord Jesus that we should be with Him.<a name=323:3></a> Well, what then can we say about Him?<a name=323:4></a> I believe the more we are occupied with the glories of Christ, the more ready we will be with our composition of praise to Himself.<a name=323:5></a> The thought of the composition bears on the psalmist's occupation.<a name=323:6></a> That is what he engaged himself with, and, one need hardly say, that if we spend all our time in occupation with the things of this life, then we are hardly likely to have a ready tongue and pen touching the King.<a name=323:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it is a present service of the Spirit of God, so readily rendered, to engage our hearts with our Beloved, so that our tongues should be ready in the outflow of response to Him who is so worthy: "Blest theme of adoration!<a name=323:8></a>" May our hearts rise with adoring affection, both individually and collectively, so that there might be a flow in assembly response towards the Lord Jesus.<a name=323:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One thing which interests me about those spoken of in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>is their long-range view.<a name=324:5></a> Moses is credited with looking forward to Christ, choosing to be identified with the suffering people of God, and the reproach of the Christ.<a name=324:6></a> Abraham was waiting for a city.<a name=324:7></a> What city?<a name=324:8></a> The establishment of earthly Jerusalem?<a name=324:9></a> No, he was looking for a heavenly city.<a name=324:10></a> There will certainly be an earthly Jerusalem, for God will see that His thoughts in regard of His earthly people are upheld and established, but that was not the city Abraham was looking for.<a name=324:11></a> He had his senses exercised and was able to look well ahead.<a name=324:12></a> What sight he had, looking forward to the establishment of the heavenly city!<a name=324:13></a> He will not form part of the assembly, for he belongs to a previous dispensation, but I think he will have access to the enjoyment of much of the privilege that is to be shared in that heavenly sphere.<a name=324:14></a>

		I refer to this remarkable utterance in the Song of Songs: "The voice of my beloved!<a name=327:3></a>" I think the spouse's exclamation is a bright point in the Song.<a name=327:4></a> She does not immediately add anything more about that voice, but it is as if it was her joy to have her ear attuned to hear the voice of her beloved.<a name=327:5></a> Have we an ear for the voice of the Lord Jesus?<a name=327:6></a> His sheep hear His voice.<a name=327:7></a> Oh!<a name=327:8></a> that we might have a ready ear for the communications of the Lord Jesus, so that we might hear what He has to say to us.<a name=327:9></a> The voice of the beloved meant so much to the spouse that she says, "The voice of my beloved!<a name=327:10></a> Behold, he cometh .<a name=327:11></a>.<a name=327:12></a>.<a name=327:13></a>"

		Now the Lord again finishes (chapter 13: 53).<a name=345:8></a> We can see how the learners are getting on as the Lord pursues that section of divine teaching to its conclusion.<a name=345:9></a> Our blessed Teacher never leaves us, but He completes a certain course of education, and (especially as we come up to the assembly realm) we want to understand what is the course of education, universally and locally, to which He would have us apply ourselves at any particular moment.<a name=345:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fourth section the Lord calls attention again to distinguished persons -- "two of you" (chapter 18: 19).<a name=345:11></a> We have seen how He brings forward the distinguished man who built on the rock, taking all his distinction from Christ the Rock; and then, the disciple distinguished in the faithful pursuit of Christ in a path of reproach; thirdly, the saints distinguished as learners in the house, hanging on every word of

		Christ, and getting rich unfoldings from His heart bearing on the mystery, that which has been hidden from before the foundation of the world.<a name=346:1></a> In this fourth course of instruction, bearing peculiarly now on the assembly, the Lord shows how in a broken day all that belongs to the assembly can go through in principle in the "two of you" -- two of the assembly.<a name=346:2></a> Everything relating to the assembly is workable with "two of you", and if there are two then the Lord can add.<a name=346:3></a> He makes also clear that His mind is to add to them, hence He goes on to speak of "two or three" (verse 20); and the love that would add another, would add still more; but one by one -- as Jeremiah says, "one of a city, two of a family" (chapter 3: 14), and how constantly we have occasion to thank God for such additions in the tenderness of divine mercy.<a name=346:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then before finishing these words, and with-drawing from Galilee (chapter 19: 1), the Lord answers Peter's question as to forgiveness with this searching parable, in which He makes clear that if one has been forgiven, the only righteous thing to do is to forgive.<a name=346:5></a> This man was forgiven and would not forgive.<a name=346:6></a> It is untrue to say, 'I enjoy the forgiveness of sins', if I have the least feeling against any of my brothers or sisters in demand, for we only enjoy forgiveness in divine favour as we are forgiving.<a name=346:7></a> This parable the Lord leaves with the brethren at the close of this great course of education, beginning at chapter 16, involving the assembly, for it is the great vessel of grace where forgiveness is dispensed; and it can still

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have throughout the gospel like a golden thread these five features of the Lord finishing; He began and then He finished, and now we come to the last section of His teaching, closing in chapter 26: 1.<a name=347:4></a> It bears upon the ground being held for the despised and rejected Heir.<a name=347:5></a> He is away in chapter 25; for the Bridegroom comes, which means that He has been away, and He appears in all the love which has characterised Him while He has been absent.<a name=347:6></a> Then in chapter 25: 14 the man goes away, leaving his servants with their commission to put into circulation his substance in view of increase on his return.<a name=347:7></a> The servants of Christ are left here to carry on in His absence, as drawing upon His resources, and they are tested thereby.<a name=347:8></a> There are the faithful five-talent and two-talent persons, and the unfaithful man with the one talent, who did not know his master's heart, and therefore could not put to use what he appeared to have as trading capital during his master's absence.<a name=347:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For spiritual trading there is no capital but love.<a name=347:10></a> We might say that the apostle had, under the Lord,

	<div class="paragraph">
		We can see that the Lord's supremacy is in evidence right through; firstly as the King in His beauty; then as the Lord of the harvest; thirdly as the great Expositor of the mind of God; fourthly as the Builder of the assembly; and finally as the still-rejected yet coming Heir of all.<a name=348:7></a> Oh!<a name=348:8></a> dear brethren, let us give ourselves to that blessed Teacher, and go on steadily with divine teaching; for if our minds are not absorbing what will qualify us for our place in that coming world of glory, as well as to take up our part in the assembly now, we shall be imbibing the poison that is around, to our moral destruction.<a name=348:9></a>

		Before dwelling upon Rebecca as a type of the church, it will be well briefly to consider Isaac as a type of Christ, and also to allude to the unnamed servant who was instrumental in discovering the chosen bride and conducting her to Isaac.<a name=349:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Typically speaking, Isaac had died and had risen again before his bride was given to him; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:19">Hebrews  11:19</a> clearly show this.<a name=349:5></a> He thus typifies Christ as the One who has taken a new place in resurrection, all links with this earth having been broken in His death.<a name=349:6></a> Abraham's repeated injunction to his trusted servant, "bring not my son thither again" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:6">Genesis  24:6</a>, 8) emphasises the fact that the bride was to be conducted to Isaac in his new place; or, in words which befit the antitype, the church is to be conducted to Christ as risen from the dead.<a name=349:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting also to note that Sarah, Abraham's wife and Isaac's mother, had died before Rebecca became Isaac's wife.<a name=349:8></a> Sarah typifies Israel.<a name=349:9></a> In Jesus' death Israel was cut off and ceased to occupy the place on earth of God's people.<a name=349:10></a> The Lord Jesus felt this, as we may see in His weeping over Jerusalem because of its rejection of Him; for His rejection involved their being broken off because of

		unbelief (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>).<a name=350:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another detail of interest is that Abraham had given to Isaac all that he had (verse 36).<a name=350:2></a> Isaac was heir of all.<a name=350:3></a> So with regard to the antitype, Christ, we read, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>).<a name=350:4></a> And again, "All things that the Father has are mine" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:15">John  16:15</a>).<a name=350:5></a> Everything is to be headed up in Christ (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:10">Ephesians  1:10</a>), and all things are to be made subject to Him (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:8">Hebrews  2:8</a>); He is the appointed Heir of all things (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>).<a name=350:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With these features in the type before us, it is clear that the Lord Jesus is here presented in His new place as risen, the Father having given all things into His hand.<a name=350:7></a> It is of the greatest moment to understand the Lord's position, for His place determines that of the church.<a name=350:8></a> If He be presented as glorified, then the church is viewed as associated with Him in glory, and sharing all with Him.<a name=350:9></a> If He be rejected, the church is to have part in His rejection; if He be as a stranger, then she is to be a stranger here also.<a name=350:10></a> Hence the view of the Lord set forth in Isaac determines the view of the assembly as presented in Rebecca.<a name=350:11></a> Christ, who has died and risen again, and who is in heaven, is the One to whom the church is to be conducted by the unnamed servant.<a name=350:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not difficult to see that the service of the Holy Spirit is typically set forth in Abraham's servant.<a name=350:13></a> His name is not given in this chapter; he describes himself as Abraham's servant.<a name=350:14></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>, 27; <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:13">John  16:13</a>, etc.<a name=350:15></a>, we have the Holy Spirit spoken of as coming in this character.<a name=350:16></a> He is sent of

		the Father, bears witness to Christ, and says all that is given Him to tell.<a name=351:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is exceedingly wonderful that the Holy Spirit should be brought before us in this way.<a name=351:2></a> The Son became a Servant as Man, taking a bondman's form (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:7">Philippians  2:7</a>).<a name=351:3></a> The Holy Spirit has not become incarnate, however, though He is as really here today as the Lord Jesus was when He walked in Galilee and Judea.<a name=351:4></a> He dwells in believers.<a name=351:5></a> And one of the objects of His being here is to bring to light a bride for Christ, and to conduct her across the desert to Him.<a name=351:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since this is the case, how needful that we should be subject to His leading, as suggested in the typical expression, "And the servant took Rebecca, and went away".<a name=351:7></a> It is only as we go the Spirit's way that we shall be conducted to our Isaac, Christ.<a name=351:8></a> Esau sold his birthright and went his way; but the servant took Rebecca and went his way .<a name=351:9></a>.<a name=351:10></a>.<a name=351:11></a> It is only as the Holy Spirit has His way with us that we shall answer to the features of the assembly as set forth in Rebecca.<a name=351:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the behaviour exhibited in this unnamed servant of Abraham, we may learn the spirit and attitude proper in any service.<a name=351:13></a> The servant's heart was full of Isaac, and his message and the work entrusted to him were his only considerations.<a name=351:14></a> His joy was fulfilled as he at last could say, "That is my master!<a name=351:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A similar spirit is seen in John the baptist.<a name=351:16></a> The friend of the Bridegroom rejoiced to hear the Bridegroom's voice; and he suitably adds, "He must

		increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:30">John  3:30</a>).<a name=352:1></a> The apostle Paul also exhibited this same trait.<a name=352:2></a> He spoke of Christ and laboured to present the church as a chaste virgin to Christ (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>).<a name=352:3></a> The beauty of a servant is to conceal himself and give prominence to his master.<a name=352:4></a> What could be a greater joy to any servant than to conduct a soul to Christ?<a name=352:5></a> Andrew first found his own brother Simon and brought him to Jesus (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:41">John  1:41</a>, 42).<a name=352:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The servant then tells Isaac all that he had done.<a name=352:7></a> It is good to review our service in the presence of our Master, to tell Him all we have done.<a name=352:8></a> Probably there will be much failure to confess as we seek to give account of our service.<a name=352:9></a> And when all is done, we are unprofitable servants and have but done what was our duty to do (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17:10">Luke  17:10</a>).<a name=352:10></a> But our Master will also review it soon.<a name=352:11></a> What wondrous grace that He should allow us to serve Him -- we who have so sinned and dishonoured His name!<a name=352:12></a> And then at the end He will recognise every little bit that has been done out of love to Him: "He is not unrighteous to forget" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:10">Hebrews  6:10</a>).<a name=352:13></a>

		I have read these three scriptures, dear brethren, because I wish to call attention to what was engaging the mind of the apostle Paul as he was approaching the end of his course here, for, as we know, he was the minister of the assembly, and I think it is right to say that what was engaging the mind of the apostle Paul, as he drew near to the close of his history, may fittingly occupy the minds of the saints who compose the assembly, as we draw near to the end of our history.<a name=369:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have begun with the second epistle to Timothy, because that gives us the public position, that is to say the position of suffering.<a name=369:11></a> There is the position of suffering, and it is likely not to get less, but rather to get more as we draw near to the close, so the second epistle to Timothy is characterised by the thought of suffering, that idea entering into each one of the four

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		chapters of the epistle, but the fact that suffering enters into the position is in no way intended to discourage, for all through the epistle the apostle sounds a note of victory and triumph, and indeed, beloved brethren, if we will think of it for a moment, it is essential that some element of suffering should enter into our position here, however little we may feel some of us have touched it as yet.<a name=370:1></a> It is essential that the element of suffering should enter into the assembly's history, because we are to be the Lamb's wife, and not only be that, but to be displayed as the Lamb's wife, and to stand by the side of the Lamb in the day of His public glory.<a name=370:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:7">Revelation  19:7</a>, "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready"; that is, she is enhancing the occasion by her presence there.<a name=370:3></a> She is in every way in keeping with the occasion, and the Lamb being the One who has suffered supremely in order to maintain the rights of God and the truth of God, it is fitting, and indeed essential, that the assembly should take on in some degree the same character of suffering, but what one wants to call attention to in connection with this passage in second Timothy is the way the apostle is looking forward to "that day".<a name=370:4></a> It is an expression which occurs twice in the first chapter, and appears again in the passage we have read .<a name=370:5></a>.<a name=370:6></a>.<a name=370:7></a> "That day" stands in contrast with this day.<a name=370:8></a> This day has very nearly come to its end, and it is for us, dear brethren, as committed to the testimony in this day, to have definitely before our minds "that day" .<a name=370:9></a>.<a name=370:10></a>.<a name=370:11></a>

		The apostle is triumphant in this fourth chapter of second Timothy.<a name=371:1></a> He says, "<i>I</i> am already being poured out, and the time of my release is come.<a name=371:2></a> I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith".<a name=371:3></a> He was conscious that he had come to the end of his course.<a name=371:4></a> He was now just awaiting martyrdom, the completion of his course in faithfulness to the Lord and to the truth was close at hand.<a name=371:5></a> Indeed so close at hand that he could say he had finished his course, and he was, as he says, already being offered.<a name=371:6></a> But what a note of triumph, dear brethren, when he was at the close.<a name=371:7></a> He says, "I have combated the good combat"; he is not saying, 'I have fought a good fight', as though to say that he had fought well.<a name=371:8></a> The point was that the fight in which he had been engaged is "the good combat", the only fight worth being engaged in.<a name=371:9></a> "I have combated the good combat", he says, "I have finished the race, I have kept the faith", and so, dear brethren, there is constant conflict as we are set to maintain the truth.<a name=371:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He reminds Timothy, that God "has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time, but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:9">2 Timothy  1:9</a>, 10).<a name=371:11></a> What a note of triumph goes right through as the apostle speaks of these things to Timothy.<a name=371:12></a> Let us think of our having

		been called with a holy calling, beloved brethren, and that according to God's purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, but now come into being.<a name=372:1></a> Life and incorruptibility have come to light in Jesus risen from the dead, and it is available to us, so to speak, by the Spirit, so that there is no reason why we should not go on maintaining the truth in holiness right through to the end.<a name=372:2></a> Whatever influences contrary to the truth the enemy may seek to introduce, whether it be in the religious sphere, or in the political sphere, or whatever it may be, we are encouraged to go through to the end maintaining the truth in all its features in holiness, and having power for it in "the grace which is in Christ Jesus" (chapter 2: 1).<a name=372:3></a> Paul went through to the end, and at the end he says, "I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith", and now he is looking on to "that day".<a name=372:4></a> It is intended as a stimulus to us to see that we go through to the end, whatever it may cost, fighting the good fight, finishing our course, and keeping the faith, and he says, "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me" .<a name=372:5></a>.<a name=372:6></a>.<a name=372:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he goes on to mention various individuals.<a name=372:8></a> It is a serious matter to take account of, dear brethren, that when the testimony of our Lord is in question individuals come into view, and they are tested, and made manifest as to what they are, according to how they have stood in relation to the testimony of our Lord.<a name=372:9></a> It is a question of the good fight, and whether we are going on in it to the end in

	<div class="paragraph">
		faithfulness, or whether we are going to drop out of it.<a name=373:1></a> Demas dropped out of it, "having loved", it says, "the present age", and there is his name in Scripture, and millions have read about it, showing what a serious thing it is, if once we have had part in the testimony of our Lord, to drop out of it as loving this present world.<a name=373:2></a> God thinks so seriously of it, that He has caused millions to hear about Demas, a man named in Scripture, and named as having that character, that he gave up the conflict, the good fight, because he "loved the present age".<a name=373:3></a> Think of the seriousness of it, dear brethren, the seriousness of any such thing becoming true of any one of us just at these closing moments when it is a question of completion, and here is this man who, as the thing drew near to completion, so to speak, in his day, dropped out because he "loved the present age".<a name=373:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, on the other hand, Paul can point to one who was with him.<a name=373:5></a> He says, "Luke alone is with me", and then he says, "Take Mark, and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry".<a name=373:6></a> Why those two men, Luke and Mark?<a name=373:7></a> Why are they singled out?<a name=373:8></a> Why is it that those two men are so honourably mentioned?<a name=373:9></a> Is it not significant, dear brethren, that they are two men who wrote gospels, two men who were qualified to become the vessels in the hands of the Spirit of God to write gospels?<a name=373:10></a> What does that mean?<a name=373:11></a> It means that they had studied Christ.<a name=373:12></a> It must mean that.<a name=373:13></a> No one who had not studied Christ could possibly become a vessel in the hands of the Spirit to write a gospel,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and so these two men, the one who is with Paul, and the other who is serviceable to him for the ministry, are men, dear brethren, who have made Christ, so to speak, their study, and therefore they go through to the end, because they have a perfect standard before their hearts, and that is the idea.<a name=374:1></a> Luke appreciates Jesus, the heavenly Man here on earth, the dependent Man, the Man whose influence always resulted in glory to God.<a name=374:2></a> Wherever He went, whatever He said, whatever He did, according to Luke's account, people glorified God as a result of it.<a name=374:3></a> So Luke was with Paul, whose ministry, as we were reading in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, has in view the formation of the assembly, which is to be the great vessel throughout all ages for glory to God.<a name=374:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Mark was profitable for the ministry.<a name=374:5></a> How is it that he was serviceable?<a name=374:6></a> He had once been unserviceable, unprofitable, but now he is serviceable.<a name=374:7></a> How is it he has become serviceable?<a name=374:8></a> The ministry is to go on to the end, there can be no question about that, and if the ministry is to go on to the end and to be fruitful, it is urgent that those who have part in it should study Christ and take Him as their Model.<a name=374:9></a> You remember how it says in Mark, "He does all things well" (chapter 7: 37).<a name=374:10></a> What a Model for those who serve in any degree, and so Mark, who, we might have thought, was one not particularly to be taken account of, especially when we think of his early history, is brought in here at the end as one who is serviceable.<a name=374:11></a> Then there is the reference, as we are so often reminded at the present

		The view of the assembly presented in Rebecca as a type in the main resembles that which is brought before us in the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=375:7></a> We have not in Rebecca a type of the believer viewed individually, but of the assembly; nor do we have illustrated here our exercises as guilty sinners and the grace of God which meets us thus.<a name=375:8></a> There are many scriptures which bring these subjects before us, but <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>presents another side of the truth.<a name=375:9></a> Rebecca is a type of the assembly as possessing features which are pleasurable to Christ.<a name=375:10></a> The unnamed servant, as we have already seen, typifies the Holy Spirit who is sent of the Father to bring to light the assembly and to conduct her to Christ.<a name=375:11></a> But

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first essential in the purposed wife was that she had to be of Isaac's kindred.<a name=376:2></a> There had to be no disparity between Isaac and his bride.<a name=376:3></a> How blessedly true this is in regard of Christ and the assembly.<a name=376:4></a> Only those who are morally like Him could form His assembly.<a name=376:5></a> Hence He is not ashamed to call them brethren; for through the Spirit's work they have moral features which are like Himself.<a name=376:6></a> In our soul history this is to be reached by each of us individually.<a name=376:7></a> The utterance of the soul in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:22">Romans  7:22</a>, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man", is an evidence of this work of the Spirit having begun.<a name=376:8></a> And in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:50">Matthew  12:50</a>, <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:35">Mark  3:35</a> and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:21">Luke  8:21</a> we see how the Lord disclaimed relationship with those who were linked with Him according to the flesh -- His mother and His brethren -- and asserted that there were those who were morally His kindred, who heard the word of God and did it.<a name=376:9></a> Rebecca must be of Isaac's kindred.<a name=376:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If such persons exist, their features will be according to their origin.<a name=376:11></a> Hence the servant discovered Rebecca by the traits which she exhibited.<a name=376:12></a> It is indeed vain for us to assert that we are of the assembly and kindred to Christ if we

		<a name=377>[Page 377]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		exhibit none of the necessary features.<a name=377:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the features that betokened Rebecca's kindredship to Isaac was that she was ready to serve and minister refreshment.<a name=377:2></a> Is this feature of the bride seen in us?<a name=377:3></a> How exercising this is!<a name=377:4></a> The apostle Paul could refer to some who had shown love to God's name having ministered to the saints (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:10">Hebrews  6:10</a>).<a name=377:5></a> He also speaks of Onesiphorus as having oft refreshed him (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:16">2 Timothy  1:16</a>), and of Philemon it could be said, "the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother" (<a href="../bible/Philemon.htm#7">Philemon  7</a>).<a name=377:6></a> What a refreshment the little gathering at Thessalonica was to the apostle (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:7">1 Thessalonians  3:7</a>), and those at Philippi (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:7">Philippians  1:7</a>; <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:10">Philippians  4:10</a>, 16, etc.<a name=377:7></a>).<a name=377:8></a> These were surely features proper to the assembly and an evidence of being kindred to Christ.<a name=377:9></a> And we may note that the request of the servant was more than granted; there was excess.<a name=377:10></a> <a href="../bible/Philemon.htm#21">Philemon  21</a>, and <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:3">2 Corinthians  8:3</a> - 5 refer to a similar spirit.<a name=377:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These features being in evidence, the servant gave to Rebecca "a gold ring, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten shekels weight of gold".<a name=377:12></a> In like manner the Holy Spirit gives additional grace and moral adornment to the believer.<a name=377:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rebecca has now to say who she is.<a name=377:14></a> This is a point of great interest.<a name=377:15></a> To use New Testament language, she is a confessor.<a name=377:16></a> It is a moment of importance in our soul's history when we can definitely declare our spiritual origin.<a name=377:17></a> We cannot properly realise our place as of the assembly unless

	<div class="paragraph">
		we have been taught by the Spirit that we are "of God".<a name=378:1></a> We would feel unsuitable if we thought of ourselves as sinners, and any fancied dignity we may possess as of our earthly origin is only a hindrance to us.<a name=378:2></a> But recognising that the cross has removed all that we were as of Adam's race, and that God has given us a new moral existence by the work of the Holy Spirit in us, we are entitled to account ourselves as "of God".<a name=378:3></a> This is the lesson we had before us in Abigail's history, and which is typically supposed in Rebecca's case.<a name=378:4></a> It is an immense point to see that as forming part of the assembly our origin is of God and we are kindred to Christ.<a name=378:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also room, Rebecca adds, for the servant.<a name=378:6></a> Good for us if we can always speak thus.<a name=378:7></a> Some believers, alas!<a name=378:8></a> are so occupied with what is natural that they have no room for what is of the Spirit.<a name=378:9></a> But to take up our place in the assembly, which is to be for the 'comfort' of Christ, we have to learn to make room for what is of the Spirit.<a name=378:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What wonderful disclosures were made by the servant when in the house!<a name=378:11></a> Abraham's thoughts, and the way those thoughts had to be fulfilled, all formed part of the wonderful errand or message.<a name=378:12></a> So also is it with us.<a name=378:13></a> As we give place to the Holy Spirit, He is free to unfold God's purposes and counsels to us.<a name=378:14></a> The Lord said of the Spirit in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:15">John  16:15</a>, "he receives of mine, and shall announce it to you".<a name=378:15></a>
