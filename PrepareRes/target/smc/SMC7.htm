		S.McC.<a name=1:1></a> One is thinking of how our souls are built up in the knowledge of Christ in relation to the gospel and the assembly, particularly thinking of current conditions and how the truth would meet such in our souls.<a name=1:2></a> In referring to the current need, one has especially in mind the need that exists in the souls of the younger believers.<a name=1:3></a> We are living in an age that is marked by peculiar superficiality, when so much appearance is put on and becomes crystallised with many and the foundations are not right.<a name=1:4></a> Younger believers are very prone to be carried by this superficial character of things because it is developed in the schools in a peculiar way.<a name=1:5></a> It is incumbent upon us to see that our foundations are right, so that there is stability inwardly underlying all that we are outwardly, and that stability is developed and acquired as our souls are built up in the knowledge of Christ.<a name=1:6></a> Christianity involves the knowledge of divine Persons, and if our souls were built up more in the knowledge of Christ in the gospel, there would be far less ebb and flow in our spiritual experience.<a name=1:7></a> We have to own that there is a good deal of ebb and flow with us; some days we are all right and the next day we may be all wrong.<a name=1:8></a> God would have us repair, in our thinking, to this matter of what is foundational.<a name=1:9></a> There is a great need amongst us for the understanding, apprehension and establishment of our souls in the basic teaching of the gospel, and these meetings have in mind that, as current conditions are felt, the truth may open up in relation to it.<a name=1:10></a> It is always so that when current conditions are felt and there is a desire in relation to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the truth, the truth will open up.<a name=2:1></a> We should therefore be very concerned about this matter of our foundations in relation to the gospel, as to redemption, salvation, deliverance, because in this superficial age, the character of which may be taken on by believers, the tendency is to take things on externally without being established internally in relation to the truth; and therefore when we are tested, it may be at work or elsewhere, we are not able to stand.<a name=2:2></a> I am sure the basic weakness is in the teaching of the gospel, because it has not had the place in our souls that it should have had; and therefore we appear to be something we are not.<a name=2:3></a> We may be breaking bread, we may be going on and talking about the meetings, and yet not solid rock in our souls; if that is the case, then the slightest wind that comes along moves us.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these passages are suggested, to begin with, because they bring Christ before us in a peculiar way in relation to the truth of the gospel.<a name=2:5></a> First, one wishes to refer to His mediatorship in the matter of sins, and then to speak of His headship.<a name=2:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, it is not headship in relation to the body, but headship in relation to man.<a name=2:7></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we have leadership in relation to salvation, for baptism to Christ Jesus in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>involves that we come under a new leadership.<a name=2:8></a> Christ is the leader of our salvation, that is <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=2:9></a> Those who are baptised unto Christ Jesus come under His leadership in the wilderness; baptism introducing us into it.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have in the mercy-seat, how God has mediated this great matter of sins and it is presented in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>in an affecting way in regard to Jesus in the mediatorial position.<a name=2:11></a> It says in verse 25: "Whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood".<a name=2:12></a> Notice the link with Christ personally, through His death: "Through faith in his blood".<a name=2:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>there is another link in

		that relation, for it says (verse 10), "for if being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in the power of his life".<a name=3:1></a> Salvation by Christ's life is not exactly His life in the gospels, it is His life in glory as risen from the dead and glorified.<a name=3:2></a> That life acts in the way of salvation as the believer experiences the working out of it in his soul in the power of the Spirit.<a name=3:3></a> But this link of the mercy-seat with the blood is very important in our basic relationships with God.<a name=3:4></a> The mediating of the great matter of sins is brought on to our view in this way.<a name=3:5></a> In no other way could the matter be mediated, and Christ is the mercy-seat.<a name=3:6></a> If only that could get a firm grip of our souls, what effect it would produce in the appreciation of how sins have been met and dealt with to God's glory.<a name=3:7></a> I do not think, speaking for oneself, that we have a sufficient sense of mercy.<a name=3:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=3:9></a>K.<a name=3:10></a> What do you think the Lord had in mind when He says: "But go and learn what that is -- I will have mercy and not sacrifice", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:13">Matthew  9:13</a>?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:12></a> I suppose He was pointing to the greatness of what was coming in in Himself and in the new dispensation.<a name=3:13></a> The Jews, to whom He spoke, were under the law and keeping themselves under the law and did not have much sense of mercy, because they did not realise what great sinners they were.<a name=3:14></a> The greater the understanding of our sinnership the more appreciation there is of the thought of mercy.<a name=3:15></a> We see sometimes in relation to our children, growing up in households where the truth is known, that the thought of sins and how they have been dealt with by God, does not sufficiently lay hold of them.<a name=3:16></a> Whereas if they had been delivered from a life of sin, there may have been more effect on them.<a name=3:17></a> Not that we put any premium on living a life of sin.<a name=3:18></a>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:1></a> This is the way it is coming out.<a name=4:2></a> The righteousness is being revealed in the gospel, as it says, "for righteousness of God is revealed therein", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:17">Romans  1:17</a>.<a name=4:3></a> It is a new kind of righteousness; not righteousness by the law, but righteousness that is to be imputed on the basis and ground of free liberal gift.<a name=4:4></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>enlarges our thoughts in regard of the liberality of divine gift and our souls are to be built up in the knowledge of divine giving, so that we can acquire property and much substance in view of the tabernacle and the service of God.<a name=4:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B.<a name=4:6></a>G.<a name=4:7></a> You have something in mind in relation to "his blood".<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:9></a> It is important that we should see the place the blood has, because the blood brings in the death of Jesus.<a name=4:10></a> The question of sins could not be mediated apart from the death of Jesus, and God has met them on that ground.<a name=4:11></a> Think of how long God waited for this!<a name=4:12></a> It says, "in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a>.<a name=4:13></a> Think of the long time that God waited, all down through the Old Testament that He should be justified in the forgiving of sins, such as David's sin was!<a name=4:14></a> You know, we are so unlike God; we cannot wait.<a name=4:15></a> We have got to have things done immediately, especially if it is a question of being justified.<a name=4:16></a> But God waited all these centuries, down through the ages, before He was justified by the death of Christ and the blood on the mercy-seat, as the types set out.<a name=4:17></a>

		S.McC.<a name=4:20></a> That is what I am thinking of in relation to the blood.<a name=4:21></a> The blood brings up the judicial side,

	<div class="paragraph">
		the death of Jesus.<a name=5:1></a> The matter of our sins could not be mediated in any other way, in regard to finality, but by that way.<a name=5:2></a> Think of the infinite cost that it was to God, that it was to Jesus, that that should take place!<a name=5:3></a>

		Rem.<a name=5:4></a> Would Paul show the great appreciation he had of mercy in speaking of himself as the chief of sinners?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:6></a> He speaks of himself as being a proud, insolent, overbearing man.<a name=5:7></a> Some of us were reading a psalm this morning in relation to the proud.<a name=5:8></a> We are very careless in our use of words.<a name=5:9></a> A believer should never take that word on his lips about being proud of anything.<a name=5:10></a> Sometimes persons say they are proud of their work, proud of their children, proud of the way they have come into things and the way they are shaping up at school.<a name=5:11></a> Pride does not come from God; pride comes from the devil; we should be proud about nothing.<a name=5:12></a> God abominates pride.<a name=5:13></a> It says: "God sets himself against the proud, but gives grace to the lowly", <a href="../bible/James.htm#4:6">James  4:6</a>.<a name=5:14></a> If pride is working in my heart, it is a solemn thing to think that I come up against God and He resists it.<a name=5:15></a> That is, God fights against pride in my heart.<a name=5:16></a> If I am too proud to acknowledge anything, too proud to go down and own where I have been wrong, God is fighting against me; He is resisting me.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:18></a> That is seen with the publican and sinner who went up to the temple to pray.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:20></a> Just so.<a name=5:21></a> The point is.<a name=5:22></a> Where do things find their origin?<a name=5:23></a> Where does pride find its origin?<a name=5:24></a> It finds its origin in him, who in the place of power and glory, sought to exalt his throne above God, namely, Satan.<a name=5:25></a> Surely, we do not want to take on that feature.<a name=5:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:2></a> Yes, it should affect us, that He sets Himself against pride, showing how terrible it is in God's sight.<a name=6:3></a> We may not be proud outwardly, but we may be very proud inwardly -- we may feel very insulted when anything is said about us or against us that would affect our reputation.<a name=6:4></a> But God sets Himself against that.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=6:6></a>K.<a name=6:7></a> When Aaron and Miriam spoke against Moses.<a name=6:8></a> Moses does not say anything, but the Spirit of God brings in that he was the meekest man.<a name=6:9></a> The Spirit of God took pleasure in calling attention to Moses, did He not?<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:11></a> He did.<a name=6:12></a> We need to remember that it was to Moses that God says "keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but by no means clearing the guilty", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:7">Exodus  34:7</a>.<a name=6:13></a> We should particularly note that word, that God by no means clears the guilty in that sense; that is, sins must be taken into account and they have been taken into account in the blood of Jesus.<a name=6:14></a> But the blood, figuratively speaking, is on the mercy-seat, and God has set the mercy-seat forth.<a name=6:15></a> That is, the mercy-seat of old was in the holiest, both in the tabernacle and the temple, but the glory of our dispensation is that God has moved the mercy-seat on to the full public view of man, showing how His righteousness is manifested.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:19></a> I suppose he was.<a name=6:20></a> He realised what we all need to realise, that when it comes to ourselves we can leave things in the hands of God.<a name=6:21></a> When it comes to what affects God, we must stand with our backs to the wall and defend the truth at all costs.<a name=6:22></a>

		matter when man was on trial!<a name=7:1></a> That is the point, man was on trial, under the law and, too, in different ways before He was on trial under the law.<a name=7:2></a> While the offerings on the altars pointed in type to what was coming in, these sacrifices could never take away sins, neither could they perfect the worshipper who approached.<a name=7:3></a> And God forbears with all that, for He waited for the coming of Jesus.<a name=7:4></a> It is very affecting, dear brethren, to think of that, how long God had to wait for the coming of Jesus.<a name=7:5></a> It was a few thousand years, but His forbearance was there.<a name=7:6></a> It is a lesson to us, for we have to see how sins are dealt with.<a name=7:7></a> We might rise up in indignation because the standards of human propriety, which we have naturally, have been impugned, or transgressed against in something.<a name=7:8></a> There is nothing in that.<a name=7:9></a> What should affect us in regard to sins, is God's holiness.<a name=7:10></a> But our dispensation shows that the righteousness of God is now manifested in regard to the passing over of sins.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=7:12></a>H.<a name=7:13></a> The setting forth of the mercy-seat was something that God had looked forward to for a long time.<a name=7:14></a> First of all it was in the holiest, where the cherubim looked down upon it and guarded it, but now it has been brought forth for men.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:16></a> The cherubim are symbols of God's government and what is in keeping with it.<a name=7:17></a> Their looking down upon the blood would point to how that government has been satisfied.<a name=7:18></a> Now we come to the full and complete thing in the blood of Jesus, so that God should "be just and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus".<a name=7:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:22></a> That is it; we have a meeting place there!<a name=7:23></a> That brings up in our souls the question of what we know about this meeting place, which reminds us of how sins have been dealt with.<a name=7:24></a> It necessitated that a divine Person, coming into manhood, would be found in death, in the place where He

		J.A.<a name=8:4></a>K.<a name=8:5></a> What do you think of the expression "the power of his blood"?<a name=8:6></a> You referred to the power of His life.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:8></a> You mean in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>.<a name=8:9></a> You will notice that 'the power of' is interpolated.<a name=8:10></a> It is added to give force to the expression in both sections.<a name=8:11></a> The blood bears on the negative side, for all that stood against us morally has been met by the blood.<a name=8:12></a> We shall be saved from the wrath which would rightly come upon us in regard of our sins through the blood.<a name=8:13></a> Wrath is not being executed at the present time, according to the truth of the gospel.<a name=8:14></a> It has been revealed from heaven, but it is not being executed in the present dispensation.<a name=8:15></a> It <i>will be</i> executed, but as justified through the power of the blood, we are saved from it.<a name=8:16></a> It is the marvellous effects of the death of Jesus in the great mediation of this matter of sins which stood between us and God.<a name=8:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:20></a> Of course it does.<a name=8:21></a> That is, blood is the only means of efficacy in regard of cleansing from sin.<a name=8:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=8:23></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>it is not only "There will I meet with thee", but "and will speak with thee".<a name=8:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:25></a> It is important that there is not only this matter of our basic relations on the ground of sins being dealt with, and where the claims of the throne have been satisfied, but opening up these wonderful thoughts in regard to us and the blessedness

	<div class="paragraph">
		of our relations with Him.<a name=9:1></a> So that ought to help us to see that nowhere is it contemplated that relief is the great end in the gospel.<a name=9:2></a> The blood, of course, does bring in relief, but it has in mind these uninterrupted relations with God where His mind is opened up, His thoughts unfolded.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B.<a name=9:4></a>G.<a name=9:5></a> The epistle is written to Christians, which would just enforce what you are saying as to the need of this in our souls in a foundational way.<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:7></a> That is the point.<a name=9:8></a> I think there is a great need in our local gatherings (at least I would presume here as in our own), of establishment with the young, and with those of us who are older, too, in regard to the glad tidings.<a name=9:9></a> You take the woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, what an appreciation she would have of the mercy-seat!<a name=9:10></a> I should think we should far less easily fall into sins if we were more conscious of this meeting place, and what Christ is to us as the mercy-seat.<a name=9:11></a> God setting Him forth, and then faith in His blood.<a name=9:12></a> The setting forth is God's active side; but faith in His blood is our active side, how we come into the matter.<a name=9:13></a>

		W.B.<a name=9:14></a>G.<a name=9:15></a> So that the conditions are not impossible.<a name=9:16></a> In spite of all that is set out in the early chapters of Romans, this is the way God meets it.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:18></a> That is the point, and it is very interesting to see the reasoning in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, because so often the negative side is brought up.<a name=9:19></a> So often we enlarge on negative conditions.<a name=9:20></a> We say, Modern conditions are so bad!<a name=9:21></a> Well, they are, but what <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, in its reasoning, shows is that if that is so -- much rather what has come in in Christianity would help us.<a name=9:22></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:15">Romans  5:15</a>: "For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which is by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many".<a name=9:23></a> And then verse 17: "For if by the offence of one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those

	<div class="paragraph">
		who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ".<a name=10:1></a> That shows that we cannot bring up the negative side as an argument for our getting into difficulty and remaining in difficulty because the truth of the gospel shows us that if the negative side is so, then, in the "much rather", the grace side, the positive side, abounds in the means of help for our salvation.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B.<a name=10:3></a>G.<a name=10:4></a> So that this was really written for us "upon whom the ends of the ages are come", when all these difficulties will be multiplied.<a name=10:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:6></a> Romans was written to those in a city, in a metropolis that was renowned, not only then, but it is renowned now as its fame has been handed down through history.<a name=10:7></a> We see how salvation comes in in the midst of that, that believers might be completely saved from a system of things where death reigns, as attached to a Person who has mediated the great matter of sins between God and men.<a name=10:8></a> He has mediated by means of His death and His resurrection; we must not forget that, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>brings it in.<a name=10:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:13></a> Well, it enters into this great matter of our salvation in that way.<a name=10:14></a> It says in verse 10: "For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather having been reconciled we shall be saved in the power of his life".<a name=10:15></a> Now salvation from wrath as linked with justification in the power of His blood and also reconciliation are both faith matters.<a name=10:16></a> That is, they are complete matters, there is no progress in them or development in them.<a name=10:17></a> They are absolute, complete.<a name=10:18></a> We come into them through the liberality of divine gift as presented in the gospel.<a name=10:19></a> But salvation by the life of Christ is not absolute in that sense.<a name=10:20></a> Salvation by the life of Christ, in its present form.<a name=10:21></a>

		S.McC.<a name=21:1></a> In view of the fact that a number were not with us this morning, we might refer to what we considered.<a name=21:2></a> Our subject is how our souls are built up in the knowledge of Christ in relation to the gospel, and in relation to the assembly.<a name=21:3></a> We shall come to the subject of fellowship and the assembly tomorrow, but we are dealing today with the gospel in Romans, and this morning we looked at chapter 3 and the end of chapter 5, noticing how Christ is presented as the mercy-seat.<a name=21:4></a> We are told that the Mediator of God and men is one, the Man Christ Jesus, and we often think of His mediatorship entering into the service of God.<a name=21:5></a> But we need to think of how His mediatorship enters into the matter of the sin question; how the great question of sin between man and God has been mediated.<a name=21:6></a> The mercy-seat thus in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>brings Christ personally on to our view, in a peculiar way.<a name=21:7></a> It was noticed that God set forth the mercy-seat and that it is through faith in His blood.<a name=21:8></a> That is where we come in, for faith in the blood brings us in in regard to the matter of our sins being dealt with.<a name=21:9></a> Then God's righteousness enters into it.<a name=21:10></a> God's righteousness is not presented in our dispensation, on the line of demand, but on the line of supply.<a name=21:11></a> Then forgiveness of sins comes about through it.<a name=21:12></a> We also noted in chapter 5, the headship of Christ.<a name=21:13></a> It is important that the believer should apprehend Christ's headship in relation to man, as over against Adam, the first head, who failed and brought such sorrow and disaster into the human race.<a name=21:14></a> Christ has come in, on the side of the race, as the divinely-appointed

		Head, so that over against the negative conditions which came in through Adam, we have the "much rather" referred to, on the positive side, in connection with the new Head, Christ.<a name=22:1></a> It was remarked that apostasy is about to be manifested, when the world will set up a rival head to Christ, in the man of sin, the antichrist.<a name=22:2></a> It is important, as believers, that we should be established in our souls in the fundamentals of the gospel so that we should see what Christ's headship means to us, and our attachment to Him as constituted righteous, so that we are not lawless, independent persons, but we are held in righteousness in relation to Him, who is the Centre of God's world.<a name=22:3></a> We referred too to the fact that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>brings in the wealth of what is toward us, so that we get salvation from wrath as justified through blood and we have reconciliation to God through the death of His Son.<a name=22:4></a> These are matters for faith to lay hold of, involving a work done outside of us.<a name=22:5></a> But then there is what is wrought in us, which of course, in its teaching, goes beyond <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, but it is brought in there to impress us with the wealth of divine giving, and to help us in view of our souls being built up, morally and spiritually.<a name=22:6></a> We are not to be in spiritual poverty, but in wealth.<a name=22:7></a> Salvation by Christ's life involves what is wrought out in the believer.<a name=22:8></a> In contrast to eternal life, we referred to life in an active and operative way, consciously in the believer by the power of the Spirit.<a name=22:9></a> Eternal life is presented in Romans in an objective way, as something to be reached, referring to what is fixed and positional.<a name=22:10></a> Salvation by the life of Christ in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>is not exactly a realm or sphere into which we are introduced, but it refers to what is operating and active in the soul of the believer.<a name=22:11></a> Participating in the life of Christ involves immediate contact with Him, and this means our salvation from things here.<a name=22:12></a>

		Now this afternoon, Christ comes before us in relation to the wilderness position.<a name=23:1></a> In chapter 6.<a name=23:2></a> He is the great Leader -- "the leader of their salvation" as referred to in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=23:3></a> It is a matter of leadership in the wilderness.<a name=23:4></a> We need leadership.<a name=23:5></a> The young people are very much in mind in our subject, because of the felt need of the cardinal truths of the gospel laying hold of their souls.<a name=23:6></a> So that instead of being superficial, we should be marked by inward stability, as there is the digging deep and our foundations being laid on the rock.<a name=23:7></a> If that is so, we shall not yield easily to the principle of sin as it operates.<a name=23:8></a> Now the Leader of our salvation comes before us in chapter 6, for "baptised unto Christ Jesus" involves Christ's leadership in the wilderness.<a name=23:9></a> In type it is seen in Moses; they were all baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.<a name=23:10></a> The leadership of Christ in the wilderness involves that the believer is brought into newness of life.<a name=23:11></a> He is no longer walking according to the flesh, but, as identified with Christ in the likeness of His death, newness of life comes into view.<a name=23:12></a> Our souls are to be built up in the knowledge of the leadership of Christ in that way.<a name=23:13></a> Then, in the opening of chapter 7, we have the new husband, and Christ as the Deliverer at the end of chapter 7.<a name=23:14></a> Then Christ as priest comes in at the end of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=23:15></a> These are cardinal features of Christ's mediatorial service in the truth of the gospel, and are brought forward in order that our souls might be solidly built up in the truth.<a name=23:16></a> This section links with the type in the Old Testament, which involves the covenant, and the tabernacle system; it involves the use that is to be made of the property and the material that is available, because God's intent is that our souls are to be built up substantially in the knowledge of Christ in view of the tabernacle and His service.<a name=23:17></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>brings in the law, the covenant, and the truth of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>adjusts us as

		S.McC.<a name=25:8></a> I am sure that is right.<a name=25:9></a> We were referring this morning to the need of having a real apprehension of the Person.<a name=25:10></a> Being justified by the blood should affect our souls as to how our sins have been met and dealt with.<a name=25:11></a> Sometimes, when we are discovered in sin, there is a good deal of remorse and a good deal of bitterness because we have been found out, but we want to be with God about the matter and take it up, not just superficially, but in the light of how God has dealt with it in the death of Christ as the early chapters of Romans stress.<a name=25:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=25:15></a> Well, that is where it is.<a name=25:16></a> It is independence of God and the whole matter of sin has been mediated by the coming into manhood of a divine Person; and more than that, for it necessitated the abandonment, when He was made sin, and His actual entrance into death and the grave and then the resurrection, showing how great a matter it is.<a name=25:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=26:15></a> The chapter we begin with brings it up as an objective.<a name=26:16></a> As our souls are built up in the knowledge of Christ, as presented in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, it eventuates in holiness, as it says, "ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end eternal life".<a name=26:17></a> Holiness is essential for our relations with God and the service of God.<a name=26:18></a> But the remarkable thing here is that is says "your fruit"; in the next chapter we shall see it is "fruit to God".<a name=26:19></a>

		J.H.<a name=27:5></a>S.<a name=27:6></a> Is it interesting in that connection that it says: "let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:12">Romans  6:12</a>?<a name=27:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=27:8></a> The mortal body is an allusion to our physical bodies.<a name=27:9></a> The Lord Jesus Himself was not any different when He was with men than when He was with God.<a name=27:10></a> He was the very same, in His relations with men and in His relations with God, and we are to be the same.<a name=27:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=27:15></a> The Lord is aiming at that.<a name=27:16></a> There has been a good deal of exercise in the years that are past, for well nigh thirty years or more, as to trade union matters, that as believers we could not have part in them.<a name=27:17></a> But then the issue has been raised as to the other side, namely those who may be in authority and in positions of influence.<a name=27:18></a> It is just as much an unequal yoke for a brother to be vice-president of a worldly corporation as it is for a brother to be a member of a trade union.<a name=27:19></a> It is an unholy association.<a name=27:20></a> You could never think of the Lord Jesus being secretary or vice-president of a worldly corporation.<a name=27:21></a> Why, the thing is the furthest from your mind to entertain the thought!<a name=27:22></a> But there are some amongst us who have no compunction about these matters.<a name=27:23></a>

		S.McC.<a name=84:16></a> It is important we should see how it comes in here: "and to know the love of the Christ, which surpasses knowledge".<a name=84:17></a> Why should it come in in this passage, in this way?<a name=84:18></a> It shows that while the official glory of Christ, as the great divine Operator, is impressed upon our minds in this great, vast system of glory, yet the love of Christ is projected on to our view, as if to suggest His relations with us on this line.<a name=84:19></a> It is not so much on the official line now, but on the inward line, such as the Lord's supper builds us up in relation to.<a name=84:20></a>

		S.McC.<a name=88:1></a> The brethren will readily see the link in John's gospel with our subject; namely, the building up in our souls of the knowledge of Christ and these passages have been selected because of certain features of Christ's glory that appear in them.<a name=88:2></a> There are other passages that could have been taken, but these particularly bear on the service of God.<a name=88:3></a> In the first passage we have the knowledge of Christ as the Giver of living water -- leading into the thought of the worship of God.<a name=88:4></a> In the next we have the knowledge of Christ in relation to the great subject of quickening.<a name=88:5></a> In the last we have the glory of Christ as the Revealer of the Father, the One who makes known to us the Father.<a name=88:6></a> Another thing will be noted by the brethren in these sections, and that is the references to eternal life, as we have it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, 5 and 17.<a name=88:7></a> In fact it is rather remarkable that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>we should have the two greatest blessings that God has purposed for men, namely, eternal life and sonship.<a name=88:8></a> The chapter opens with eternal life and ends with sonship.<a name=88:9></a> Sonship, of course, is a greater thought than eternal life, but eternal life is the highest thought of blessing in relation to our need and links with the earthly side.<a name=88:10></a> Sonship is the highest feature of blessing in the Christian dispensation in connection with what is related to God's heart.<a name=88:11></a> The more we think of these thoughts the more remarkable it seems that <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>should open with eternal life and end with sonship.<a name=88:12></a> Both these thoughts are prime factors in the service of God.<a name=88:13></a> Eternal life is basic to the service of God.<a name=88:14></a> I believe the Lord would help us as to eternal life at the present time, on the eve of the rapture.<a name=88:15></a> In the

		early days of recovery in regard of the truth, eternal life was a great point of conflict.<a name=89:1></a> The point of conflict was the <i>doctrine</i> of eternal life.<a name=89:2></a> But I think the Lord is going to help us, on the eve of the rapture, as to the <i>practical bearing</i> of eternal life.<a name=89:3></a> Beloved J.<a name=89:4></a>T.<a name=89:5></a> at Washington, in one of the last series of meetings, emphasised that there was a good deal more for us to understand in connection with eternal life.<a name=89:6></a> John's ministry makes much of it.<a name=89:7></a> That is something we should think over, for John's gospel is particularly written for our time.<a name=89:8></a> The striking emphasis throughout his gospel on eternal life must surely mean that the current departure from the truth in Christendom is to be met by this great thought of eternal life, as the saints enter upon it.<a name=89:9></a> Eternal life strictly refers to an out-of-the-world order of blessing.<a name=89:10></a> The Lord is emphasising what is out-of-the-world at the present time with us, so that we might be weaned more and more from what is in the world.<a name=89:11></a> So that as the rapture takes place it will not merely be an arbitrary act on the part of divine Persons, but there will be a corresponding state and condition in the assembly, as in the good of eternal life, which, we might say, will cause us to go up spontaneously.<a name=89:12></a> As the Lord descends there will almost be, what you might call, a reciprocal action.<a name=89:13></a> There will be the descent of the Lord, but there will be saints moving in the power and energy of eternal life, to meet Him.<a name=89:14></a> We need, therefore, to consider this matter of eternal life in its practical bearing and especially its bearing upon the service of God.<a name=89:15></a> The service of God cannot be carried on effectively unless we are clear of the world and associations in it; therefore the emphasis on eternal life.<a name=89:16></a>

		their own gods after the manner of the nations, whence they had been carried away".<a name=90:1></a> That is a remarkable chapter showing the fundamentals of the whole Samaritan matter.<a name=90:2></a> We may have the fear of God in our souls and yet not come fully into the sphere which the knowledge of God has reference to, apart from the world's system and all that marks it.<a name=90:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=90:4></a> We have the history of the system that is linked with Samaria, and the woman seems to have thoughts linked with it in her mind; but the Lord brings in what really is the crux of the matter in regard to what is merely profession and not vital, in the Spirit, as typified in the living water.<a name=90:5></a> The great line of demarcation at the present time between an empty profession and what is vital is just this matter of the living water, the Spirit.<a name=90:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=90:7></a>S.<a name=90:8></a> Do you think the Lord has raised up the ministry of the Holy Spirit, not only in the way of teaching, but having in mind our vital living links with the Spirit of God, in view of fully understanding and entering into eternal life?<a name=90:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=90:10></a> It is important to see the difference between eternal life in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>and <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>.<a name=90:11></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>presents eternal life in relation to faith and believing, in relation to the gospel testimony: "For God so loved the world".<a name=90:12></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>is more than gospel testimony, more than faith, it involves the presence of the Spirit in the believer and that, of necessity, is greater than eternal life itself.<a name=90:13></a> The Spirit must be greater than eternal life because He is a divine Person.<a name=90:14></a> So the emphasis on the living water, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, is very important, because the bearing of eternal life in that chapter (and the living water springing up to eternal life) is delivering and that is what is greatly needed in regard to the service of God.<a name=90:15></a> Persons need to be delivered in regard to what is inward in their souls, so that they should be free and buoyant in the assembly in the service of God.<a name=90:16></a> It is not so

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=91:5></a> Drinking involves what will affect us inwardly.<a name=91:6></a> I believe that in assembly service, while some of us may make a good deal of what we do not know -- the secret of the lack of spontaneity really lies in the fact that we are not inwardly set free.<a name=91:7></a> We may enjoy the indwelling Spirit to a certain extent, but He has not been allowed full scope in this regard.<a name=91:8></a> The Lord says, "shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=91:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=91:10></a>K.<a name=91:11></a> Does the springing up as in chapter 4 suggest the activity of the Spirit?<a name=91:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=91:13></a> Yes.<a name=91:14></a> It is delightful to see life among the brethren, and we know what is required in the service.<a name=91:15></a> What is there that God has not done, we might say, to make possible the greatest results in His service to Himself?<a name=91:16></a> Every one of us therefore should be concerned that we should be in the flow of the worship and contributing to it audibly.<a name=91:17></a> That is, those of us who can; the sisters, of course, cannot.<a name=91:18></a> It is their part to remain silent, but they contribute to it in a substantial way, silently, because the sisters form the body of spirituality that supports the service.<a name=91:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=91:23></a> It does, because eternal life has a direct bearing upon the service of God.<a name=91:24></a> The service of God is not a matter of ritualism, getting on your feet and expressing well-known terms among the brethren.<a name=91:25></a> It is the result of life in your soul, life in the environment and sphere you are in.<a name=91:26></a> God loves the thought of life, as seen in the creation, and He so loves the thought of life in the assembly.<a name=91:27></a> We should be very concerned, therefore, that He should see the expression of it in His service.<a name=91:28></a> If I were a brother in the

		S.McC.<a name=92:19></a> I should think so.<a name=92:20></a> We owe a good deal to the sisters because the body of spirituality, in any local gathering, is largely made up of what is resident in the sisters.<a name=92:21></a> They are the silent unit in the local make-up and we can see from <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>that the body of spirituality lies with them.<a name=92:22></a>
