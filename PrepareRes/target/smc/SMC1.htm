		S.McC.<a name=1:1></a> I was thinking of the book of the Acts having specially in mind the thought of spiritual quality appearing in those who are the subjects of divine workmanship in the book, and I thought it might be good to commence with the first chapter.<a name=1:2></a> It is hoped that in the pursuit of our enquiry together in a subject and dependent way we shall see the greatness of the Spirit's place in this book, and also the great place the assembly has, but it is particularly in mind to centre our thoughts on the thought of spiritual quality appearing in persons who come before us uniquely in this book, and who are serving in the testimony in relation to the promulgation of the thoughts of God.<a name=1:3></a> It is important, I am sure we would all agree, that in the closing days we should see the necessity for quality.<a name=1:4></a> I suppose at no time has there been such insistence on quality in the minds of men in the world as at the present time; quality has a unique place, and great efforts are made in order that the materials and the like might be of dependable quality, and how much more so should it be in the testimony, and in relation to the assembly in the finishing of the dispensation, and we are to be concerned about the matter of quality, quality in persons, for this book brings persons before us.<a name=1:5></a> Christianity is not something in the air.<a name=1:6></a> Christianity is a living system of things centring in Christ glorified and the Spirit here, and then worked out, not just in books, nor in ritual or ceremony, but in persons who coming under the hand of divine Persons have been wrought upon by Them, and give evidence and testimony to that work.<a name=1:7></a> It is in mind as we pursue to take account of Peter, and Stephen, Philip, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, and others, and especially to see the place that women have, because it is of all moment that the sisters should understand the place they have in the present economy, the place they have to fill out in usefulness, whether old or young, because this book shows us quality in persons both old and young.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought we might begin with the first chapter which has primarily in mind those who were the fruit of the Lord's own personal service in the days of His flesh here, and they are brought before us in relation to the upper room in Jerusalem.<a name=2:2></a> We should dwell for a moment on the remarkable way in which Luke opens the book by drawing attention to Christ, presenting Himself to His own, as it says, "I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach, until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom He had chosen, He was taken up; to whom also He presented Himself living, after He had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God.<a name=2:3></a>" Now, we are to note the way the Lord continues to use the Spirit although He had been into death.<a name=2:4></a> When He came into manhood and entered into public service He referred to the Spirit according to Luke, being <i>upon</i> Him as He stood up in the synagogue in Nazareth, and the Spirit was used by Him all through His pathway.<a name=2:5></a> Chapter 1 of Acts views the fact that He has died, was buried, and had risen again, and we are to note the stress on the Holy Spirit, because by way of model and example the Lord Jesus is setting out what is to be the true source, spring and power of all service in persons, whomsoever they may be that are used in the testimony in the book of the Acts.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=2:7></a> Is this quality to be seen in the saints as the result of the work of the Holy Spirit?<a name=2:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:1></a> I thought so, because none of us are to rely on anything we may be naturally.<a name=3:2></a> There is nothing so uncertain in the things of God as anything we may have naturally, be it a keen mind, or keen perception naturally, be it a humble disposition naturally, or an obstreperous disposition naturally; none of those things can be relied upon.<a name=3:3></a> We have to make room for the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:4></a> He is the great power by which things are to be done in this book, so that the book might be rightly termed "The Acts of the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=3:6></a> It was at Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.<a name=3:7></a> They were like Christ.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:9></a> Yes, at Antioch, showing I suppose that the name came out through what would be expressed in them.<a name=3:10></a> It was not a name given from heaven, but a name which seemed to be given in relation to what was expressed among them.<a name=3:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		O.E.<a name=3:12></a>F.<a name=3:13></a> So Paul says in Philippians, "We are the circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh," <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:3">Philippians  3:3</a>.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:15></a> Very good, showing what a complete deliverance there had been with Paul from Judaism which claimed to be the circumcision.<a name=3:16></a> Paul understood the whole setting of Christianity that the Spirit was the great power and means by which things are done.<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=3:18></a> Do you have something in your mind as to the Lord using the Holy Spirit Himself in this first chapter?<a name=3:19></a> "Having <i>by the Holy Spirit</i> charged the apostles whom he had chosen.<a name=3:20></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:21></a> The way the Lord Jesus moves in these forty days has specially in mind, by way of precept and example, to inculcate into the minds of His disciples the way things were to be done, that is by the Spirit, not by natural resources or human strength, but by the.<a name=3:22></a> Spirit.<a name=3:23></a> The Lord Jesus could say in

		resurrection, according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:18">Matthew  28:18</a>, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth.<a name=4:1></a>" But here it is remarkable that the Person who says that is presented to us as <i>by the Spirit</i> charging His apostles whom He had chosen -- delightful reference "whom he had chosen" -- and he charged them by the Holy Spirit.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.C.<a name=4:3></a> Would this expression "whom he had chosen" bring to our minds His choosing in regard to the pearl of great value?<a name=4:4></a> Quality had been in His mind in making that choice.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:6></a> Exactly.<a name=4:7></a> I am sure there is something in that.<a name=4:8></a> Before choosing these men He had spent a night in prayer to God.<a name=4:9></a> What ground must have been covered in that all night season of prayer!<a name=4:10></a> What He must have gone through in communion with God about the matter, and then they were chosen.<a name=4:11></a> It would bring in the great idea of spiritual quality.<a name=4:12></a> Of course, we have to bear in mind that among them appears Judas of whom the Lord says, "Have not I chosen you the twelve?<a name=4:13></a> and of you one is a devil," <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:70">John  6:70</a>.<a name=4:14></a> In the great public profession we have to bear in mind that there may be what is unreal, and Judas represents that side.<a name=4:15></a> He is in the place of outward relations with Christ as many in the profession are, but this chapter soberly unfolds to us that he is an apostate, a very humbling thing which should search every one of our hearts, because every one of us may be so near to divine Persons, the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, even perhaps be useable in any service, and yet there is always the possibility of a Judas coming to light.<a name=4:16></a> We have to watch that element.<a name=4:17></a> Only the work of God will go through.<a name=4:18></a>

		F.H.<a name=4:19></a> The Lord's word to the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>was "The Father seeks such as his worshippers.<a name=4:20></a>" She had been the subject of the work of God and there was quality and reality with her.<a name=4:21></a>

		quality, and I think the Lord would impress our minds with that this afternoon, that it is not a question of anything and everything, but a question of divine selection, divine choosing, and what can any of us say about the matter?<a name=5:1></a> If in the sovereignty of God, and the exercise of His mercy we have come into the line of the testimony.<a name=5:2></a> What can we say in the presence of it all?<a name=5:3></a> The Lord has in mind quality to carry on the testimony, and these persons come before us as persons of quality as under His hand.<a name=5:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:8></a> Yes, we shall see that.<a name=5:9></a> He was a man with the quality of an evangelist.<a name=5:10></a> He was a remarkable man, and he had remarkable daughters, showing that there was not only quality in the man himself, but in his house.<a name=5:11></a> He had four daughters who prophesied; where and how is something we need to look into, but the Spirit of God says that they prophesied and we may be sure that they did.<a name=5:12></a>

		G.S.<a name=5:13></a>R.<a name=5:14></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:16">John  15:16</a> the Lord says "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.<a name=5:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:16></a> John's gospel has in mind very specially what is trustworthy, that the Lord could commit things into their hands, and we know that naturally we are not trustworthy.<a name=5:17></a> In the beginning of John we have "Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man," <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:24">John  2:24</a>, 25.<a name=5:18></a> But as divinely wrought upon we become trustworthy vessels, and John's ministry has that particularly in mind.<a name=5:19></a>

		J.R.<a name=5:20></a> In verse 15 of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>it speaks of "the crowd of names.<a name=5:21></a>" Would that suggest what is distinctive?<a name=5:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:1></a> That is what I thought, and the allusion to the women among them is interesting.<a name=6:2></a> We are to note how women enter into this setting in the upper room and are marked by spiritual quality, but before going on to that the matter of the Lord's sufferings is alluded to in verse 3, "to whom also he presented himself living after he had <i>suffered</i> with many proofs being seen by them during forty days, and speaking the things which concern the kingdom of God.<a name=6:3></a>" We are not to forget the impress the writer would put upon our minds and spirits as to the sufferings of Christ.<a name=6:4></a> How much we owe to them!<a name=6:5></a> Indeed, we owe all to the sufferings of Christ, and we shall see as we proceed with this book what spiritual quality shines testimonially in sufferings; however great the sufferings might be we shall find features of spiritual quality shine in the persons in suffering, and we are not to forget the suffering, whether in Christ, or by extension in the saints of the assembly.<a name=6:6></a> Suffering is our privileged portion, and we ought to thank God for it all the time.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.C.<a name=6:8></a>L.<a name=6:9></a> Would suffering enter into the making?<a name=6:10></a> The Lord says to Simon and Andrew, "Come after me, and I will <i>make</i> you fishers of men," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:19">Matthew  4:19</a>.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:12></a> I think there is something in that.<a name=6:13></a> Think of the Lord taking them in hand, and take all the personnel that are here today; each one has a certain individuality, and think of the Lord making disciples of us!<a name=6:14></a> Think of what He has had to take in hand in oneself, and in the rest of us.<a name=6:15></a> We are all different in temperament and make-up.<a name=6:16></a> We know, some of us in the field of engineering, how hard it is, and what a trial it is to work on difficult material.<a name=6:17></a> Well, think of the Lord working on material such as we, and we can thank God for the results, not that there is any praise to any of us, but to Him under whose hand we have come.<a name=6:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:2></a> I think so, and we would like to see a lot of sisters like that.<a name=7:3></a> She did what the twelve did not.<a name=7:4></a> They were occupied with material things, but she was thinking about attracting the men of the city to Christ, and so wonderful was her testimony (she must have been remarkably affected because of the power there was in her testimony) that the men of the city followed her.<a name=7:5></a>

		J.W.<a name=7:6></a> Would Rebecca in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>be marked by spiritual quality in her readiness to follow Abraham's servant?<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:8></a> I think so.<a name=7:9></a> Scripture abounds with suggestions in persons as to quality, right from the beginning to the end, and Rebecca is one of them.<a name=7:10></a> Of course, we have not time to go into all the examples that may come up.<a name=7:11></a> In our enquiry this afternoon we are centring on the beginning of the Acts to see what is making way for the great vessel which is about to come into view, the assembly, as formed by the incoming of the Spirit, a vessel that is to take the place of Israel in the ways of God, and in which the testimony of grace is to be set out.<a name=7:12></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>brings certain persons concretely before us.<a name=7:13></a> The Lord is preparing the way in His service for the descent of the Spirit, and they are to become accustomed in their minds and thoughts to what is spiritual, because the Lord is stressing the spiritual side.<a name=7:14></a> "Having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen," verse 2, and in verse 5, "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days.<a name=7:15></a>" Think of what the baptism with the Holy Spirit would mean; what a powerful touch that would be in their lives.<a name=7:16></a> Think of the first touch when Christ called them, when He said, "Come after Me," and then think of what this touch, yea, more than a touch would be.<a name=7:17></a> The baptism of the Spirit involves

		O.E.<a name=8:2></a>F.<a name=8:3></a> I was thinking of the personnel as making room for the Spirit.<a name=8:4></a> Holy men of God were used by the Spirit of God in writing the Scriptures.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:6></a> It is a very great matter that the personnel should be kept before us.<a name=8:7></a> Men make a lot of personnel these days; their records are voluminous that deal with personnel, but think of the personnel that form the assembly, and while the assembly is a glorious entity, the body of Christ, we are not to lose sight of the fact that that entity is composed of individuals such as we are, and they constitute the personnel under the hand of divine Persons in relation to the promoting of divine ends in the economy of grace, so that in the baptism of the Spirit what a testimony there would be in persons coming under the influence of the Spirit.<a name=8:8></a> If you met a person under the influence of the Holy Spirit you could not help feeling there is something different about that brother or that sister, and I am sure we all need to be concerned more and more as to what the Lord has in mind here in His education of His disciples that they are to come under the hand of the Spirit, and <i>we</i> are to get that into our minds that <i>we</i> are to come under the hand of the Spirit.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.S.<a name=8:10></a>R.<a name=8:11></a> In connection with that does the word in verse 3 bear on it, "to whom he presented himself living after he had suffered with many proofs.<a name=8:12></a>" Is there a suggestion in that to the Spirit's quickening service?<a name=8:13></a> The last impression the apostle had was of a living person who would give character to the system.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:15></a> I am sure that is right, for in the presentation of Himself living there was something in that in the way of testimony that was to affect them and is to give character to the whole system of Christianity,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>

		L.C.<a name=9:2></a> Is it a matter that the Lord Jesus accumulated certain material during His time here, and now is entrusting that material to the Holy Spirit and now it would be a question of what the Holy Spirit would make of these persons.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:4></a> Yes, I think that is what chapter 2 would bring us on to.<a name=9:5></a> But here the Spirit has not yet come, and the Lord is with them during the forty days prior to the Spirit's coming, and the Lord is serving to help the disciples educationally in view of the coming of the Spirit and the fact that the Spirit was to take them on, and they were to form part of the vessel the assembly, that the Spirit would indwell and were to be used by the Spirit in relation to that vessel.<a name=9:6></a>

		S.W.<a name=9:7></a>R.<a name=9:8></a> What is the difference between the baptism of John and the baptism with the Holy Spirit?<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:10></a> You notice that twice in the chapter reference is made to John's baptism, in verses 5 and 22.<a name=9:11></a> Now, there is a moral element in the matter of John's baptism that we are not to forget.<a name=9:12></a> The Lord is not pushing John's baptism aside.<a name=9:13></a> Notice the word 'indeed.<a name=9:14></a>' "John <i>indeed</i> baptised with water.<a name=9:15></a>" That was the baptism of what we might call separation through which the remnant were separated from what then existed, but the baptism of the Spirit is a merging baptism, which involves not so much that we are separated from something, but merged by the act into the glorious vessel that constitutes the assembly, but with John's baptism there is a moral element that we are not to lose sight of, because you will notice when the matter of selecting one in the place of Judas comes up, it says "it is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with

		S.McC.<a name=10:5></a> Well, it would look like that, but there was something amiss there, and they had suffered from it in that they had not received the Spirit.<a name=10:6></a> It seems as if the baptism of John forms a kind of background for what the Lord proceeds with in relation to His service.<a name=10:7></a> He Himself said about it "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>.<a name=10:8></a>

		S.McC.<a name=11:5></a> That is what I think.<a name=11:6></a> The reception of the Spirit involves the beginning of the formative side of the work of God, because what we take in by faith in the way of light, and the receiving of the forgiveness of sins and justification, hardly alludes to the formative side of the work of God.<a name=11:7></a> It is a question of what we appropriate of the work by faith.<a name=11:8></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>involves the life line.<a name=11:9></a> The reception of the Spirit and His service in us has in view the work of God subjectively bringing about spiritual quality.<a name=11:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are a few interesting words to be noted in this chapter, and we should note the word in verse 4 'assembled,' and then we have it in verse 21, "the men who have <i>assembled</i> with us.<a name=11:11></a>" Notice the disciples are taking on the use of this word.<a name=11:12></a> In the first section it stands related to Christ assembling with His disciples, and now Peter takes on the word in this section.<a name=11:13></a> "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have <i>assembled</i> with us.<a name=11:14></a>" There is dignity about that word 'assembled.<a name=11:15></a>' It links on with the idea of the assembly, but we do not have the assembly in chapter l of the Acts, and it is well to keep that in mind.<a name=11:16></a> We have to come to chapter 2 before we get the assembly.<a name=11:17></a>

		S.McC.<a name=58:1></a> In this section of Acts, chapters 16 to 20, we have the unparalleled energy of Paul, the Holy Spirit acting in him and through him, before us, and it is thought well that we might just briefly look at the passage in chapter 15 before going on to it.<a name=58:2></a> The thought of spiritual quality has been before us, and we shall see it greatly augmented in this section, especially from chapters 16 to 21, where we have the unique section that we may call a distinctly Pauline section where there is brought before us the stream of Pauline energy, unsurpassed and unprecedented, and it is a remarkable thing that the section begins with a Cyprian, Barnabas, moving out of the stream, and it ends with a Cyprian moving in the stream -- "a certain Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21:16">Acts  21:16</a>.<a name=58:3></a> They were to lodge with him in Jerusalem, showing how remarkable the work of God is in that case.<a name=58:4></a> After the dissension between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark, Barnabas recedes into the background, beloved man as he was, and the Spirit of God focuses our attention on Paul, the vessel of unparalleled energy in the Lord's work reaching to European parts, and the work in all its precious quality coming before us in different ones referred to; Timothy, Lydia, Apollos, Aquila and Priscilla, but it was thought well that we should just for a moment look at chapter 15 as to the quality that appears there.<a name=58:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 14 we have "establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to abide in the faith" (verse 22), and at the end of chapter 15, "confirming the assemblies," and at the beginning of chapter 16 "the assemblies therefore were confirmed," and this is a feature we are to take account of, and especially is it salutary for those who serve the saints in any measure to keep in mind that <i>the prime object in ministry is to build up</i>, not to overthrow and divide, but to confirm, and it is a great thing that we should be confirmed in our gatherings, and it is remarkable as Paul's ministry comes into the ascendency in this book that confirmation of the assemblies is stressed.<a name=59:3></a> We should look for confirmation on that line but in this section in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>where we get "chosen men," and "leading men among the brethren," "our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ," all that is an intensification of the subject of our enquiry, quality in the assembly and especially in those who give a lead among the brethren.<a name=59:4></a> It is important that there should be those who give a lead, and that quality should be in such.<a name=59:5></a> It is an important matter that in all the gatherings those who take a leading part should be consistent with the truth, otherwise the truth may be held in disrepute.<a name=59:6></a>

		S.McC.<a name=64:14></a> That is it, and it is a great thing for all of us because Christendom sets the Pauline ministry aside, and we have to see the proper place it has in relation to Christ and the assembly, because it is remarkable in this chapter, when you look into it at the beginning especially, to see <i>who</i> is causing joy among the brethren.<a name=64:15></a> Certainly not the Judaistic leaders, they were bringing in distress and burdens more than the brethren could bear, but it says of Paul and Barnabas, "They therefore having been set on their way by the assembly, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of those of the nations.<a name=64:16></a> And <i>they</i> caused great joy to all the brethren.<a name=64:17></a>" What did they cause great joy by?<a name=64:18></a> By relating the work of God, and all that <i>God</i> had wrought with them.<a name=64:19></a> As someone once said, The Judaising men were <i>doing all the talking</i>, they

		It is always an advantage to have persons of spiritual and moral influence who can give a good lead, and the great thing is to make room for them, I am not speaking of an official lead, any brother or sister claiming to give a lead because, maybe, they have been a certain time breaking bread, but what this chapter is stressing is men who have moral quality.<a name=65:8></a> They had apostolic authority, delegated authority, but they had <i>moral</i> authority.<a name=65:9></a> As James says, "Brethren listen to <i>me</i>.<a name=65:10></a>" Wonderful man James, he was a leader in the assembly at Jerusalem apparently, and he was a remarkable man.<a name=65:11></a> What is to be noted in going on to chapter 16 is the unity in the ministry, unity among those in the assembly, and among those who were giving a lead.<a name=65:12></a> Notice what James says in verse 13, "Brethren, listen to me; Simon has related how God first visited to take out of the nations a people for his name.<a name=65:13></a> And with this <i>agree</i> the words of the prophets.<a name=65:14></a>" He is not looking for something that disagrees.<a name=65:15></a> What shines in this chapter is that the brethren are moving in the current of what the Spirit is saying and stressing

		S.McC.<a name=77:1></a> This chapter is a fitting conclusion to the enquiry we have pursued together in these meetings.<a name=77:2></a> It is a very rich and very full chapter, and it gives us a remarkable view of Paul and his great service and especially referring to the subject of love as we have often noted in this chapter.<a name=77:3></a> There are a number of things that bear out in the chapter the thought of spiritual quality which we have looked at together, such as the first embrace, then the company that were with Paul, verse 4, the first day of the week, and the breaking of bread, and then the way that Paul descending falls upon Eutychus enfolding him in his arms, and then the remarkable way he goes over things in his words to the elders of Ephesus, and the remarkable feature that he touches upon in his word referring to the assembly in such a unique way, and all the counsel of God, and then referring latterly to the extent of his care for them, and the way he went about in his service in ministering, working with his hands and labouring.<a name=77:4></a> All this sets out the idea of quality, and then the finish of the chapter when we get the embrace again when they fell upon the neck of Paul and ardently kissed him; pointing us to the reciprocity of love in this wonderful environment that <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>brings before us.<a name=77:5></a> These thoughts we should keep before us in finishing our enquiry as we look into this chapter 20 together.<a name=77:6></a> It is evident that Paul is contemplating the finishing of the apostolic period.<a name=77:7></a> There is no such thought as apostolic succession which some claim around us.<a name=77:8></a> It is perfectly clear from this chapter that there is no such thought as that, in that Paul appoints his service to no one following him particularly, in fact he leaves

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:7></a> I think it shows us that Paul's ministry, Paul's service and ministry involves this activity of love, and the more we are in touch with Paul and his ministry in this light the more we shall understand this embrace.<a name=78:8></a> It says "But after the tumult had ceased, Paul having called the disciples to him and embraced them, went away to go to Macedonia.<a name=78:9></a>" Paul's commission was not just a mere arbitrary commission to convey certain features of the truth that were in the dispensation that were committed to him, but he is setting out the great feature that enters into the economy, extending from God through Christ and the Spirit and the servants to the saints, the feature of love.<a name=78:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.M.<a name=78:11></a>D.<a name=78:12></a> Would the embrace suggest that love would be in circulation?<a name=78:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=78:14></a> I think it does.<a name=78:15></a> The whole chapter would have that in mind, circulation, which is a great thing.<a name=78:16></a> The life of the Christian circle as it were lies in relation to the circulation of love.<a name=78:17></a> It is all right to speak of the subject of love, but if the thing is not in circulation we know there is not much value attaching to the position.<a name=78:18></a> We know what it is in regard of the monetary system, however much wealth there may be if the principle of circulation is interfered with impoverishment sets in, and it is the same in the assembly.<a name=78:19></a>

		S.McC.<a name=80:10></a> That is very interesting, for in this section, verses 3 and 4, despite Paul's apostolic authority and the weight he carried in the light of his apostolic commission he entered into matters with others, as it says, "and having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came to Greece.<a name=80:11></a> And having spent three months there, a treacherous plot against him having been set on foot by the Jews, as he was going to sail to Syria, the resolution was adopted of returning through Macedonia.<a name=80:12></a> And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.<a name=80:13></a>" Notice how much Macedonia is coming into this section.<a name=80:14></a> <i>Macedonia referring to a choice part where Paul's ministry had borne much fruit</i>, and he always seemed to have special delight in referring

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:6></a> It is a very interesting thing how both these thoughts are linked with Macedonia.<a name=81:7></a> Paul said in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16">1 Corinthians  16</a>, "I will come to you when I shall have gone through Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia," verse 5.<a name=81:8></a> Why does he say that?<a name=81:9></a> It shows how much Macedonia was on his mind, and you remember how later in the second letter to the Corinthians he says in chapter 9: 2, "For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects to you Macedonians," He says in chapter 8, "But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia; that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their free-hearted liberality.<a name=81:10></a>" As if there is a kind of fluidity linked with Macedonia, and their movements towards it in contrast to the rigidity that would result from fleshly officialism.<a name=81:11></a> I think the concluding and the resolution being adopted suggest that side of things.<a name=81:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.L.<a name=81:13></a>C.<a name=81:14></a> The thought of brethren seems to appear quite a lot in relation to those down in Macedonia.<a name=81:15></a> At Philippi when Paul left the prison with Silas they went to Lydia.<a name=81:16></a> When he came to Thessalonica "the <i>brethren</i> immediately sent away, in the night Paul and Silas to Berea.<a name=81:17></a>" And at Berea "the <i>brethren</i> sent away Paul to go as to the sea.<a name=81:18></a>" Where did they come from?<a name=81:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=82:13></a> I think that is right, and Macedonia, as we have said seems to represent a certain choice area where the brethren were very poor, but where they were so affected by the ministry and by the service of the apostle among them that we have definite results as is indicated in the second epistle to the Corinthians, their free-hearted liberality could be spoken of as <i>abounding</i> in the presence of their deep poverty.<a name=82:14></a> That is a word for <i>us</i> in regard of the collections in our gatherings, showing that where the truth really is having its way, and where there is affinity with Paul you will find that the brethren give well, and there is certainly more and more room for giving in the collections in the gatherings, I am

		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:1">Luke  1:1</a> -- 80
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:1></a> We were pursuing an enquiry elsewhere as to quality in persons in the Acts and it occurred to me that this afternoon we might pursue that further, with the service of God in mind in a general way, in Luke's gospel.<a name=97:2></a> The chapter that we have read is rather lengthy but it was suggested that we should read the whole chapter to get the full bearing of the scripture, on the subject of our enquiry.<a name=97:3></a> It will be obvious that in the time we have, we cannot go into all the details of the chapter, but it is in mind to keep before us certain persons as setting out certain positive qualities, such as John the baptist, Mary and Elizabeth and finally Zacharias.<a name=97:4></a> It is important that we should see what the Lord is aiming at in the present time in view of the completing of the dispensation, that He has quality in the saints in mind.<a name=97:5></a> The assembly is a great vessel, a vessel of great quality, being heavenly in origin and heavenly in destiny, and I think we can all see, if we look into the ministry, that the Lord is aiming at bringing us in our souls more and more into the substantial good of the greatness of the truth as to Christ and the assembly that has been brought so much before us.<a name=97:6></a> No doubt the emphasis recently on the truth as to the Spirit and as to the sisters is all bearing upon this matter of quality in the vessel that is to share with Christ in administration in the day of glory in the world to come.<a name=97:7></a> Luke has the service of God in mind in a special way.<a name=97:8></a> When we refer to the service of God we are not thinking exclusively of Lord's day morning, but we are thinking of the whole position relating to it, such as we are in this afternoon.<a name=97:9></a> The service of God is in mind in relation to our subject,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and Luke stresses the moral side, and the priestly side, and I think it is a great thing, dear brethren, that that should always be strengthened with us.<a name=98:1></a> We should see that the Lord has constantly in mind to strengthen the moral element in our souls, because the enemy has a great object of attack in any part of the world where the saints may be marked by particular and peculiar interest in the truth, and there is no doubt that he seeks, and will seek, to assail it, especially on moral lines, if by any means he can entrench himself on the position in any of our souls, to rob us of joy and buoyancy in the service of God, because that is a distinct feature of spiritual quality in Luke's gospel, the feature of joy and buoyancy, running through from beginning to end.<a name=98:2></a> I mention all this to indicate the general lines upon which our enquiry may proceed, but of course as we feel our way no doubt our enquiry will be enlarged in regard to other features that may be indicated, as in a subject, dependent way we pursue the enquiry together.<a name=98:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John is the first personality that we should think of, as representing according to Luke how the moral line is intensified and has in mind to be strengthened, as is said of him in verse 14, "He shall be to thee joy and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.<a name=98:4></a> For he shall be great before the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.<a name=98:5></a> And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.<a name=98:6></a> And <i>he</i> shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones to the thoughts of just men, to make ready for the Lord a prepared people," verse 14 -- 17.<a name=98:7></a> Now this is unique to Luke's gospel, we do not have it with the other evangelists, Matthew or Mark or John, so there must be some special intent why it appears in Luke's gospel.<a name=98:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=99>[Page 99]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that might be just noted in passing is that Luke has in mind, as one who companied with Paul, the economy of local assemblies and a confirming of the truth relating thereto, especially in the personnel that form the local gatherings.<a name=99:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=99:2></a>E.<a name=99:3></a> Would you think that we see the feature of buoyancy and joy marking John the baptist before he was born?<a name=99:4></a> "He leaped in the womb.<a name=99:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=99:6></a> A very interesting thing, showing how early the feature of buoyancy is seen with him, and with his mother, Elizabeth, a very choice vessel in the section that we are referring to, based upon the principle of Nazariteship.<a name=99:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.S.<a name=99:8></a>S.<a name=99:9></a> Would you link that too with verse 15, "He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb," the Spirit in that way giving us the thought of joy and what it means in these verses referred to?<a name=99:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=99:11></a> I am sure that is right and that enters into our enquiry, among the many other things.<a name=99:12></a> On the line of quality, especially in relation to the moral side bearing on the truth, it is important that we should learn to make room for the Spirit, and to use the Spirit as in the line of the testimony.<a name=99:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.A.<a name=99:14></a>C.<a name=99:15></a> We notice that the expression "being filled with the Holy Spirit" occurs three times in the chapter.<a name=99:16></a> First in connection with the child, then in connection with the woman, and finally in connection with the man.<a name=99:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=99:18></a> That is a very interesting thing because the child, the woman and the man, represent the component parts of the assembly.<a name=99:19></a> They set out the elements that compose the assembly, as we know.<a name=99:20></a> We have it referred to elsewhere in the gospel as the moral side of exercise is intensified, as in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8">Luke  8</a>, for instance, the man, the woman and the child.<a name=99:21></a> It is important to see that Luke has in mind to focus our attention, not on <i>one</i> component part, but on
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=100>[Page 100]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the <i>three</i> component parts of the gatherings of local assemblies -- the man, the woman and the child.<a name=100:1></a> Because if the children are wrong constitutionally, there will be an element of defection entering into the line of the testimony as it proceeds.<a name=100:2></a> I am thinking of the wine and strong drink which has a constitutional bearing -- our children kept free from the elements and principles of the world, as held on the line of devotedness to God and His interests.<a name=100:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.T.<a name=100:4></a> There is joy and buoyancy in response to the sovereignty of God?<a name=100:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=100:6></a> Well, I would say that that is one feature of the truth and an important one, but another important feature that goes along with that is the moral side in our souls.<a name=100:7></a> That is, if the moral side is not clear, the element of joy and rejoicing, buoyancy, will necessarily be affected.<a name=100:8></a> Luke has that in mind in the priestly way he writes his gospel.<a name=100:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.O.<a name=100:10></a>E.<a name=100:11></a> It is noticeable that in this gospel we get the Lord Jesus saying, while yet a Child, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?<a name=100:12></a>" chapter 2: 49.<a name=100:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=100:14></a> Very good, and I think it fits into our subject very well, because it is the only gospel that gives us that statement.<a name=100:15></a> We are to note with the evangelists, the distinctive features that appear in each, and the Lord in saying that at the age of twelve, becomes a great example in regard to the element that we have been referring to.<a name=100:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=100:17></a> Would you say that all these references to "child" would suggest that we are to take up these things at the earliest possible time and not to put them off to a later date?<a name=100:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=100:19></a> I think that is important, that they should have it in mind from the earliest, and <i>we</i> should have it in mind.<a name=100:20></a> Of course the children are natural, new birth has to take place, they have to take their own stand eventually in confession of the Lord, but we

		<a name=101>[Page 101]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		should have it in mind from the outset in their training as part of the testimony, because our children are different, "else were your children, unclean, but now are they holy," Paul says, referring to them positionally.<a name=101:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=101:2></a> Do you mean that the environment should be conducive to the Spirit to operate, to produce what we have before us?<a name=101:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=101:4></a> Exactly, that is what is in mind, and now that you have mentioned that word, it is important to see this whole environment in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>, that is why we read the whole chapter, to get some little idea of the environment that the truth appeared in.<a name=101:5></a> Because we have the incoming of Christ, the incarnation, before us in this chapter, and the whole environment is divinely sterilised in view of the quality that is to appear in "the Holy Thing" which is to be born -- the stress is on the quality, "the Holy Thing.<a name=101:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=101:7></a>E.<a name=101:8></a> That itself suggests what is priestly "the Holy Thing.<a name=101:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=101:10></a> Exactly, and the need for the exclusion of every and any extraneous element that would interfere with this kind of quality and these kind of conditions.<a name=101:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N.M.<a name=101:12></a> "Joy in heaven over one sinner, that repenteth.<a name=101:13></a>" Would buoyancy be in receiving the Spirit?<a name=101:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=101:15></a> Well, joy is a great feature of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, both in regard to the shepherd, and in regard to the woman, and in regard to the father, the thought of buoyancy is in mind all the way through in that section, I think it is especially helpful to see in this immediate part that we are considering, how it is linked with this kind of service and ministry that speaks of the spirit and power of Elias.<a name=101:16></a> We might think that <i>Elisha</i> would bring in the elements of joy and rejoicing and buoyancy, but it is the spirit and power of Elijah before us here: the powerful authoritative

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=102:5></a> That is what I thought, especially as finding a certain analogy in our time.<a name=102:6></a> It is a great thing to take account of the spirit and power of Elijah, because it represents in John the baptist the element of mystery.<a name=102:7></a> The Lord said in Matthew, chapter 11: 14, "If ye will receive it, <i>this</i> is Elias," there is an element of mystery about John the baptist that we have to understand and we are to see the bearing of it in principle in our time and in the teaching.<a name=102:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=102:9></a> You mean to us it would be the <i>spirit</i> of Elias?<a name=102:10></a> Not him personally now but the <i>spirit</i> of Elias?<a name=102:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=102:12></a> That is it, the spirit and power of Elias.<a name=102:13></a> Another interesting thing in Luke's gospel is to follow through the idea of "power" in the gospel.<a name=102:14></a> It is a remarkable thing that the gospel that gives us the Lord Jesus as touching humanity at its lowest point in the babe in the manger, begins with the thought of power and ends with the thought of power.<a name=102:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		V.B.<a name=102:16></a> Would you say that what follows in that verse (17) "to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones to the thoughts of just men," would bear out what you say as regards power?<a name=102:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=102:18></a> I thought so, it is the effective power of the ministry.<a name=102:19></a> John the baptist belonged to another dispensation, but we are thinking of the principle of ministry of this character that makes way for the Lord's coming in, as that is our great expectation, we are being prepared as a people waiting for the Lord to come in.<a name=102:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		<a name=103>[Page 103]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=103:1></a> Well, it is a great matter that the Spirit should be made room for, made room for in us individually as well as in the gatherings.<a name=103:2></a> Luke is emphasising persons in whom the Spirit has a <i>right-of-way</i>, not just that He is there but that He has a right-of-way.<a name=103:3></a> I suppose that most here have the Spirit, but has the Spirit got a right-of-way with us?<a name=103:4></a> It is important in view of spiritual quality being arrived at.<a name=103:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=103:9></a> I was thinking especially of "the thoughts of just men, to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.<a name=103:10></a>" John's ministry seems to be paving the way for the incoming of Christ.<a name=103:11></a> And of course <i>all</i> ministry that comes from heaven <i>will</i> make way for Christ.<a name=103:12></a> If in ministry way is not made for Christ there is a defect in it.<a name=103:13></a> So there is a certain analogy in that, and of course, Elijah's ministry had to do with apostate times.<a name=103:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=103:15></a>E.<a name=103:16></a> Luke is the only one who gives us the names of all those political authorities, Philip the tetrarch, Lysanias, and Herod, he gives them all in connection with the birth.<a name=103:17></a> What do you think of that?<a name=103:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=103:19></a> Well, I think it is very interesting to notice what you now refer to.<a name=103:20></a> He first refers to the days of Herod, those who were more local to Judaea and the territory around there, but then in the second chapter he extends farther abroad to Caesar Augustus, and then in the third chapter he opens up the diversified forms of government both in districts and otherwise.<a name=103:21></a> I think it is to help us to see that whatever form the government might take the line of quality in the testimony is going through, and I think it helps us at the present time in view of the current situation that we have to do with, to see that whatever may be transpiring in the diversified forms of government,

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=104:4></a> Oh, I think so, I think it is a great comfort to take account of the fact that God is thinking of the assembly.<a name=104:5></a> He is thinking of the testimony.<a name=104:6></a> However weak some may think the western nations are, God has got His eye on the assembly in that position, and He will keep His hand over matters definitely until the church is translated.<a name=104:7></a>

		S.McC.<a name=107:4></a> Well, I think it is to show us that age is <i>not</i> a disadvantage in the things of God.<a name=107:5></a> Some of us were looking the other day at Caleb, he says, "I am this day eighty-five years old," and he says, I am as strong this day as I was then, showing that age is not a disadvantage in the things of God.<a name=107:6></a> I should say that age is a distinct advantage in the things of God.<a name=107:7></a> Although in Zacharias we have a certain defection appearing, yet his wife Elizabeth represents one in whom the line is maintained, so that <i>he</i> comes under the power of the environment, and breaks forth.<a name=107:8></a>

		S.McC.<a name=107:17></a> Very good.<a name=107:18></a> Showing the necessity, which Luke would stress (it is a feature of his teaching throughout) of the completing of moral exercises.<a name=107:19></a> And it is a great matter with each of us, brothers and sisters alike, that moral exercises in our souls <i>should</i> be completed in view of our own practical gain, and in view of the gain of the gatherings in which we are set.<a name=107:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=107:24></a> That is right, and so on this road, as we might refer to it, this moral road, quality in the sisters is stressed.<a name=107:25></a> It says of Mary in verse 38, "And Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of the Lord;

		S.McC.<a name=111:16></a> You mean in the substance of her remarks?<a name=111:17></a> Yes, I am sure that is right.<a name=111:18></a> As has often been noted Elizabeth represents the free action of the Spirit at any given time.<a name=111:19></a> Here they are in the house of Zacharias.<a name=111:20></a> It is a great thing that in our homes, in the houses of the saints, that we should have this kind of quality, the quality that was seen in Elizabeth and Mary.<a name=111:21></a> Elizabeth suggests the free action of the Spirit in given circumstances such as this, in the home circle, and Mary represents the sustained, substantial, contributive side in her thanksgiving.<a name=111:22></a>

		S.McC.<a name=118:1></a> Yesterday afternoon we looked at certain persons in the first chapter of this gospel -- John, Elizabeth, Mary and Zacharias, keeping before us the thought of moral or spiritual quality as is stressed in these persons in the opening of the gospel, and reference was made to the way that Luke in his ministry stresses the moral side, and how his gospel, generally speaking, has in mind the service of God.<a name=118:2></a> This afternoon in the first passage that we have read in the second chapter, we have Simeon, and Anna the daughter of Phanuel, both remarkable persons, and particularly fitting into our subject because of the features that mark them.<a name=118:3></a> We have persons also referred to in the ninth chapter that set out the thought of spiritual quality, and what we should keep before us now in our enquiry in the first section that we have read is more the <i>outward</i> bearing of the service of God, and in the second passage that we have read, the more <i>inward</i> bearing of the service of God.<a name=118:4></a> Quality is essential in those features of the service.<a name=118:5></a> The scene in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>is particularly affecting, inasmuch as it has to do with the incoming of Christ in such <i>lowly</i> circumstances, as Mr.<a name=118:6></a> Darby has said "Oh, strange yet fit beginning to all that life of woe.<a name=118:7></a>" That in itself, in the setting of the testimony in that way, should call for our attention, because Simeon and Anna are fitting into the particular setting of the testimony at the moment; and so are Moses and Elias in chapter 9.<a name=118:8></a> Peter and James and John are brought into it there by the Lord, but Moses and Elias are already with Him, and we should keep in our minds in our enquiry this thought, how persons fit into the line of the testimony in correspondence

		with what may be obtaining at a given time.<a name=119:1></a> So that Simeon who comes first into our consideration is referred to as "a man in Jerusalem," and then in verse 25, "And <i>this</i> man was just and pious," again stressing the moral line.<a name=119:2></a> To be "just and pious" seems to be a feature that Luke would make a good deal of, and especially must we keep in mind the affinities that would seem to be there between the Spirit and Simeon.<a name=119:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=119:7></a> Well, the meeting this afternoon fits in with the outward bearing of the service of God, and our other readings during the week, and other meetings, fit in with that side.<a name=119:8></a> But this morning, moving on to the spiritual side of the service, we have what we referred to as the inward bearing of the service of God.<a name=119:9></a> The mount of transfiguration links with it.<a name=119:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=119:15></a> I would think so, although we would not shut out in the first passage the way that God is before the soul of Simeon, but as you point out, generally speaking, the bearing of what we have in this second chapter is in relation to what is testimonial, the bearing on man, whereas in the second passage it is the glory scene, in which we are drawn into the secret of the Father's thoughts about Christ, in the exalted, divine surroundings of the holy mount.<a name=119:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=120:4></a> I think what you refer to is extremely interesting and throws fresh light on what we had before us yesterday afternoon.<a name=120:5></a> What you refer to is important to notice because it adds to the richness of the subject.<a name=120:6></a> It adds to the greatness of what there is in the opening chapters of Luke, we might say, behind the testimonial setting and character of things that Luke has in mind, and which was referred to earlier.<a name=120:7></a> The manger and the reproach linked with it all has a bearing on the testimonial side, but lying <i>behind</i> it is refinement in the spiritual intelligence in the apprehension of divine Persons, all Three of Them.<a name=120:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=120:11></a> Well, these are very interesting verses, because you notice how the thought of "law" is stressed, "according to the law of Moses" (verse 22), then "according to what is said in the <i>law</i> of the Lord" (verse 24), opening up the great range of the teaching in the beginning.<a name=120:12></a> We have not got time to go into it now, but the great teaching of Romans is to help the believer, as enjoying deliverance, to delight in the law of the Lord.<a name=120:13></a> "I delight in the law of God," it is said, and the law of God is regulatory, and it is a great matter that, in what has to do with the public side of the service of God that our thoughts and our words should not be without control.<a name=120:14></a> The law of Moses and the law of the Lord represent controlling light in regard of the position.<a name=120:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=121:5></a> I think so.<a name=121:6></a> You mean, the Lord's Christ?<a name=121:7></a> Particularly referring to the Psalms, which bear on the service of God in all its richness and fulness in an inward way.<a name=121:8></a> For instance, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, what a blessed allusion we have to the Lord's Christ; and all through the Psalms it can be traced.<a name=121:9></a> But "awaiting the consolation of Israel" would be like our position publicly now, in awaiting the coming of the Lord, so that what we did this morning really had a testimonial bearing on the public position, in view of His coming.<a name=121:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=121:14></a> Yes, exactly, I think it is an important matter with regard to the public side of the service of God that these affinities with the Spirit should be understood better, and be more in evidence with us, because it is not a question now, this afternoon, of academic teaching -- we will not get anywhere on that line.<a name=121:15></a> We may have orderly exposition and the like, but the important thing, the great line of demarcation between what is true and the mere profession, is this matter of affinity with the Spirit: that there is continual liberty in the meeting and in the persons in relation to the Spirit.<a name=121:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=122:11></a>H.<a name=122:12></a> You referred to the law of the Lord.<a name=122:13></a> It is mentioned at the end too, "and when they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city.<a name=122:14></a> Nazareth," but in between their coming to do what was referring to the law and their having fulfilled it, you get at what Simeon and Anna represent.<a name=122:15></a> Is it not a suggestion that nothing is completed without these conditions?<a name=122:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=122:17></a> Well, I think so.<a name=122:18></a> I think that is the point, and if we may so say, the epistle to the Corinthians, especially the first epistle, would correspond to the law of the Lord, the law of God in that way as governing our assemblies, and governing our position in the very centre of things as is in mind here.<a name=122:19></a> So that our minds and our thoughts are not loose, they are not uncontrolled, we are together on the principle of being governed by the light that governs the position.<a name=122:20></a> That, as I understand it, is the law of the Lord, it is the light that governs the position.<a name=122:21></a>

		M.S.<a name=125:2></a>S.<a name=125:3></a> I wondered whether there is teaching in the order in which the Spirit is presented, three times in connection with Simeon?<a name=125:4></a> First it is <i>upon</i> him, then it was divinely communicated <i>to</i> him by the Holy Spirit, then he came <i>in</i> the Spirit.<a name=125:5></a> I wondered if, having the Spirit upon us and listening to His communications, in that way we are enabled to move in the power of the Spirit?<a name=125:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=125:7></a> Exactly.<a name=125:8></a> I think that is right, and what a power for good and for spiritual richness are persons who come this way, who come <i>in</i> the Spirit <i>into</i> the temple.<a name=125:9></a> The "upon," and the communication to, would especially stress the affinity of Simeon with the Spirit, because there was something there that the Spirit could link on with.<a name=125:10></a> So that it is evident that if there is anything in any of our hearts, or in our lives unjudged, that the Spirit will <i>not</i> have liberty in linking on with us.<a name=125:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.Y.<a name=125:12></a> So as moving in the liberty of the Spirit we are at liberty to speak to God, and speak to God in appreciation of Christ, in such glowing terms.<a name=125:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=125:14></a> Yes, it is remarkable how it says, "He blessed God," as if the first consideration he had was for God.<a name=125:15></a> This is the mark of a true priestly man.<a name=125:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=125:17></a> I was thinking of Simeon waiting for the consolation of Israel.<a name=125:18></a> Whether that would mean that he had God's thoughts and carried them in view of what would be the consolation of Israel, and connected that with the Lord Jesus who had come in?<a name=125:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=125:20></a> I think it is a very interesting matter that he was awaiting the consolation -- not of Simeon -- he was awaiting the consolation of Israel, showing how enlarged the man was.<a name=125:21></a> As a man in Jerusalem, at the very centre of divine operations, he was, what
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=126>[Page 126]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we would say in our way of speaking, governed by an assembly viewpoint.<a name=126:1></a> He was thinking in assembly thoughts and in assembly ideas -- the consolation of <i>Israel</i>.<a name=126:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=126:3></a> And, would you say, at a time when there was outwardly scarcely anything to be said for Israel, he had in his heart the whole position?<a name=126:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=126:5></a> That is it, and it is particularly fitting at the present time, that we have the whole assembly in our minds.<a name=126:6></a> The Lord has nothing less.<a name=126:7></a> In Philadelphia He has not got a remnant in mind, He has not got a particular few in mind, He has got the whole assembly in His mind.<a name=126:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=126:9></a> I was thinking of what Paul says, before Agrippa, "our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day and night," it was the whole thought.<a name=126:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=126:11></a> Exactly, so that what is a help to see now in these things we are referring to is, that as you find brothers and sisters who are marked by particular affinity with the Spirit, they have an enlarged viewpoint, not a circumscribed viewpoint, but it is an enlarged viewpoint, an enlarged outlook, in regard to the saints and the truth.<a name=126:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=126:13></a>H.<a name=126:14></a> That is why Simeon refers to "a light for revelation of the Gentiles" I suppose?<a name=126:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=126:16></a> Well, there it is, light is expanding and extending in this section, and when we come together in our readings like these, and in our local readings, we will find that as persons come this way, and marked by these qualities, the truth enlarges and extends on our view.<a name=126:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=126:18></a> And so he is speaking of the consolation of Israel, but yet when he is speaking of the Gentiles he puts them first as to order, "for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel.<a name=126:19></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=126:20></a> Well, do you not think that that refers to the particular intelligence of Simeon as moving on this line, that he saw that God had humanity in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=127>[Page 127]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		mind?<a name=127:1></a> Because in Luke humanity is in mind and the Lord Jesus Christ is coming in as the new Head of the race on the side of humanity and Simeon as in the current of divine feelings and the divine mind apprehends that, do you not think?<a name=127:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=127:3></a> I think so.<a name=127:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=127:5></a>E.<a name=127:6></a> Would you say that this was a great reward for a man like Simeon?<a name=127:7></a> He is rewarded by seeing the Lord's Christ.<a name=127:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=127:9></a> Oh, I think it is, and I think we shall find that we are more than compensated as we are more on this line, that there is particular help on the line of pursuing divine interests as indicated in Simeon.<a name=127:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.T.<a name=127:11></a> Simeon, though he does not belong to this dispensation, was just and pious.<a name=127:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=127:13></a> That is interesting as fitting into the moral side that we have been stressing, and it is important that these features of uprightness, piety and integrity should support the public position of the testimony.<a name=127:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.K.<a name=127:15></a> Noah was a just man too, although he did not belong to this dispensation.<a name=127:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=127:17></a> Exactly.<a name=127:18></a> Simeon does not belong to our dispensation as we say, and he is marked by justness and piety, and Paul stresses it to a young man, Timothy, the idea of piety -- the whole of the first epistle to Timothy breathes of piety.<a name=127:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.Y.<a name=127:20></a> Is it not noticeable that Simeon blesses God, and after blessing God he now turns to the father and mother of the child and blesses them also?<a name=127:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=127:22></a> Well, he does, as if he is conversant with what is in the divine mind.<a name=127:23></a> It says, verse 34, "And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Lo, this child is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel" -- not among the Gentiles notice -- but the fall and rising <i>up</i> (notice that word 'up'), "and for a sign spoken against (and even a sword shall go through thine own soul); so that the thoughts may be revealed from many hearts.<a name=127:24></a>" Simeon in speaking

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to the parents in this way seemed to realise the great diverging line that there would be in the matter, "even a sword shall go through thine own soul," alluding to the division between what is natural and spiritual.<a name=128:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=128:2></a> Would you say that it is significant that all this took place in the temple.<a name=128:3></a> We get the temple in Corinthians, and Simeon's and Anna's being in the temple antedates our day, do you not think?<a name=128:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=128:5></a> Well, it would, so that the principle of the thing is what we carry in our minds.<a name=128:6></a> For instance, this afternoon, the principle of the temple is operating in regard to our enquiring into the truth, and it is specially important to see the relation of the Spirit to the temple, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you.<a name=128:7></a>" That is, the link is with the Spirit in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>.<a name=128:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.Y.<a name=128:9></a> You referred just now to Simeon speaking of the dividing line in connection with a sword going through Mary's own soul; do we see how, in verse 43, the Lord cut the ground where what was natural was concerned?<a name=128:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=128:11></a> Well, exactly, that would be one principle of it, that the Lord maintains the great dividing line when it comes to the asserting of natural claims, but yet what should touch our hearts is, that in these circumstances the Lord goes down with them and is subject to them, which is a feature that is running through this section.<a name=128:12></a> As we saw it in Mary yesterday, "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord!<a name=128:13></a>" stressing subjection.<a name=128:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=128:15></a>H.<a name=128:16></a> The intensification of the moral line would be stressed in the fact that Simeon received him <i>into</i> his arms?<a name=128:17></a> As the parents brought in the child Jesus, he received Him into his arms, as though to suggest there was no reserve with him whatever, but he was wholeheartedly committed to the position.<a name=128:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=128:19></a> That is it, he set out in that way how we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are to be ready for the reception of Christ, ready for impressions of Christ, and to take them on in this way.<a name=129:1></a> Notice what is says, "and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law," notice how all through the section the regulating side is stressed.<a name=129:2></a> That is, things are not just running loosely, our thoughts are not running loosely on matters, and so when we sit together as we are now, the principle of control enters into our way of thinking and taking part: so that we do not have wild gourds, we do not have wrong or inaccurate suggestions as to the truth.<a name=129:3></a> As we make way for the Spirit we shall be kept on the line of what is proper and right according to God.<a name=129:4></a> So Simeon represents persons who have a peculiar link with the Spirit, who not only <i>have</i> the Spirit, but are making use of the Spirit, and are in communion with Him.<a name=129:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.O.<a name=129:6></a>E.<a name=129:7></a> Mary gets the good of that in the second of John.<a name=129:8></a> She says, "Whatever he may say to you do," <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:5">John  2:5</a>.<a name=129:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=129:10></a> Exactly.<a name=129:11></a> The sword, as it were, must have entered into her soul somewhat that time when the Lord said, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?<a name=129:12></a> Mine hour has not yet come.<a name=129:13></a>" The Lord was helping Mary to see what was proper in the matter of her approach to him.<a name=129:14></a>

		L.A.<a name=129:15></a>C.<a name=129:16></a> The communication here is from the Holy Spirit, but in verse 29 Simeon acknowledges it as to God, and refers to it as "<i>Thy</i> word," would you help us as to that?<a name=129:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=129:18></a> Well, I think verse 29 shows us what Simeon did.<a name=129:19></a> He says, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to the word.<a name=129:20></a>" It was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ, and now he says, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace;

		S.McC.<a name=130:6></a> You mean in verse 29?<a name=130:7></a> No, "the Lord" here is God, it is the general way in the Old Testament of referring to God.<a name=130:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=130:17></a> Is there not also suggestive teaching in it, that with Christ in our arms we are ready to go out of sight?<a name=130:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=130:19></a> That is it.<a name=130:20></a> What a wonderful sight it is, is it not, to see this man receiving the child into his arms.<a name=130:21></a> It should touch us to think of what was in that small compass.<a name=130:22></a> We speak of the manger and the small compass that was there, but look at this small compass -- the Babe in Simeon's arms!<a name=130:23></a> The infinite greatness of what is compressed into our gatherings and within our reach, and in the light of the greatness of it we are prepared to go out, as you point out.<a name=130:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		M.S.<a name=130:25></a>S.<a name=130:26></a> The "he" is emphatic in verse 28, "<i>he</i> received him.<a name=130:27></a>" Would not that suggest the quality that you are bringing before us in this man?<a name=130:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=130:29></a> I think it would.<a name=130:30></a> It is very touching as we get it here, it is not that he <i>took</i> him into his arms, it is "he <i>received</i> him into his arms," as if

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the child was moving towards the position.<a name=131:1></a> Not that we want to put too much into the passage, but it is a wonderful thing to take account of this, that in John's gospel where the Person of Christ is peculiarly in mind, it says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<a name=131:2></a>" The Lord is viewed there as coming <i>into</i> the bosom of the Father.<a name=131:3></a> He was <i>received</i> in the bosom, the word 'bosom' as some of us may know, points to a receptacle.<a name=131:4></a> It is the idea of <i>receptivity</i>, as the word in the original conveys.<a name=131:5></a> The preposition 'in' denotes the movement towards, but the bosom itself denotes receptivity.<a name=131:6></a> In Luke Jesus is particularly on the side of humanity.<a name=131:7></a> And now we get humanity in Simeon, rising, in principle, to the matter in that the child is received into his arms.<a name=131:8></a> And that is a very touching matter, he received confirmation and that enters into his reception of Christ.<a name=131:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.S.<a name=131:10></a>S.<a name=131:11></a> Does it not involve moral correspondence between Christ and the man Simeon?<a name=131:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=131:13></a> Well, it does, I think it involves (to use the word that we have been using), that there is not only affinity between Simeon and the Spirit, spiritual affinity, but that there is affinity between Simeon and the babe.<a name=131:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=131:15></a>H.<a name=131:16></a> So that expressed in Simeon was what God had in mind, and what the angel predicated, that God should visit Israel -- seen in the way that he received Christ, is it not?<a name=131:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=131:18></a> I am sure that is so, that carries with it a view of humanity in Simeon, a <i>man</i> in Jerusalem.<a name=131:19></a> Humanity according to the divine thought, we might say, making way for this wonderful advent of Christ.<a name=131:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=143:11></a> I am sure that is very interesting, and I think there is something in what you say in regard to the matter of suffering, because Paul says, you will remember, quoting from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#44:22">Psalm  44:22</a>, "For thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for slaughter.<a name=143:12></a>" He quotes that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=143:13></a> The thought of suffering is peculiarly linked with the idea of the sheep, and there is something about the drachma which is important to notice, and I think it fits in with the thought of quality in the passage you referred to in Peter.<a name=143:14></a> It says of the drachma first of all, "What woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it?<a name=143:15></a>" In that passage in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>it says, "That ye might set forth the excellencies of him who

		S.McC.<a name=144:5></a> No, it does not.<a name=144:6></a> Its value is lost to the <i>house</i>; that is, the saints, the assembly loses its value for the moment.<a name=144:7></a> Because if anything gets out of circulation we know that there is a definite depleting of the resources.<a name=144:8></a> We can take account of that financially and otherwise, in material goods, that when things get out of circulation, it depletes by so much the purchasing or operating power of the system.<a name=144:9></a> And that is what we want to note here.<a name=144:10></a> There are many who might say, it does not matter whether they are doing much or whether they are in circulation or not, but it matters a good deal, because there were ten before and there are only nine now, and that means that the purchasing and operating power is depleted by that much.<a name=144:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=144:14></a> I think so, and I think that the great thing in the chapter is that we should be affected by the concentration of feelings in this chapter, because it is a chapter that is filled with feelings as to the matter, in divine Persons.<a name=144:15></a> So that as we think of the brethren, especially as the subjects of recovering and restoring grace, as is in mind in this chapter, we think of them on exalted lines.<a name=144:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=145:2></a> I think there is, that as the chapter proceeds from the standpoint of shepherd care, through the careful searching of the woman in regard to the piece of silver, down to the matter of the person, it comes down to <i>two</i>.<a name=145:3></a> When we come to the idea of actual persons we come down to the number <i>two</i> to show us the concentrated interest of God in this matter of persons.<a name=145:4></a>

		C.Bl.<a name=145:5></a> What is the suggestion of the woman searching for the piece of silver as connected with Christianity?<a name=145:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=145:7></a> Well, in the way we are now thinking of it, we are thinking of it in relation to the Spirit in the assembly, and how the Spirit has part in the great matter of what is taking place in relation to the assembly, in the securing of what is essential to carry on the affairs of the house, the service of God in other words.<a name=145:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=145:9></a> Is what is said in verse 2 an answer to the statement, "This man receives sinners and eats with them," divine Persons going about recovery in this way so as to bring into effect the recovery in man, in spite of all that man has fallen into, all the degradation, divine Persons are moving to bring about recovery independent of that?<a name=145:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=145:11></a> Exactly, and to get man on to the elevated line, the heavenly line of divine thoughts in this chapter.<a name=145:12></a> It is a wonderful thing to see the elevated line that is running through this chapter, that it is not just a mere question of the extrication of man in view of his relief, but the <i>pleasure</i> of divine Persons, "<i>Rejoice with me</i>" is the word in verse 6, and in verse 9, "Rejoice with me," and then again in verse 23, "Bring me the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry.<a name=145:13></a>" That is, it is a matter of divine joy in this setting.<a name=145:14></a> We do not think enough

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=146:7></a> Well, exactly, and that is what I meant by saying that we are to be affected by divine feelings as entering into this chapter, so that we ourselves become marked by the same kind of feelings.<a name=146:8></a> The very words "Rejoice with me" in these sections that we have alluded to, "rejoice <i>with</i> me," show that divine Persons are bringing us alongside of them in this matter.<a name=146:9></a> The preposition 'with' is to be noted.<a name=146:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=147:15></a> I think there is something in that.<a name=147:16></a> It is a very interesting thing that in the great chapter of the cleansing, the restoring and cleansing of the leper in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#14">Leviticus  14</a>, the great thing to see is the sympathy that enters into his restoration.<a name=147:17></a> We might just refer to it now as we are talking about it.<a name=147:18></a> It says in verse 10, "And on the eighth day.<a name=147:19></a>" We saw yesterday how Luke would give a touch as to the eighth day.<a name=147:20></a> He only of the evangelists mentions the eighth day in regard to the mount of transfiguration, that is, he links us with another world and the eighth day here is linking us on with another day, a new day, the eighth day, as it says in verse 10, "He shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one yearling ewe-lamb without blemish, and three tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil, for an oblation, and one log of oil.<a name=147:21></a> And the priest that cleanseth him shall present the man that is to be cleansed and those things before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.<a name=147:22></a>" Now notice at the beginning of the chapter, it has been the leper until now, it says in verse 1, "This shall be the law of the <i>leper</i> in the day of his cleansing," and in verse 3, "when the priest

	<div class="paragraph">
		looketh, behold, the sore of leprosy is healed in the <i>leper</i>," but notice when you come to verse 11, it is not "shall present the leper" but "shall present the man" -- "How much better is a man," the Lord said, "than a sheep," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:12">Matthew  12:12</a>.<a name=148:1></a> We are now in the presence of the value of a man, "present the man that is to be cleansed and those things before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.<a name=148:2></a>" Then in verse 21, where provision is made in a certain way for a poor one, it says, "But if he be poor, and his hand be not able to get it, then he shall take one lamb for a trespass-offering, for a wave-offering, to make atonement for him; and one tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for an oblation; <i>and a log of oil</i>.<a name=148:3></a>" What one would like to point out is that there is no difference in regard to the log of oil.<a name=148:4></a> Whether it be in the one who <i>has</i> the means, or whether it be in the one who has not got the means, when it comes to the log of oil, the measure is the same, which I think points to this element of quality that we are now considering, linked specially with the Spirit.<a name=148:5></a> The log of oil, as we know, is a twelfth part of a hin.<a name=148:6></a> That is, it is part of something else, part of a whole idea, and that is what this chapter is impressing us with.<a name=148:7></a> While persons get estranged from whole ideas, the whole bent of divine activities is to bring us <i>back</i> to these whole ideas -- a hundred sheep, or ten drachmas, or the two sons, while the elder one elects to put himself out of it, that is his matter.<a name=148:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=149:6></a> Well, it is interesting to see how he approached them with whole thoughts in mind, they had divided thoughts among them.<a name=149:7></a> Some were saying they were of Paul, others saying they were of Apollos, still some more saying they were of Christ -- these are all divided ideas, but the great thing that Paul keeps before them is <i>whole</i> ideas, "If the <i>whole</i> assembly come together in one place," and so on, that could be referred to.<a name=149:8></a>

		S.McC.<a name=152:18></a> I think it would.<a name=152:19></a> We have always got to keep in mind that the Spirit has taken a place of relative obscurity in the system, serving behind the scene, so that in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8">1 Corinthians  8</a>, in the statement as to the economy He is not mentioned.<a name=152:20></a> And in Colossians, where His work so wondrously appears He is only mentioned once, and we have always to keep in mind in the order in the Trinity as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>, that the Spirit is last.<a name=152:21></a> He is not first, and there is something in that that would regulate us as to the place that the Spirit would have in the service of God, so that there is a proper balance.<a name=152:22></a>

		S.McC.<a name=154:13></a> Verse 7 says, "I say unto you, that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner," he says, "Rejoice with me for <i>I</i> have found my lost sheep," he is referring to what is in the house down here.<a name=154:14></a> And he says then, "I say unto you that <i>thus</i>" -- that is, corresponding with the joy in the assembly here there is joy in heaven.<a name=154:15></a> And then in verse 9 it says, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.<a name=154:16></a> <i>Thus</i>, I say unto you, there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner," We are now reminded of the place the angels have in this great matter.<a name=154:17></a>

		S.McC.<a name=165:5></a> Well, Nazariteship underlies it, but what we are trying to stress and to emphasise, is what is provided from <i>our</i> side; that we have the light of the divine mind in the tabernacle set up and anointed, and the glory that filled it, but then what are <i>we</i> doing?<a name=165:6></a> What about <i>our</i> side, and the wealth that is latent by the work of God in the saints, on our side?<a name=165:7></a> It is coming into view in practical committal here in support of the whole system of light typified in the tabernacle.<a name=165:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=166:4></a> Well, it is interesting to note in this book what is covered.<a name=166:5></a> That in itself is a very interesting study in the book of Numbers.<a name=166:6></a> For instance, in chapter 19 where we get unusual light brought into the book of Numbers (you would think it belonged to Leviticus), as to the red heifer, we get the idea of every vessel that has a cover <i>bound</i> upon it is free from defilement.<a name=166:7></a> A very important thing that our children in our tents, in our houses, should be covered, the covering <i>bound</i> upon them, as is going to be done this week in the matter of baptism, our brother is in principle going to <i>bind</i> the covering.<a name=166:8></a> Of course, it does not only involve the formal act of baptism but the <i>teaching</i> of baptism, as the binding of the covering of the vessel so that it is held free from defilement.<a name=166:9></a> Then we get the covering of the different vessels, articles of furniture; and the princes have got the idea.<a name=166:10></a> That is, there is a certain suggestion in the covering that the princes have taken on, and it is coming in in their contributions.<a name=166:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=166:15></a> Well, I think the idea of the "twelve" is a delightful suggestion, because it is a matter of love entering into these great responsive movements.<a name=166:16></a> The twelve is the great love number and also sets out the ability to work with one another in relation to the light that the Lord is giving.<a name=166:17></a> Instead of pulling away from one another, the number twelve suggests that we are merging together in love, in responsive movement to the light that may be given at any given moment.<a name=166:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=167:6></a> Well, I think so, I think the thought of unity is stressed in the chapter and the ability to work with one another.<a name=167:7></a> That is, if there are six waggons it does not mean that every one is given a waggon, there is the matter of their ability to work with one another in support of this system of light that is represented in the first two verses.<a name=167:8></a>

		S.McC.<a name=168:5></a> I think so, the remarkable thing is that God is before us in the end of the Nazarite chapter, and He comes into the end of the chapter of the princes.<a name=168:6></a> He comes into the beginning of the chapter of the princes and He comes in at the end, you will notice, in the matter of giving a word.<a name=168:7></a> Where you get Nazariteship among the saints you may count on a fresh accession of light.<a name=168:8></a> As we come together in our gatherings, where there is devotedness and the desire to hold ourselves free from <i>all</i> natural and worldly influences, you will find that the brethren will get fresh accessions of light, and that is what these verses that you referred to bring out -- "<i>Jehovah</i> spoke to Moses, saying .<a name=168:9></a>.<a name=168:10></a>.<a name=168:11></a> ", and we have this wonderful touch as to His favour shining upon His people.<a name=168:12></a>

		H.L.<a name=170:8></a>H.<a name=170:9></a> Referring back to chapter 3, where it says the charge of Merari "consisted in the oversight of the boards of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its bases, and all its furniture, and all that belongs to its service," that is connected with the persons you say?<a name=170:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=170:11></a> Exactly, the boards are typical of persons, believers who have been set up in relation to God in this world, on the basis of righteousness; whereas Gershon has to do with the soft materials, as it says in verse 25, "And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was: the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the curtain of the entrance to the tent of meeting.<a name=170:12></a> And the hangings of the court, and the curtain of the entrance to the court, which <i>surrounds</i> the tabernacle, <i>and</i> the altar" -- that is, they are concerned about the principles that govern the whole position, the soft materials that surround the whole position.<a name=170:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=171:2></a> I think so.<a name=171:3></a> Fresh features of the truth come out in regard to divine service in the assembly, and there are those in whom the work of God would express itself in a dignified way in giving a lead, committing themselves to the position in view of the <i>performing</i> of the service.<a name=171:4></a> Take the matter as to the Spirit, light was given as to it, but then what about the performance of the service?<a name=171:5></a> It is a question of those who can give a <i>lead</i> in regard to the performance of the service.<a name=171:6></a>

		testimony has moved forward, the light has increased through David, and now under Solomon, the service of God has been <i>greatly</i> enlarged upon, the light as to it has greatly increased, especially in the Davidic regime, and as the light increases in regard to the assembly, in regard to God's house, we must expect correspondingly that the provision for the maintenance of suitable conditions must increase.<a name=182:1></a> And therefore, we find that with the increased light that we have received in this period of assembly revival, in these last few years a great many moral questions have been raised which were not raised before, and a good deal more details in regard to the principles of separation have been raised in the minds of the saints.<a name=182:2></a> And that enters into this section, that as the light increases and the glory of the system becomes greater in our souls, the provision for the maintenance of purified conditions is greater, and therefore the great stress in this chapter on the works in <i>brass</i>.<a name=182:3></a> And I think the Lord might help us to enquire a little on the wealth of this particular section we have read as providing in the public position -- the court's position in relation to the temple system, the means whereby what is suited to the house of God can be maintained.<a name=182:4></a> It is in mind first just to refer to this man and what characterises him, and then just an allusion to the <i>pillars</i> and their importance, and then the <i>sea</i>, and then to dwell somewhat on the lavers and the richness of ornamentation that is linked with the lavers, the <i>bases</i> of the lavers; all very suggestive as fitting in with the increased light in regard to Christ and the assembly in our time.<a name=182:5></a>

		S.McC.<a name=183:1></a> Yes, so the Lord has stressed a good deal in recent times the idea of being "sent.<a name=183:2></a>" Hiram is not coming into the matter from the voluntary standpoint exactly, he is coming in as under commission, sent for and fetched, in regard to this matter.<a name=183:3></a> And the fact that he is a widow's son would fit in, perhaps, with a certain feature of the teaching, and that he is of Naphtali, "he was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and he was <i>full</i> of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, to do <i>all</i> kinds of works in brass.<a name=183:4></a>" Now what is to be noted here, in this immediate point, is that while Moses was given a pattern on the mount as to the tabernacle system, there is no pattern mentioned here.<a name=183:5></a> Of course, David had the pattern by the Spirit, of all the things for the house of God.<a name=183:6></a> A very interesting thing that allusion is made to him as having it by the Spirit, but there is no allusion to a pattern here, it seems to stress the side in manhood here in this person "full of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, to do all kinds of works in brass.<a name=183:7></a>" I think <i>that</i> is where we are tested when moral questions arise as to uprightness and what is right in the house of God, we would all like a book to give us some lay-out of precedents, but what tests us is this matter of being full of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, to do <i>all</i> kinds of works in brass.<a name=183:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=185:13></a> Very good.<a name=185:14></a> I believe there is something in that, because Timothy had a mixed parentage, just like this man here, this man had a mother of the tribe of Naphtali, but then his father was a man of Tyre, and Timothy's father is said to have been a Greek, so that there is a certain semblance in what you say.<a name=185:15></a> And then in relation to what you were referring to, Timothy came along the line of tears, "being mindful of thy tears.<a name=185:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.O.<a name=185:17></a>E.<a name=185:18></a> As a young man the apostle put a good deal into his hands, did he not?<a name=185:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=185:20></a> He did!<a name=185:21></a> And that is the point here.<a name=185:22></a> Solomon was the king, but think of what he put into this man's hands to do, with confidence that the work would be carried on, and especially is it all the more testing in that it is works in brass, that is, it is work that had to do with moral questions.<a name=185:23></a>

		A.T.<a name=185:24></a> Would you say there is a certain process the brass has to pass through before being formed?<a name=185:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=185:26></a> Well, I am sure there is something in that.<a name=185:27></a> So that is why we read that last section as to the plain of Jordan.<a name=185:28></a> Notice when it comes to the casting of the vessels Hiram is not mentioned.<a name=185:29></a> It says in verse 46, "In the plain of the Jordan did <i>the king</i>

		cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zaretan.<a name=186:1></a>" Now these two places are very interesting in themselves, but we have not got time to go into all the rich typical detail of this chapter, but it shows the environment in which the forming took place.<a name=186:2></a> Jordan is a good place to live in proximity to, from this view point -- I mean, the matter of works in brass.<a name=186:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=186:4></a> Do you mean that there has to be the answering of all these moral questions that the standard might not be lowered in the progress of the truth?<a name=186:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=186:6></a> That is what I am thinking about.<a name=186:7></a> You take the epistle to the Romans that deals with the whole moral question in our souls first.<a name=186:8></a> Romans precedes Corinthians in the history of our souls.<a name=186:9></a> It is no use our going on and trying to work out moral questions in our local gatherings if they have never been worked out in our own souls.<a name=186:10></a> The teaching of Romans is that I first face the moral question in my own soul, become a <i>bondman</i> to righteousness -- a marvellous expression, a <i>bondman</i> to righteousness.<a name=186:11></a> Righteousness has such a place that I am in bond service to it, and the whole epistle is stressing the moral line in regard to our deliverance from the world, the law, and the flesh.<a name=186:12></a> It is stressing the moral side, but it has to be worked out in my own soul first, do you not think?<a name=186:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.E.<a name=186:14></a>B.<a name=186:15></a> You are associating then the worker in brass with the brass itself?<a name=186:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=186:17></a> Well, a worker of brass, he is dealing with the <i>brass</i> side of things, not the <i>gold</i> side of things, I am not seeking in any way to detract from the gold side of things, I was saying there could be another reading on the gold side of things, but tonight we are enlarging on the <i>brass</i> which links with the public position more, and when you look over the past few years (I can only speak from what we are working out up in the north) it is tremendous the variety of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.S.<a name=187:2></a>S.<a name=187:3></a> Would Solomon be viewed here rather as "Son over God's house," I mean, the Lord as that, rather than "Son of the Father's love"?<a name=187:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:5></a> I think so, although we cannot exclude the other, but I think he is viewed in this particular chapter particularly as being over the system, as it says, the stress in verse 48 is, "And Solomon <i>made</i> all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah," and verse 51, "And <i>all</i> the work was finished that <i>king</i> Solomon made for the house of Jehovah.<a name=187:6></a>" The stress is on the authority of Solomon over the realm and yet it is the authority of love which "Son over God's house" would perhaps stress.<a name=187:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.B.<a name=187:8></a> It says, "Full of wisdom, understanding and knowledge," is the thought in mind that we should become individually qualified to deal with all moral questions that might arise, and the basic principle for that is self-judgment?<a name=187:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:10></a> Well, I should say that is just what the brass suggests -- self-judgment.<a name=187:11></a> It is a matter of judgment in a discriminatory way, and self-judgment is an important thing in all of our hearts.<a name=187:12></a> That is what the teaching of Romans is intended to help us on, that the moral question is first resolved in my own soul, then we proceed to Corinthians where we find it solved in the economy of the local assembly.<a name=187:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=187:14></a>E.<a name=187:15></a> Now the father of Hiram was a man of Tyre, he came from the business world, did he not?<a name=187:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:17></a> Yes.<a name=187:18></a> So you can see how much this man would, in a way, have to face in the matter, the line was not very clear in his genealogy, but nevertheless from the maternal side, he is of Naphtali, and Naphtali gets a goodly word in Genesis and in Deuteronomy, "Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full of the blessing of Jehovah, possess thou the west and the south.<a name=187:19></a>" So that the line of Naphtali represents

		a substantial line, as in the joy and gain of things in a certain light.<a name=188:1></a> So there is that advantage to him, although there is what might seem to be this other disadvantage, but it is not a disadvantage because he is very skilled in matters.<a name=188:2></a>

		E.L.<a name=188:3></a>E.<a name=188:4></a> Showing that we can be occupied with the commerce of the world to a certain extent, if our calling is there, but nevertheless we can go in for the making of the brass.<a name=188:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:6></a> I think so, and it would help us to see that certain things that we might think a disadvantage can be overcome, we are very prone sometimes to excuse our deficiencies by making a lot of certain disadvantages, but the point is that we have to overcome in regard to disadvantages.<a name=188:7></a> Now this matter of the two pillars which we should look at briefly is an important thing in regard to the public position; the one Jachin, meaning "He will establish," and the other Boaz, meaning "In him is strength," There is amongst the saints in the system, in the light of these two pillars, the resources to carry things through.<a name=188:8></a> We are never, as it were, to be faced with things uncompleted, as if they cannot be carried through.<a name=188:9></a> Jachin and Boaz would, in the impress of them on our minds, mean that we see that things are to be carried through; not in human strength, but in strength which is divinely supplied.<a name=188:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=188:11></a>E.<a name=188:12></a> The promise to the overcomer is that, "He that overcomes will I make a <i>pillar</i> in the temple of my God.<a name=188:13></a>" Is that a reference to this, you think?<a name=188:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:15></a> No doubt.<a name=188:16></a> Reference to the idea of a pillar is very interesting in that way, particularly fitting that the Lord should bring it in in speaking to Philadelphia.<a name=188:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.P.<a name=188:18></a> Would you say a word on the pomegranates on the capitals in relation to these pillars?<a name=188:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:20></a> Well, the pillars suggest that things are to be carried through.<a name=188:21></a> That is, we are never to be at

		a loss, in that sense, things are going to be carried through.<a name=189:1></a> As Paul says in his very approach to the exercising moral questions in Corinth, "Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God.<a name=189:2></a>" That is, there is a means to carry things through, but the pomegranates suggest certain features in the saints that are essential, as Paul says right in the midst of that, "Now I exhort you, brethren, .<a name=189:3></a>.<a name=189:4></a>.<a name=189:5></a> that ye <i>all</i> say the same thing, .<a name=189:6></a>.<a name=189:7></a>.<a name=189:8></a> that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion," That is, the pomegranate, along with the working in brass, in 1 Corinthians, is to stress all the way through the need of practical unity among the brethren.<a name=189:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.P.<a name=189:10></a> I was wondering if in the pomegranate we do not see the need of unity for the carrying out of all these moral conditions?<a name=189:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:12></a> Yes, and another thing along with that to be noted, running through the pillars and the sea, is the numeral twelve.<a name=189:13></a> That is, it says, "a line of <i>twelve</i> cubits encompassed the second pillar," and then it says further down in verse 25, in regard to the sea, "It stood upon <i>twelve</i> oxen.<a name=189:14></a>" We are reminded of love as underlying and entering into these great matters which involve the public side and the moral side in relation to the truth.<a name=189:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=189:16></a>H.<a name=189:17></a> What would the capitals suggest?<a name=189:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:19></a> I think the capitals suggest a certain kind of dignity that attaches to the principle on which things are to be carried through, the capitals upon the two pillars -- a kind of ornamental setting on the top of the pillars.<a name=189:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=189:21></a>H.<a name=189:22></a> It suggests that the thing is carried through to a finish, would it not?<a name=189:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		is, a finished idea is in mind in the songs of the ascent.<a name=190:1></a> The songs of the ascent give us the moral and spiritual exercises of the remnant in the days of recovery in the ascent, and they finish with this idea, that a completed side of things is in mind, that the oil is running down to the hem of the garment.<a name=190:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=190:3></a>H.<a name=190:4></a> So every matter in which moral issues are raised is to be taken to a certain conclusion, is that not so?<a name=190:5></a> There may be the danger at times of dropping matters at a certain time, but the thought is that they are to be carried right through.<a name=190:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=190:7></a> Well, that is what these things would stress, and what we were referring to, that we are not at a loss, and not to say that we cannot carry things through.<a name=190:8></a> If our souls and minds are imbued with these two pillars, we can see that there <i>is</i> provision in the system to carry things through; "not in strength which is of men, but in strength which is of God.<a name=190:9></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=190:13></a> Exactly, and so as Paul opens up the first epistle to the Corinthians, he calls attention to the rich way in which they had been furnished, it is a question of their laying hold of the matter.<a name=190:14></a> For instance, at the end of the first chapter, in regard to Christ, he says, "Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption," Christ of God has been made that to us.<a name=190:15></a> Well, surely there should be no lack in regard to all these matters, righteousness, wisdom, holiness and redemption.<a name=190:16></a> They represent all that is needed for the moral side of the position.<a name=190:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=191:8></a> Well, I think it is a great matter that the lily-work should be in evidence amongst us -- the thought of purity.<a name=191:9></a> And then the lily-work stresses divine workmanship, but stresses the idea of purity, that our motives are pure, there is no opaqueness with us, no ulterior motives in the solving of moral questions.<a name=191:10></a> What is impregnating our minds is, "<i>God</i> will establish," and "In <i>him</i> is strength.<a name=191:11></a>" It is not a question of me or anyone else seeking something for our own gain, the lily-work would suggest the idea of purity adorning all these matters.<a name=191:12></a>

		S.McC.<a name=195:12></a> I think the sea generally was for the priests to wash in, and the lavers were for the rinsing of the offerings.<a name=195:13></a> That is, the offerings speak of impressions of Christ, we would serve one another in love, so that not just any natural feature might be promoted, but that what <i>that</i> brother and what <i>that</i> sister has of Christ should be preserved, the sea was for the priests to wash in and the lavers were for the offerings to be rinsed in.<a name=195:14></a> It is love working out in these different ways.<a name=195:15></a> And what is to be noticed too is that both of these vessels of cleansing could hold far more than is indicated, that is, there was always room for more in regard to the water, which is an important thing.<a name=195:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=196:11></a> Yes, it is very interesting this matter of what is molten in regard to the sea, and then in verse 33 it says, "The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their supports, and their rims, and their spokes and their naves were all molten.<a name=196:12></a>" There is a certain kind of rigidity about the whole matter, in the taking up of the thing.<a name=196:13></a> We are to be impressed with that in love's service, that things are not held loosely, you know, but there is a certain firmness.<a name=196:14></a> Remember the Lord Jesus when He came to Peter on the line of the laver in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, Peter says, Thou shalt never wash <i>my</i> feet.<a name=196:15></a> Well, the Lord is very firm about the matter, He says, "Unless I wash thee thou hast not part with me.<a name=196:16></a>" Although it was love's service there is a firmness there, that there was to be no allowance for anything that would interfere with love's service.<a name=196:17></a> And I think that the molten idea suggests, not legal rigidity, but the rigidity that belongs to this system where things are held on the lines of firmness and faithfulness.<a name=196:18></a>

		Christ, God's Anointed One.<a name=202:1></a> There are various elements that act and react in the chapter in regard to the matter of Solomon.<a name=202:2></a> Solomon would represent what is peculiarly choice and fittingly linked with our day and time in relation to what is before us in the assembly.<a name=202:3></a> We should, because of the time and the need for keeping to our scriptures that we have read, abide by what has been suggested.<a name=202:4></a> It says in verse 39, "And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.<a name=202:5></a>" I do not think we will have much difficulty in seeing how the Spirit of God enters into this movement, especially a movement that is linked with the universal position, suggested in the tabernacle.<a name=202:6></a> It is not like David's own anointing so much, where the word to Samuel was, "Fill thy horn with oil" -- a matter of the personality of the great prophet Samuel, and the spirituality marking him, in "fill thy horn with oil," because the allusion would be to Samuel himself, and the power of his prophetic personality and ministry, and service: it is somewhat different when we come to Solomon, it is more a matter of what is linked with the whole position of the assembly, as it says, "The horn of oil <i>out of the tabernacle</i>" -- the tabernacle or tent of meeting being a suggestion of the assembly, I thought we might be helped in seeing for a moment how Zadok comes into view in relation to the horn of oil in this setting of the tabernacle and making way for what Solomon suggests.<a name=202:7></a> We might think of the beginning of the work of recovery of 130 years ago as fitting in with the Davidic side, the powerful personality of God's servants suggested in Samuel, their horn filled with oil; how matters were met on that principle, powerful personality in prophetic ministry.<a name=202:8></a> Of course, it descends to our own time too, and in Solomon's time things that were passed over in David's time are not passed over in Solomon's time, they have become

		S.McC.<a name=205:9></a> I think it is just to show that Solomon is a counterpart of David, that in the way of looking at the truth we must take David and Solomon as one, the one is a counterpart of the other in that way, do you not think?<a name=205:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=205:15></a> That is one of the things that has been in mind in the line of enquiry suggested, that the moral side runs through in Zadok.<a name=205:16></a> In Ezekiel we will find in looking into the last chapter in the presence of the holy heavings, the holy movements of devoted strength and love amongst the people of God, in the appreciation of the purposes of divine love, that a place is found for Zadok.<a name=205:17></a> You see how the moral line, as we might speak of it, merges into the line of purpose, and counsel, in Zadok's position in the different phases in which he is viewed.<a name=205:18></a>

		S.McC.<a name=208:7></a> That is what I was thinking about, I was particularly linking our subject with this morning, the Lord's supper and what flowed out of it.<a name=208:8></a> We do not want to be in the current of Adonijah or Joab or Abiathar, they are all centring around the man of sin and shame: how much part they can take, and the kind of part they can take, and how well worded it may be, all that is really in the spirit of Adonijah in which Joab and Abiathar are moving, whereas Zadok the priest, and Nathan and the others are moving in the current of the Spirit who is distinguishing Christ.<a name=208:9></a>

		S.McC.<a name=214:6></a> That is how I understand it, it says, "Anointed him to Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.<a name=214:7></a>" And so we have the supremacy of God alluded to in the chapter, no doubt the Father would be typified in Jehovah, and we have got the distinction of Christ, but then what is linked with the Spirit stands out in the anointing.<a name=214:8></a> The Spirit is before our souls in this great matter of the anointing, both as to the governing side, the side of dignity in the prince, in type; or as to the side of the service of God and holiness among the saints.<a name=214:9></a> Although, I suppose, there may be a certain way of referring to Christ, too, in relation to Zadok the priest.<a name=214:10></a>

		It is laid upon my heart tonight, dear brethren, to say a word about spiritual desires, for I think that if there is one thing that these meetings that we have been together in relation to these three days should do, it is to awaken and revive spiritual desires.<a name=233:1></a> It may be that we have never had them before, or it may be that we have had them before but the desires have waned somewhat with us, but what I have to say tonight I have to say to all of us, that as we return to our gatherings we shall return with renewed spiritual desires, I have chosen these passages in the Old Testament, which is so rich and so full in figurative and typical language and always serves to amplify the truth; and in all the passages I have read, there is a peculiar expression of desire.<a name=233:2></a> In regard to Achsah, that delightful young sister, whose name is so honourably mentioned, she says, "Give me a blessing," and not just content with that she says "Give me also"; oh, that word 'also'; it is interesting to see the different ways it appears in Scripture.<a name=233:3></a> She says "give me also springs of water.<a name=233:4></a>" That is, Achsah is in full accord with the mind and heart of God, <i>which is always more and more</i>.<a name=233:5></a> And then the daughters of Zelophehad whom we often refer to, they say "Give unto us a possession.<a name=233:6></a>" What courage these beloved women had, without fear, in the holy boldness that faith imparts, and that belongs to those who have the Spirit, because <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>has been passed, "they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.<a name=233:7></a>" And they say, "Give us a possession among the brethren of our father," verse 4.<a name=233:8></a>

		<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#14">Joshua  14</a>-- just the very reading of it is spiritually exhilarating -- we see the delightful, wonderful brother Caleb.<a name=234:1></a> What a lesson, what a model he is to all of us, how he says, "And now give me this mountain.<a name=234:2></a>" He is very clear, although he is an old brother as we would speak, but his mind is very clear as he covers the ground, and remembers things and calls attention to certain promises.<a name=234:3></a> We might refer to them as the promises of God, because that is how they would apply in our case.<a name=234:4></a> His mind is very clear.<a name=234:5></a> He is not just reminisencing, as some of us may do, 'there <i>was</i> a day when we were so bright, so keen.<a name=234:6></a>' <i>He</i> was not living in the days when he <i>was</i> once bright and <i>was</i> once keen in spiritual desires.<a name=234:7></a> He was the same then as he was before, he gives us a wonderful illustration of a consistent <i>person</i> in divine things right up to the end, and I am sure that the older brethren will bear the exhortation tonight as we would speak respectfully in regard of their years in the testimony, that heaven is very pleased to see sustained desire right up to the end as we shall see in Caleb.<a name=234:8></a>

		to go, and I would say, as we return to our gatherings, that the Lord has been suggesting to us that we should lay ourselves out more to be taken on by divine Persons, and that we should allow divine Persons to take us as far as <i>they</i> want to, because they will take us to wonderful heights of glory, they will take us to wonderful realms of spiritual wealth and fulness, so that we shall never need to have a regret as to the journey, and as to the point to which, in their taking of us, we may have reached.<a name=235:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this matter of Achsah appearing in the book of Judges; she appears in the book of Joshua, and as those who are intelligent in regards of the Scriptures know, Joshua is the book of victory, victory on the side of the people of God, it is victory all the way generally speaking -- There may be defeat as at Ai necessary to prove something to the people, but generally over the book of Joshua can be written "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory.<a name=235:2></a>" Under the spiritual leadership of Joshua, with Gilgal as the base of operations, the people go forward in relation to victory after victory in entering on the inheritance that God has marked out for them.<a name=235:3></a> But the book of Judges presents a different viewpoint.<a name=235:4></a> The book of Judges contemplates what we have to view in our time, a broken state of things.<a name=235:5></a> The book of Joshua contemplates the days of the Acts, speaking after a certain manner, when the people under the spiritual leadership of Christ, typified in Joshua, and also the leadership of the Spirit typified in the man with the drawn sword, went forward in relation to the great thoughts of God, and nothing could stand before the power of Christianity; in the days of the Acts everything had to give way.<a name=235:6></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And Othniel, what does it say about Othniel?<a name=239:3></a> Well, a suggestion was made in regard of the truth and Othniel took it up.<a name=239:4></a> I wonder if the young men here, the young brothers are taking up suggestions in the field of the truth?<a name=239:5></a> Othniel might have said, "I will not bother my head about it, let someone else take it up," but the point is that Othniel was thinking about what was set out by Caleb, "He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife," verse 12.<a name=239:6></a> Notice, not only smites it, but <i>takes</i> it.<a name=239:7></a> Now, I commend that to the younger brothers; Kirjath-sepher, what does it mean?<a name=239:8></a> We have often referred to it -- the city of the book.<a name=239:9></a> Now that is a great test to overcome the city of the book, the city of education, the city of literature.<a name=239:10></a> It is a real test in these days.<a name=239:11></a> Libraries are so prolific and so much is available.<a name=239:12></a> Do you not notice how easy it is to make room for natural desires, and to read a lot of literature that really does not help you?<a name=239:13></a> It does not help us in the truth; it may be legitimate.<a name=239:14></a> It may be you say to your father or mother, "I have to do it to help me in my school studies"; the enemy sometimes helps us to say things like that, but sometimes it is not to help us in school studies at all.<a name=239:15></a> Sometimes it is just to satisfy mere desire naturally, whereas it may damage us spiritually, I want to encourage you all to overcome the city of the book; it is a great matter not to let learning and education overcome any of us, a certain education may be needed to obtain employment, and God will help you so far as it is necessary to carry on, but do not get immersed in the thing to the extent that your soul is damaged, your spiritual

		Now a word as to the passage in Numbers, and the daughters of Zelophehad.<a name=241:1></a> In chapter 27 it says, "Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad.<a name=241:2></a>" Notice the adverb 'then.<a name=241:3></a>' It is very important because in the previous chapter God had been giving instructions in regard to the numbering in view of the land.<a name=241:4></a> It is an important thing to be amongst those who are numbered in relation to the inheritance, those who are going forward in relation to the choice things of God.<a name=241:5></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26">Numbers  26</a>, while it is a glorious chapter in one way, is a most solemn one in another way.<a name=241:6></a> There are three deaths mentioned in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26">Numbers  26</a>where the numbering is in view of the inheritance, and none of them are natural deaths, they all took place in the government of God, as if to remind us all that in this matter of the truth and the light of the heavenly position <i>it does not do to trifle with it</i>, it does not do to play fast and loose with the truth and with the Lord's rights.<a name=241:7></a> You who read the Scriptures carefully will find as you look into <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26">Numbers  26</a>that the death of Korah, Dathan and Abiram is alluded to.<a name=241:8></a> "This is the Dathan and Abiram summoned of the assembly, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the band of Korah, when they contended against Jehovah.<a name=241:9></a> And the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah when that band died, when the fire devoured the two hundred and fifty men," <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26:9">Numbers  26:9</a>, 10.<a name=241:10></a> They withstood the sovereign rights of God in Moses.<a name=241:11></a> It is a very important thing to notice the rebellion in Christendom in relation to the rights of God in their sovereignty, and none of us wants to be found allied with that kind of thing.<a name=241:12></a> Then in verse 19 of that chapter "Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.<a name=241:13></a>" If you read Genesis you will find that Jehovah slew them; on what account?<a name=241:14></a> Because they were not prepared to give their support to the continuance of the testimony.<a name=241:15></a> If you look into it

		you will find that it is true.<a name=242:1></a> When it comes to the continuance of the line of the testimony, one was wicked, and the other was not prepared to support it, and God was so displeased with the matter that He slew them, showing how serious it is not to be prepared to support the line of the testimony in its continuance.<a name=242:2></a> Then we get in the closing part of the chapter, verse 61, "Nadab and Abihu died, when they presented strange fire before Jehovah.<a name=242:3></a>" They did not die a natural death, but the judgment of God came in upon them because of their offering of strange fire, and these things appearing in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26">Numbers  26</a>are to remind us that profanity, lightness, carelessness in the realm in which we have to do with God will not do.<a name=242:4></a> If we are on that line we will be only courting divine displeasure, whereas over against that we have the numbering in view of the inheritance as if God is showing that despite these humbling disastrous things, the overcomers are going forward right into the realm of what is choice, what is marked out in Christ before the world began, and now on the basis of redemption and the incoming of the Spirit.<a name=242:5></a> God is seeking to lead us forward in relation to that.<a name=242:6></a>

		I would especially enlist the interest of the younger brethren in regard to the immensity and greatness of this subject, because the greater the thoughts that occupy our minds in the dispensation, the greater will be our progress, the more manifest will be our progress, because generally we are formed by what we think about, by what is in our minds, and I would especially desire to impress every one of us, young and old alike, with the greatness of Christ and the assembly being in our minds <i>all the time</i>.<a name=248:3></a> It is in the mind of heaven.<a name=248:4></a> It is the great theme of heaven at the present moment.<a name=248:5></a> Every other feature in God's ways is held up at the present time in order that all might be concentrated on this wondrous family of which we form part, as having the Spirit, this glorious vessel, that we are part of through divine grace; everything is concentrated on this unique vessel, the assembly, because of the greatness of her part and place in the purposes and counsels of God.<a name=248:6></a>

		Now in the first passage that I have read I want to refer to him in that crisis, a unique crisis, at the very mountain of God, and the remarkable way that Aaron is before him, a prince in Israel, and the priestly feature that marked Moses in that critical hour when the enemy seemed to have gained the day, but where the intercessory service of Moses, wonderful type of Christ, intervenes for the salvation of Aaron and of the people.<a name=260:11></a> It was a difficult moment: Deuteronomy helps us to go over the ground and see all the way that God has led us.<a name=260:12></a> It has not been an easy matter for God, speaking reverently, dear brethren; if it had been a question of ourselves with one another we long ago would have had done with one another, but this book unfolds to us how God

		I have no doubt that Moses would think of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as well as the children of Israel in referring to the generations, for he alludes to them here, he says in the portion that we have read, "Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not at the stubbornness of this people .<a name=262:19></a>.<a name=262:20></a>.<a name=262:21></a> ", he refers to God on the high level of His promises, he would remind God of His promises, which is another priestly feature of the man, as Isaiah says, "Ye that put Jehovah in remembrance.<a name=262:22></a>"

		an opening into this wonderful suggestion of the truth -- the food of the heavenly land, the old corn, feeding upon Christ, as belonging to the heavenly realm.<a name=283:1></a> We feed upon Him, of course, as manna in the wilderness, to sustain us in our everyday life here, but it is an important thing to feed upon Him as the heavenly One and the One who is in heaven, the One who <i>belongs</i> to heaven, so that we might become like Him constitutionally, "As is the heavenly One such also the heavenly ones.<a name=283:2></a>" Now I pass over to Genesis.<a name=283:3></a> Circumcision in Joshua is the basis of the inheritance, and of all the victories that are connected with the people of God in their appreciation and apprehension of God's thoughts and His love for them.<a name=283:4></a>

		Now in Genesis I want to speak of circumcision in relation to a man and his house, and also in Exodus.<a name=283:5></a> I think <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17">Genesis  17</a>gives us a wonderful view of Abraham!<a name=283:6></a> It gives us a view of the moral power of this man who walked before God.<a name=283:7></a> It is a great thing to walk before God.<a name=283:8></a> We often walk before men.<a name=283:9></a> We are often concerned about what the brethren think of what we are ministering, what we are preaching -- how well we did in it, and all the good works that we may carry on and do.<a name=283:10></a> We often think a lot about men, you know, we are more affected by men than we are inclined to give credit to, but it is very subtle.<a name=283:11></a> But Abraham walked before <i>God</i>, God indeed gave him a word as to walking before Him, and you will notice that in the verse previous to the portion read, it says, "And he left off talking with him" -- I like that word, dear brethren!<a name=283:12></a> He <i>left off</i> talking with him!<a name=283:13></a> Not talking <i>to</i> him, but talking <i>with</i> him, "And <i>God went up from Abraham</i>"!<a name=283:14></a> Notice that, dear brethren.<a name=283:15></a> Think of this man that had responded to the light of the heavenly call!<a name=283:16></a> We are dealing now with the heavenly man properly in Genesis, the heavenly man morally -- Abraham.<a name=283:17></a>

		Isaac, of course, is the heavenly man officially but Abraham is the heavenly man morally, and I want to ask every one of us about the matter of heavenly-mindedness.<a name=284:1></a> Is there anyone here who has not responded to the heavenly call?<a name=284:2></a> It is a great matter to respond to the <i>heavenly</i> call, that God is calling us out of the world and all that constitutes it, circumcision is really referring to that, that God is not going on with anything <i>in</i> the world but cuts at the very root of what the world's system is built up upon, the flesh in all its energy and strength.<a name=284:3></a> It says, "He left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham," The chapter is a wonderful chapter, it opens with God saying to Abraham, "Walk before my face, and be perfect.<a name=284:4></a> And I will set my covenant between me and thee": I think God would give us all a sense in our souls of settled and fixed matters on this line as walking before Him.<a name=284:5></a> Very often with many of us we have difficulty in arriving at just where we are, and how we stand.<a name=284:6></a> The covenant implies a definite fixed basis on which we know where <i>God</i> is and we know where <i>we</i> are, and that is a very important matter in regard to heavenly-mindedness, because circumcision lies at the basis of our progress in regard to heavenly things.<a name=284:7></a> And this chapter has in mind that Abraham should know where God was, and that he should know where he, Abraham, was, and I think we need to find our bearings, dear brethren, in this light.<a name=284:8></a> John's ministry has that in mind, his epistle especially, that we should find our bearings in the truth: that it is not just always sitting in the meetings and under the influence of the ministry, and the power of the truth, while that in itself is wonderful and we thank God for it but John would help each of us to find our <i>bearings</i> in the truth, so that we <i>know</i> where we are inwardly, because circumcision, our subject, is bearing upon inwardness, as <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2">Romans  2</a>, opens up.<a name=284:9></a> So while many

		of us may know where we are outwardly and externally, as in the assembly, we want to know where we are <i>inwardly</i>, and John's ministry is especially calculated to help us as to where we are inwardly, so that things become fixed and permanent with us, as it says, "He that is begotten of God keeps himself.<a name=285:1></a>" It is interesting how John speaks of the work of God in the believer, and as we get our bearings in relation to the truth that John has in mind in his ministry, we shall find abstractly a certain invulnerability in the believer as to all that we have to do with in passing through this scene.<a name=285:2></a> We shall find that as we rely and make room for the inward and abstract side of the truth which John is enforcing and inculcating into our minds through the principle of teaching, we shall get a fixed bearing.<a name=285:3></a> So that our joy is not up one day and down another.<a name=285:4></a> We are not all buoyant one week and all down another week, John's ministry is to help us to find our bearings.<a name=285:5></a> And the way that we are applying this thought of the covenant has in mind a certain fixed relationship between the believer and God, because Abraham is the father of us all, and is a pattern.<a name=285:6></a>

		God is pleased with the position in this chapter -- pleased with Abraham, despite the fact that Abraham said, Oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.<a name=285:7></a> A great man like this, yet we are reminded of his desires in regard to Ishmael, but nevertheless contextually God is pleased with Abraham, as He is with <i>all</i> heavenly-minded persons.<a name=285:8></a> And it says, "He left off talking with him," as if the conversation would have gone on, and on, and on.<a name=285:9></a> A wonderful thing to walk with God and to converse with Him!<a name=285:10></a> It says, God <i>left off</i> talking with him.<a name=285:11></a> There will be no leaving off in eternity, but in the time scene things have to be broken in upon, so it says, He left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham, showing that the base of God's operation in this

		great matter was Abraham, just as the base of His operations now is in the saints.<a name=286:1></a> And then it says, "Abraham took Ishmael.<a name=286:2></a>" Now I want to refer briefly to the moral power of this man; that he can not only bring the truth to bear upon himself, upon his own soul, but his <i>whole</i> household, the whole institution that is linked with him, as it says, "And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money -- every male among the people of Abraham's house -- and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that <i>same</i> day" -- not a week after, not two months after, but the <i>same</i> day.<a name=286:3></a> Now what is God saying to us tonight?<a name=286:4></a> Why is the word coming thus?<a name=286:5></a> Is there any one here that the truth is having to say to tonight?<a name=286:6></a> What about our movements in relation to it?<a name=286:7></a> It says of Abraham, "in the <i>selfsame day</i>.<a name=286:8></a>"

		Now the secret of all spiritual prosperity and progress is <i>immediate</i> reaction to heavenly light, If God gives us light on the road it is important that we should immediately react to it and we shall get more light from God, because that is what this section unfolds.<a name=286:9></a> Abraham takes one step (you remember how Romans speaks of the "steps" of the faith of our father Abraham), a step at a time.<a name=286:10></a> And you will find that if you take one step God will give you light as to another step.<a name=286:11></a> Often persons that are exercised about clearing themselves from wrong associations think that God will give them complete light in the association in which they are -- He will not.<a name=286:12></a> When you clear yourself of wrong associations, God will give you more and more light as to the whole position.<a name=286:13></a> And you will find, if you work it out, that that is how God operates.<a name=286:14></a> And it says, "Abraham -- on the selfsame day," notice how it is twice said!<a name=286:15></a> It says in verse 23, "On that <i>same</i> day, as <i>God</i> had said to him" -- you see it was not a question of what <i>anyone</i> had said but as <i>God</i> had

		And it says (notice in the next chapter) "And Jehovah appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre.<a name=287:6></a>" Now I want to show, dear brethren, that circumcision in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17">Genesis  17</a>is the basis for the wonderful, intimate relationships in such blessed communion with divine Persons, as is set out in chapter 18.<a name=287:7></a> I am sure, dear brethren, that the more, in the power of the Spirit, the death of Christ and the truth of it is brought to bear on our souls and all that we are, the more we shall enjoy the blessedness of the company of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=287:8></a> What wonderful grace, dear brethren, that God, who is so infinite in His greatness, yet in revelation has come so near in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit -- come so near as to take up their abode with us, because <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>points out to us the possibility of <i>every</i> divine Person, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, being with an individual believer.<a name=287:9></a> What immensity in the suggestion!<a name=287:10></a> But there it is!<a name=287:11></a> The Spirit is viewed as being with us and in us, and the Lord Jesus speaks about those that love Him and keep His word, the Father and Himself coming to them and making Their abode with him -- think of it!<a name=287:12></a> And that is what we have in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18">Genesis  18</a>, it becomes the basis of known, happy

		Now I want just to finish with a word on circumcision in Exodus.<a name=288:7></a> I feel, dear brethren, that this is a sober matter with all of us, because we have the minister Moses here.<a name=288:8></a> Wonderful minister he was!<a name=288:9></a> But it shows, dear brethren, that God is not going on with any of us in carelessness as to the matter of the flesh.<a name=288:10></a> It is a serious thing to serve God and to have part in His service, I think we should all face that, brothers and sisters alike.<a name=288:11></a> It says in verse 24 of chapter 4 of Exodus, "And it came to pass <i>on the way</i>, in the inn, that Jehovah came upon him, and sought to slay him.<a name=288:12></a>" This is a serious matter, dear brethren.<a name=288:13></a> Men think that they can do what they like in the service of God, they can carry on in any way they think fit, or see fit, but dear brethren, the nearer we are to God the more we shall see that it is a sober and grave matter to have to do with God, and we cannot go on with the flesh unattended to, with this matter of the reproach of Egypt not rolled away.<a name=288:14></a> Moses started out first to do things in his

		And I would leave that word with the brethren, at this moment, that the right way to get on with one another, to go on unjealously with one another, is in the acceptance of the truth of circumcision.<a name=290:6></a> To give no quarter to the flesh, or any principle or feature of Egypt's world.<a name=290:7></a> We shall thus know what it is to serve in relation to one another and in relation to the mountain of God where all the resources and power of God is known.<a name=290:8></a> We know how the enemy would work to cripple us, to render us ineffective in our service, but God would help us to see the effective way of service in the acceptance of circumcision.<a name=290:9></a> And as accepting it we will get the practical support of an Aaron, one who has the capacity to embrace us, and to kiss us.<a name=290:10></a> It may mean a journey.<a name=290:11></a> It may mean the taking account of the mountain of God, and what the mountain of God suggests -- the exercise of the rights of God in His holy love -- but it means the <i>kiss</i> of Aaron.<a name=290:12></a> And is it not worth while, dear brethren, in view of being effective in the service of God?<a name=290:13></a>
