	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=1:1></a> It is suggested that we look at Paul and his ministry, and the opening up of the heavenly side in relation to it, and especially to see what is distinctive and final in it.<a name=1:2></a> The brethren would immediately recall how the line of distinctiveness runs through all Paul's service and ministry from beginning to end.<a name=1:3></a> The thought of what is final, too, appears in it, for to him it was given to complete the word of God.<a name=1:4></a> It is thought well, in the first reading, to consider himself personally, and see how immediately heaven comes on to view in connection with him and his conversion, and then to see the peculiar distinctiveness that no doubt entered into and characterised his ministry, as in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=1:5></a> There is the distinctive side in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, the Lord personally taking a hand in the arresting and apprehension of Saul, and the Lord referring to him in His word to Ananias, "this man is an elect vessel to me.<a name=1:6></a>" Then we may see later on the distinctiveness that appears in relation to the gospel which he preached and the Lord's supper which he received; and then in the Colossian and Ephesian letters especially to reach the great thoughts of finality that appear particularly in the Ephesian letter in regard to the assembly in Christ Jesus.<a name=1:7></a> There are the great marital thoughts and family thoughts that flood the epistle to the Ephesians as what is final is brought before the saints.<a name=1:8></a> I thought that a consideration of himself personally in these passages would indicate the distinctiveness that the Lord has in mind in his service and ministry, especially having the assembly in view, for it is Paul's ministry that opens out and develops the truth of the assembly.<a name=1:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:1></a>G.<a name=2:2></a> Have you in mind at all that Paul was himself to exemplify the truth which he ministered?<a name=2:3></a> Does that additional feature come into it?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:5></a> Yes, I am thinking of that in a special way, and also, that he was distinctive as a sufferer.<a name=2:6></a> He suffered as very few others outside of Christ have suffered; and the manner of his life was all in accord with his ministry.<a name=2:7></a> It is all setting out the distinctiveness that the Lord had in mind in the ministry and service of such a vessel, in raising him up as He did.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=2:9></a>M.<a name=2:10></a> Have you in mind that in introducing this subject of finality, the Lord is near?<a name=2:11></a> We must take on these exercises right away?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:13></a> That is exactly what is in mind, the imminence of the translation, the shortness of the time.<a name=2:14></a> It is important that Paul's ministry and what it sets out should be laid hold of in all that it involves; whether on the lower line, involving what is practical and searching, or on the higher more elevated line, involving what is so enriching and stimulating.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=2:16></a> You remarked that the Lord appears to take a very personal hand in dealing with Saul.<a name=2:17></a> Would you say how that impresses you?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:19></a> It seems to me that in view of the assembly, and the greatness of the assembly in the Lord's eyes and affections, and in view of the unfolding of the truth of the assembly in its heavenly relations, the Lord is very selective.<a name=2:20></a> He entrusts this service to no other, but He comes into it personally especially from the heavenly side.<a name=2:21></a> That is, it is an intervention from heaven, for the heavenly side is going to open up in the ministry of this servant, and the Lord intervenes from the heavenly side Himself.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=2:23></a> How selective the Lord was in relation to the pearl, "having found one pearl of great value.<a name=2:24></a>" Would this choice of Paul follow on that?<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:26></a> It would.<a name=2:27></a> So that the assembly is very

		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		select in that way.<a name=3:1></a> The refinement that is linked with the assembly stands out in all its distinctiveness and, as we shall see, heavenly refinement stands out in Paul in all its distinctiveness.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=3:3></a>S.<a name=3:4></a> Is there something distinctive in the fact of Saul being at the stoning of the martyr Stephen, bearing upon the suffering side?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:6></a> I think there is.<a name=3:7></a> As we know, it was a transitional moment; God had borne with Jerusalem and what was there, but at that moment we get the transference of things to heaven.<a name=3:8></a> Stephen looks into heaven and sees the new centre of operations, and Saul comes on to view at that juncture.<a name=3:9></a> It is all pointing, I think, to the way the heavenly side is coming on to view.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=3:11></a>S.<a name=3:12></a> So that heaven intervenes in this section we have read, and finally in 2 Timothy and several times in between in the apostle's service we have the Lord appearing to him.<a name=3:13></a> Are not these appearings important in relation to this service and ministry?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:15></a> They are, because they give the distinctive touch to service in ministry.<a name=3:16></a> With those that serve, it is important that there should be some experience of this kind of thing.<a name=3:17></a> Of course we must bear in mind the special elect vessel that Paul was, but there should be some experience in those that serve in view of distinctiveness of these kind of movements on the part of the Lord.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.VanS.<a name=3:19></a> Would you say a word please in relation to <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>, in connection with selection?<a name=3:20></a>" But when God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me.<a name=3:21></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:22></a> He is showing, in that letter, that he was specially marked out in connection with his service, set apart so early.<a name=3:23></a> It particularly comes in over against the elements of Judaism that were asserting themselves in the province of Galatia.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:1></a>G.<a name=4:2></a> So that God's Son was revealed in him.<a name=4:3></a> Does that involve that the dignity and liberty of sonship in its true heavenly character was to be seen in Paul?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:5></a> I thought it did.<a name=4:6></a> It brings in the line of what is distinctive in that way.<a name=4:7></a> It is not just that He was revealed <i>to</i> him, as to Peter, but He was revealed <i>in</i> him, meaning that it would characterise him in all his service and preaching.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=4:9></a>C.<a name=4:10></a>L.<a name=4:11></a> Does the selection of Damascus as the location for this enter into what you have in mind?<a name=4:12></a> He is not converted in Jerusalem.<a name=4:13></a> Did not the Lord extract him from that setting in order that His work might not be impaired by anything that would damage what is heavenly?<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:15></a> It is very interesting that the Lord, we might say, selects the position in which He will affect him.<a name=4:16></a> How often we see that principle operating!<a name=4:17></a> The Lord meets an issue, not where we think it might be met, but according to His own wisdom and His own selection.<a name=4:18></a> That is a great thing, especially in conflict, and this matter here involved conflict, for Saul was at war with the saints.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=4:20></a>S.<a name=4:21></a> Do you think in view of his ministry as to the assembly, that we could link this with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, as to Damascus, and why Damascus was selected?<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:23></a> There might be something in that; I had not thought of it.<a name=4:24></a> It is striking that it was removed from Jerusalem.<a name=4:25></a> That is, it was removed from the sphere of religious influence and religious prejudice; as if the Lord would have a free hand, and a free right of way, in view of the heavenly side of the truth, and the assembly in her heavenly character, which He had in mind to bring in through this vessel.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=4:27></a>H.<a name=4:28></a> Is His interest strengthened by the introduction of the Lord's own voice?<a name=4:29></a> It says, "falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him," and

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there are other mentions there too.<a name=5:1></a> The Lord is intervening, not only with light and the arresting of the vessel, but there is His own personal expression of things in the voice.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:3></a> I think that helps.<a name=5:4></a> The voice intensifies the thought of the personal appearance of Christ to Saul at this moment.<a name=5:5></a> All the influence of personality would enter into that voice, the voice of Jesus, "<i>I</i> am Jesus.<a name=5:6></a>" What a voice it was!<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=5:8></a>H.<a name=5:9></a> Did Saul seem, perhaps dimly, to have some conviction about it immediately, by the way that he answers, "Who art thou, <i>Lord</i>?<a name=5:10></a>" It says of John in the Revelation that he "turned back to see the voice which spoke," <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:12">Revelation  1:12</a>.<a name=5:11></a> Would it be right to say that Saul seems to grasp some kind of significance in what the Lord says?<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:13></a> I would think he did.<a name=5:14></a> It is interesting, his immediate answer when he heard the voice, "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=5:15></a>" He did not just say, 'Who art thou?<a name=5:16></a>', but "Who art thou, <i>Lord</i>?<a name=5:17></a>" There was some immediate recognition on his part of who the Person was.<a name=5:18></a> He was no ordinary Person.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:20></a>C.<a name=5:21></a> Are the circumstances somewhat similar in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, where it says, "when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi"?<a name=5:22></a> It is there that He says "Who do <i>ye</i> say that I am?<a name=5:23></a>", and it is there that He discloses the truth of the assembly and speaks of the Father revealing it to Peter.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:25></a> I think that helps.<a name=5:26></a> It shows how careful divine Persons are in regard to the choice subjects of Their operations and the selection of circumstances in which Their operations work, so that we are free from what might impair or damage.<a name=5:27></a> The principle of that would enter in, I suppose, to many matters.<a name=5:28></a> Sickness comes in and infirmity of body and detention in certain circumstances; all that brings in the Lord's way of operating in regard to matters to help us, and to help the assembly.<a name=5:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=6:1></a> That is seen in its excellence in Paul being detained in prison, where these rich epistles of heavenly ministry came from.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:3></a> Well, there we have a very full allusion to what we are saying.<a name=6:4></a> The most of us here would recall the readings in this very hall on "Paul's ministry and the Service of God," when that very thing was referred to.<a name=6:5></a> The Lord was operating from His own side to remove the servant from anything that would blight or impair or hinder the full heavenly distinction of the assembly as it appears in those letters.<a name=6:6></a> And I believe, in all the pressure of the present moment, the deaths and the sicknesses and other matters, that we are being impressed by the Lord emphasising His right to do as <i>He will</i>, in order that the full value and distinctiveness of the heavenly side might appear in the saints.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=6:8></a>E.<a name=6:9></a> Would it be just to enquire at this point whether Stephen had a special touch just before his martyrdom, for it says of him that he fixed his eyes on heaven?<a name=6:10></a> But when he speaks to the people he speaks of seeing the heavens opened.<a name=6:11></a> Would this allusion to his fixing his eyes on heaven suggest something of an expectation that an entirely new move was coming by that way and does chapter 9 show how it comes?<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:13></a> I think there is something interesting in that.<a name=6:14></a> It is prefaced by saying, "being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>.<a name=6:15></a> It is as if he were a vessel that was so filled with the Spirit that he sensed the new departure in divine movements and divine operations.<a name=6:16></a> I think if we are like Stephen, the Spirit <i>must</i> come into this matter, in the sense that if we are accustomed to making room for the Spirit and being filled with the Spirit, we shall sense divine movements and operations, even if it may involve what is drastic, as it did then.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=7:1></a>P.<a name=7:2></a> Might I enquire whether the "I am" of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:5">Acts  9:5</a>, "I am Jesus," has some reference to His deity, while 'Jesus' stresses the side of His manhood?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:4></a> The very name Jesus carries a touch as to that in itself, and Saul recognises, even if it is instinctively, that he is in the presence of Someone very great.<a name=7:5></a> He says, "Who art thou, <i>Lord</i>?<a name=7:6></a>"; it is no ordinary Person he is in the presence of.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McK.<a name=7:8></a> Does the light out of heaven link on with the sound out of heaven, as though the matter is to be given impetus from heaven itself, and that impetus is to abide?<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:10></a> I think so.<a name=7:11></a> I think we should see more this matter of heaven and how it is intervening here, especially if we are to reach what is distinctive and final we must come to what is heavenly.<a name=7:12></a> It is on that line that what is distinctive and what is final are brought before us.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.M.<a name=7:14></a>M.<a name=7:15></a> Would Paul's initial experience here give him, right through his life, ever to hold the gospel as intimately intertwined with the assembly?<a name=7:16></a> The Lord in His skill puts Paul in touch with a brother, with a local assembly?<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:18></a> That is a very important matter.<a name=7:19></a> The Lord refers to him in that lowly way, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest," identifying Himself with the saints in the suffering way and position, and then He says in verse 6, "But rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou <i>must</i> do.<a name=7:20></a>" Then there come into operation the spiritual facilities in a locality to serve persons such as Saul of Tarsus, all bringing out and emphasising the importance of the local position.<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=7:22></a>P.<a name=7:23></a> Would that be like the half-dead man being brought to the inn?<a name=7:24></a> I was wondering if the service of the Samaritan in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>is not seen filled out in our passage before us.<a name=7:25></a> The half-dead man is taken into the inn where he is cared for; so we have

	<div class="paragraph">
		the initial impressions received and the power of the kingdom operating?<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:2></a> There is a link in that way, the local position being what is provisional, but it is the place where we are served and cared for.<a name=8:3></a> That brings up the question as to whether we value our local positions.<a name=8:4></a> The value of the position in the city is one of the first impressions from heaven that is conveyed to Paul.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=8:6></a>P.<a name=8:7></a> I just thought when you laid emphasis on the word 'must,' that you possibly had in mind the authority of the voice of the local assembly.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:9></a> I think we need to see that, and especially when you think of such an one as Saul was and what he represents.<a name=8:10></a> It is especially important with those that have any part in service that the value and the dignity and the authority of the local assembly should be recognised.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.D.<a name=8:12></a>W.<a name=8:13></a> So that it says in Galatians those at Jerusalem communicated nothing to him, but he would not say that as to the saints at Damascus, would he?<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:15></a> No, certainly he would not.<a name=8:16></a> When he said that, he was referring not to the local assembly in the sense in which we are speaking of it; he was seeking to maintain the heavenly distinctiveness of his own ministry as free from all metropolitan influence.<a name=8:17></a> We want to be free from any earthly metropolitan influence, for our metropolis is in heaven, where Jesus is, and we want to see what is worked out commensurate with that in local assemblies in the presence of the Spirit here below.<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=8:19></a>E.<a name=8:20></a> Is that why Luke, a Gentile, is selected to write this history?<a name=8:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:22></a> Yes, that is interesting, because his gospel largely emphasises the thought of locality, the Lord being in certain places.<a name=8:23></a> The idea of locality is greatly emphasised in his gospel.<a name=8:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=9:1></a> Speaking of the local assembly, and those who serve having right respect and really gaining from it, is that seen with Paul in an enlarged way in chapter 22?<a name=9:2></a> He tells us something there that Luke does not tell us here; for instance, he has to be stimulated about baptism?<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:4></a> Just so, apparently he was tarrying; so that we get the facility in operation to help him in that regard.<a name=9:5></a> You see, when we return to our local positions, there are facilities that are not found perhaps in the same way in going around.<a name=9:6></a> In the local positions there are all the facilities to help us in whatever way we need help, and we all need help.<a name=9:7></a> It is good to see the value of the local position in that sense, because the man that the Lord sovereignly selects to open up the wealth of the assembly in relation to heavenly thoughts is the man that values the local position.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=9:9></a>H.<a name=9:10></a> It says about Paul and his company at the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>that they returned to Antioch and they stayed no little time with the disciples there, from whence they had gone out.<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:12></a> That is they had a base to which they returned.<a name=9:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=9:14></a>S.<a name=9:15></a> Those facilities that you spoke of involve a house as well as what is local.<a name=9:16></a> Is not that important?<a name=9:17></a> It says in verse 11, "And the Lord said to him, Rise up and go into the street which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one by name Saul, he is of Tarsus.<a name=9:18></a>" I was thinking of the house and the matter of entertaining as well as what is local.<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:20></a> I am sure it is important to see how our houses and local positions come into matters, and how they may become part of the spiritual facilities which serve the work of God in liberating what there may be linked with it.<a name=9:21></a> What a value it puts on our houses!<a name=9:22></a> But it raises the question as to what goes on in our houses, and whether they are available in

		P.L.<a name=10:2></a> Apollos was thus served by Aquila and Priscilla.<a name=10:3></a>

		S.McC.<a name=10:4></a> Exactly, they "took him to them," <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:26">Acts  18:26</a>.<a name=10:5></a> I suppose they would have had him home.<a name=10:6></a> Not that we want to conjecture, or put into Scripture what is not there, but I suppose the force of it is there.<a name=10:7></a> They did not do it publicly, they took him to them.<a name=10:8></a>

		E.A.<a name=10:9></a>K.<a name=10:10></a> Are these facilities you speak of seen in Corinth?<a name=10:11></a> On the one hand there is the subjective representation of it in the household of Chloe, and then we have Paul's estimate of the local assembly in the expressions "the assembly of God which is at Corinth," and "a chaste virgin espoused to Christ," despite the conditions?<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:13></a> It shows what God can do and how things can be preserved despite current influences that may be abroad, wherever we are.<a name=10:14></a> It is very striking (it is a most interesting study in itself) to see how Paul was served in relation to households, and it is <i>he</i>, and <i>he</i> specially, in the assembly epistles who brings up the thought of the households and gives instructions in regard to them.<a name=10:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=12:7></a> It is important to see that.<a name=12:8></a> We should always be prepared for what heaven is doing in that way.<a name=12:9></a> It is very touching the way that the Lord has personal relations, not only with Saul, we have been speaking about Saul, but with Ananias.<a name=12:10></a> He seems to know Ananias well, and Ananias seems to know Him well.<a name=12:11></a> There is thus a certain ease in the relations between the Lord and Ananias that is very affecting in this section, in serving Saul of Tarsus.<a name=12:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=14:19></a> Well, what a tribute that is to him!<a name=14:20></a> It is a great thing in regard to ourselves that we should be marked by praying.<a name=14:21></a> That is, "he <i>is</i> praying," not 'he <i>has</i> prayed,' but "he is praying," as if it is a characteristic feature with him.<a name=14:22></a> I am sure that we need to be marked by being praying persons, even if we have to pray all night.<a name=14:23></a> It is a great thing to be marked by praying.<a name=14:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=15:21></a> Just so; the Lord enters into conversation with him.<a name=15:22></a> It is very affecting how Ananias says in verse 11, "Behold, here am I, Lord," and the Lord tells him to rise up and go into the street which is called Straight.<a name=15:23></a> Then Ananias converses with the Lord over this matter of Saul and what he has done, and then the Lord brings in the peremptory word, "<i>Go</i>, for this man is an elect vessel to me.<a name=15:24></a>" I suppose we must have a sense of the Lord's authority in these matters.<a name=15:25></a> The reference to "the elect vessel" is, of course, a special touch as to Paul's distinctiveness, and specially bears on the great feature of the heavenly side that is to be opened up and the truth of the

		S.McC.<a name=16:18></a> It does, because the whole range of what is in Christ as suggested here, while it includes more than what is heavenly, involves what is heavenly as far as Paul is concerned.<a name=16:19></a> The realm of new creation, as we have part in it, would be in mind, but it is interesting that while he is speaking about an experience that occurred fourteen years ago, he says "I <i>know</i>.<a name=16:20></a>" He does not say 'I <i>knew</i> a man in Christ,' he says, "I <i>know</i>.<a name=16:21></a>" He was taking account of the thing abstractly, and yet we have the great reference to "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago.<a name=16:22></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=53:8></a> Yes, it helps to see the different ways in which the body thus may be apprehended.<a name=53:9></a> In verse 13 of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>it would also allude to what is universal, "For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body," but then when it comes down to the verse that we have read, it says in verse 27, "Now ye are Christ's body"; that is, the character of that body appears in Corinth or wherever we are set in our local positions.<a name=53:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=53:11></a>G.<a name=53:12></a> It was verse 27 that I had in mind in making the remark, but it is important as you say, to see that in verse 13 it is universal.<a name=53:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=54:7></a> Exactly, and I would say that although it is universal, yet verse 13 bears on what is local.<a name=54:8></a> Would you not think, in the backward or retroactive allusion to the Lord's supper and to the cup, that locally we are affected by this great matter of all being given to drink of one Spirit every Lord's day?<a name=54:9></a>

		S.McC.<a name=59:10></a> In relation to the whole universal race of man God has committed Himself to Christ as the new Head of the race; that is what I mean by the use of the word 'federal.<a name=59:11></a>' It is in contrast to the special and distinctive character of headship in relation to that glorious entity, His body, the assembly, which bears on what is organic.<a name=59:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=59:15></a> That is the truth exactly.<a name=59:16></a> You take <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, where the chapter is filled with references to the Spirit.<a name=59:17></a> The Spirit is life in the believer; not that He promotes life, but He <i>is</i> life.<a name=59:18></a> That is, He is everything to the believer until the believer reaches Colossians, where Christ is his life.<a name=59:19></a> The Spirit is everything until the position is reached where, as we shall see this afternoon, Christ is everything.<a name=59:20></a>

		S.McC.<a name=61:8></a> I see what you have in mind in regard to it, but I was thinking of a distinctive glory that attaches to Christ, namely that He baptises with the Spirit.<a name=61:9></a> That is signally marked out in regard to Him, and the baptism of the Spirit is done through the power of the Spirit.<a name=61:10></a> That is, the Lord administered the Spirit from on high.<a name=61:11></a> The Spirit was sent and, as the Spirit came, the body was formed, so that it was the baptism of the Spirit characteristically, but I think the act of Christ enters into it.<a name=61:12></a> But this matter that you refer to as to the deity of the Spirit is important, because who but One of the Deity could act as you point out in these different ways.<a name=61:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=62:11></a> I was thinking of the tendency sometimes to address Him individually as God, using such an expression as "We worship thee as God," when speaking to the Spirit at that point in the service, which I do not think is intelligent.<a name=62:12></a> I mean, if we worship God, in the collective sense, we worship Father, Son and Holy Spirit as God.<a name=62:13></a> We worship them collectively as God at that point, not severally as God.<a name=62:14></a> If we mention them severally, it is to bring in the glories that reflect on the Persons who are viewed together collectively as God.<a name=62:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=76:1></a> It is in mind this afternoon to consider the distinctive way in which the headship of Christ is presented in this epistle.<a name=76:2></a> The passages that we have read are very rich and full and it will be obvious that we cannot dwell on all the details of them.<a name=76:3></a> I believe, as it has often been said, the Spirit of God amongst us would leave an impression upon us through these passages as to "that is my master," as the servant of old said to Rebecca.<a name=76:4></a> You will notice there is not only the side of what is distinctive in connection with Christ as Head, but the thought of what is final and complete in regard to the saints entering into this epistle.<a name=76:5></a> Paul completes the word of God, not as a matter of time exactly, nor a matter of the number of books in the sense that he wrote the last one to complete the number.<a name=76:6></a> It is not that at all; it is a question of the circle of the truth, the assembly being the mystery involving the completion of it, Christ and the assembly as we should say.<a name=76:7></a> Then there is the great object that Paul had in his service that he might "present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=76:8></a>" What an objective he had in his service!<a name=76:9></a> The expression "every man" would indicate that every person would be in mind in his outlook abstractly.<a name=76:10></a> Concretely of course it works out in the saints who form the assembly.<a name=76:11></a> We get the thought of completeness too in regard to the saints and Christ, for we are complete in Him, this letter being to help us to see the value of the Head, and the importance of holding the Head, as deriving all supply and wisdom and direction from the Head.<a name=76:12></a> It is very easy, perhaps, to get away from the Head in our affections and
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		thoughts, and maybe to hold the truth just as the truth without sufficiently abiding in the Head, abiding in Christ in that way, as the great Source of supply for the saints.<a name=77:1></a> They are complete in Him in that relation.<a name=77:2></a> This morning we were dwelling on the body in the foundational epistles, and we alluded to it of course in Ephesians, but in Romans and Corinthians reference is made to the body to affect our corporate relations so that unity might prevail.<a name=77:3></a> There can be no gain of Christ's headship unless in our corporate relations we are united; the headship of Christ is available, and the gain of it is to be received, where the saints are united, and where affection is present and operating.<a name=77:4></a>

		A.E.<a name=77:5></a>M.<a name=77:6></a> Can I take you back?<a name=77:7></a> You said this morning (if I understand you rightly) that we arrive at the "collective idea of God.<a name=77:8></a>" Can you explain that?<a name=77:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=77:10></a> It is using a form of speech that we have to use, being finite and being creatures that we are.<a name=77:11></a> In using it we have in mind the Father and the Son and the Spirit, as together, as expressing to us the great thought of God.<a name=77:12></a> Deity is presented in the Father in the economy, as we know, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8">1 Corinthians  8</a>, and in the Name in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>, Deity is presented to us in the three Persons.<a name=77:13></a> Their place in Deity is in mind, although economical names are used.<a name=77:14></a> It was the Name of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>that was in mind.<a name=77:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=77:19></a> It does not to me.<a name=77:20></a> It is not a question of three Gods; it is the Persons collectively, together, as God.<a name=77:21></a> It is no thought of Tritheism, and no thought either of Sabellianism; it is the opposite to that.<a name=77:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:13></a> If we can use the expression 'unity.<a name=78:14></a>' I am sure you know what we mean, for it is a question whether the word 'unity' is strong enough when it comes to that.<a name=78:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=78:16></a>C.<a name=78:17></a> We could use 'oneness.<a name=78:18></a>' 'Unity' is the Latin word, and 'oneness' the Anglo-Saxon.<a name=78:19></a> We have come to give more force to oneness, so it may be best to keep to that.<a name=78:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:21></a> Yes, I think what you say is right, because the bearing of the Name is economical in Matthew.<a name=78:22></a> That is, it bears on the economy and operations in it.<a name=78:23></a> It is the Father, the Son and the Spirit, and as we have been taught, you could not reverse the order and put the Spirit, the Son and the Father.<a name=78:24></a> It is put in the order in which it appears in the economy, but yet it is one Name.<a name=78:25></a> It emphasises in our minds and in our hearts, in regard to the Persons abstractly, Their co-equality, in the oneness of Deity.<a name=78:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=78:27></a>C.<a name=78:28></a> Do you think we might sometimes misunderstand what is in one another's minds in our words, in this sense that in thinking of the co-equality of the Persons, in the oneness of Godhead, we are really thinking of something which in itself is outside

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=79:3></a> They ever existed in eternal oneness, and yet according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>, in Their co-equality as Persons, for "the Word was <i>with</i> God, and the Word <i>was</i> God.<a name=79:4></a>" The distinctness of personality is maintained.<a name=79:5></a>

		A.B.<a name=79:6></a>P.<a name=79:7></a> Does the expression in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:23">Matthew  1:23</a> "they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'," convey more than that that Person is God?<a name=79:8></a> It implies that <i>God</i> is with us.<a name=79:9></a> Equally so in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:25">1 Corinthians  14:25</a>, "God is indeed amongst you," would possibly relate to the Spirit, but as we think of these divine Persona, the oneness of God is in our thoughts.<a name=79:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=79:11></a> Just so.<a name=79:12></a> It is always important to remember that whatever place two of the Holy Persons take in the economy, it never alters the Deity.<a name=79:13></a> The Deity remains the same, and when Deity is presented in the One, it does not alter the Deity in that sense; it is still there in its fulness, as it says, "to us there is one God, the Father" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>), but it is fixed, to use creature language which we are bound to use having no other means of expressing ourselves, in the economy on that Person.<a name=79:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		S.McC.<a name=94:21></a> I thought it was very affecting, how They all enter into the matter of redemption, and how, in a certain sense, each of the Persons came before us in Their feelings.<a name=94:22></a> It is not that you can attach too much in connection with sufferings, but what must it have been to the Father, as we heard, and what must it have been to the Spirit, that that spotless blessed One -- Object of divine delight -- should be forsaken as He was and should be in death.<a name=94:23></a>

		S.McC.<a name=128:2></a> I think, as we generally know and understand, that it helps to see that Hebrews is an extricatory epistle, Ephesians is not.<a name=128:3></a> Colossians is almost on the line of what is extricatory, in that the saints were being affected by alien influences diverting them from the Head, but Ephesians and Romans are normal epistles, in which the truth is laid out with skill by the apostle.<a name=128:4></a> Hebrews is extricatory, having in mind the detachment of the saints from the earthly side, especially Jerusalem, with all that in their minds held such repute.<a name=128:5></a> It is also a wilderness epistle, so that while you get rays of divine majesty and greatness shining into the letter, the state of the saints is not normal, as we have in Ephesians, where the state of first love exists.<a name=128:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=128:11></a> Yes, it is very interesting to see that we do not get the types formally referred to in Ephesians, nor the Old Testament scriptures quoted in the same way in the first part as we have in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=128:12></a> I think all that helps.<a name=128:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=148:9></a> The thought of His Spirit has greatly affected me in this passage as coming in just before touching on the assembly in Christ Jesus.<a name=148:10></a> I think the reference to the Father's Spirit, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, is to impress us with the necessity of the family side, as giving the intimacy and fulness and the richness that are required for the worship of God in the majesty of His Being, insofar as we are able to apprehend His Being with finite understanding and capacity.<a name=148:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=148:17></a> Yes.<a name=148:18></a> It is not exactly what is linked with unapproachable light; it is the fulness of what is linked with His operations in this wonderful realm that we view Him in, in all its vastness -- "breadth and length and depth and height"!<a name=148:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=148:20></a>G.<a name=148:21></a> So that when the Lord speaks of this realm in its wonderful extent.<a name=148:22></a> He calls it "My Father's house"; is that right?<a name=148:23></a> It impresses the paternal thought upon it, the family side of things.<a name=148:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=149:5></a> That is it.<a name=149:6></a> Then there is the channelling of our thoughts from the wideness of the apprehension of the universe and the many families in it, to the great Centre of it, in Christ in the assembly, as it says, "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus.<a name=149:7></a>" Think of the dignity that attaches to that expression!<a name=149:8></a> It is an expression that we have often had pointed out to us, the preposition 'in' involving the preposition of power, "the assembly in Christ Jesus.<a name=149:9></a>" What a position it has in the universe of God in this sense!<a name=149:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=149:15></a> I know of no other passage in the Scripture that so extensively or so exaltingly refers to the assembly as this, because, whatever feature of glory we may think on, in regard to the assembly, it is all embodied in this expression "the assembly," and then "in Christ Jesus," involves that the holy humanity of Christ is before us; and we have the status in relation to it, "the assembly in Christ Jesus.<a name=149:16></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=149:20></a> You might say, that vessel in finality, and the glorious state linked with that Man in finality, for the eternal subsisting state between God and men lies in the revelation of God in a Man, and the assembly is blessed inconceivably in that Man.<a name=149:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=150:20></a> Very good.<a name=150:21></a> It brings out the uniqueness that is linked with the Spirit in the saints in the assembly, as He will be in no other family, because in that passage, without doubt, there is an allusion to the Spirit.<a name=150:22></a>

		I have the desire, dear brethren, with the help of the Lord, to say a word as to the depths into which God entered in order that all His precious thoughts might be established for ever.<a name=152:1></a> I think we need to take account of this side of things perhaps more than we have done, in order that greater depth of feeling, and greater sobriety, might be brought to pass with us all, not that one would exclude oneself in any way from being in need of these things, but one feels that as the end draws near, and as the Spirit of God is emphasising the exceeding greatness and morally elevated character of the things to which we have been called, there is a need with us of increasing depth of feeling, and increasing sobriety, as befits those who are not only called with a heavenly calling, but are themselves heavenly.<a name=152:2></a> We have been speaking, in the meetings which many of us have had already today, of the heavenly level of the things in which we have been called to have part; perhaps it has not sufficiently impressed us all, how wonderful it is that one of the Persons of the Godhead should have taken up manhood, bringing into manhood all moral excellence.<a name=152:3></a> All that God could look for in man, adequate to satisfy His heart, and sufficient rightly to express Himself, has now come into being in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ in manhood, the glory of His Person shedding its light on, and giving its character to, the manhood which now subsists in Him.<a name=152:4></a> But what is perhaps equally marvellous is that redemption having been accomplished, we are

		So I take up this passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, a well-known passage, in order to call attention, not only to the sacrifice involved for the Son, typified in Isaac, but also to call attention to what it involved for the Father.<a name=154:2></a> Then the second passage, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, will impress us, further, with all that has been involved for the Son in order to lay an immutable basis for the establishment of all God's thoughts, and for the bringing into expression of all His glory.<a name=154:3></a> And the third passage will show that the Holy Spirit Himself has entered into this wonderful matter.<a name=154:4></a> You remember, dear brethren, that when God appeared to Moses at the burning bush, He spoke to him of the condition in which His people were, and His proposal to bring them out of Egypt, and bring them into a land flowing with milk and honey; and He said to Moses "I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard .<a name=154:5></a>.<a name=154:6></a>.<a name=154:7></a> and I am come down to deliver them" -- "<i>I</i> am come down.<a name=154:8></a>" Carry that in mind, dear brethren, it is not that He sent an angel, an angel could quite well have effected all that was necessary for the deliverance of His people from Egypt; but God says "<i>I</i> am come down.<a name=154:9></a>" And I believe as we begin to take account of the way God has operated to deliver us from all that in which we were involved, and to secure us for His pleasure, we shall find that it has involved the coming down of God, first in the Person of the Son, and then in the Person of the Spirit.<a name=154:10></a> God Himself entering into the conditions which had come in through sin, first, as I have said, in the Person of the Son, and then in the Person of the Spirit, in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in this 22nd chapter of Genesis.<a name=155:2></a> God called upon Abraham to act, "Take now," He says, "thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac.<a name=155:3></a>" The answer on Abraham's part was immediate, and just by way of digression for a moment, in connection with what came before many of us this afternoon, I may point out that with this great matter in hand it says that Abraham rose early in the morning.<a name=155:4></a> It will be found frequently in Scripture, where something of importance is to be taken up, that those concerned rose early in the morning.<a name=155:5></a> We have it here in this chapter, we have it in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>, where God called upon Moses to go up the mountain with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and they went up, and saw God, and ate and drank in the presence of God.<a name=155:6></a> But it says in that scripture, that Moses rose early in the morning, and built an altar.<a name=155:7></a> And then again in the book of Joshua, in chapter 3, when they were about to cross the Jordan, and to enter into the land, something which we have before us every Lord's day morning, that by the grace of the Lord, and in the power of the Spirit, we may pass over Jordan and enter into the land, on that occasion it says that Joshua rose early in the morning.<a name=155:8></a> We know well that on the great first day of the week, the day on which the Lord Jesus rose from the dead, Mary of Magdala, that great lover of Christ, rose very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, and went to the sepulchre.<a name=155:9></a> But as has already been remarked this afternoon, the Father was there before her, the Father had been there, and had raised up Christ from among the dead by His glory.<a name=155:10></a> One often thinks, and I have no doubt others do too, what the feelings of the Father must have been when He raised up Jesus from among the dead on that first day of the week.<a name=155:11></a> Every cherished thought of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Father was now secured, and the One in whom it was secured was there before His face in glorious manhood, firstborn from among the dead.<a name=156:1></a> And then, too, what the Lord must have felt on the first day of the week, to find Himself, speaking reverently, raised from amongst the dead by the glory of the Father; and all that He had cherished in His heart so blessedly was now secured for the Father's pleasure for eternity.<a name=156:2></a> So that He was able to speak to Mary Magdalene later on of "my brethren," and of the heavenly relationships which were now to be introduced.<a name=156:3></a> How much there is connected with the first day of the week.<a name=156:4></a> It is well that we should carry these things in our minds every first day of the week, and that we should realise that important things are before us, as we take up the privilege of the Supper, and all that springs out of it, and then go through the day with other features proper to the first day of the week.<a name=156:5></a> How much there is that is glorious in character, that we move amongst, that we have part in.<a name=156:6></a> And it is well that we should be concerned to be early in relation to these things, and that they should be before us, not as something casual, not as something even merely habitual; but as something glorious, into which every first day of the week would give us fresh entrance.<a name=156:7></a> And then we find too, alas, on the other side of the matter, that God, in His dealings with Israel, had to tell them several times over, through the prophet Jeremiah, that He had risen early in the morning, sending His prophets to them.<a name=156:8></a> Think of God using such language, that He had risen early in the morning in an appeal, in an earnest desire, to secure again the affections of His people which He had lost.<a name=156:9></a> So intent was He upon it that He would rise early in the morning and send prophets with that in view, in order that the affections of His people should be stimulated, if it were possible, and the answer that He sought might be secured.<a name=156:10></a>

		Well, I only say that by way of a digression because of what has been raised, and is being raised, as to whether we might not well begin our privileges on Lord's days earlier than we do, and take up the day with a sense of the glory attaching to it, and of the importance of the things in which we are about to have part.<a name=157:1></a> Here in this 22nd chapter of Genesis it says that Abraham, with great things before him, rose early in the morning.<a name=157:2></a> God had said to him, "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and there offer him up for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<a name=157:3></a>" The verses that I read at the end of the chapter show us that as a result of what was done, as a result of all that it meant for the Father, and of all that it meant for the Son, all the precious promises of God are secured.<a name=157:4></a> But this is the way by which they were to be secured, a way which involved infinite sacrifice.<a name=157:5></a> All was to be in the nature of a burnt-offering, there is wonderful acceptability, there is wonderful fragrance before God in relation to Christ, in the way of self-sacrifice in which <i>He</i> has gone; but at the same time, dear brethren, it may be we do not always give sufficient thought to what it has meant for the Father; and so it says that they went both of them together.<a name=157:6></a> But it says also, that "Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand (that is Abraham's hand) and the knife, and they went both of them together.<a name=157:7></a>" It is interesting how this scripture speaks of the wood of the burnt-offering, twice it speaks of it, "the wood of the burnt-offering.<a name=157:8></a>" I suppose it refers to the humanity of Christ, as underlying all that was effected by means of His precious death; and what a glorious humanity it was, dear brethren; moral excellence stamped upon it.<a name=157:9></a> You remember how it says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>that in the volume of the book it

		could come to pass, this way of suffering and sacrifice had to be taken, and it is well that we should see that the Father had His own part in it, the scripture presents things in this way in this chapter, in a kind of pictorial way, in order to enable us, by the Spirit, to get some impression of it, without exactly a direct statement of Scripture as to it.<a name=159:1></a> But there is enough in the passage to enable us, by the Spirit, to get an impression of what it meant for the Father that His thoughts should be established by this way of infinite sacrifice on the part of His Son.<a name=159:2></a> And so it says that the wood of the burnt-offering was laid upon Isaac, but then it says that the father, Abraham, took the fire in his hand, and the knife.<a name=159:3></a> Isaac was his son, his only son, for here God takes no account of Ishmael.<a name=159:4></a> Isaac was his only son, whom he loved; and Abraham and Isaac were going together and as they thus moved together, in unbroken communion, on a journey this part of which was still far off when it was commenced, the father was carrying the fire and the knife.<a name=159:5></a> He would know well what use was to be made of the fire, he would know well what use was to be made of the knife.<a name=159:6></a> It is put in that way, I believe, dear brethren, in order that we should not think that God is above having feelings in these matters, indeed rather we are to understand that all the Persons of the Godhead have been involved in the most extreme sacrifice, in order that divine thoughts of blessing might be for ever established.<a name=159:7></a> And so we are to read into the passage, I do not doubt, that it was not without cost to the heart of God Himself, cost that we cannot measure, that the basis of all the blessing that is to subsist through the world to come and through eternity, was laid; it was not, I say, without cost, either to the Father or to the Son, that this way was undertaken.<a name=159:8></a> And so it says, "they went both of them together.<a name=159:9></a>" A wonderful contemplation.<a name=159:10></a> We see the Father and the Son moving together in the gospel of

		John, in a particular way; how They moved together, there was never a shade of divergence of thought between the Father and the Son, the Son did nothing of Himself, but what He saw the Father do; on the other hand, the Father hid nothing from the Son, but shewed Him all that He was doing.<a name=160:1></a> A wonderful contemplation, the movements together of the Father and the Son in the gospel of John; and yet we are to understand that there <i>came</i> a moment, when the supreme sacrifice was to be made, as it says, "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.<a name=160:2></a>" And so we are to be affected by this, dear brethren, that we do not treat divine things lightly, that we do not regard lightly the fact that we have been called with the wonderful calling with which we have been called, but that underlying all that we are brought into, lies this remarkable expression of depths into which God Himself has entered.<a name=160:3></a> Infinite depths, and I believe I am right in saying that the blessing and the glory in wonderful moral elevation, and all that speaks of height, are commensurate with the depths into which divine Persons have entered.<a name=160:4></a>

		Well, I will come back in a moment to the later part of this chapter, but will now endeavour to speak, and it is holy ground indeed, on the verses we have read from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=160:5></a> It is the language of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we know, on the cross; He said, "My God, my God, Why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=160:6></a> why art thou <i>far</i> from my salvation" -- how much there is in that Word 'far,' "why art thou far?<a name=160:7></a>" How the Lord felt it, dear brethren, the terrible distance that had come in.<a name=160:8></a> To Him who had always walked in unbroken communion with God, and in the sense of being pleasing to God, there came this moment when He says, "why art thou <i>far</i> from my salvation?<a name=160:9></a>" He says, indeed, "Thou art my God from my mother's belly.<a name=160:10></a>" From the very outset He had depended

		And then, as we read in the epistle to the Hebrews, "if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh, how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God.<a name=162:7></a>" We are intended to gather from that, dear brethren, that the Spirit Himself entered feelingly into this matter of atonement, "who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God.<a name=162:8></a>" I do not think one can say any more about this than the passage itself conveys and expresses, but there it is, in order that we might have an impression that the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit have all entered into this matter of the atonement, of the accomplishment of redemption, in order, as I have said several times, that God's will should be established, and all His precious thoughts brought in.<a name=162:9></a>

		A.J.<a name=221:18></a>G.<a name=221:19></a> And do you think that the fact that Melchisedec is said to be "priest of the Most High God" was intended to impress Abraham from the outset with the idea of God being served, he himself being called to have part in that?<a name=221:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=221:21></a> So that it is interesting in regard to what you have said, that you have the dual reference in the great climax in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>, "Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament," or 'expanse',

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=222:4></a>G.<a name=222:5></a> Yes, I thought so.<a name=222:6></a> It says that Melchisedec said, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God .<a name=222:7></a>.<a name=222:8></a>.<a name=222:9></a> .<a name=222:10></a> And blessed be the Most High God.<a name=222:11></a>" As though he would suggest to Abraham that he himself is to take up this service of blessing the Most High God.<a name=222:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=222:13></a> Just so.<a name=222:14></a> The sanctuary -- "Praise God in his sanctuary" -- links with what is special and limited in relation to the revelation of God; but the praising Him in the expanse involves the wider and more general sphere in which God is apprehended as operating in relation to His great thoughts, not only including the assembly, but including every family.<a name=222:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=222:16></a> In the earlier meeting you made some reference to the expanse in connection with recovery or restoration.<a name=222:17></a> Would Abraham, as moving in the gain of the expanse, be used to recover his brother Lot?<a name=222:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=222:19></a> That is what enters into the context of the passage that we read.<a name=222:20></a> Abraham is on the line of recovering his brother.<a name=222:21></a> Which is a great thing.<a name=222:22></a> Lot represents, I suppose, the tendency with many, especially the younger ones, to view the well-watered plain of Jordan; whereas Abraham represents those that are maintained in relation to the heavenly line, and as maintained are effective in influencing such as Lot represents.<a name=222:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=222:24></a>F.<a name=222:25></a> Is it significant that the first impression that Abraham would have of this heavenly system is one of blessing?<a name=222:26></a> I refer to verse 19.<a name=222:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=222:28></a> Yes.<a name=222:29></a> That is one of the main thoughts in reading this passage, and in the passage in chapter 22 we see how blessing is linked with this great section where Abraham is before us.<a name=222:30></a> Because Abraham is the heavenly man, unofficially.<a name=222:31></a> The heavenly side is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=223:2></a>H.<a name=223:3></a> Would Lot, as being recovered, be recovered into this practical matter of blessing; Abraham being blessed, and God being blessed?<a name=223:4></a> Would that be in mind, today, for instance, in the great matter of recovery of persons, that they should be brought back into the best that we enjoy together?<a name=223:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=223:6></a> Yes.<a name=223:7></a> What an impression Lot would get in this scene.<a name=223:8></a> Perhaps we have never thought of Lot in this scene, but he must have been there.<a name=223:9></a> He must have been looking on, perhaps, and watching all that was transpiring; and yet later on he departs from it, which is a very humbling matter; but what an impression it <i>should</i> have put upon him, here, in one so great as Abraham, blessed by one so great as Melchisedec.<a name=223:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=223:11></a>H.<a name=223:12></a> And would the fact of the Spirit calling him here, "his brother Lot," be a gracious movement to move himself into such a scene?<a name=223:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=223:14></a> Yes.<a name=223:15></a> It is as if heaven would credit him with the best; heaven would clothe him with the best thoughts in this section.<a name=223:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=223:17></a>C.<a name=223:18></a>L.<a name=223:19></a> Is there a reason why the name of Jehovah is spoken of as the Most High at this point?<a name=223:20></a> It involves what is mighty and powerful, does it not, and yet it is referred to as the Most High?<a name=223:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=223:22></a> Yes.<a name=223:23></a> I thought there was a link with the expanse in the title, because the Most High brings in the thought of elevation.<a name=223:24></a> Of course it is a millennial title, and in the millennial scene the expanse that God originally made has a peculiar place; but I think the reference to the Most High God is to link our thoughts with the complete superiority of the expanse in a scene where the enemy is moving to hinder the divine right of way.<a name=223:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		A.P.<a name=224:6></a>C.<a name=224:7></a>L.<a name=224:8></a> I am wondering whether some of our young people are fully alive to the importance of that side of the truth.<a name=224:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=224:10></a> Well, I think it is important that they should see it, as it is presented here, specially this thought in Abram of complete superiority to the advances of the king of Sodom as divinely fortified by one who comes on to the scene mysteriously.<a name=224:11></a> It is like what we have read of in the book of Job in relation to the expanse; God is saying, Can you explain these things?<a name=224:12></a> Can you unfold light as to these matters?<a name=224:13></a> Well, Melchisedec comes in in that mysterious way as a hidden divine reserve and resource to meet faith on the heavenly line.<a name=224:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=224:15></a>H.<a name=224:16></a> It says that Melchisedec brought out bread and wine.<a name=224:17></a> Is that part of the reserves, and would you say a word on that?<a name=224:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=224:19></a> Yes, the remark of the Spirit through Moses is very interesting, that he "brought out" where did he bring it out from?<a name=224:20></a> Well, that is the point in Job.<a name=224:21></a> Where do things come from?<a name=224:22></a> Can you explain them?<a name=224:23></a> And "brought out" means that they are coming out of a sphere where God's supremacy is known, and honoured, for Melchisedec was priest of the Most High God.<a name=224:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.M.<a name=224:25></a>M.<a name=224:26></a> Would the gospel of Luke help as to this title Most High God?<a name=224:27></a> I was thinking of the reference "the dayspring from on high has visited us, to shine upon" us, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:78">Luke  1:78</a>.<a name=224:28></a> Would it link with the expanse, and God moving in that character, in grace?<a name=224:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=224:30></a> That is very helpful, because Luke would show how the influence of the expanse is to help us at

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the present time.<a name=225:1></a> In Matthew it is in relation to the side of rule; and administration, but in Luke it is in relation to the service of God, the praises of God.<a name=225:2></a> So that Luke, as he opens his gospel, would bring us to heaven immediately and impress us with elevated surroundings far morally above the world.<a name=225:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.G.<a name=225:4></a>J.<a name=225:5></a> You referred to the enemy trying to prevent the divine right of way.<a name=225:6></a> Is that seen in the Acts, where the female slave with the spirit of Python persisted in following Paul and Silas, and refers to God in this title, the Most High?<a name=225:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=225:8></a> It is remarkable how that title comes in in that section, and how Paul meets it, too.<a name=225:9></a> The heavenly line was coming in in Paul's service and Paul's ministry, but then you get this evil force that is really in the expanse, operating through this channel in the woman to hinder the divine right of way in Paul in opening up the greatness of the heavenly realm where the assembly in its relations with Christ is to be known.<a name=225:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=225:11></a> Whereas here, as you say, Abraham is fortified to meet the overtures of the king of Sodom.<a name=225:12></a> The context, I think, confirms what you say, in verse 17, the Spirit of God records that the king of Sodom went out to meet him, and in verse 21 he said certain things.<a name=225:13></a> But in between that you get this divine visitation.<a name=225:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=225:15></a> It is very interesting that it should specifically say, in verse 17, that the king of Sodom went out to meet <i>him</i>, not to meet the company, not all the servants, trained as they were, nor to meet Lot.<a name=225:16></a> He knows what he can do with Lot, you might say, for the enemy knows what he can do with every one of us; but he is concentrating his attention on Abraham.<a name=225:17></a> If he can deflect Abraham, he gains a complete victory in the position.<a name=225:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=226:2></a> Yes.<a name=226:3></a> Whatever the bread and wine signify, they are a means of strengthening and support.<a name=226:4></a> But they are brought forward in anticipation of the advances of the king of Sodom.<a name=226:5></a> It is an interesting thing that it says in verse 19, "he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth.<a name=226:6></a>" Now notice that in verse 22 Abraham takes on that language, although he adds a touch of his own; "I have lifted up my hand to <i>Jehovah</i>, the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth.<a name=226:7></a>" The allusion to God as possessor of heavens and earth is very fine at this juncture.<a name=226:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.W.<a name=226:9></a>T.<a name=226:10></a> Is it striking that this makes Abraham independent of the king of Sodom, not only generally, but as to these very small details -- "a thread even to a sandal-thong"?<a name=226:11></a> Would that help us just now?<a name=226:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=226:13></a> It would, that is, as you come on to the heavenly line, things become very delicate and the lines become finely drawn; whereas with Lot, in the general setting, while he has certain things, like unleavened bread, and is called righteous Lot, there seems to be a strange lack of conscience with him as to certain things; so that he becomes enveloped in the affairs of Sodom.<a name=226:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=226:15></a>G.<a name=226:16></a> Is it not rather striking that when the seventy return with joy after their victory over the demons, the Lord tells them not to rejoice in that, but to rejoice that their names were written in heaven?<a name=226:17></a> And then He immediately rejoices Himself, and addresses the Father as Lord of the heaven and of the earth.<a name=226:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=227:2></a> Just so.<a name=227:3></a> The Lord Jesus says, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth.<a name=227:4></a>" He brings in that thought of praise and engages in that feature of service as Man at that juncture, in the light of what had taken place in the dispossession of the power of the enemy.<a name=227:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=227:6></a>H.<a name=227:7></a> Is Abraham's further vision, where he is told to "look now toward the heavens," to strengthen him in the progeny that was going to be heavenly, like himself, and able to enter into this matter of being supplied from heaven, and enter into the praise of God?<a name=227:8></a> In chapter 14 it is the "possessor," but now I wondered if his looking towards the heavens and God saying "so shall thy seed be" would link us on with the great heavenly company to engage in the praise of God in a heavenly way.<a name=227:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=227:10></a> I think it does.<a name=227:11></a> We have the reference in the opening verse of chapter 15 to the word of Jehovah coming to Abram.<a name=227:12></a> In chapter 14 Abram says, "I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah," the use of the name Jehovah there signifying that Abram was in the good of the relationship in which he stood to God.<a name=227:13></a> But then in chapter 15 we have "after these things, the word of Jehovah" -- not the word of the Most High -- "came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward," as if to confirm him in this great position.<a name=227:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=227:15></a> Is this the greatest reward that Abraham could possibly have?<a name=227:16></a> Does not this far exceed anything that the king of Sodom could possibly have done for him?<a name=227:17></a> Jehovah is Himself to be his shield, his exceeding great reward!<a name=227:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=227:19></a> Well, it means, speaking simply, that God was his portion.<a name=227:20></a> When we come to the development of the heavenly side in the type in the book of Joshua,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=228>[Page 228]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we find that the Levites had no territorial possessions.<a name=228:1></a> God was to be their portion.<a name=228:2></a> While a lot is made of Abraham's territorial possessions, yet this brings in a refined spiritual touch that lies behind all, "I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward.<a name=228:3></a>" The nearer we get to God, and the nearer we get to heaven the more God Himself becomes our portion.<a name=228:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=228:7></a> I think it should.<a name=228:8></a> The heavenly line, the line of what is linked with the expanse, is to promote separateness with us, because Abraham is called out, and the path of faith involves that he is maintained in all that is suited to pilgrim life, and the pilgrim path.<a name=228:9></a> Therefore he cannot afford to be involved in things here.<a name=228:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=229:8></a> I think it is, and Romans helps us very much in regard to that.<a name=229:9></a> The great thought of blessing in Romans has in mind our reigning in life, that we are superior to our circumstances, and it is on that line that we come into the glory, as it says, "we boast in hope of the glory of God.<a name=229:10></a>" Now notice that in chapter 15 there is another added touch by Abraham.<a name=229:11></a> We have seen that in chapter 14, verse 22, while he takes on the language of Melchisedec he adds an impression he has of his own, "I have lifted up my hand to <i>Jehovah</i>, the Most High God.<a name=229:12></a>" Then in chapter 15: 2 we get, "And Abram said, <i>Lord</i> Jehovah, what wilt thou give me?<a name=229:13></a>" That word is the plural of Adon, which is very significant as coming in here.<a name=229:14></a>

		S.McC.<a name=229:17></a> I think it does; it is a sense of relationship that is present in his soul.<a name=229:18></a> Lot did not have that sense of relationship, and therefore he came under the corrupting power of the world in Sodom.<a name=229:19></a> And if we do not have the sense of relationship as moving in the path of faith in relation to the heavenly line, we shall succumb to the overtures of the world.<a name=229:20></a>

		S.McC.<a name=258:2></a> I think it is important to see that from this chapter, especially after the whole history of the assembly has been gone over, we have this voice, "Come up here" and then, "Immediately I became in the Spirit.<a name=258:3></a>" It is really what you might call a spiritual door out of the ruin and confusion and dislocation; so that we see the Being who is above all the dislocation.<a name=258:4></a> We have the fixed thoughts linked with the unchanged and constant Being who is referred to here, the glass sea, for instance, like crystal.<a name=258:5></a> There is something in that that links with what we are referring to, for one thing you will have noticed in Mr.<a name=258:6></a> Darby's writings and in his hymns is this great thought of the "glass sea, like crystal.<a name=258:7></a>" It suggests a condition of stainlessness, of abiding purity, what is unsullied and unalloyed, despite all that there may be on the lower level, and it is through the Spirit that we come into that.<a name=258:8></a> On the one hand, we see God in His majesty standing out, and on the other hand, all that is consistent with God and His majesty that surrounds the throne in keeping with it.<a name=258:9></a>

		P.H.<a name=258:10></a>H.<a name=258:11></a> In what sense do the four living creatures present themselves, and act, in regard of this scene?<a name=258:12></a> It says, "the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf," and so on.<a name=258:13></a> Do they present the line of the ways that God has used to arrive at His end?<a name=258:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=258:15></a> I think so.<a name=258:16></a> I think they bring in, in keeping with the objective view of the throne and divine majesty, the subjective side in us.<a name=258:17></a> Thus as the throne works out in its operations, the thought of the lion and the calf and the face of a man and the flying eagle, represent certain conditions or features that are produced in the saints.<a name=258:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=259:3></a> It does.<a name=259:4></a> The four references there are remarkable, "before and behind," and then later down, "round and within," showing how, as to ourselves where vigilance is needed, the thought is complete.<a name=259:5></a> There is no part lacking, you might say, or no part unprotected and unguarded, would you think?<a name=259:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=259:20></a> I think it does, because what leads to disaster in any of our spiritual histories is the lack of what is seen in the living creatures, that is, the attributes, of course, as suggested in them.<a name=259:21></a> For instance, we have the thought of power in the lion; well, that is a great feature.<a name=259:22></a> Then there is the thought of the firmness in the calf; and the face of a man suggests the thought of intelligence, and then the flying eagle brings in the thought of rapidity in movement and elevation in movement.<a name=259:23></a> All these are very important in regard to our state of soul, if we are to be preserved from disaster, would you think?<a name=259:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=259:25></a>H.<a name=259:26></a> Yes.<a name=259:27></a> I was wondering whether the remark about persons not seeing could be linked with the lion.<a name=259:28></a> It says elsewhere, "he turneth not aside for any.<a name=259:29></a>" That is, if there is truth in a matter, it becomes a principle to us; therefore the seeing of a thing is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=260:4></a> I think so.<a name=260:5></a> And as you follow it through, you have the matter of firmness.<a name=260:6></a> That is, if firmness is not present we may be deflected.<a name=260:7></a> Then the thought of the face of a man involves that things are not done blindly, they are worked out intelligently; and then, in the reference "like a flying eagle," we have the dignified, elevated, and rapid movements that are suggested in the eagle.<a name=260:8></a> You get in this book the thought, for instance, of a time when there shall be no more delay.<a name=260:9></a> It says in chapter 10: 6, when the strong angel comes in, "that there should be no longer delay.<a name=260:10></a>" It is the idea of the eagle, that things are to go through.<a name=260:11></a>

		Now chapter 10 is a reference as we know to Christ in the figure that is before us; and it is interesting how He is viewed as coming down out of the heaven; that is, we have to remember that in these sections, evil's challenge is being met, and He comes "down out of the heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head" -- notice the rainbow in both the chapters that we have read -- "and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire" -- note the fire running through all the sections that we have read -- "and having in his hand a little opened book.<a name=263:14></a>" Now the little opened book, as we understand it, refers to what is to work out as appropriated by us in affecting us inwardly, and that is an important matter.<a name=263:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=268:1></a> These sections that we have read in this book introduce us to a great realm of administrative and governmental glory; first as seen in Israel, if we take account of the actual symbolic meaning of the woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, though we may apply it in relation to what is seen in the assembly.<a name=268:2></a> The male son which the woman brings forth, that the dragon is ready to devour, and which is caught up to God and to His throne involves, as we have often heard, not only Christ, but the assembly; Christ and the assembly.<a name=268:3></a> And immediately that is so, the presence of Christ and the assembly there, we have the clearing of the expanse.<a name=268:4></a> There was war in the heavens and Satan who had entered the expanse, with the many votaries of his activities and power, is cast out into the earth.<a name=268:5></a> He had sought to interfere with the great operations that the expanse was designed in view of.<a name=268:6></a> Then in the last section we have the way that the assembly, the Lamb's wife, as the holy city, comes on to our view in connection with the millennial scene.<a name=268:7></a> Everywhere the relation of the city is seen in connection with the earth.<a name=268:8></a> God's prime thought in connection with the expanse, as we contemplated in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, is now arrived at in the final side of things in the Revelation.<a name=268:9></a> We have Christ and the assembly associated with Him in the blest administration of that day, culminating in the service of God, as in the last section that we read in chapter 22; and the thought of the Lord God shining upon them and they reigning to the ages of ages.<a name=268:10></a> We thus see how the whole challenge which evil has thrown up is met, and met victoriously, and the saints come into it.<a name=268:11></a>

		S.McC.<a name=270:12></a> It is very striking in that way how these thoughts that appeared in the early chapters of Genesis now reach a full positive result in the end of the Revelation.<a name=270:13></a> They are met by divine supremacy, you might say; not only divine supremacy in relation to the throne in the heavens, but divine supremacy in what the woman suggests.<a name=270:14></a>

		Solomon is right in the midst of it, young and tender.<a name=324:1></a> That is what we love to see.<a name=324:2></a> What a sight to heaven to see the living creatures and the features of the living creatures allied with the twenty-four elders in the maintenance of all that is due to the throne, in consistency and in keeping with it.<a name=324:3></a> What it is to heaven to see the young and the old going on together as seen in David and Solomon.<a name=324:4></a> David the one in whom the ripened fruits of spiritual experience with God are seen, and Solomon the one in whom the features of tenderness, impressionableness and amenability to divine touch are seen.<a name=324:5></a> How wonderful these things are, dear brethren!<a name=324:6></a> The palace which is for God, which is so great, requires these things.<a name=324:7></a> God loves these thoughts in His palace.<a name=324:8></a> There is what David represents and what Solomon represents but they all fit into the great thought of the assembly in its majesty and glory, as the greatest creature vessel, the vessel that is nearest to Deity, the palace which is for God, and not for man.<a name=324:9></a> Think of the blending of these precious thoughts.<a name=324:10></a> It is like the half-opened flowers alongside of the cherubim in the walls of the house in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#6:29">1 Kings  6:29</a>.<a name=324:11></a>
