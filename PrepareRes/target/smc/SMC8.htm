	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=1:1></a> It is proposed that we should look at the subject of spiritual unity in the ministry of John.<a name=1:2></a> As the brethren would recall immediately at the mention of it, unity has a great place in his ministry.<a name=1:3></a> It is a very full and extensive subject in his ministry, entering into all his writings.<a name=1:4></a> It is proposed that we should look this morning first at unity in relation to the truth, which has such a prominent place in the passages that we have read.<a name=1:5></a> Then we may, if the Lord should help, go to the Revelation, and see unity in the ministry of John as it appears in the testimonial position in relation to reproach and suffering, and also, in relation to glory, in the administrative setting.<a name=1:6></a> Then we may go to the gospel of John, for the extensive side of the subject, to see how spiritual unity develops in relation to the servants and their service; and in relation to the flock and the family of God figuratively set out in John's ministry.<a name=1:7></a> Then we shall need to see how it enters into the great subject of the service of God, where under the hand of the minister of the sanctuary, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, the great thoughts of unity and oneness are stressed.<a name=1:8></a> Then entering into it, and running alongside of it, we have the great truths of eternal life, and sonship, and the revelation of God in Christ, all having in mind the promotion of this thought of spiritual unity amongst us.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in proposing <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>to be read, one has in mind that we should consider first of all that this unity must have a moral basis.<a name=1:10></a> Any unity that does not have a moral basis amongst us will not last very long.<a name=1:11></a> The brethren will remember how, in the history

		of Jehoshaphat, he joined himself to the wicked king Ahaziah in regard to the ships, and how God intervened to break them up; <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#20:35">2 Chronicles  20:35</a> - 37.<a name=2:1></a> How much there has been around of amalgamation, and the promotion of a unity that does not have its basis in the water and the blood, and in relation to the Spirit.<a name=2:2></a> So it is thought that we should first consider the Spirit, and the water and the blood, whose witness agrees in one.<a name=2:3></a> If the witness agrees in one, as it is received, and as it affects the brethren, it must produce a corresponding subjective result with us, so that there is spiritual unity.<a name=2:4></a> Then, not only do we have a moral basis emphasised in the first epistle, but the truth comes on to our view in the second epistle as the great bond by which we are bound together.<a name=2:5></a> We want to see the importance of the truth, as entering into the way we are bound together in spiritual unity.<a name=2:6></a> The truth is a most important and effective bond; we cannot disregard it.<a name=2:7></a> We want to see its importance in the second epistle, where reference is made to the doctrine of the Christ, taking us back to what has come out in the teaching of Christ, and in His ministry, linked with the revelation of God in Him.<a name=2:8></a> Then we should see how love enters into the matter, too, as in verse 5 of the second epistle, "And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.<a name=2:9></a> And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments".<a name=2:10></a> And then, the witness to the love of Gaius before the assembly is very affecting, especially as we see the controlling and dominating place that the truth has in both these relations.<a name=2:11></a> But first of all, we have this matter of the water which stresses the moral side with us, and the essentiality of a purified state amongst us.<a name=2:12></a> We are to be free from what is of the world, and free from what is linked with the man of

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:3></a>G.<a name=3:4></a> I am sure it will be profitable to us.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a>Jr.<a name=3:7></a> Would the thought of unity be in the Lord's service in the gospels and connected with the service of the apostles in the Acts, so that it is one thing that has come down to us?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:9></a> I thought so.<a name=3:10></a> I thought it was embodied in the expression "the doctrine of the Christ".<a name=3:11></a> What was set out in the Lord's service and in the service of the apostles, as you say, has come down to us; and we are to be affected by it.<a name=3:12></a> There is no new development, as it were; there is nothing to be added to that.<a name=3:13></a> We are coming into it in our time, on the line of recognising what is there and being controlled by it.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=3:15></a> So that Christianity is all set forth in the Person of Christ.<a name=3:16></a> There has been nothing added, nor could there be, whatever unfoldings the Spirit has afforded.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:18></a> So that John stresses what is from the beginning.<a name=3:19></a> It is an important matter that we are to be affected and regulated by what is from the beginning; the fathers, that is those in a position of parental influence among the saints, being specially alluded to as knowing Him that is from the beginning.<a name=3:20></a> So that things are maintained in relation to that.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a>Jr.<a name=3:23></a> Would you think then that the ministry of John comes in especially in view of the disunity that is in Christendom?<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:25></a> One has felt that very specially.<a name=3:26></a> We even get in John's gospel the prophetic announcement through Caiaphas as to the Lord's death, and John the evangelist in commenting on it by the Spirit refers to the important point that "he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:52">John  11:52</a>.<a name=3:27></a> That is a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		remarkable reference bearing on the prophecy preceding from the mouth of a man like Caiaphas, but it shows us abstractly what is in mind in John's ministry.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:2></a>Jr.<a name=4:3></a> I thought too, that the disunity that is in Christendom may have its reflection amongst us.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:5></a> Therefore we are to be searched in relation to the matter, and one feels it brings up the need for emphasis on the water.<a name=4:6></a> That is, the death of Christ in its separative and purifying aspect, as that which would set us apart from all the divisive features and elements amongst us, and in us, that in the world make way for the man of sin.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=4:8></a>C.<a name=4:9></a>L.<a name=4:10></a> The first reference to the water in verse 6 is "<i>he</i> that came by water and blood, Jesus the Christ".<a name=4:11></a> It is connected with the Person; it is not only an abstract matter in that sense, but "This is <i>he</i> that came".<a name=4:12></a> I was thinking of what has been said as to what is in the Person.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:14></a> And does not this become the great test in Christianity?<a name=4:15></a> John says earlier, "every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that power of the antichrist, of which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world".<a name=4:16></a> That is, all that is around us is affected by the influence of antichristian principles, that would bring in a rival to Christ, and bring in what is divisive in that sense.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=4:18></a>S.<a name=4:19></a> What would the name "Jesus the Christ" be intended to convey to us?<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:21></a> I think it is to call our attention to a different kind of humanity, a different kind of Man.<a name=4:22></a> In the gatherings, in the assemblings, we need to see the importance of a different kind of humanity.<a name=4:23></a> All around us in Christendom we see the kind of humanity that likes to have a vain show, what will make much of the flesh, and in the world we see the kind of humanity that will make everything of what

		is material -- money, and power in a material and political way, but in the assembly we are to be affected by this different kind of humanity -- "Jesus the Christ".<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:2></a>G.<a name=5:3></a> The Man who is approved and anointed of God -- the Christ.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:5></a> Exactly.<a name=5:6></a> That is the kind of humanity that God can commit Himself to.<a name=5:7></a> And the water is to help us to judge unsparingly in our souls the features of the humanity and of the kind of man that He has expressed His displeasure in regard to in the death of Christ, typified in the water.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=5:9></a>H.<a name=5:10></a> What exactly is pointed to in the thought of coming?<a name=5:11></a> "This is he that <i>came</i> by water and blood", Is it to concentrate our attention on these two things?<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:13></a> I think it is.<a name=5:14></a> It is not a question of what is chronological, it is not a question exactly of a point of time, it is a question of the Lord coming into the sphere of the testimony, where full witness and testimony is to be rendered to this kind of humanity.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=5:16></a>H.<a name=5:17></a> Therefore it includes the historical matter of His death, where the water and the blood became manifest.<a name=5:18></a> Would the death of Christ in that respect be one of the points in the testimony?<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:20></a> It is.<a name=5:21></a> And we are to note in that sense, that in the gospel, the blood comes first, whereas in the epistle the water comes first.<a name=5:22></a> Well, that is not for nothing.<a name=5:23></a> In the gospels, things are presented to us objectively for faith to lay hold of, but when we come to John's epistle, the state of the saints is in mind, so that the water precedes the mention of the blood.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:25></a>G.<a name=5:26></a> John lays particular stress on the witness.<a name=5:27></a> "He who saw it", he says, referring to the coming out of the blood and water, "bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that

		ye also may believe", <a href="../bible/John.htm#19:35">John  19:35</a>.<a name=6:1></a> Does he not attach great importance to this matter of the blood and the water, in the gospel, and the water and the blood in the epistle?<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:3></a> It is very interesting to see that, how along with the witness is stressed the moral value of the witness, the authenticity of it, "he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true".<a name=6:4></a> There is thus abundant authoritative witness to this matter of the blood and the water; and the water and the blood.<a name=6:5></a> This is very important, because in the general position, in the professing body, and coming nearer, amongst ourselves, there is sometimes great uncertainty and perhaps wonderment, as to what is really the truth; whereas John would emphasise that what he says is true.<a name=6:6></a> That is specially important in those that minister.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=6:8></a> Has John in mind the maintenance of the saints in victory?<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:10></a> I would say so, the beginning of the chapter emphasises that.<a name=6:11></a> How can victory be maintained amongst us, and how can spiritual unity be established, if this moral basis is not right in our souls?<a name=6:12></a> We must have a judgment as to the state from which there arises the difficulties, the unbelief, the deception, and all that is linked with that man.<a name=6:13></a> We are to have a right judgment of it, and, through the water aspect of the death of Christ, see the value of a new state.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:15></a>C.<a name=6:16></a> Would it be justifiable to bring in Paul's doctrine to support what has been said?<a name=6:17></a> He says in Ephesians, "But ye have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus; namely your having put off according to the former conversation the old man .<a name=6:18></a>.<a name=6:19></a>.<a name=6:20></a> and your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:20">Ephesians  4:20</a> - 24.<a name=6:21></a> I was

		wondering whether "the doctrine of the Christ", as has been indicated, and our learning of Him involves His present position, and the truth in Him as set out where He is; and that involves the water, our having put off the old man.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:2></a> I think there is a definite link with Paul's ministry in that setting.<a name=7:3></a> We often refer to the locating points in John's ministry that link on with Paul's, and this is one that particularly links on with that section to which you refer, as to truthful righteousness and holiness.<a name=7:4></a> The water has to do with that state amongst the saints, where there is nothing opaque, where there is nothing clandestine, where there is uprightness and transparency, and where the truth has full place.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:6></a>C.<a name=7:7></a> So that the truth as it is in Jesus involves our having put off the old man.<a name=7:8></a> Does not the water imply that, that we have done it by profession, and we are to do it in practice?<a name=7:9></a> Is that right?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:11></a> That is how I understand it.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:13></a>Jr.<a name=7:14></a> So that baptism is the crux of the matter as to application, not just profession?<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:16></a> Exactly.<a name=7:17></a> The death of Christ, in that separative way, sets us apart from the world, and the man that is in it, and the taking up of the practical teaching of it involves our arrival at this new state, where things are transparent, things are upright amongst us.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=7:19></a> Is that seen in the eunuch, who after he had listened to the word said, "Behold water"?<a name=7:20></a> He was baptised and went on his way rejoicing.<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:22></a> He got an impression as to the need of the water; and would to God that we all had a greater impression of the need of the water.<a name=7:23></a> Why is it that so many princes amongst us have fallen out by the way?<a name=7:24></a> I believe, speaking soberly and calculatingly, that it is because the water, and the state which the water produces, have been lacking.<a name=7:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That bears on us all now, for every one of us, in our hearts and our souls, should be greatly concerned, that the state which the water produces should not be lacking.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:2></a>G.<a name=8:3></a> Would you say that the sense of the need of the water produces the sense of the need positively of the Spirit, as the power for the new life, and as the witness to us?<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:5></a> So the water can only be rightly arrived at in its value, or be applied, in the power of the Spirit, in that sense.<a name=8:6></a> It is not a question of the human mind, or the resource of the flesh entering into it, because the water sets all that aside.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:8></a>G.<a name=8:9></a> And the Spirit comes into prominence as <i>the</i> truth.<a name=8:10></a> "It is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth".<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:12></a> It is very important to see the Spirit referred to in this way, because it links on with the truth as the bond of fellowship in the second and third epistles.<a name=8:13></a> The Lord is the truth objectively, at the right hand of God, but the Spirit is the truth subjectively here in the saints.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=8:15></a>E.<a name=8:16></a> May there be some explanation for us now, as to how, since the Spirit has acquired a personal place among the brethren.<a name=8:17></a> He has had scope to bring emphasis into the ministry as to purification?<a name=8:18></a> One was wondering whether the word in Hebrews, "Sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water", would have any bearing upon what is in your mind?<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:20></a> It has a very definite bearing.<a name=8:21></a> The recovery of the saints to the recognition of the Spirit, and what is due to Him, and the place that He has in the service of God, in an all-embracive way, is not only to affect us objectively, but it is to affect us subjectively and practically, in all associations of life.<a name=8:22></a> So that the Lord has been stressing, on the eve of translation, the importance that we should be

		J.S.<a name=9:2></a>E.<a name=9:3></a> We have come into the gain of this better translation.<a name=9:4></a> According to the Authorised Version heaven and earth stood in contrast, reference being made to three bearing witness in heaven, and three on earth, but does the Spirit and the water, and the blood, all apply to us as here on the earth?<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:6></a> It is important to see that because the whole point is our position in the testimony here.<a name=9:7></a> It is remarkable how the numeral three comes into it, because the numeral three has a great place in God's world.<a name=9:8></a> We have the three in creation, and we have the three in the tabernacle system, supremely we have the Three in the Trinity.<a name=9:9></a> And it is remarkable that we should have the three referred to in this way here, "and the three agree in one".<a name=9:10></a> There is no diversity in thought in the witness here.<a name=9:11></a> And there would be no diversity of thought, or action, in the result and the effect that it produces, in the state that is marked by what is effected by the death of Christ in this way.<a name=9:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:16></a> I think so.<a name=9:17></a> It is not the blood so much, important as the blood is, and we do not want to miss it here, but what is stressed is the water.<a name=9:18></a> Especially is it important in persons being accorded to the right to the tree of life, as it says in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>, that there should be clear testimony to the fact that the water, typically speaking, is employed by them in the washing of their robes.<a name=9:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:10></a> Exactly.<a name=10:11></a> Why is it that diversity of opinion and of judgment comes up amongst us?<a name=10:12></a> It must be that the matter of the water has not the place that it should have, especially where evil may be involved.<a name=10:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:18></a> It does.<a name=10:19></a> Zechariah is concerned about uncleanness, and we should be concerned about uncleanness wherever we are, in any part of the world; for in our time, the Lord is stressing practical conditions amongst the saints, subjective conditions entering into this matter of life, and spiritual unity, because the life is to work out in spiritual unity.<a name=10:20></a> It is not just an abstract idea of life, it is to work out in spiritual unity among the brethren as the features of the world are abominated and judged and set aside in our souls.<a name=10:21></a>

		A.J.<a name=78:1></a>G.<a name=78:2></a> Would you say what is the distinctive thought connected with the flock?<a name=78:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:4></a> It brings up an interesting point, in relation to the sheep.<a name=78:5></a> It is not a question of how sheep are born, how they come into existence, but, as we know in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, it is a question of what the sheep are, and the features that mark the sheep that are there that the Lord as the Shepherd takes account of.<a name=78:6></a> I thought the flock would link with the saints from that viewpoint in the Colossian letter.<a name=78:7></a> Both the Colossian and Ephesian letters would involve what we have in these two sections in regard to the sheep and the family, would you think?<a name=78:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=78:9></a>G.<a name=78:10></a> Perhaps you would open that out a little more.<a name=78:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:12></a> Well, the great thought of "leading out", and "putting forth" is prominent in the service of the shepherd, and Colossians views the Lord in His influence upon the saints in relation to what is outside of Judaism, for Judaism adds nothing to the position in Colossians.<a name=78:13></a> This section refers to the Lord as leading out, putting forth; His influence is seen in that direction.<a name=78:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=78:15></a>C.<a name=78:16></a> Have you in mind that the word "they follow me, and I give them life eternal", would involve following Him over Jordan, according to Colossians?<a name=78:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:18></a> I would think so.<a name=78:19></a> In verse 10 we have, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly".<a name=78:20></a> Life in that sense is linked with the position over Jordan, the faith state in the saints, as viewed in Colossians, laying hold of it.<a name=78:21></a> So that the subject of life, entering into all these passages is very important, and shows that the unity is an organic unity.<a name=78:22></a> It is not only unity in the truth, as we considered earlier, which is very important, but unity in life.<a name=78:23></a> That is, the life is the same wherever you view it.<a name=78:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=79:4></a> I think there is.<a name=79:5></a> But would you say something more on what you are thinking of.<a name=79:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=79:7></a>E.<a name=79:8></a> Just that He uses this figure of the sheep, on the one hand; it was that which was within the compass of their understanding, but it was to show that they were outside the range of enjoying its operations.<a name=79:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=79:10></a> So that oftentimes, where the truth comes out in the presence of opposition, there are special touches which we might not have got otherwise.<a name=79:11></a> I think that is the setting of <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>.<a name=79:12></a> Life abundantly is exclusive to this dispensation.<a name=79:13></a> That is, no other family has this touch of life that the sheep of Christ have.<a name=79:14></a> The flock, the assembly viewed in that sense, comes into it now.<a name=79:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=79:16></a>E.<a name=79:17></a> Has there been over the years, what we might call a spiritual build-up in the truth, coming to light in the presence of enemies, but the enemies not coming into it?<a name=79:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=79:19></a> So that the line of demarcation becomes more and more distinct, between the opposition to the Lord and His sheep, and what would nominally occupy a position, but not be according to the divine order.<a name=79:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=79:24></a> I think it does.<a name=79:25></a> Much is made of the voice in this chapter.<a name=79:26></a> And the reference in verse 3 that we did not read, to the porter, is very important in that relation.<a name=79:27></a> Who is the porter opening to?<a name=79:28></a> The porter is not opening to the thieves and the robbers; the porter is opening to Christ, making way for Christ, the true Shepherd.<a name=79:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=80:4></a>H.<a name=80:5></a> Would the question of the voice stand over against the persuasive speech, and similar things, in the Colossian epistle?<a name=80:6></a> It says here that the sheep know his voice, but they know not the voice of strangers.<a name=80:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=80:8></a> What you refer to is very interesting, because one of the things that enters into the mystery of iniquity, or the mystery of lawlessness and its operating, is speech.<a name=80:9></a> Speech has a peculiar place, for God said, you will remember, in Exodus, "Who made man's mouth?<a name=80:10></a>" It is peculiarly one of the greatest and finest organs that God has made in man and the enemy has entrenched upon that, just as he has entrenched upon the expanse.<a name=80:11></a> He has come into that matter of man's mouth, especially in view of antichristian principles being promoted, that would make way for a rival to Christ.<a name=80:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=80:13></a>H.<a name=80:14></a> So what is connected with the voice is leadership.<a name=80:15></a> It says, "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice".<a name=80:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=80:17></a> We are all tested as to whether we know the voice in that way; the characteristic of the sheep is that it knows the voice.<a name=80:18></a> So that we can measure ourselves, for John gives us measuring lines by which we can arrive at where we are in regard to the Lord and in regard to the truth, and this is one of the measuring lines as to whether we are amongst the sheep of Christ, and hear His voice.<a name=80:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=80:20></a> Do you distinguish therefore between His words, and His voice?<a name=80:21></a> We have His voice referred to in chapter 5.<a name=80:22></a> I wondered whether you had in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:2></a> The voice peculiarly brings out the personality of Christ, in certain relations.<a name=81:3></a> We get the voice of the Bridegroom, the voice of the Son of God, the voice of the Shepherd, in this gospel.<a name=81:4></a> Why is John making so much of the voice, his ministry bearing on current conditions in the last days?<a name=81:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:10></a> That is why one was referring to personality, as linked with the voice.<a name=81:11></a> John turned to see the voice, and what he saw was the Lord Jesus.<a name=81:12></a> Personality is peculiarly linked with the voice.<a name=81:13></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:16></a> We sincerely hope it is.<a name=81:17></a> We trust it is not the voice of the wolf, or the voice of the thief.<a name=81:18></a> We trust that we hear the Shepherd's voice, in gatherings such as these.<a name=81:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.C.<a name=81:20></a>L.<a name=81:21></a> Would you connect what is in the body of the saints with the thought of what is in the flock, and how the Lord's voice in the truth is recognised?<a name=81:22></a> Is not that sometimes more reliable than one speaking here or one speaking there?<a name=81:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:24></a> So that there is a great value in seeing, in that sense, what there is in the body of the saints.<a name=81:25></a> It has often been pointed out, and often been noticed, that one of the distinctive things that characterised J.<a name=81:26></a>T.<a name=81:27></a>'s service was the room that was made for what there was in the body of the saints.<a name=81:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.C.<a name=81:29></a>L.<a name=81:30></a> Does not Paul speak of really protecting that, by way of oversight?<a name=81:31></a> The Holy Spirit is seeing to it that that is protected by way of oversight, so that the wolf does not get in.<a name=81:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=81:33></a> Just so.<a name=81:34></a> There is a certain safeguard in what there is in the body of the saints by the Spirit, although, of course, leadership is always required.<a name=81:35></a>

		J.McK.<a name=82:1></a> Would the voice connect with the Lord passing on?<a name=82:2></a> We have, at the end of chapter 8, that He was passing on, and it says in the beginning of chapter 9, "as he passed on".<a name=82:3></a> Would this voice be a kind of delineation of that passing on, and indicate where the Lord is in the matter?<a name=82:4></a> And as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>speaks of His leading -- "He brought them to his holy border".<a name=82:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=82:6></a> So that if we do not recognise the voice we may be left behind; we are not among the sheep of Christ characteristically in that way.<a name=82:7></a> It is important to see that this section is full of movement.<a name=82:8></a> Here we have the Lord coming in, and going out, and putting forth; and then in the next section, with the family, it is full of movement.<a name=82:9></a>

		C.H.<a name=82:10></a> Would the light of the Son of God, which is in the end of the previous chapter, be carried forward into this chapter?<a name=82:11></a> Is the Shepherd the Son of God?<a name=82:12></a> He is introducing us into that realm where the Son of God is to be supreme.<a name=82:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=82:14></a> That is right.<a name=82:15></a> And the presentation of the Shepherd and the flock is to draw out feelings, and to bring in the richness and refinement that are linked with the development of feelings in the assembly.<a name=82:16></a> Surely there is much room for that, and the enjoyment of life more abundantly would help in that relation.<a name=82:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=83:6></a> I think so; and along with the Person of Christ, in that way, the Father comes in, as in the latter portion of the chapter.<a name=83:7></a> The Lord brings the Father in, saying, "My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.<a name=83:8></a> I and the Father are one".<a name=83:9></a> We have mystery linked with the knowledge of these two wondrous Persons, in relation to the sheep, and the matter of security, life eternal, and not perishing.<a name=83:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=83:11></a> The matter of suffering is brought into this again, but is it of note that the Father loves Him because of that?<a name=83:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=83:13></a> Yes, the Lord laying down His life furnishes the Father with the motive for loving Him, as we have often heard, "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again".<a name=83:14></a>

		P.H.<a name=83:15></a>H.<a name=83:16></a> Referring to this matter of the Lord's Person, when He says "<i>I</i> am the door", and when He says "<i>I</i> am the living bread", and other expressions, are we to understand that behind those specific things, there is the inscrutability of His Person?<a name=83:17></a> "<i>I</i> am the door" would mean what He is, I suppose, but "before Abraham was, <i>I</i> am" would be the greatness and deity of His Person, would it not?<a name=83:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=83:19></a> Yes.<a name=83:20></a> John all the way through stresses the Person of Christ.<a name=83:21></a> The very opening verse of his gospel draws attention to that, and all the way

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=84:5></a> I think so.<a name=84:6></a> In that sense there is a link with Colossians, where the Person of Christ is projected on to our view in a very special way.<a name=84:7></a> It is very interesting that in Colossians there is only one allusion to the Spirit, and that reference is to the saints, and their "love in the Spirit".<a name=84:8></a> From there on we get the Person of Christ enlarged upon in the ministry of Paul to the Colossians.<a name=84:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=84:13></a> I think we arrive at it by response to light as it is presented.<a name=84:14></a> As light is presented to us, in regard to the truth and divine thoughts, we come into the gain of what Christ is as the door, and we move in relation to it.<a name=84:15></a> Perhaps you would say something as to it?<a name=84:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=84:17></a>Jr.<a name=84:18></a> In verse 7.<a name=84:19></a> He says, "Verily, verily", that is Christ, "I say to you".<a name=84:20></a> That is, He is emphasising this point of the door, "<i>I</i> am the door of the sheep".<a name=84:21></a> So you would have to see what that would mean now; the door must mean the way into things.<a name=84:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:7></a> I thought that was the setting in which it is viewed here.<a name=96:8></a> It says "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus", and also "He whom thou lovest is sick".<a name=96:9></a> It is a question of the Lord's links with each of the members of the family.<a name=96:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:15></a> Well, we have to make room for attractiveness in the family of God.<a name=96:16></a> There was the thought of attractiveness in Christ Himself, and the first word for love bears on that in regard to Lazarus.<a name=96:17></a> Why should we take issue with that?<a name=96:18></a> If there are those that draw out the love of friendship from Christ, we would delight in the thought of it.<a name=96:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:22></a> I thought the glory of God really involved that, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=96:23></a>" What was the glory of God?<a name=96:24></a> In the wonderful way that the power of death was met, and life comes on to our view in one who is raised from the dead.<a name=96:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:4></a> Yes.<a name=97:5></a> Now in chapter 11, verse 41 follows immediately verse 40, that is, the Lord raises the issue as to the stone, the stone has to be taken away.<a name=97:6></a> Now we are to notice that in this setting here, because, when we come to the rapture, as we perhaps may have heard, there is no idea of taking the stone away.<a name=97:7></a> When the Lord descends Himself personally with the assembling shout, there is no suggestion or idea of the stone being taken away, the dead in Christ will be raised.<a name=97:8></a> But there is an issue involved here, and the Lord says "Take away the stone".<a name=97:9></a> It is not that He is going to do it.<a name=97:10></a> He could easily do it, but that is not the point.<a name=97:11></a> He is saying "Take away the stone", and Martha would hold Him up in relation to the stone.<a name=97:12></a> The point, I believe is, that all that is linked with that corrupt condition must be faced, but faced in the light of the glory of God, and the power of God that can cope with it, and deal with it.<a name=97:13></a> We do not want to keep the stone on the mouth of the sepulchre, if the Lord says "Take away the stone".<a name=97:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:19></a> It is very interesting how the sisterhood comes in, and especially in regard to this matter of the stone.<a name=97:20></a> That is, it is not the Jews that the Lord is speaking to; the Jews are there, but the Lord says, in verse 39, "Take away the stone.<a name=97:21></a> Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days there".<a name=97:22></a> It is as if Martha

		would keep the stone there; she does not want the offensiveness of all that is hidden behind the stone to come out.<a name=98:1></a> But if the glory of God is to enter into this matter, and the power of God, the stone must be taken away, and the sisters are to understand that.<a name=98:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=98:3></a>Jr.<a name=98:4></a> So she does not say any more after that.<a name=98:5></a> I was thinking it would show the way she was reached, "Jesus says to her".<a name=98:6></a> Is it not an affectionate reference -- "the sister of the dead"?<a name=98:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=98:8></a> It is, and an unusual reference, "Martha, the sister of the dead".<a name=98:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=98:10></a> Over against that statement, would you say a word as to verse 2, where the Spirit of God seems to emphasise that Lazarus was Mary's brother?<a name=98:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=98:12></a> It shows how personality stands out in that way, in Mary.<a name=98:13></a> The Spirit of God through John projects her on to our view before the matter of death is dealt with.<a name=98:14></a> In chapter 11: 2 John says "it was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick".<a name=98:15></a> But when we come to verse 39 that was referred to, it is "Martha, the sister of the dead".<a name=98:16></a> A very interesting link, to see how both of them are linked with Lazarus in the different ways in which he is referred to.<a name=98:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=98:21></a> We do not like, perhaps, the offensive side to come fully out, but the Lord joins issue with the matter; He said, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=98:22></a>" He did not say to her, 'Did I not say to thee that if the stone was rolled away thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=98:23></a>' He said, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=98:24></a>" The issue had to be met in Martha's own soul, just as the issue has to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=99:5></a> It is very interesting to see that the moment the Lord meets the issue in Martha's soul, and Martha seems to get help, it says "<i>they</i> took <i>therefore</i>", notice that adverb 'therefore', it does not just say 'they took the stone away', the adverb 'therefore' reflects on verse 40, "Did I not say to thee that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=99:6></a>" Then it says, "They took therefore the stone away".<a name=99:7></a> Then the Lord lifts up His eyes on high; it is not now the sepulchre, not now what is behind that stone, but He lifts up His eyes on high and says, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me".<a name=99:8></a> There is moral order in the way the circumstances are related here.<a name=99:9></a>

		S.McC.<a name=103:1></a> It was thought mainly to consider the section from <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>to 17, but it came into one's mind last night, that perhaps we should refer to these sections that we have read from chapters 12 and 13, and then, if the Lord should so will, perhaps <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>this afternoon.<a name=103:2></a> The section in John from chapter 13 to 17, that we come into now, is really the backbone of the subject we are considering in spiritual unity, and in suggesting these passages, the thoughts in mind are to see how we are bound up in the humanity of Christ, first of all, and then how we are bound up together in the affections of Christ.<a name=103:3></a> We have the humanity of Christ in regard to the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying, and the bearing of much fruit, that is the new kind of humanity in which we are together bound up with Christ.<a name=103:4></a> Then in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, one feels that there is a typical and hidden allusion to the place of the assembly.<a name=103:5></a> In view of the degeneration and corruption under the influence of which the assembly has come publicly, it is important that we should see how we are bound up together in the affections of Christ.<a name=103:6></a> The fact that the Lord says of John in chapter 21, "If I will that he abide until I come", is perhaps an indication to us as to certain features that appear in John that would greatly help us in regard to the assembly's position at the close of the dispensation.<a name=103:7></a> There is no doubt a hidden allusion to it typically, in John, as in the bosom, and on the breast of Jesus.<a name=103:8></a> Then we should see in chapter 14, how we are bound up together in the life of Christ, as the Lord says, "because I live ye also shall live"; then how we are

		J.T.<a name=109:1></a>Jr.<a name=109:2></a> The thought of death would be a puzzle to the Greeks, and of course the Lord's supper is the expression of death.<a name=109:3></a> It is really the experience of these things every first day of the week that is to help the saints about this new condition.<a name=109:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=109:5></a> So it is very remarkable that the Lord's supper has really become a test in Christendom.<a name=109:6></a> It has been set aside, and the enemy has been in that, because of what we are now referring to; therefore the importance of seeing the death of Christ in this relation.<a name=109:7></a> The Lord speaks of it as a matter of parabolic fact, in verse 24, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die", but then, it is not a matter of parabolic fact in verse 27, for the Lord comes to the actuality of it, and the literality of it, when He says, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?<a name=109:8></a> Father, save me from this hour.<a name=109:9></a> But on account of this have I come to this hour.<a name=109:10></a> Father, glorify thy name".<a name=109:11></a> Surely the Lord has in mind in saying "But on account of this", the assembly at the present time, and what has come in in result.<a name=109:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=109:17></a> That is what we were referring to earlier, when we said that we get the intimation of it here in the Lord's word, but not the development or opening out of it.<a name=109:18></a> But as we go to the epistles, we get in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, and in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>, that we are of Christ, and out of Christ; the assembly, in that sense, is of Him and out of Him.<a name=109:19></a> That needs to impress our minds more and more, because the issue as to trade unionism and associations has been very practical, and it involves this matter, as to the kind of humanity that we have part in in the assembly.<a name=109:20></a>

		S.McC.<a name=110:3></a> If we do not get the gain of that, disintegration is bound to come about with us, because separation from evil is always God's principle of unity.<a name=110:4></a> That is why we read the verse as to "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me".<a name=110:5></a> That is, in this section, we are in the presence of the way of the cross, the way of death, death to the world, and the kind of humanity in it.<a name=110:6></a> In Philadelphia we have the complete acceptance of that, and the Lord is pleased with it.<a name=110:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		M.A.<a name=110:8></a>W.<a name=110:9></a> Is that why the practical dealing with associations and what is evil leads to the family of God in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6">2 Corinthians  6</a>, in the reference to sons and daughters according to God?<a name=110:10></a>

		What is in mind in reading these scriptures is the idea of spiritual perception.<a name=172:2></a> To be able to see things from the divine viewpoint is a quality that is very much needed by us, for it is not as we naturally see things.<a name=172:3></a> How much this is needed today amongst us, as one matter after another arises in our various localities, calling for spiritual perception.<a name=172:4></a> Whether we can see aright in matters is of great importance, and as to whether we can see with God in a matter.<a name=172:5></a> As far as spiritual things are concerned we are born blind, and I think sight begins with new birth; that is the first divine operation in our souls and it has that in view, as the Lord Jesus says, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom".<a name=172:6></a> The first operations on the part of God in relation to us is to open our eyes.<a name=172:7></a> That is in the commission to the apostle Paul; he was to open men's eyes.<a name=172:8></a> Then the idea came in as to turning from darkness to light and from Satan's power to God, and that they should have the forgiveness of sins, and that they should come into the great inheritance that God has purposed for them.<a name=172:9></a> It was to begin with the opening of the eyes, our spiritual eyesight at first has to be opened.<a name=172:10></a> So that this is a great matter, and it would seem to me that the divine Persons all have this in mind in relation to us, to enlighten us, so that we eventually come into the knowledge of divine Persons.<a name=172:11></a>

		The words in chapter 17 which are in my mind particularly are, first, in verse 11, "that they may be one as we".<a name=182:3></a> They are very simple words, but they are very wonderful.<a name=182:4></a> Then in verse 21 He says "that they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us", and then in verse 22, "that they may be one, as we are one".<a name=182:5></a> May the Holy Spirit help us to enter a little into what is in the mind of the Lord Jesus in these simple words.<a name=182:6></a> They are wonderful, infinite, and we shall never exhaust them, and may the Holy Spirit help the servant who speaks, to say just a word about them briefly.<a name=182:7></a>

		"That they may be one", the Lord says in verse 11.<a name=182:8></a> This section of the chapter refers, as we have been saying together, to the servants, primarily to the apostles, that they should be one, as the Father and the Son are One, in the work that they were now to undertake.<a name=182:9></a> The Lord Jesus said, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" and He would have those who carry on the work to be one with Them in it.<a name=182:10></a> That is a very great thought for us to ponder over.<a name=182:11></a> Primarily the apostles were in mind, but it comes down to our time, for the service goes on to the end of the dispensation.<a name=182:12></a> The Lord Jesus is looking down the whole dispensation to the day of glory; an important thing to have in mind in reading this marvellous chapter!<a name=182:13></a> The service goes on; every service rightly carried out has a unifying effect, and is, I believe, only carried out rightly as in this oneness with the Father and the Son.<a name=182:14></a> One almost feels that it is too much to say that all true service

		S.McC.<a name=203:1></a> It is in mind to consider the glory of Christ, and how it is to affect the assembly on the eve of the rapture.<a name=203:2></a> In the type of old, in Rebecca (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>), that well-known section, the journey leads to the point where Rebecca says, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us?<a name=203:3></a> And the servant said, That is my master!<a name=203:4></a>" (verse 65), and that is largely what is in mind to take account of, with the desire that there may be the corresponding result with us seen in Rebecca at that juncture as affected by the word, "she took the veil, and covered herself".<a name=203:5></a> I think the brethren would readily see that the whole bearing of the Lord's voice at the moment is to detach us from the world and all that is linked with it in view of the apostasy that is coming in, when the world will set up a rival head to Christ.<a name=203:6></a> As the product of the Spirit's faithful service, the assembly will admit of no rival to Christ, and we are to see to it that in our hearts no rival to Christ is in any sense made room for; so that it is very affecting to see how the "I Jesus", the emphatic 'I', Jesus, comes into the passage read (verse 16), and "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star".<a name=203:7></a> There is a sort of awakening appeal in the fresh touch as to the personal glory of Jesus as this book finishes; a book that is very full in regard to history, involving localities, the assembly generally, and involving the world, but the personal appeal to the saints in this verse at the end is very affecting.<a name=203:8></a> It is as if the Lord would understand that there would be an immediate response to this affecting word, and we know that all ministry, rightly speaking according to God, has in mind that Christ personally

		should acquire a place in the affections of the saints, and that there should be a fresh and living response to that Person, and one thing that should be kept in mind, amongst other things, is the way that David comes in, because I think the peculiar way in which David comes into both these passages, refers to what we have already said, that God will permit no rival to Christ.<a name=204:1></a> In the Old Testament God would permit no rival to David.<a name=204:2></a> Every rival to David must go down.<a name=204:3></a> Although the sorrows of the testimony were many in relation to the working out of that great ideal in God's anointed one in David, just as in our time and these last days of the dispensation in the recovery and the revival of the truth there have been many sorrows since the beginning of the recovery, but we can see how Christ comes into the ascendency all the time, with a view to His full place in the affections of the assembly.<a name=204:4></a>

		S.McC.<a name=204:9></a> I think the angel alludes to the peculiar setting of the book, that is, the book being of a judicial character, introduces the thought of distance from beginning to end, but yet in the midst of it all there are these personal touches; while there is the recognition of the distance, there are the personal touches of Christ, such as here and to Philadelphia.<a name=204:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=205:15></a> Yes, what heart-searchings there were in Israel in the arrival at the supremacy of David.<a name=205:16></a> We can see that in the historical books in the Old Testament.<a name=205:17></a> If Christ is to acquire the place of supremacy on the eve of translation that this book shows He desires to have, it must of necessity produce heart-searchings with us, because both the letter to Philadelphia and the portion that we have read, emphasise that we are on the eve of the rapture, "I come quickly" is a special word to Philadelphia amongst the assemblies.<a name=205:18></a>

		and the wonderful results that stand related thereto; just preceding that we get the thought of the sieve, and Israel being shaken in the sieve, yet not the least grain falling to the ground; an abstract allusion that we always have to hold to when we come to that side, but it is making way for the renown of Christ, typified in David and the system that Christ's glory is apprehended in relation to, and especially where the service of God is to have such a choice place.<a name=206:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.H.<a name=206:2></a>S.<a name=206:3></a> What is the thought of "the bright and morning star" in relation to David?<a name=206:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=206:5></a> Well, it is very striking how we get this reference.<a name=206:6></a> We get two references to the morning star in this book, the first to Thyatira, then here, but in this verse we get the addition of the word 'bright' that we do not have in Thyatira.<a name=206:7></a> Thyatira bringing in, as it does, the introduction of a rival head to Christ in the ecclesiastical order and unity publicly where such corruption has set in as evidenced on every hand, it is striking how the morning star comes in in the darkness linked with that corruption, but here it is linked with the thought of what is bright, as if our hearts and minds are to be illumined by Christ coming on to the horizon of our view in this heavenly way.<a name=206:8></a> I think it is detaching, "the bright and morning star" has a detaching effect, drawing us out of the order of things upon which impending judgment is soon to fall, drawing us into that heavenly order of things where Christ is so wondrously supreme.<a name=206:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=207:7></a> Yes, Peter in that way would link on with what we are saying, especially as we think of the allusion that has just been made by Peter before these verses to "the excellent glory" (verse 17), and how Christ is brought on to our view on the holy mount, signalised as He is by the Father's salutation.<a name=207:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=207:12></a> I think so, in fact you would say the appearing is really more prominent here than the rapture, it involves the rapture, but the appearing would be in mind here in full result.<a name=207:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=240:2></a> Well, that is very interesting.<a name=240:3></a> We have a reference to the holiest in the last passage that we read.<a name=240:4></a> It is interesting the dual reference to the holiest in Hebrews.<a name=240:5></a> The holiest is presented as a wilderness thought into which we have access individually, into the presence of God, but it is also presented in a great enlarged setting as in chapter 9, the presence of God, and the vast scene of glory in which Christ is seen so wondrously in it.<a name=240:6></a> So that in chapter 10 we get a very practical bearing of it in relation to our apprehension of Christ.<a name=240:7></a> Earlier the chapter had been referring to His coming into humanity and taking away the first that He might establish the second, then it says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water".<a name=240:8></a> We have been speaking about the exalted thoughts that attach to us in the epistle, now we come to this practical exhortation as to drawing near, that we are to see to these matters in approaching, of a true heart, hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience, and bodies washed with pure water.<a name=240:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=241:3></a> In the second chapter of Ephesians we read how that we have come near, "Ye who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ" (verse 13).<a name=241:4></a> Here in Hebrews, the verse we are looking at, it is "by the blood of Jesus" -- would you say something as to that?<a name=241:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=241:6></a> I thought it was a personal reference that would be particularly calculated to touch our feelings.<a name=241:7></a> In the previous chapter where the official side is seen in relation to the sanctuary, it is constantly "the blood of the Christ", that anointed One, the great divine Operator, but when you come to boldness for approach and encouraging us to draw near, it is the "blood of Jesus", and then it is "through the veil".<a name=241:8></a> It is not the rent veil as we notice, it is an allusion to the humanity of Jesus and how it has become instrumental in this matter of our drawing near, and then he added a thought "having a great priest over the house of God".<a name=241:9></a> Everything is conducive to our drawing near in keeping with what divine Persons have done.<a name=241:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=241:14></a> I think so, that is what we were referring to as touching the spiritual emotions and feelings.<a name=241:15></a> Then "the new and living way" links on with the way into the full apprehension and contemplation of the Lord's glory in relation to His new name, with which the service of God and the minister of the sanctuary have a peculiar link.<a name=241:16></a>

		S.McC.<a name=243:1></a> We are considering together the subject of the glory of Christ as it is intended to affect us, especially on the eve of translation as reference was made to the words of Rebecca to the servant, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us?<a name=243:2></a> And the servant said, That is my master!<a name=243:3></a> Then she took the veil and covered herself", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:65">Genesis  24:65</a>.<a name=243:4></a> I think the Spirit of God would help us to understand more and more what that means, the veil to cover herself, and these passages have been suggested for consideration this morning because of the way in which they advance on our view the glory of Christ, particularly bearing on His headship.<a name=243:5></a> The mystery of iniquity is working already in view of the great apostasy when the world will set up a rival head to Christ.<a name=243:6></a> The apostasy will fully set in when that head is set up.<a name=243:7></a> It is the great object of the enemy to produce a rival to Christ, and he operates in the world with this in mind, and he operates in the assembly too insidiously all the time, affecting the public body as he has, so that we find a rival head even in that which bears the name of God publicly, and therefore the need of coming under the Spirit's power and influence so that we should be delivered from the influence of every head that is rival to Christ.<a name=243:8></a> The unnamed woman in the ending of the synoptic gospels by her act at the end of the pathway of Christ, makes clear where she stands, so I think in the assembly at the present moment there is to be a clear sense of where we stand in relation to Christ, over against all that is operating to move athwart the great thoughts and rights of God.<a name=243:9></a> Matthew and

		Mark and the unnamed woman in Simon the leper's house, would link with the public position, but in John's gospel Mary comes in a little bit earlier, we might say, from one point of view, and she is named.<a name=244:1></a> She anoints the Lord and she names Him, and it makes way for the wonderful opening up of the thoughts of the economy of love, and the divine arrangement into which divine Persons have come.<a name=244:2></a> I think the Spirit's ministry in all these scriptures would have in mind the building up of our souls in the knowledge of Christ's glory so that we become more and more practically detached.<a name=244:3></a> We have been using the word 'detached' a lot, and the Spirit has in mind, on the eve of translation, that we should be more and more detached from everything around us, and detached from the features of the man of sin and shame in our own hearts, and there is only one way in which that detachment effectively comes about, and that is through the advancement of Christ's glory in our souls.<a name=244:4></a>

		So that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>we have Christ's headship alluded to uniquely in relation to the race.<a name=244:5></a> Christ's headship in connection with man, over against Adam who was the federal head of the human race, but who fell through sin.<a name=244:6></a> Christ is brought on to our view as the Head of the race according to the truth of the glad tidings in which God's thoughts and blessings for men are presented, so that it is Christ's headship on moral lines in relation to the sin question, delivering us and detaching us from lawlessness and independency.<a name=244:7></a> In Colossians, where we have the glory of Christ advanced on our view, it is the personal glory of Christ and His headship, standing related to the assembly, His body.<a name=244:8></a> If we are not basically affected by this in the truth of the gospel and our foundations are not right in regard to it, we shall never be right in the assembly.<a name=244:9></a> In Romans the kingdom must have its way in authority in the teaching in our souls,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in Ephesians, Christ's glory and greatness are advanced on our view, more on official lines as the great Head over all things to the assembly.<a name=245:3></a> The vast system of things upon which His headship bears, is before us, God having in mind earlier (the verses we did not read) "to head up all things in the Christ" (verse 10), and then the assembly sharing in that headship in such a unique way as by Him, like the queen, in gold of Ophir, by the side of the king in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=245:4></a> I thought we might get help in relation to these thoughts; there is much detail in these passages that we have read that we shall not have time to dwell upon, but if we keep to these main thoughts we may get help.<a name=245:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=252:8></a> I am sure it would because it is important that we carry with us all the time the spirit of the glad tidings, and that the truth of the glad tidings is constantly present in a detaching and delivering effect.<a name=252:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=252:10></a>S.<a name=252:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, Peter says, "God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (verse 36), that raises the question, does it not, "What shall we do, brethren?<a name=252:12></a>" and they accept detachment in the fullest way, and Peter goes on "ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (verse 38)?<a name=252:13></a> Is this attachment to Christ that you are speaking of, effectual now by this?<a name=252:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=252:15></a> I think so, and we want to see the importance of this attachment to Christ that <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>has in mind, Christ as the divinely appointed Head, who has taken up all the liabilities of man, of the race, and discharged them to the glory of God, and as the One in whom everything is presented for men, and not only our attachment to Him, but there is also the thought of contact with Him.<a name=252:16></a> We did not read the verse, but "For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in the power of his life" (verse 10).<a name=252:17></a> That means that practical contact by the Spirit with Christ in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=253:8></a> I think it does, that is just what we are seeking to get at, that we all need to see the importance of our foundations, according to the truth of the glad tidings.<a name=253:9></a> It is a question not only of being detached from the world, but being detached from ourselves and the man of sin and shame linked with ourselves.<a name=253:10></a> If the detachment is complete then there will not be much difficulty, do you think?<a name=253:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=253:12></a> In our assembly life together, does the education go on as to the practical change of man?<a name=253:13></a> I was struck with the way the apostle refers to Jesus Christ constantly in the first letter to the Corinthians particularly.<a name=253:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=254:2></a> Well, I think that all helps to see that detachment is in mind.<a name=254:3></a> The brethren may think we are using this word 'detachment' too much, but I am sure the more it is considered, the more we will see the importance of it, our complete detachment from the world and from the first man.<a name=254:4></a> Eternal life alludes to an order of things that is out of the world, morally and spiritually, and it is always presented in Paul's ministry as an objective to be reached, and the truth of the glad tidings puts us on the way to it.<a name=254:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=254:6></a> Does John the baptist, in the first chapter of John's gospel, shine out in that connection?<a name=254:7></a> He says, "Behold, the Lamb of God" (verse 36), and two disciples are detached from John and attracted to Christ?<a name=254:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=254:9></a> Well, you can see how completely John was detached from himself, and from Jerusalem with all its traditional and powerful influence that it had.<a name=254:10></a> How completely he was detached from it in the light of Christ's glory, Christ having eclipsed in his mind and his soul, every other man, and a true minister, like John the baptist, for he is a model in John's gospel, his ministry will always lead that way.<a name=254:11></a> If a ministry attracts itself to the minister in the sense of personality according to the flesh, results will be disastrous, for all true ministry must detach from man according to the flesh and link us with Christ.<a name=254:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=271:3></a> In Colossians, as you will have observed, in the first chapter it is used almost as a title of Deity, a title of God, a remarkable way in which it is put, and here we get the thought of the Godhead which we do not have in the first chapter.<a name=271:4></a> There it is bracketed, that is, it is added to give the force, but here it is, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=271:5></a> I think it should greatly impress us with the Person of Christ because in this 9th verse in chapter 2 it is not exactly mediatorial, that is it involves what Christ is, Christ is God, and Deity is presented in Christ, it comes on to our view in Christ, and this word 'fulness' carries us beyond what is arbitrary.<a name=271:6></a> It brings us to the great thought of what God is essentially as He has come out to be known by creature mind, in so far as creature mind and capacity can take in the thoughts of Himself.<a name=271:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=271:11></a> It does, it is a wonderful thing to take account of it herein that sense 'bodily'.<a name=271:12></a> The addition of the word 'bodily' brings on to our view the Lord's humanity in its present glorious state, and how God, or the Deity, is apprehended in a Man and will be so apprehended eternally.<a name=271:13></a> That is, as has often been alluded to, the eternal subsisting state between God and man lies in a Man.<a name=271:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=272:16></a> That is it.<a name=272:17></a> How remarkable the two sides are in that sense, the completeness of what is to be known of God towards us in this glorious Person, and then the completeness on our side in Him toward God, "ye are complete in him".<a name=272:18></a> There would be a kind of a link with what we were referring to, the Lord's renown in the mediatorial position in "my new name".<a name=272:19></a>

		S.McC.<a name=285:1></a> In referring to the glory of Christ, it seems fitting that John's gospel should come into our minds before we finish this series of meetings.<a name=285:2></a> John's gospel was written in view of the last days and contemplates degeneration in relation to the truth.<a name=285:3></a> The Person of Christ is thus peculiarly presented in the gospel as an off-set to the conditions of the last days, and especially in view of detaching us in our affections from an order of things that incurs divine displeasure, for the Jewish side is very prominent in John's gospel.<a name=285:4></a> I suppose religious flesh is the worst character of flesh that Scripture calls attention to; and therefore the bearing of the teaching in John's gospel is always on the way out of the world, and we see how persons are detached in John's gospel as the Person of Christ and His glory comes on to their view.<a name=285:5></a> From chapter 1 right through the gospel we see persons who leave one order of things and come into the order of things that is linked with the Son of God.<a name=285:6></a> Some are cast out as we see in chapter 9, because of the way they were affected by the glory of this Person who served them, and I have no doubt that that operates today too.<a name=285:7></a> We begin with the section we read in the first chapter which calls attention to the Lord Jesus Christ in the love position, and all these sections that we have read speak of the Son of God in that love position, the position of affection.<a name=285:8></a> We were remarking at the beginning, that in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>we are in the presence of one divine Person speaking to Another, along with the assembly, and saying to the Lord Jesus "Come".<a name=285:9></a> It is particularly affecting that in this gospel there should be brought on to our view

		S.McC.<a name=291:6></a> It is, indeed.<a name=291:7></a> As you would know, the word 'bosom' in the original conveys the thought of a receptacle, that is the word carries the thought of receiving, and the preposition 'in', "who is <i>in</i>", is "eis", which, in the original, has the force of 'motion towards'.<a name=291:8></a> The reciprocity in the verse, the mutual relations conveyed in the verse, is thus very affecting.<a name=291:9></a> It is not only that the Lord Jesus moved into that place in coming into manhood, but that the Father's affections received Him.<a name=291:10></a> Think of the joy of God in this paternal relation, receiving Christ in humanity in this wonderful place of affection.<a name=291:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=299:2></a> I think it does.<a name=299:3></a> So that you can understand in the light of what F.<a name=299:4></a>E.<a name=299:5></a>R.<a name=299:6></a> said, that John saw what Paul never saw, how his gospel would take colour from that, bearing in mind that the Spirit is inspiring the holy record.<a name=299:7></a> John is writing under the influence of the Spirit, but you can see his gospel would take character from that, that he saw what Paul never saw, that is saints in revival standing in the truth of the assembly as Philadelphia contemplates, and his gospel would have that in mind all the way through.<a name=299:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.C.<a name=299:9></a>M.<a name=299:10></a> Does Philadelphia in that way stand for the very best in the way of quality and spiritual refinement?<a name=299:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=299:12></a> That is it, and that is why quality is stressed in John's gospel, the quality of the relations between the Father and the Son, and the Spirit, moved on to our view, and then the quality of the worship, and the worshippers, "the Father seeks such as his worshippers".<a name=299:13></a> It is the quality of the worshippers -- "the Father seeks <i>such</i>".<a name=299:14></a>

		H.A.<a name=299:15></a>H.<a name=299:16></a> Is the extension of lovability seen?<a name=299:17></a> Whilst specifically in the Son, is it seen in Philadelphian conditions, the lovability that can be entrusted with administration?<a name=299:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=299:19></a> Well, that is what is in mind.<a name=299:20></a> Philadelphia means brotherly love, so that really it is a love letter that we have in the word to Philadelphia, the Lord is so pleased with what He sees there as the assembly comes under His eye in the features that stand out, and it is all linked with the quality of the love that John is referring to in his gospel.<a name=299:21></a> That brings us to chapter 5, where the word 'love' is different from the word 'love' in chapter 3.<a name=299:22></a> In chapter 3 "The Father loves the Son", the word 'love' is 'agapao' -- the word of settled disposition,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=300>[Page 300]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but the word in chapter 5: 20, is 'phileo' -- the love of attractiveness, the love of friendship, and you get that in Philadelphia.<a name=300:1></a> It is not only the thought of the settled disposition of love, but the attractive features that draw out the love of Christ in Philadelphia.<a name=300:2></a> This has in mind the operational side here.<a name=300:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=300:4></a>B.<a name=300:5></a> Why does it go on to quickening in that setting?<a name=300:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=300:7></a> I think it is very important because we can never be rightly in the service of God apart from quickening.<a name=300:8></a> Quickening involves the divine operation by which we are affected subjectively and brought into correspondence with Christ.<a name=300:9></a> It is not a question of what we know, it is not a question of what faith can take in, quickening is never viewed by faith, quickening is by the Spirit.<a name=300:10></a> It is how the believer through the sovereign divine operation in him is put subjectively into correspondence with Christ.<a name=300:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.C.<a name=300:12></a>M.<a name=300:13></a> Mr.<a name=300:14></a> Raven's remark as to quickening helps in that connection, the quickening power of God fits me in sensibilities to live in the closest relationship with God.<a name=300:15></a> Is that not in mind, the relationship in John, and quickening essential to it?<a name=300:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=300:17></a> So that the quickening helps us to be at home in all the refinement and quality that is seen in the relations of the Father and the Son, "For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does"; that is very affecting, that One divine Person should come into a position where He is shown things because the Father loves Him in relation to the great operations that are at hand.<a name=300:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=300:22></a> I think so in its bearing, but we need to be sustained in the gain of it, do you not think?<a name=300:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=300:24></a>D.<a name=300:25></a> I was wondering whether this word 'constitutional' would mean a great deal more than Lord's day morning.<a name=300:26></a>

		E.B.<a name=301:5></a>S.<a name=301:6></a> Would you say another word on the Father <i>giving</i> these things to the Son, and "all things" in chapter 3, and "all judgment" in chapter 5?<a name=301:7></a> He <i>has</i> given, it says, in both cases.<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=301:9></a> It is helpful to see this here now that you have referred to it, because we were referring to certain limitations in connection with the Son that He did not know, as He says, in a certain relation, not even the Son knows.<a name=301:10></a> Now we come to certain limitations linked with the Father.<a name=301:11></a> It is a remarkable thing and it should help those that think that the thought of the Father covers everything because it does not.<a name=301:12></a> The thought of the Father is a limited thought, as it says here, "for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son", that is, the Father does not judge any one.<a name=301:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=303:16></a> Well, it does, because it involves unjealous relations, and we do not need to draw away from this matter of unjealous relations, because we know that naturally in our hearts, there is a good deal of jealousy, and it has to be judged and kept where it belongs.<a name=303:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In thinking over, dear brethren, what we had before us this afternoon, this passage came into my mind, there being an obvious link in the fact that in chapter 2, as we were having, we have the Lord presented to us as the Leader of our salvation, and here He is presented as "the leader and completer of faith".<a name=305:2></a> It is very affecting that we have the light that God is bringing many sons to glory.<a name=305:3></a> I suppose glory is the full shining out of God in His blessedness, and the perfect answer to it on the part of men in sonship, and that is what God is bringing us to, and Christ is Himself the Leader of our salvation, the One who has in His own Person in Manhood set the matter on, and is now the full expression in glorious manhood in sonship in the presence of God of that which we are to be brought to.<a name=305:4></a> Indeed, it will even extend to complete conformity to His body of glory.<a name=305:5></a> The pattern is there already in the presence of God in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ in glorious conditions, and we are all called with a heavenly calling to this glorious end of sons brought to glory.<a name=305:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the writer of the epistle speaks in this chapter of the cloud of witnesses surrounding us, witnesses to the great principle of walking by faith not by sight.<a name=305:7></a> I believe there is nothing more important for us in one sense than to recognise that we are to be governed by faith, and when I say faith, I am
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=306>[Page 306]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not speaking simply of confidence in God, which is an element really of piety, but of faith, that is, having unseen things before the soul.<a name=306:1></a> It says in Corinthians that the inward man, even though the outward is perishing, is renewed day by day on the principle of our looking not at seen things but at unseen things, and if that is the desire of our hearts, the bent of our minds, then I believe we can count on the help of the Spirit.<a name=306:2></a> The Spirit will link Himself with faith in the saints.<a name=306:3></a> On the other hand, if we are spending our time looking at seen things we shall place a great obstacle in the way of the help which the Spirit would afford us.<a name=306:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so here we are encouraged to lay aside every weight "and sin which so easily entangles us".<a name=306:5></a> Each one, I suppose, as desiring to go on with God, discovers the kind of thing that is a weight or hindrance, or that tends to be an entanglement.<a name=306:6></a> These things are to be laid aside.<a name=306:7></a> It is important that we should be concerned to do so, that we should have energy to do so.<a name=306:8></a> Abraham had energy to scare away certain birds.<a name=306:9></a> We are all to show energy in divine things, and the Spirit of God will help, and the grace of the Lord will help where there is the evidence of desire and energy on the part of the saints.<a name=306:10></a> So we are to lay aside "every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us", and, it says, to "run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking steadfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith".<a name=306:11></a> He has led in this way, the path of faith, a path through this world, governed by the light of unseen things, and He has completed the course.<a name=306:12></a> He is the Completer of faith, and He is set down, it says, "at the right hand of the throne of God".<a name=306:13></a> So that there is every encouragement in looking steadfastly on Jesus.<a name=306:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were thinking this afternoon of it being befitting to God "for whom are all things, and by whom are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=307>[Page 307]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings".<a name=307:1></a> It is a most touching thing, sufferings are incidental to the path of faith of the believer, but the Leader of our salvation has been perfected, that is, has arrived at the full thought in which our salvation is set forth in Him, through sufferings.<a name=307:2></a> Wonderful grace indeed that the Lord should go through on that principle, not avoiding suffering.<a name=307:3></a> It says sufferings, in the plural, not simply suffering as a general principle, though that holds good, but the detail of the sufferings.<a name=307:4></a> How much entered into it!<a name=307:5></a> I suppose the Lord was conscious of suffering in His spirit and in other ways all through His path of testimony here, but when it came to the last few days and the last few hours, how much was concentrated in that period!<a name=307:6></a> But He went through, it says, "who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame".<a name=307:7></a> How we all shrink from shame, we all shrink from reproach.<a name=307:8></a> I do not suppose there is anyone who does not.<a name=307:9></a> At the same time the Lord is presented to us, not as shrinking from it, but as enduring the cross and despising the shame.<a name=307:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so we find that the writer of the epistle brings in then the thought of the dealings of God with His sons.<a name=307:11></a> What an encouragement that is, dear brethren.<a name=307:12></a> There is such a thing as the Father's chastening, there is even such a thing as the Father's scourging, which is more severe, at the same time all comes from a Father's hand, and all is because sonship is in view for us, and because the pattern of what God is bringing His sons to is already before Him in its glorious completeness in Christ.<a name=307:13></a> Let us then keep it before <i>us</i>.<a name=307:14></a> That is what God is bringing us to, full conformity to Christ, morally at the present time, and when the work in our souls is completed, then conformity to Christ in His body of glory.<a name=307:15></a> But the most important
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=308>[Page 308]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thing, of course, is conformity to Christ morally which the Father of spirits is operating in view of in each one of us.<a name=308:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the writer says that we are to consider well: "consider well" -- as though he would detain us on the point, not just a fleeting passing view, "consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds".<a name=308:2></a> What an important matter the mind is, dear brethren; how easily we may allow in our minds unbelieving thoughts or discouraging thoughts, but he says "that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds".<a name=308:3></a> The great point is that the mind should be held in the right direction.<a name=308:4></a> And so it says, "looking steadfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith".<a name=308:5></a> Not only the detail of the path of faith in all its testings and all that calls for endurance passed through by Him, but glorious completeness apprehended in Himself as set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<a name=308:6></a> And so it says we are to "consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself", and then further, "Ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves he chastens".<a name=308:7></a> How encouraging all this is, dear brethren.<a name=308:8></a> It is a question of love, and of the pleasure of God.<a name=308:9></a> It says, "it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory".<a name=308:10></a> It is a question of the delight that God contemplates in having us all before Him in the glorious liberty of sonship and in the glory attaching to it rightly as already set forth in Christ.<a name=308:11></a> There can be no greater glory for us to contemplate than the final climax of that to which we have been called and to which we are being brought, and this is the time of formation.<a name=308:12></a> How much there is to form

		Well, beloved brethren, there is plenty of pressure today, pressure in the individual circumstances of the saints, pressure too in assembly matters, but all these things under the hand of the Father, are ordered and controlled by Him in perfect skill.<a name=309:12></a> There is, as we have had pointed out to us many times, such a

		I have today received a fresh impression of sufferings, based on the verses we have read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>, and I would just record this brief impression amongst the brethren, as referring to these scriptures.<a name=311:2></a> First of all in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>, according to the type, the Spirit is given to us on the basis of the sufferings of Christ.<a name=311:3></a> We are well acquainted with the other rock in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>, a high rock, speaking of Christ in His exaltation and glory, and the necessity only of speaking to that rock that it may give its water, but it does us good to remember this earlier reference.<a name=311:4></a> We may often forget it, that is, the Spirit given to us on the basis of Christ being smitten.<a name=311:5></a> As to the figures which the scripture uses, this would involve what is inscrutable, because God Himself was there.<a name=311:6></a> He tells Moses what he is to do, taking with him some elders who were to see and to take experience by what was happening, and taking the rod; then God says, "I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb".<a name=311:7></a> That is, whether it be in Christ, or whether it be in the Spirit, God Himself is there, fully identified with the coming in of the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit, God fully there in Christ, God fully there in the Spirit.<a name=311:8></a> If we should ask ourselves, Does this mean then that God Himself has entered into the suffering such as the smiting signifies?<a name=311:9></a> Indeed it is so, and Scripture helps to hold the thought right in saying, "Now the rock was the Christ".<a name=311:10></a> And this makes this particular incident a very touching one to us, that we should receive the Spirit on such a basis, that Christ has suffered and died, "Christ once humbled here".<a name=311:11></a> The grace of it is magnified, too, when we think what called it forth

		there was murmuring and refusal, the refusal of divine authority in lordship as represented in Moses.<a name=312:1></a> But God does not strike the people.<a name=312:2></a> Somebody had to be smitten, somebody had to suffer if God was to go on with the people, and He meets it all in surpassing grace, not only in the actual smiting of the rock but in the giving of the Spirit.<a name=312:3></a> The words Massah, and Meribah merit our contemplation and our deep pondering, for we may come to the conclusion that God has many times met our own contention and our own quarrelling by means of reminding us of the One who suffered even unto death that we might have the Spirit.<a name=312:4></a>

		And then I thought of the anointing oil in chapter 30, and the contents of it, as it says when God is approaching this great matter of the hallowing by the anointing, "Take best spices -- of liquid myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon the half -- two hundred and fifty, and of sweet myrtle two hundred and fifty, and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin".<a name=312:5></a> It was wonderful that Moses should receive an instruction of that kind.<a name=312:6></a> He had not yet come down the mountain, this was still all light for him, light from the direct presence of God which he was to pass on presently to the people, but it must have struck him as it would ourselves, knowing the general scope of Scripture, that the myrrh, the liquid myrrh being the first ingredient and being a not inconsiderable part of the composition of that holy ointment, would mean that suffering was in view, anointing in view of suffering is to be included in that holy composition.<a name=312:7></a> It is true that fragrance is there, myrtle and cinnamon and cassia, and the myrrh itself, there was always something of the sweet fragrance which the Spirit brings, and every time, we might say, the Spirit is presented as anointing, and every time we are conscious that anointed persons or a part of the anointed system is

		before us, occupying us, we shall be conscious of fragrance.<a name=313:1></a> It is to be noted too that these are spices.<a name=313:2></a> They are not minerals, they are not rocks ground to powder and mixed, they are spices; that is to say, they are a part of the growth which God Himself has ordered, they come straight from God.<a name=313:3></a> So, dear brethren, in what occupies us in our place in the wilderness and in the testimony, and in what our brother has just been speaking to us about, our part in chastening and all that comes with it, there is to be a compensating help and sweetness from the Spirit.<a name=313:4></a> That is, that the Spirit especially needed in times of suffering and times of pressure, is first, we might say, before our minds as in connection with suffering itself.<a name=313:5></a> The myrrh is mentioned first.<a name=313:6></a> We shall remember a woman who brought a box of myrrh and lavished it on the Lord, we shall remember the occasions in the Song of Songs where myrrh, and liquid myrrh, is mentioned, principally in settings which show that there is suffering and pressure.<a name=313:7></a> I think we are just to be encouraged at this present time that the Holy Spirit Himself as the anointing enters in for our help in all these times of testing for the saints.<a name=313:8></a> The whole of the tabernacle system was to be anointed, the persons, as in Aaron and his sons, and the whole system, so that whether taken down or re-erected, every part of the pathway, involving much suffering, in what Moses called this "waste howling wilderness", every feature of testing was to be accompanied by some precious detail of the help and power of the Spirit.<a name=313:9></a> I believe that the Holy Spirit Himself would enter into this and would encourage us.<a name=313:10></a> Peter tells us, "If ye are reproached in the name of Christ, blessed are ye; for the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you".<a name=313:11></a> If any suffer in the name of Christ, not on account of it exactly, but if we are in that position to which the name of Christ attaches, the Spirit has a particular

	<div class="paragraph">
		interest; not only in the whole assembly system, we might say, but in every person who is pressed "as a Christian" in regard of the truth in this time of travail and pilgrimage.<a name=314:1></a> So, dear brethren, without saying more, may I just leave this impression?<a name=314:2></a> It is very wonderful, at least to my soul, that, according to the figures used, Christ should enter into suffering that we might have the Spirit, and in what accompanies the composition of the anointing oil, speaking of the Spirit Himself, there is suffering also attached.<a name=314:3></a> This will help us in view of finishing our journey, and finishing it according to God.<a name=314:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An example of this, I believe, would be in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, when our dear brethren were suffering and their backs were beaten, yet they were soon praising, "in praying, were praising God".<a name=314:5></a> There was a change.<a name=314:6></a> One is always looking for changes amongst the people of God, specially amongst the young people, and amongst those too who have gone out of the way, in fact, with all of us, that we may come more and more to God's own way and God's own thoughts, beautifully exemplified in these two, Paul and Silas, in praying.<a name=314:7></a> I dare say in praying they were accepting the suffering and full of desire in regard of the will of God.<a name=314:8></a> We cannot tell, but that it should be turned into praise shows that there was another power there, a power which did not arise from Paul and Silas naturally, but which arose, I believe, from the Spirit with them; the sufferings of Christ were exemplified there, although, of course, only in small measure, but the Spirit identified Himself with these suffering men.<a name=314:9></a> Some of our brethren are suffering in many ways, we need not detail them, but there is a resource, a rich outlet in this divine provision.<a name=314:10></a> Some of the things in the tabernacle economy had to be beaten.<a name=314:11></a> We are to think of it morally, gold had to be beaten, for instance, beaten out very thin, for the ephod of the high priest, gold beaten out and cut

		into very thin lacings.<a name=315:1></a> God could not use anything that was not beaten, He could not use an ingot of gold, however precious, it must be beaten.<a name=315:2></a> That refers to what is beaten out in the saints in their grasp of the truth, the truth of the Person of Christ, for instance.<a name=315:3></a> The oil had to be beaten.<a name=315:4></a> Moses' instructions were to bring pure, beaten olive oil for the light; <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#24:5">Leviticus  24:5</a>.<a name=315:5></a> The testimony may not shine much in some of our localities perhaps, because of the lack of this feature of beating in us.<a name=315:6></a> It refers to our bringing what has passed through deep exercise.<a name=315:7></a> And the incense -- some of it was beaten and put before the testimony in the tabernacle.<a name=315:8></a> The more it was beaten the more the fragrance would come out.<a name=315:9></a> Perhaps these things may be applied, dear brethren, to Paul and Silas, and others, who in a way are suffering at the present time.<a name=315:10></a> There is more to be got out of them in such adversity than there is in the time of prosperity.<a name=315:11></a> Scripture speaks of the time of adversity (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#7:14">Ecclesiastes  7:14</a>), there is wealth and gain from that.<a name=315:12></a> Job speaks of the <i>cold</i> from the north, and <i>gold</i> from the north.<a name=315:13></a> There is some affinity, it would seem.<a name=315:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These things I would desire to leave with us, practical impressions for our minds in regard of Christ, and our prayers, and impressions in regard of the Spirit.<a name=315:15></a> We might perhaps value the Spirit more than we have done.<a name=315:16></a> He is the best Friend we have on earth, as we have been constantly reminded.<a name=315:17></a> As one servant of the Lord said, 'How are you treating such a Guest?<a name=315:18></a>' All these thoughts arise in our minds, so that if there comes any occasion for actual literal suffering it may be to our gain, and prayer turned into praise.<a name=315:19></a> May the Lord just help us in these impressions for His name's sake.<a name=315:20></a>

		Just a thought, beloved, that has come to me while we have been together, particularly from the meeting we had this morning, where the great thought of <i>the</i> Spirit was brought before us.<a name=316:2></a> One has noticed that in this epistle to the Galatians every time the Spirit is alluded to, with the exception of one, He is spoken of as "<i>the</i> Spirit".<a name=316:3></a> What came to one's mind in this is the importance of what we are sowing to, whether we are sowing to the flesh, or sowing to the Spirit, because whatever we are sowing to the crop that we shall have will be on that line.<a name=316:4></a> The great point here is, "he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life".<a name=316:5></a> What results there will be from the Spirit Himself as the result of sowing to the Spirit!<a name=316:6></a> One would desire that we might all be marked by this feature more and more, dear brethren, of sowing to the Spirit, so that "<i>from the Spirit</i>" we "shall reap eternal life".<a name=316:7></a> God's great thought is that we should all be in the present enjoyment of eternal life, in a living system of things that we have had before us today, and the great point here is, that if we are to be in the enjoyment of that, we must heed the importance of sowing to the Spirit, and then it says, "<i>from the Spirit</i> shall reap eternal life".<a name=316:8></a> What a place the Spirit has in the great economy of God!<a name=316:9></a>

		The brethren will immediately see the prime importance of this great matter of the Spirit, for the lawgiver typifies Christ, Abraham typifies the Father, God in His parental interest in the wonderful relation of Father, and Hegai brings on to our view the great personal interest of the Spirit Himself in the care and protection of what is to be for God and for Christ and for the testimony in a scene where the enemy's power is known and felt.<a name=320:2></a> I am sure that if we consider these thoughts carefully we shall see the necessity of knowing the Spirit better and for making greater room for Him, of entering into the blessedness more of communion with Him.<a name=320:3></a> It is important that our acquaintance with the Spirit should grow.<a name=320:4></a> You will remember how the Lord Jesus brought in the word in the way of solace and comfort to hearts that were disconcerted as they contemplated being bereft of His presence, He said He would send another Comforter.<a name=320:5></a> He referred to Him as One whom the world neither knows nor sees, but "ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>.<a name=320:6></a> The Spirit is thus a Person to be known and to be acquainted with as taking the place of Christ here in the assembly at the present moment, Christ having died out of this world and gone into heaven at the right hand of God.<a name=320:7></a>

		So I began with <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, where, as a result of the administration of Christ, the Spirit is brought on to our view typically in the well, as a great resource for the believer in the path that in life leads right into the inheritance, into the choiceness of that realm where all is of God in Christ and which God has marked out for those that are the subjects of the counsels of His love before the world was.<a name=322:1></a> What a resource the Spirit is in the well, as typified in its springing up as is contemplated, over against the dark background of Numbers.<a name=322:2></a> The Spirit is viewed in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>in the light of the antitype in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, as the great resource of the believer, as becoming all to the believer until he reaches Christ in relation to Colossians where Christ is everything and in all.<a name=322:3></a> But it is a wonderful thing to take account of this fact in the light of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>in the type, that the Spirit is to be everything to us until we reach that point -- not that He leaves us there, for we shall always need the Spirit, not only now but through all eternity we shall know the blessedness of His indwelling as no other family will in the same manner and degree.<a name=322:4></a> Numbers has in mind this great resource coming to light over against the dark background of the eruptions of the flesh.<a name=322:5></a> The book of Numbers opens to our view the vastness of divine resource, that in a world that is arid and devoid of resource for the believer.<a name=322:6></a> God can furnish that which is adequate to carry him through and maintain him in the most adversative circumstances.<a name=322:7></a> But despite the manifestation of divine provision we have to learn, as it is important we should learn, the incorrigible nature and character of the flesh.<a name=322:8></a> It is a bitter lesson but it is a necessary lesson and an important lesson to learn.<a name=322:9></a> Over against divine interventions, over against the shining of the glory definitely marking out where God is in His sovereign dispositions, in His sovereign selections, we have in

		the midst of it all how the flesh in its incorrigible nature erupts to challenge and question the rights of the God, who in the wealth and abundance of the grace that wrought in our deliverance from Egypt and the power of Pharaoh, has brought us to Himself.<a name=323:1></a> What a God we find in the desert, in the wilderness, over against the flesh and its breaking out, and the marvellous thing in Numbers is that it breaks out and erupts in great and small, in brothers and sisters, in princes, yes -- and I speak soberly and guardedly -- in the great man Moses.<a name=323:2></a> We are reminded thus that we can look for nothing from the flesh, we have to come to it in our souls experimentally that the flesh is enmity against God.<a name=323:3></a> You cannot change it, you cannot improve it, it is incorrigible, unchangeable.<a name=323:4></a> Yet in the midst of all that in this book you get the bright rays of Nazarite devotion, of princely dedication and wealth attached thereto, augmenting the great system in which God is known as in the antitype in the assembly, and in the great thoughts that come out later in the book in the bread of God's offering and the like.<a name=323:5></a> God reminding us, dear brethren, that we must go on despite the adversative circumstances, showing us what God can do despite the circumstances, despite the incorrigibility of the flesh.<a name=323:6></a> But we have to come to it in the light of deliverance in Romans that we are not only delivered from the world as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, viewed as a sin system out of which Christ has died, we are not only delivered from the law as referred to in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, but we are to know the blessedness of deliverance from that incorrigible state that is linked with the flesh, so that the believer, according to the truth of the glad tidings, as he reaches deliverance in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, is able to take account of himself as no longer in the flesh but in the Spirit, as God's Spirit dwells in him or her.<a name=323:7></a> How wonderful that is, and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>has in mind that, prefaced by the great thought of

	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to refer to the spirit of the bondman, having in mind the different ways in which it acts and reacts upon the people of God.<a name=376:1></a> It is important that in a selfish age, such as we are in, where all are seeking their own things and not the things of Jesus Christ, we should come under the influence of the Lord Jesus in regard to this spirit of bondmanship.<a name=376:2></a> And I have read the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>to begin with the Lord Himself.<a name=376:3></a> He wants to help the disciples by way of the model or example He has given, and we are all to be helped by this way.<a name=376:4></a> Our Lord is the Model in many things.<a name=376:5></a> Peter tells us of the model that He has left for us in regard to suffering, so that we should follow in His steps.<a name=376:6></a> Many of us shirk suffering but the Lord went to all the pains of leaving us a model that we should follow in His steps.<a name=376:7></a> A model involves a good deal of expenditure, and a good deal of care and forethought, and a good deal of energy and labour.<a name=376:8></a> And the Lord has undertaken all this, so that we might be fully furnished with that which we can follow in Himself, follow in His steps.<a name=376:9></a> And so in regard to the great thought of bondmanship, we have an example and a model in the Lord Himself.<a name=376:10></a> It is inscrutable to the human mind to think that One who had co-equal, co-eternal part in Deity with the Father and the Spirit, should not only come into the condition of humanity, in the marvellous stoop in grace that He took, but that He should take on what is more, the form of a bondman.<a name=376:11></a> Because bondman's form is not proper to man, ordinarily, normally; it is an additional thought.<a name=376:12></a> And the
