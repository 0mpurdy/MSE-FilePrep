		THE GLORY AND PRINCIPLES OF DIVINE ADMINISTRATION IN THE ASSEMBLY

		S.McC.<a name=1:1></a> The thought in mind in suggesting these passages as a basis for an inquiry in relation to the truth, is the thought of glory in relation to divine administration.<a name=1:2></a> We have, in the passages that we have read, remarkable allusions to glory, especially as entering into administrative functions and bearing on an administrative environment.<a name=1:3></a> In view of the apparent deterioration in administration on every hand and among the nations, it is important that we should understand the positive features linked with divine administration.<a name=1:4></a> Matthew is the great administrative gospel, and the assembly is presented in it in a very dignified and glorious way in relation to this subject of divine administration.<a name=1:5></a> Divine Persons delight, in the presence of the deterioration linked with man's administration, to draw our attention to, and link our thoughts with, the glory of divine administration, especially in regard to the positive features that are linked with it and what it brings in.<a name=1:6></a> Very often, perhaps, we have tended to allow the preponderance in our minds of administration as bearing on the repression of evil, without sufficiently seeing that divine administration, and the working out of it in its glory, involves the introduction of positive thoughts of blessing.<a name=1:7></a> There is a radiancy in divine administration, with which there is linked the representation of God; and every one of us, as having part in divine administration, should be marked by the right representation of Him who is the source of all administration.<a name=1:8></a> It is suggested that we look at this reference in chapter 16, where the Son of man is referred to, in verse 27, coming "in the glory of his Father," a remarkable allusion to
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ; and then, in chapter 17, the overshadowing cloud, alluding to the excellent glory (as the marginal reference would suggest); and then the allusion in chapter 25, in the time of the sessional judgment, to the great thought of the Son of man coming in His glory; the reference to "his throne of glory," all bearing upon the administrative position.<a name=2:1></a> As the brethren will note, in chapter 25 it is a question of executive administration, especially working out in relation to the protection of the people of God.<a name=2:2></a> I thought we might get help in considering these features of glory, as set out in this gospel, which brings administration so much before us.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.E.<a name=2:4></a>E.<a name=2:5></a> Would the glory of the administration of the assembly lie in the reflection of divine Persons in it?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:7></a> Yes, God would be rightly represented in all administration working out in the assembly.<a name=2:8></a> The Lord makes a remarkable allusion to the assembly in this chapter; "my assembly.<a name=2:9></a>" How much the Lord makes of the assembly!<a name=2:10></a> The way He speaks of it as "my assembly," and "hades' gates shall not prevail against it," an allusion, I suppose, to the administrative side in connection with what is evil.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=2:12></a>H.<a name=2:13></a> What you have said would be confirmed in the great issue in the book of the Revelation; when the cities of the nations fall.<a name=2:14></a> God's answer to it is to bring in His city in holiness and transparency and glory.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:16></a> So that it is said of the holy city that she has the glory of God.<a name=2:17></a> She is marked by that, a vessel that has been formed in relation to divine outshining, and, as having it, capacitated to have her part and place in sharing with Christ in the blest administration of that day.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.B.<a name=2:19></a> Are you suggesting that this administrative vessel, the assembly, is composed of persons who have to be cared for?<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:21></a> That is what Matthew would impress us with, that the saints are great in the eyes of divine

	<div class="paragraph">
		Persons.<a name=3:1></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>impresses us with that, in the working out of the principle of care, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, while we know that prophetically it alludes to the sessional judgment of a future day, yet the principles that enter into the executive administration of that moment are to be understood by us, as rightly conveying what enters into divine administration.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.C.<a name=3:3></a>R.<a name=3:4></a> So that administration is not limited to care meetings, but the care of the saints is basic in that chapter.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:6></a> I think we may have been too limited in our thoughts as to administration.<a name=3:7></a> Think of the glory of it in our dispensation; Christ in heaven and the great system of administration set up in relation to Him there.<a name=3:8></a> He functioning as Man in heaven, and the Spirit in the assembly down here commensurate with the position up there; the great working out of divine administration in the glad tidings in the way the knowledge of God is brought to men.<a name=3:9></a> We need to have our thoughts enlarged as to divine administration.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.J.<a name=3:11></a>M.<a name=3:12></a> In chapter 16 He speaks of the Son of man coming "in the glory of his Father with his angels," and then in chapter 25, "But when the Son of man comes in <i>his</i> glory" -- are those two features that shine in the matter now?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:14></a> I think they do.<a name=3:15></a> "The glory of his Father" is a remarkable expression, and there is something for us to understand and learn as to this reference at this particular juncture; the Father being the great sovereign Ruler of the universe, and the One who is referred to by the Lord Jesus in that great turning point in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.<a name=3:16></a>" That is one of the features of the glory of the Father, that He is not operating in relation to the wise and prudent.<a name=3:17></a> He is operating in relation to the impressionable

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		state among the people of God.<a name=4:1></a> Unsophisticated as the babes are in the ways of human and worldly wisdom, the Father is operating in relation to them, with this great thought of administration in mind.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.O.<a name=4:3></a>L.<a name=4:4></a> The glory of the Father was witnessed in the resurrection of Christ, was it not, according to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>?<a name=4:5></a> He was "raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father.<a name=4:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:7></a> Yes, showing how early the thought of glory enters into the position of the believer in the wilderness.<a name=4:8></a> It is the glory of <i>the</i> Father there, God known in that way.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N.B.<a name=4:10></a>S.<a name=4:11></a> In this reference in verse 27, "For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father," intended to direct the eyes of our hearts to the contemplation of that glory, so that it affects us in our movements here, and enables us to be ready to lose things here, as indicated in the verses earlier?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:13></a> I think so.<a name=4:14></a> Peter had been the subject in relation to a divine movement in the body of the chapter.<a name=4:15></a> The Lord says to Peter, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.<a name=4:16></a>" That is another feature of the Father's glory, His operations in putting an impression upon such as Peter represents.<a name=4:17></a> The great thought of administration is brought into Peter's mind by what the Lord says in regard to the keys of the kingdom and what follows, "whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens.<a name=4:18></a>" The Lord is inculcating into Peter's mind administrative thoughts, yet Peter falls beneath the level of these great thoughts, and the Lord has to rebuke him in the succeeding verses, for Peter would turn the Lord away from the path in which the divine glory would shine, the path of suffering.<a name=4:19></a> Then the Lord introduces this matter of those who want to save their lives, and proceeds to speak of this matter of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Son of man about to come in the glory of His Father.<a name=5:1></a> It seems to have a distinct bearing in relation to what has preceded.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.C.<a name=5:3></a> Is that why He takes them up into a high mountain apart shortly afterwards, and is transfigured before them?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:5></a> Yes.<a name=5:6></a> It would show the elevated side of things that comes into view in this great administrative section; whereas, in man's world, there is the thought of degeneration in administrative functions, just as in Daniel's time there was the deterioration from the head of gold down to what we have in the feet.<a name=5:7></a> The Lord would elevate our thoughts in relation to the great realm and range of divine administration and glory.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.J.<a name=5:9></a>M.<a name=5:10></a> Did Hannah have an instinctive sense of that glory of divine administration in her prayer, which was really a song, the reversal of men's thoughts?<a name=5:11></a> "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy.<a name=5:12></a> To set him among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory," <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:8">1 Samuel  2:8</a>.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:14></a> Very good.<a name=5:15></a> Hannah had a right conception as to divine administration, linked with God's anointed!<a name=5:16></a> She was a woman who was in power in her soul.<a name=5:17></a> Whilst the subject of persecution from her rival Peninnah, she finds herself liberated in her soul, giving expression to the exalted thoughts linked with the glory of divine administration.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=5:19></a>H.<a name=5:20></a> Does it suggest to you that the Lord had confidence in Peter?<a name=5:21></a> I notice He calls him Simon Barjona first, but then He says, "thou <i>art</i> Peter.<a name=5:22></a>" Does it suggest that the Lord had confidence that Peter was going to come into the gain of all that you are saying?<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:24></a> Matthew would keep Peter before us: "first Peter".<a name=5:25></a> We are not to lose sight of the distinctive place that Peter has; but what comes out in the verses immediately preceding those we read, shows what is possible

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with any one of us.<a name=6:1></a> If it was possible with Peter, it is possible with any one of us to fall beneath the level and dignity of divine thoughts in regard to what is going forward.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=6:3></a>H.<a name=6:4></a> You refer, do you, to the Lord calling Peter "Satan" in that matter?<a name=6:5></a> An adversary!<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:7></a> A remarkable expression!<a name=6:8></a> We might have said naturally, Well, was the Lord justified in using such a strong expression at this juncture?<a name=6:9></a> We might say, All that Peter said was, "God be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee.<a name=6:10></a>" But the Lord, turning round, "said to Peter, Get away behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men.<a name=6:11></a>" Peter was seeking to deflect the Lord in relation to the path in which the glory of divine administration would be established and shine out.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=6:13></a>G.<a name=6:14></a> Would Peter's recovery be on the lines of following the Lord, as suggested in the following verses?<a name=6:15></a> "If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.<a name=6:16></a>" Does the pathway of suffering precede this thought of glory?<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:18></a> Well, it does; and I think it involves that we should be <i>unreserved</i> in our committal to things.<a name=6:19></a> Where there are reserves, you never get full enlightenment and full freedom in relation to the glory of divine administration.<a name=6:20></a> We try to save our lives, in whatever way it may be, in regard to things in the world around us -- our businesses, or in the way of religious reputation, or other things.<a name=6:21></a> If we try to save our lives, we shall never get the full gain of what is linked with our part in these great matters we are referring to.<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=6:23></a> Would verse 29 of chapter 11 have a moral bearing upon this?<a name=6:24></a> "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.<a name=6:25></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:26></a> Just so.<a name=6:27></a> The Lord would help us as to our part in this great feature of administration, in which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		divine glory is shining; because we are not to have anything less in our minds, in regard to the working out of administration, than that divine glory is to shine in it; not the glory of men, but <i>the glory of God</i>.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.C.<a name=7:2></a>McK.<a name=7:3></a> That is emphasized in the heavenly city, that you drew attention to, having the glory of God, and her outshining corresponds with that?<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:5></a> And therefore, as to the city having the glory of God, there is the great matter at the present time of the forming processes, through suffering and other means and ways of developing us substantially, in relation to that great thought.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.J.<a name=7:7></a>G.<a name=7:8></a> Would you say a word in relation to the scripture in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:23">Revelation  21:23</a>?<a name=7:9></a> "The glory of God has enlightened it" (that is, the city), "and the lamp thereof is the Lamb.<a name=7:10></a>" Why are those two thoughts put together?<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:12></a> I think it suggests that where divine administration is working out, you will find enlightenment among the brethren.<a name=7:13></a> Where divine administration is interfered with, you get darkening and bondage -- engendering elements, which do not set the saints free.<a name=7:14></a> "The glory of God has enlightened it.<a name=7:15></a>" It is a remarkable sphere and environment, where the gates are open and not shut, and where there are the remarkable resources for meeting whatever need there might be.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=7:17></a>H.<a name=7:18></a> Would the word in Galatians be in keeping with that?<a name=7:19></a> It says, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:26">Galatians  4:26</a>.<a name=7:20></a> Is that one feature of the glory shining out in the assembly?<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:22></a> That is what I thought <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>would teach us; the great matter of sonship.<a name=7:23></a> Preceding the functioning chapter (chapter 18), the liberty and dignity of sonship, in Christ and in the saints, is brought into chapter 17.<a name=7:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.C.<a name=7:25></a>McK.<a name=7:26></a> It says in chapter 16: 27, "the glory of

	<div class="paragraph">
		his Father with his angels.<a name=8:1></a>" I was thinking of the angels there.<a name=8:2></a> What bearing would they have on the matter?<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:4></a> We know that the angels will attend these great matters.<a name=8:5></a> They attend in relation to the working out of administration in the assembly.<a name=8:6></a> They are greatly interested in the working out of divine administration wherever it may be seen, and it is interesting to see how they appear in these matters.<a name=8:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, the assembly is referred to, in relation to the working out of the all-various wisdom of God, and the angels taking account of it.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.G.<a name=8:9></a>C.<a name=8:10></a> The first of the scriptures before us refers to individuals: "If any one desires to come after me.<a name=8:11></a>" Does the concrete expression of administration in a local assembly depend upon the presence of individuals in it who are thus committed?<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:13></a> I think that is important in a day of difficulty, such as we are in.<a name=8:14></a> It is important that there should be full and unreserved committal with us to the path of suffering and reproach; because, in that path, we see how divine glory shines out in Jesus; moral glory shining as the Lord drew near to the cross, and on the cross His relations with the thief, what glory shines; when He came and had to do with the Jews, in the light of John's ministry, how the Lord stressed the fact that they rejected the Father; how He came in the Father's Name; how He did the works which the Father did, and how He was rejected by the Jews.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=8:16></a>G.<a name=8:17></a> On the mount of transfiguration, the Lord's face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light.<a name=8:18></a> Are they in keeping with what you have before you, as to the glory of administration?<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:20></a> It suggests transparency.<a name=8:21></a> The figure of the sun implies indiscriminate influence, shining on the just and the unjust; the great heavenly influence linked with it, too.<a name=8:22></a> All that enters into the position of chapter 17.<a name=8:23></a> It is to help us in the administration of chapter 18,

		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for in chapter 17 we are in an administrative environment, and the teaching in it is to help us by first seeing the dignity of sonship in Christ.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.J.<a name=9:2></a>M.<a name=9:3></a> That is really the shining that shone upon Saul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus, and he started early with the light of sonship and the glory of divine administration in Christ.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:5></a> Paul got an impression from that moment, and he is the minister that brings forward the assembly in her heavenly position.<a name=9:6></a> No doubt, all that entered into the moment gave him a permanent impression.<a name=9:7></a> I think we want to understand the heavenly side more, in relation to administrative matters; that we can only work out administration rightly and properly, as coming in from the heavenly side, with all the beneficent influence that the heavenly side, as enjoyed by us, would disseminate in the working out of the administration.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.J.<a name=9:9></a>G.<a name=9:10></a> Would that bear upon the reference to "my Father who is in the heavens," and then further, "your Father who is in the heavens"?<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:12></a> Matthew makes a good deal of that, what is in the heavens, and what is in heaven; as if, to understand administration rightly, we have to understand that side of things.<a name=9:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=9:14></a> Is that why it is spoken of as the glory of the Father of the Son of man?<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:16></a> That is a very interesting reference, "the Son of man" implying His link with humanity.<a name=9:17></a> What this administrative environment would stress, is the greatness of man, as the Lords sets out as to the Son of man and His activities.<a name=9:18></a> And then the matter of sheep; earlier in the gospel it is said, "How much better then is a man than a sheep!<a name=9:19></a>" That is, we are impressed, in the Son of man here, with humanity; because the Son of man is what He is on our side.<a name=9:20></a>

		F.W.<a name=9:21></a> So that it is administration in a Man; but it is one particular Man; that is, the Son of man, is it?<a name=9:22></a>

		And then the glory of the Father of the Son of man (at the end of chapter 16), and the glory cloud (at the beginning of chapter 17) with the word, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight.<a name=10:1></a>"

		S.McC.<a name=10:2></a> So that you might say that the rights of humanity according to God are guaranteed in the closing verses of chapter 16, in the allusion to the Son of man.<a name=10:3></a> Evil will have to be dealt with, of course; but the very reference to the Son of man involves the protection of the rights of humanity, according to the divine viewpoint.<a name=10:4></a> It says, "For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his doings.<a name=10:5></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=10:6></a>H.<a name=10:7></a> Is that why all judgment is given to Him, because He is the Son of man?<a name=10:8></a> He will deal feelingly even in judgment?<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:10></a> Exactly; and the glory of the Father, linked with that, shows us (while the Father judges <i>no one</i>) the remarkable link of the Father with the matter of judgment in the hands of the Son of man; the grace side being intensified in the thought of the glory of His Father, because in the word to Laodicea, He is upon His Father's throne, having overcome, a delightful reference to the unique character of divine administration at the present time.<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=10:12></a> Is that why it was necessary for the bright cloud to overshadow them?<a name=10:13></a> There were those that were saying, "let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elias"; but has that all to be set aside, and the special and dominant position of the glory of the Son of man to govern the situation?<a name=10:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:15></a> Well, that is it.<a name=10:16></a> So that, in this world of administrative glory in chapters 16 -- 18, every man must go out; no one can stand alongside of Christ.<a name=10:17></a> If administration makes much of man according to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:2></a> Yes.<a name=67:3></a> The first part is the delivering side, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live I, but Christ lives in me," that is the side of deliverance; but then "the faith of the Son of God" gives us a positive link with the Man, the Person, who is the Centre of another world.<a name=67:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:10></a> It is interesting to see how Peter in his letter refers to Paul later, as has often been pointed out.<a name=67:11></a> I think the very expression that he uses shows how he values what Paul said to him in withstanding him to the face, because Peter was a princely man, but he was entirely wrong in this matter, and it was all the more serious in that he was affected by the influence of others.<a name=67:12></a> It says in verse 12 "before that certain came from James.<a name=67:13></a>" We often think of the generality of the brethren being affected by influence, but here is one servant being affected by another, and to the extent that he compromises the truth.<a name=67:14></a> This shows the importance of ministers being right and solid in their links with the Lord who has given their gifts to them.<a name=67:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=71:1></a> The knowledge of the Son of God seems to be a prime matter in John's ministry.<a name=71:2></a> He makes more of it than the other evangelists, even to the extent of giving us in his gospel a whole long chapter (chapter 9) devoted to a soul who arrived at the knowledge in some way.<a name=71:3></a> The fact that the work of the ministry is operating in view of our arriving at the knowledge of the Son of God would certainly serve to show the prime importance of it.<a name=71:4></a> It would seem to link with the completing of things in the dispensation, and the fact that John's ministry makes so much of the apprehension of the Son of God, both in the gospel and the epistles, would serve to bring home to us the importance of it at this time upon which John's ministry bears.<a name=71:5></a> It bears upon the time when doctrinal degeneracy has set in and where, in the public body, a good deal has been resorted to in years gone by to try and prevent that degeneracy -- the creeds and the like, protestant reform and everything on that line -- it all tried to stem the tide, but it has been futile.<a name=71:6></a> John in his ministry brings in elements of the teaching, such as life, that would help us in difficult days.<a name=71:7></a> The thought of life runs collaterally through the gospel with the knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=71:8></a> We might look first at it in the first chapter in relation to the uniqueness of the Lord Jesus in this position in manhood, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father," and then we might see how linked with the thought of the Son of God in chapter 3 is this great gospel vista, an enlarged vista in the field of the gospel.<a name=71:9></a> Then in chapter 5, bearing upon the service of God, the divine family, the great thought of quickening, the voice of the Son

		S.McC.<a name=119:8></a> Yes, exactly.<a name=119:9></a> The fulness of the administration will work out in the world to come, but we are to understand it morally and spiritually now, for Christ in having taken His place in heaven is functioning as Man in relation to the great administration which is working out from that position.<a name=119:10></a> There is also the world to come, but it enters into the present moment in a particular way, the Spirit here in the assembly standing in relation to the provision of Christ on high, functioning as Man in heaven, the Centre of this great administration.<a name=119:11></a>

		S.McC.<a name=121:11></a> Yes.<a name=121:12></a> The thought of David enters into Ephesians.<a name=121:13></a> In Colossians the "Son of His love" would be an allusion to Solomon, but in Ephesians "accepted in the Beloved" is more the reference to David, and the fact that "out of heaven" is made mention of here, and the holy city which comes down out of heaven, stresses the heavenly side.<a name=121:14></a> It is important that we should make room for love of a heavenly character.<a name=121:15></a> David is the great love man of the Old Testament.<a name=121:16></a> He knew how to love and he knew how to be loved.<a name=121:17></a> His whole administration is characterised by that.<a name=121:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=122:30></a> Exactly.<a name=122:31></a> "The Holy" and "the True" is a very important reference, because a correspondence would be expected on the part of those to whom it is addressed.<a name=122:32></a> It is a presentation of the Lord Himself outside the features that are named in the first chapter.<a name=122:33></a>

		F.D.<a name=123:10></a>C.<a name=123:11></a> Does it involve the testimony as well as the service of God?<a name=123:12></a>

		S.McC.<a name=123:13></a> I think so.<a name=123:14></a> That is what one is thinking of.<a name=123:15></a> There is an administration of grace involved in "He that has the key of David," but linked with this is "the Holy" and "the True", stressing moral conditions among the saints, not just ecclesiastical position.<a name=123:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=123:17></a>McC.<a name=123:18></a> Is it in mind that every fresh line of truth that comes out would call forth an answering melody and song to it?<a name=123:19></a> Is that why we needed a new hymn book?<a name=123:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=153:1></a> I am thinking of the service of Christ in leadership of His people, and how the spirit of it is to work out amongst us.<a name=153:2></a> We might read first in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>this morning, and perhaps we may amplify it later from the Old Testament.<a name=153:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The services of Christ towards His own are many, and the particular one that is before us is leadership, involving administrative service to His own, working out in love for the saints and care for them, and having in mind, as it says in verse 16, "There shall be one flock, one shepherd," the great point of contact between John's ministry and Paul's.<a name=153:4></a> Mr.<a name=153:5></a> Darby said that in insisting on Paul we are not to forget John; although we must always keep in mind the distinctiveness of Paul's ministry, in that he had certain formal commissions which John had not.<a name=153:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One thought that we might begin with this great portion in John's gospel, which refers us to the leadership of Christ, as in verses 3 and 4, "He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.<a name=153:7></a> When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.<a name=153:8></a>" It is important that we should understand the service of Christ in this character of leadership.<a name=153:9></a> There is His leadership in regard to the service of God, the service of song in the assembly, but this leadership has to do with the saints in their defenceless character as in a scene of contrariety, yet marked by the features of the work of God; and, as such, coming under the divine notice and attention, and served by divine Persons in an exalted manner, so that the standards that enter into this section dealing with the Shepherd and the sheep are elevated standards;

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Lord alluding in verse 15 to "as the Father knows me and I know Father.<a name=154:1></a>" He says in verse 14, "<i>I</i> am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.<a name=154:2></a>" And then again He says, verse 17, "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life.<a name=154:3></a>" And then the great thought of things being carried through enters into this kind and character of leadership, so that, as He says in verse 27, "My sheep hear my voice, and <i>I</i> know them, and they follow me; and <i>I</i> give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.<a name=154:4></a> My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.<a name=154:5></a> I and the Father are one.<a name=154:6></a>" We can see thus how the sheep go through in principle in these verses.<a name=154:7></a> "They shall never perish.<a name=154:8></a>" The work of God in that way goes through, whatever may come in, whatever may be linked with the perishing, the falling short of great divine objectives which the Lord is keeping before our minds as to His sheep here, "And they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.<a name=154:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can thus see the effectiveness of leadership as in Christ; and as contemplating this kind of leadership, the spirit of it is to work out among the saints, so that there is the corresponding care for the sheep, as comes into view in the service of Christ.<a name=154:10></a> We are to have in mind that the saints might be liberated from the world, as set out in the principle of the Jewish fold, and brought into the abundance of life, the wonderful conditions collectively, where life in abundance is known and enjoyed, involving buoyancy amongst the saints.<a name=154:11></a> These thoughts may yield further as we enquire together in relation to this service.<a name=154:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=155:11></a> The ninth chapter throws into relief the personal service of Christ to one of His sheep, and the influence that He acquires over that person, so that when He says to him, "<i>Thou</i>, dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=155:12></a> He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on Him?<a name=155:13></a>", showing the influence that the Lord, the Son of God, had acquired over this sheep of His.<a name=155:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=222:1></a> In considering further the feature of the service of Christ in leadership, we come to David.<a name=222:2></a> David is both a type of Christ and a type of the Spirit of Christ among the saints.<a name=222:3></a> We have been noting all through the enquiries that linked with this thought of leadership is the administrative service that is linked with the care of the flock; as we have seen, every man that God seems to use is marked by this feature, having peculiar care for the flock.<a name=222:4></a> These passages have been read because they bring David before us, as we might say, in a singular way.<a name=222:5></a> What he is behind the scenes.<a name=222:6></a> Perhaps we need to know more about this side of the truth, because there is such a tendency with us to like what may be taken account of in a spectacular way in public.<a name=222:7></a> But these passages ought to be a great encouragement to us, especially the younger men and women, and to all of us, as to how David is marked from the earliest by this great feature of care for the sheep, for the flock.<a name=222:8></a> It seems to be something that is in David's constitution; and whatever position he is in, it comes out, what he thinks and feels on this line, as having the sheep at heart.<a name=222:9></a> Another thing that is to be noted is that David represents a side in the truth that peculiarly promotes unity among the saints.<a name=222:10></a> He becomes a great rallying point in the testimony.<a name=222:11></a> His name means "beloved".<a name=222:12></a> We get the love side running through David.<a name=222:13></a> We get the service of God coming into view in David.<a name=222:14></a> But underlying all is this great thought of care for the flock.<a name=222:15></a> As it says in the first passage that we read, "And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men?<a name=222:16></a> And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding

	<div class="paragraph">
		the sheep.<a name=223:1></a>" That is a feature that comes into view in David and goes right through in his history, and it is a feature that we might emulate.<a name=223:2></a> The Lord Jesus, as we noted in the prophet the other night, coming into the position, speaks of, "The poor of the flock"; He fed them; so that we should be encouraged in view of what is before us in the subject of David, to take account of this important feature.<a name=223:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=223:4></a>J.<a name=223:5></a> Is that seen in New Testament setting in Stephen and others who were occupied in caring for the saints, and who received quick advancement?<a name=223:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=223:7></a> Yes.<a name=223:8></a> God would take us on as we are prepared to put our hand to do what is to be done, whatever it might be.<a name=223:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=223:10></a>H.<a name=223:11></a> The first recorded victory of David, I suppose, is where he slew the lion and the bear.<a name=223:12></a> Did that mark him all the way through?<a name=223:13></a> I think I have heard it said, that he never lost a battle, especially in the unifying of the saints in meeting the enemy.<a name=223:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=223:15></a> These passages that we have read deal with what is basic in David.<a name=223:16></a> He never departs, we might say, at least in principle, from this feature which runs through all the way; and it underlies the great principle of the throne, of rule and administration.<a name=223:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.J.<a name=223:18></a>G.<a name=223:19></a> It is said of David in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>, "he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands.<a name=223:20></a>" I was wondering if integrity of heart bears upon the inward side that you were speaking of?<a name=223:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=223:22></a> Integrity is a great thing, a very important thing; integrity of heart; especially when it comes to the saints.<a name=223:23></a> Of course, we should be marked by integrity of heart in business; it is a poor thing if there is not integrity of heart in our business.<a name=223:24></a> It is a great thing that there should be uprightness in our business, in our houses; uprightness in all our dealings; integrity of heart before God.<a name=223:25></a> It is a prime feature; but with

		P.B.<a name=224:7></a> So that when Jehovah speaks to Samuel in regard to Eliab he says, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him.<a name=224:8></a>" And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are these all the young men?<a name=224:9></a> And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep.<a name=224:10></a>" And then Samuel immediately says, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither.<a name=224:11></a>" Samuel gets an impress of the kind of man that is acceptable to Jehovah?<a name=224:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=224:13></a> And there is only one man that will do for God, that is Christ; and we want to make room for Christ, and the spirit of Christ amongst us.<a name=224:14></a> It is a remarkable thing that in relation to Eliab God says, "I have rejected him.<a name=224:15></a>" He says the very same thing about him as He says about Saul, saying, "I have rejected him.<a name=224:16></a>" God says the same about this elder brother of David.<a name=224:17></a> The one that would set David aside, make out that David was proud and naughty in heart, when David was really instrumental in the liberation of the people of God.<a name=224:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=225:22></a> I think we all have to learn, in that way, that what supports rule and administration according to God, lies basically in what we have been considering in these men that have been before us.<a name=225:23></a> It is a basic feature.<a name=225:24></a>

		S.McC.<a name=226:3></a> Well, the teaching is important, because we need teaching, the brethren need teaching; it is an important element; but we need shepherding, we need the shepherds; and the coupling of them together in Ephesians is important, because it involves the care for souls.<a name=226:4></a>

		S.McC.<a name=228:11></a> So that God operates here as in verse 12; Jehovah says, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he.<a name=228:12></a>" God is bringing to our attention what He is committing Himself to, as it says, "And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren.<a name=228:13></a>" A great view to faith as to what comes in subsequently, and David becomes the great rallying point.<a name=228:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=237:14></a> Well, I would think that the principles of the world, or whatever might be suggested in the lion and the bear, are operating against the flock, against what the saints are locally, in their local position.<a name=237:15></a> It may be a young person, as suggested in the lamb, some tender feature of the work of God; but the attack is against the flock.<a name=237:16></a> That is what is involved in all these matters.<a name=237:17></a> David sees the necessity for going after it, in this way.<a name=237:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=238:3></a> I would like to ask in regard to the previous scripture; it says, "thy servant" twice.<a name=238:4></a> Is this the feature that would really preserve, taking on the spirit of Jesus in bondmanship, serving by love?<a name=238:5></a>

		S.McC.<a name=238:13></a> Yes.<a name=238:14></a> While Saul is on the throne, the kingdom, you might say, is Saul's.<a name=238:15></a> He is on the throne.<a name=238:16></a> But morally the kingdom is with David.<a name=238:17></a> Officially it is with Saul, but morally it is with David; and the principles of the kingdom are operating in David's presence and those that were with him, in the way of protection.<a name=238:18></a>

		S.McC.<a name=265:1></a> The letters to the Corinthians are often referred to.<a name=265:2></a> These passages are well-known, but they, never fail to yield fresh help for us in the settings in which we are found in our local gatherings.<a name=265:3></a> In suggesting these passages, one has in mind particularly the importance of the temple in the first: "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=265:4></a>" and then the importance of the body in the second, and the Spirit's relation to the body as it comes out in that chapter.<a name=265:5></a> The thought of the temple particularly draws our attention to the great feature of light, what the saints are as convened and the Spirit of God among them, and the sure and certain way of getting help in regard to the truth in the recognition of this, and the thought of the refusal of all that is linked with man's mind and human wisdom, as Paul alludes to it in verse 18, "Let no one deceive himself if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.<a name=265:6></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=266:8></a> Well, of course, Paul is using an extreme statement here as to the possibility of the natural mind of the man after the flesh encroaching in this realm, "If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy.<a name=266:9></a>" That could hardly be true of a believer in the full sense of it.<a name=266:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=266:15></a> I am sure if there is gift in any locality, the brethren will be glad to make room for what is there.<a name=266:16></a> Gift, as has often been said, is like a precious stone.<a name=266:17></a> It enhances the diffusion of the light; it helps in the diffusing of light in a greater way.<a name=266:18></a> The temple is a sphere where light is diffused from God as to the truth.<a name=266:19></a>

		S.McC.<a name=267:4></a> No, it is not dependent on gift, but gift is a great advantage in a locality in regard to the operation of the temple.<a name=267:5></a> But what Paul is stressing here is what the saints in Corinth <i>were</i> themselves.<a name=267:6></a> "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=267:7></a>" He is anxious, it would seem in the letter, to keep before them the dignity of what they were as set together in the locality.<a name=267:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.G.<a name=267:14></a>S.<a name=267:15></a> I was thinking of the passage reading from verse 4 of the first chapter where he thanks God for them and speaks of them being enriched in Christ Jesus, "in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge," and that they came short in no gift, and so on.<a name=267:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=267:17></a> Yes, he speaks of them as richly furnished at the outset.<a name=267:18></a> But he comes back to this matter of what they were as the temple of God.<a name=267:19></a> That is, he is not exactly bringing in that gift was essential here.<a name=267:20></a> He is stressing what they were as set together in the locality, especially concerned, as he is, that none of them should be making their boast in men; as he says in verse 21, "So that let no one boast in men.<a name=267:21></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.F.<a name=267:22></a> I was wondering in that way whether the balance does not come in in verse 16, "the Spirit of God dwells in you.<a name=267:23></a>" Does that balance us?<a name=267:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=267:25></a> Yes, because it would seem as if at Corinth they were making a good deal of their gift, to the extent that schools of thought and opinion were established among them; and the apostle is seeking to stress what the saints were collectively as offsetting that.<a name=267:26></a>

		S.McC.<a name=268:18></a> Yes, exactly.<a name=268:19></a> One feels that in a country like this where you have in different cities so many gatherings, it must be a real practical test as to the working out of these great thoughts of the temple and the body; just how to make room for the thought in its fulness, so that the position is not overshadowed by mere personality, important as personality is in certain respects in the local position.<a name=268:20></a>

		S.McC.<a name=269:11></a> Yes; because we might say there were certain conditions at Corinth which might becloud this great thought, and there <i>were</i> conditions that would becloud the thought, but Paul is insisting on it in their minds in the teaching here, "Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=269:12></a>"

		S.McC.<a name=290:5></a> Yes, they say, "Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel.<a name=290:6></a>" How true that is in the elements of the teaching of the glad tidings, that along with the struggle linked with the displacement of the man according to the flesh in our hearts, there is the conscious vital support of Christ, all the way through, underlying the position.<a name=290:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=291:7></a> It is important to see that when we come to verse 6 it says, "the king and his men went to Jerusalem.<a name=291:8></a>" We come to another thought, not now the tribes and the elders, but the king and <i>his men</i>; as if, when we come to this matter of the hearts of the saints set forth in the stronghold of Zion, we have this great thought of the king and his men, especially stressing the side of manhood, representing the Lord Jesus Christ and what He has under His hand in relation to manhood in the testimony to achieve this great end, that is, the securing of the hearts of the saints in the light of the stronghold of Zion, in order that He might dwell there and that the operations of building might commence inward.<a name=291:9></a>

		The time is gone, and we should just finish with a remark as to chapter 23.<a name=302:4></a> All this is underlying, and making way for, the conditions that we have indicated in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:1">Psalm  133:1</a>, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.<a name=302:5></a>" This last feature in 2 Samuel shows us the kind of man that David was, and the kind of administration that was in his mind and in his soul as he speaks of "the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel," <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:1">2 Samuel  23:1</a>.<a name=302:6></a> All this is to intensify in our minds where the Spirit of God is, because the brethren dwelling together in unity, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>, draws peculiar attention to where the Spirit of God is free and unhampered.<a name=302:7></a> The reference to the dew and to "the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garment; as the dew of Hermon that descendeth on the mountains of Zion," reminds us of spiritual conditions among the brethren where the Holy Spirit is unhampered, so that conditions are fluid among the brethren in this light.<a name=302:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=302:9></a> That really follows what you have been bringing before us in regard to the place that Christ has in the affections of the saints.<a name=302:10></a> I was thinking of the previous Psalm, David's concern for the ark and "habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob.<a name=302:11></a>"

		S.McC.<a name=325:1></a> Time did not permit our referring to chapters 40 and 43, parts of which we read this morning, and we might perhaps just consider them for a moment, particularly chapter 43, but alluding to chapter 40 which brings us within the range of a great scope of things as to the truth.<a name=325:2></a> We have considered the great character of the work of God coming to light in chapter 37; the culmination of the teaching in that chapter in the supremacy of Christ typified in David, and God's tabernacle spread over the people.<a name=325:3></a> Then chapters 38 and 39 give us a touch in regard to the breaking down of the last feature of opposition, as we might refer to it, before we come to chapter 40.<a name=325:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 39 God is seen allowing the enemy to oppose, to a certain extent, to bring out God's holy jealousy for His name; as he says, in verse 25, "Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name: and they shall bear their confusion, and all their unfaithfulness in which they have acted unfaithfully against me, when they shall dwell safely in their land, and none shall make them afraid; when I have brought them again from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am hallowed in them in the sight of many nations.<a name=325:5></a> And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to be led into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.<a name=325:6></a> And I will not hide my face any more from them, for I shall have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.<a name=325:7></a>" This and other references in the chapter are striking allusions to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=326>[Page 326]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		way God shows publicly His love for His people and regard for them, and His holy jealousy in regard of His name.<a name=326:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we come to chapter 40, which brings us to this great range of things that enters into the last eight chapters in Ezekiel, involving a good deal that tests us as to our apprehension of the truth.<a name=326:2></a> There are two things that run through the eight chapters, and that is the necessity for the man that is alluded to as standing by Ezekiel, and also for the Spirit.<a name=326:3></a> That is, the service of Christ mediatorially, and the service of the Spirit are important things to keep in mind in what we are about to consider in regard to the great scope of things here in the truth.<a name=326:4></a> In chapter 40 he is brought to the land of Israel and set upon a high mountain, and he sees "the building of a city, on the south," and "a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a flax-cord in his hand, and a measuring-reed; and he stood in the gate," all to intensify in our minds the thought of measurement, without which we shall be lost as to the truth; the divine standard of measure is a great matter.<a name=326:5></a> And a good deal is said as to the house; the first thing that is described is the house and the features of it.<a name=326:6></a> Then we come to chapter 43 and "the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; .<a name=326:7></a>.<a name=326:8></a>.<a name=326:9></a> and the earth was lit up with his glory.<a name=326:10></a>" Then it says that, "the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.<a name=326:11></a> And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man was standing by me.<a name=326:12></a>" I believe it is a great matter that we should get a sense of God coming into the position and a Man standing by us even now, not only in the service of God on the upward and heavenly side, but even now that we should have a sense of these great things as we go over the truth together, intensifying in our minds the thought of

		And Mark flinched in the crisis, when the pressure got severe, when he measured what full committal would entail for him.<a name=388:2></a> He was not prepared to go all the way, and I would earnestly encourage every one of us, especially the younger brethren, to face the matter of full committal in the light of Mark's gospel, so that we may not be in the meetings lightly or loosely, but with settled purpose of heart, as helped by the Lord and strengthened by the Holy Spirit whom we have, to commit ourselves fully to what is on hand in relation to our part in the testimony of God.<a name=388:3></a> You remember what is said as to the young man in this gospel.<a name=388:4></a> When the crisis linked with the cross drew near, when there were those that were around who were taking Jesus to crucify Him, there was a young man who fled leaving his garment with them.<a name=388:5></a> His garment, as we know, was lightly cast about him.<a name=388:6></a> We do not want to be in the testimony thus in any light, shallow and superficial way.<a name=388:7></a> The gospel tells us of another young man, at the end, after the Lord had risen from the dead, who was sitting clothed in a white robe, a great example for us in regard to any part, however small it may be, that any of us may have in relation to the testimony of God.<a name=388:8></a> It is important that our robes are white.<a name=388:9></a> It is important that our manner of life should be unstained by the things that are around us in the world, that we should be free as marked by purity, not only purity inwardly in our hearts and souls, but purified circumstances, as the white robe suggests.<a name=388:10></a> And Mark had learned these lessons.<a name=388:11></a> It involved much for him, but he had learned these lessons.<a name=388:12></a> He had turned back from the work when he was most needed, and we ought all to learn, especially the younger ones, the need of standing true in the present moment of the Lord's

		These passages that one has read are somewhat lengthy, but it was necessary to read them because of what one has upon one's heart to refer to tonight, namely, the sufferings of Christ.<a name=400:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sufferings of Christ in themselves are an immense subject, but they are a subject that we do not know enough about; a subject, perhaps, and a theme, in the apprehension and appreciation of which we have not allowed the Spirit to help us as we should.<a name=400:2></a> I am referring to what I notice in myself when I say that.<a name=400:3></a> But it is a theme, that if engaged on with the help of the Spirit, will draw us nearer and nearer to the One Whom we love, Who has suffered so, our Saviour.<a name=400:4></a> We need to make room in our minds for the teaching that enters into the foundations of the truth of the glad tidings.<a name=400:5></a> I am sure if we better understood the sufferings of Christ in relation to the atonement, we should be more delivered from the influence of sin and sins.<a name=400:6></a> For when we see what it meant to Him, what it cost Him that we might be initially set up in relation to God, according to the way He has made Himself known in the terms of the glad tidings, if we allow the Spirit to bring more home to our souls what enters into these foundations, in relation to the sufferings of Christ, we should be far better men and women in the assembly.<a name=400:7></a>

		There is nothing so cold as a knowledge of the truth in the mind, that has never affected the soul or the conscience.<a name=400:8></a> It is so easy to let our souls drift into a state of indifference in regard to the teaching of the knowledge of God, in the elements of it in the gospel; but we must never assume, dear brethren, to get to a

		point, as long as we are here in the public position, where the sufferings of Christ are forgotten, or that there are loftier subjects to engage us so that we leave them behind.<a name=401:1></a> The sufferings of Christ underlie everything that we have together, and everything that we enjoy together; and we need to allow teaching in relation to the sufferings of Christ to infiltrate into our minds, to enter our hearts, so that we might be softer and more mellowed in our spirits under the preciousness of their touch.<a name=401:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We want to beware, dear brethren, of going with things merely externally, for there is a constant tendency with us to live at a distance from divine Persons, while invariably ostensibly clinging to the truth, as Mr.<a name=401:3></a> Darby has said in relation to Jerusalem, and their sorrows in the last days in the reception of the antichrist.<a name=401:4></a> To be in outward nearness to God and yet inwardly not so, is a terrible thing, and to invest one's heart with the Name of God, clothing oneself with it as a cloak of pride, a buckler, so that the arrows of God do not reach the conscience.<a name=401:5></a> What could be more dreadful than what the Lord Jesus has to say to Jerusalem: "Your house is left unto you desolate.<a name=401:6></a>" And Jerusalem is the centre of the prophecy that I have read from; God has it in mind from the beginning to the end.<a name=401:7></a> In Haggai it is the house, special allusion being made to the matter of the glory of the house, but in Zechariah Jerusalem is the central point, everything is measured in relation to Jerusalem.<a name=401:8></a> Jerusalem is a wonderful type of the assembly.<a name=401:9></a> The more we read the prophets, and especially this prophet, we shall see that Jerusalem is the apple of God's eye.<a name=401:10></a> Indeed this language is used.<a name=401:11></a> Everything in this book, the great powers and authorities among the nations, are all being regulated in relation to Jerusalem; and we want to see that we cherish what God cherishes, the assembly is God's chief interest on earth at the present moment, so it should be our chief interest.<a name=401:12></a> Indeed, the practical

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 11 of the book of Zechariah opens by drawing our attention to the way that the power of man and the force of man has swept in on Israel and overcome the position.<a name=402:8></a> The noble ones are spoiled, the cedars are devoured.<a name=402:9></a> It is the overrunning scourge of human resource in man's power and strength, entering upon the realm that belongs to God.<a name=402:10></a>

		For we can understand as we read the opening chapters of the gospel by Luke, the pathos of the position to those with a godly heart and a godly mind, such as Zacharias and Elizabeth.<a name=402:11></a> How they felt the Roman yoke, and the fact that the resources linked with man's uncontrolled power and energy, had entered on the realm of Immanuel's land, and were holding in captivity what belonged to God.<a name=402:12></a> We might apply it in principle, dear brethren, to the whole scene around us

		I want to refer to the environment here, as to this change in a man -- Saul.<a name=433:1></a> In <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#9:27">1 Samuel  9:27</a> it says, "As they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Tell the servant to pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still now, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.<a name=433:2></a>" "That I may <i>cause</i> thee .<a name=433:3></a>.<a name=433:4></a>.<a name=433:5></a> " Now I want to stress in what I have to say as to Saul tonight, and his becoming changed into another man, that we are in an environment where everything is operating towards that end, that we all might be changed into better brothers and sisters.<a name=433:6></a> This portion of the Word is full of the thought of men, indeed in this book, while God has allowed Saul to come forward.<a name=433:7></a> He has in mind the man that is set out in David, whom Paul alludes to as a man after God's heart.<a name=433:8></a> And while God is thinking of that, He allows the people as it were, the advantage of making their own choice.<a name=433:9></a> God is infinitely fair in matters; we sometimes are very unfair.<a name=433:10></a> How humbling it is to see the injustice and unfairness that marks us at times But God is infinitely fair, and He is allowing the people a certain measure of latitude in regard to Saul, for He has important lessons to teach us, as He does in all these matters.<a name=433:11></a> He may allow a certain line of things a fair amount of latitude and scope; but as in Saul, it is only to bring out the <i>exceeding sinfulness of sin</i>, such as we have to learn experimentally in the analysis of good and evil in our souls in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=433:12></a> God allows a certain latitude to a certain line of things, because He has in mind over against the dark background of the features linked with the man of sin and shame, to throw into bright relief the features of His own Anointed in all their excellence, set out in type in David, but supremely seen in the Christ of the gospels.<a name=433:13></a> God is infinitely fair in all these matters, and if we are unfaithful, He remains faithful.<a name=433:14></a> Have we not had that witnessed to in the vicissitudes of the testimony, in the recurring

		And Samuel here is representing God.<a name=434:4></a> He is a wonderful man, Samuel; he comes into the Psalms, not as a prophet, but as a priest.<a name=434:5></a> I think that is a wonderful commendation of him.<a name=434:6></a> He was one of the greatest prophets who ever lived in Old Testament times, and yet when he is brought up in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99">Psalm  99</a>, he is not brought up in relation to the prophetic side of his service, but what is stressed are his links with God in a priestly way -- "Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name.<a name=434:7></a>" Is that not an indication to us, dear brethren, as to what underlay Samuel's power in prophetic ministry?<a name=434:8></a> Is it not an incentive to all of us to pray, and to pray, and to pray again, to be men and women of prayer?<a name=434:9></a> The Books of Samuel stress the matter of prayer in women and in men; they open with a woman who is a praying woman, Hannah; a woman who can speak of her horn as lifted up in Jehovah.<a name=434:10></a> What a sister Hannah was; a woman who can say that her horn is lifted up in Jehovah, a woman who can put into poetic utterance her appreciation of the truth, her knowledge of God arrived at through anguish of soul as beset by the persistent persecution of her rival, Peninnah!<a name=434:11></a> Hannah was a woman who cried inwardly, despite the suffering and the persecution.<a name=434:12></a> And the more we are with God, the more we shall come out as Hannah, with a song which will celebrate God and His Anointed.<a name=434:13></a> And Samuel is mentioned in his priestly power in the Psalms.<a name=434:14></a> I have no doubt Samuel prayed for Saul.<a name=434:15></a>

		How needful it is, dear brethren, that that distinctive ministry, in which the Spirit has been so prominent, should have its full place with us, and that there should be no effort with any one of us (for our hearts are all prone to it, as the enemy finds a way through them) in any way to undervalue, or discredit, or undermine the distinctiveness of that ministry.<a name=445:1></a> And the Spirit of God has been drawn attention to, in the closing phase of it, in a unique way, as to His Person as an Object of worship; but I believe that, commensurate with that, there is now in this testing period the challenge to us, not just as to whether we honour that Person objectively in the honour and worship that is rightly His due, but as to whether we are habituating ourselves to communion with Him, and whether we know what it is to use Him, and to be used by Him.<a name=445:2></a> It is a very real matter.<a name=445:3></a> The only way to meet the Philistine element (which all of us are so prone to make way for, and to become characterised by) is by making room for the Spirit.<a name=445:4></a> We need to make room for Him more and more in all our faculties -- in our way of thinking, in our way of speaking, in our way of hearing!<a name=445:5></a> For it is important, in the calling of attention to the Spirit, in the closing moment of the dispensation, on the eve of the translation, that we should see what is in mind, and that we should learn that the dispensation is going to end in spiritual power.<a name=445:6></a> It may be in smallness; it may be in weakness publicly (for we cannot claim too much), but it is going to end with a definite known result, in the assembly.<a name=445:7></a> That enters into the history of Samson who delineates for us, in a peculiar way, the history of the church publicly.<a name=445:8></a>

		The cross becomes a great dividing line, a great point of severance in regard to man after the flesh, and in regard to the world around us.<a name=458:2></a> Peter alludes to the cross in the language that he uses in this chapter.<a name=458:3></a> He calls it the tree, being Jewish, but nevertheless the cross is in mind, for Peter would aim in the ministry to help us as to the suffering position.<a name=458:4></a> We need to be helped in regard to the suffering position: we need to know, as Peter would help us to know, the value of suffering at the present time; so he says, "For to this have ye been called.<a name=458:5></a>" That is, it is not coincidence in circumstances, but divine intent enters into the suffering.<a name=458:6></a> As Peter says, "To this have ye been called.<a name=458:7></a>" He is alluding to the importance of doing good and suffering, bearing it as acceptable with God, and he says, "For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps.<a name=458:8></a>" I think we would all have to own freely that the steps of suffering are not the steps that we would naturally choose; they are the steps that we naturally would avoid in every way possible, but we are to understand suffering from Peter's viewpoint, that we have been called to this position.<a name=458:9></a> I think it would help us to be more restful in the position.<a name=458:10></a> It would help us to take on the sufferings in a more peaceful way, especially desirous as we would be in this light, of going through things acceptably with God.<a name=458:11></a> You remember that Enoch had the testimony before he was translated that he pleased God.<a name=458:12></a> What a wonderful thing it is to be pleasing to God in suffering, to be acceptable to God in suffering, for Peter's letter is dealing with the scene of suffering;

		I have on my heart to speak a word on how moral power and moral weight are acquired.<a name=470:1></a> You will notice that in the passages we have read there is constant reference to Judah; and Judah, as we know, particularly emphasizes this side of the truth.<a name=470:2></a> We are told in Chronicles that Judah prevailed among his brethren, and of him was the prince.<a name=470:3></a> I am sure that there would be a desire with all of us to acquire greater weight and power morally with God and with men.<a name=470:4></a> The prince suggests that idea.<a name=470:5></a> And I might say that there is no royal road to acquiring moral power, as men speak of a royal road, there is no short cut to it.<a name=470:6></a> It involves much heart searching, but God is ready to help us if we are desirous of acquiring power morally with Himself and with men.<a name=470:7></a> The whole bearing of the teaching in Romans has in mind that the believer should learn how to acquire moral weight and power.<a name=470:8></a> We can never acquire it if we do not begin in ourselves.<a name=470:9></a> It is important with every one of us in regard to the truth that we begin with ourselves.<a name=470:10></a> We must let the truth have its way in our own souls before we seek to bring it to bear upon others, and the teaching in Romans is to help the believer towards this end.<a name=470:11></a> Not exactly to acquire power officially, but to acquire power morally, as with the help of God we learn to deal with sin -- sin as it bears on us externally, and sin as it is in us internally.<a name=470:12></a> No one is of much moral weight in the testimony unless he learns how to deal with this great matter of sin in himself.<a name=470:13></a> The exercises of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>and 7 are essential to this end.<a name=470:14></a> Many a believer has been crippled morally by never judging the principle of sin as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, operating in the world around

		Now in chapter 44 Judah goes up, and they take Benjamin with them.<a name=479:20></a> That is, they have taken on the truth, the regulation by Joseph's commandment.<a name=479:21></a> Joseph is dealing with them a step at a time.<a name=479:22></a> He gets Benjamin up, and he operates now on the high level of the silver cup, the glory of redemption, to detain Benjamin.<a name=479:23></a> This precious feature is too great, Joseph would say, to be lost.<a name=479:24></a> I want to retain it.<a name=479:25></a> He wants

		I do not desire to go into the detail, but I refer to the continual acquisition of moral power on the part of Judah, seen in the way he takes up the matter and does not excuse himself.<a name=480:14></a> You might say, 'Judah, you have some right to excuse yourself, you stood by the commandment of Joseph; why not tell Joseph that?<a name=480:15></a>' Well, he does in effect.<a name=480:16></a> But the point is that Judah sees there is no use for excuses.<a name=480:17></a> He says, "God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we

		Now I come to this last passage which shows us clearly the great moral power in Judah.<a name=482:8></a> Judah becomes the sanctuary of God.<a name=482:9></a> When God takes the children of Israel out of Egypt later, Judah was His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.<a name=482:10></a> Judah has the nearest place, the sanctuary.<a name=482:11></a> It is an interesting thing too, in regard to Benjamin, that the house was in Benjamin's territory.<a name=482:12></a> "The beloved of Jehovah -- he shall dwell .<a name=482:13></a>.<a name=482:14></a>.<a name=482:15></a> between his shoulders.<a name=482:16></a>" There were these two great links in the chain of events that lead to the full disclosure of Joseph and what a place of honour they come into.<a name=482:17></a> Judah becomes the sanctuary, and Benjamin becomes the house in principle.<a name=482:18></a> The beloved of Jehovah, he shall dwell between his shoulders, meaning Benjamin's territory, where Jerusalem was.<a name=482:19></a> "Judah -- as to thee, thy brethren will praise thee; thy hand will be upon the neck of thine enemies.<a name=482:20></a>" That is what the line of acquiring moral power gives us, that is where we are brought to.<a name=482:21></a> Would the young brothers and sisters like to have their hand on the neck of their enemies -- sin, and the world, and all the principles of the flesh that operate to bring us into bondage?<a name=482:22></a> Would you like to get your hand on the neck of your enemies?<a name=482:23></a> It is

		reached along the line that Judah travelled, that is, in coming to a right judgment about yourself and your own heart in all its nakedness -- coming to God's judgment about matters.<a name=483:1></a> You remember when Tamar's sin came to light Judah said, "Bring her forth, that she may be burned.<a name=483:2></a>" Many of us are like that, you know.<a name=483:3></a> David, whose ancestor he was, was incensed and indignant when the parable came to him as to the sin, and he was ready to put the man to death, just like Judah, "Bring her forth, that she may be burned.<a name=483:4></a>" But Judah got right.<a name=483:5></a> Then it says here, "Thy father's children will bow down to thee.<a name=483:6></a> Judah is a young lion.<a name=483:7></a>" Then in verse 10, "The sceptre will not depart from Judah, Nor the lawgiver from between his feet.<a name=483:8></a>" Now notice this, that the man that held to regulation by Joseph's commandment is the man with whom the lawgiver is now linked.<a name=483:9></a> I think it is a beautiful touch, dear brethren, as to the acquisition of moral power.<a name=483:10></a> It does not drop on us as a mantle out of the air.<a name=483:11></a> It is developed in a hard and difficult way, but it is developed in our relations with Christ and with God, and as making room for the Holy Spirit.<a name=483:12></a>

		So it says in verse 11, "He bindeth his foal to the vine, And his ass's colt to the choice vine; He washeth his dress in wine, And his garment in the blood of grapes.<a name=483:13></a> The eyes are red with wine.<a name=483:14></a>" I believe that in our language, that suggests one who knows what it is to make room for the Spirit -- the holy stimulating features that are linked with the Spirit's activities.<a name=483:15></a> What moral power Judah acquired; and the door is open to every one of us, brothers and sisters alike, to acquire power likewise.<a name=483:16></a>
