	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:1></a> The knowledge of divine Persons and divine things is to be considered.<a name=7:2></a> It is essential that the importance of John's gospel should be apprehended by us.<a name=7:3></a> Mr.<a name=7:4></a> Raven said that it was the backbone of all the gospels, and Mr.<a name=7:5></a> Taylor remarked that it was the backbone of all the Scriptures, showing what an important place it had in their minds, and it is especially important as bearing on what we are about to consider together in connection with the revelation of God -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=7:6></a> In the consideration of our subject together, divine personality will be before us in each of the Persons of the Deity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and particularly before us now we have the divine Personality of the Word, the Son.<a name=7:7></a> We need to see the place that the Person of Christ has in these holy writings.<a name=7:8></a> It is important that in seeking after light we should not miss the glory of the Persons about whom we seek light.<a name=7:9></a> They are presented in John's ministry in a manner which is calculated to touch every feature of spiritual affection begotten through the operations of God.<a name=7:10></a> The knowledge that we are referring to -- spiritual knowledge -- seems to run right through all John's ministry, both in the gospel and the epistles, and the Revelation.<a name=7:11></a> If we were to consult a concordance, it would be surprising the number of times that the word 'know' and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'knowing' comes into John's ministry; and especially is it important in view of all that is abroad in the public profession, that we should come into the knowledge that John has in mind, and, as quickened in our affections, be affected by that knowledge, and especially in view of the enriching of the service of God.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the first portion we have read, the matter of knowledge is presented negatively, which is very interesting.<a name=8:2></a> John opens his gospel with negative references to knowledge, whereas when we come to the seventeenth chapter it is replete with references to positive features of knowledge as to the men that God has given Christ out of the world.<a name=8:3></a> He says in verse 10, "He" (that is Christ) "was in the world, and the world had its being through him and the world <i>knew him not</i>.<a name=8:4></a>" Then in verse 26, "John answered them, saying, I baptise with water.<a name=8:5></a> In the midst of you stands, whom ye do <i>not know</i>, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose".<a name=8:6></a> Then John says in verse 30 as to the Lamb of God, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me; and I <i>knew him not</i>; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.<a name=8:7></a> And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.<a name=8:8></a> And I <i>knew him not</i>; but he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=8:9></a> And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".<a name=8:10></a> This is what we should keep before us in this first reading, the negative side, throwing into relief what is in mind on the positive side in our enquiry.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=8:12></a>P.<a name=8:13></a> When he says "I knew him not", is he referring to His eternal personality?<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:15></a> There is no doubt he is not alluding to Him on natural lines, for John stood related to the Lord on the natural side; it seems to refer to something very definite on John's part, when he says "a man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he was before me; and I knew him not".<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral side is in mind in the first negative suggestion, the condition of the world morally, the created sphere into which the Lord came, "the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not", it is the moral side in regard to knowledge; and then it is the religious side in the second reference, those that came out of Jerusalem -- the priests and Levites who should have known, but John says "whom ye do not know", which suggests the religious darkness marking that setting; but when we come to the Baptist, it is more an allusion to the exclusion of the natural side in the matter of this knowledge.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.G.<a name=9:2></a>W.<a name=9:3></a> Is the acquirement of positive knowledge reached by way of our <i>seeing</i>, which is the result of the work of the Spirit in us in the way of enlightenment?<a name=9:4></a> I was thinking of verse 34.<a name=9:5></a> John says there "I have seen".<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:7></a> Yes, new birth in its radical character in us brings about the ability to see things which we did not see before; and seeing is brought much before us in John's ministry, and it is important that our eyes should be open spiritually to see what comes within our range in the movements of divine Persons in this gospel.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=9:9></a>B.<a name=9:10></a> Is one of the first steps in acquiring knowledge the realisation that we are without it?<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:12></a> Yes, the negative side would throw that into relief -- the great need there is for the true knowledge of God which John's gospel would bring on to our view, beginning with this Person.<a name=9:13></a> It is important that we should get an impression as to the divine Personality that is before us here in the Son -- the Word as He is referred to.<a name=9:14></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=9:15></a>" Our affections need to be quickened in relation to the Person of Christ; John's gospel makes a lot of the Person of Christ.<a name=9:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=9:17></a>E.<a name=9:18></a> Had you something further in your mind in alluding to these three categories: the world, and the religious circle, and what is natural?<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:20></a> I think John is stressing the negative side as he opens his ministry to bring into relief what was in the assembly; the realm to which we belong.<a name=9:21></a> The Lord has great pleasure in referring in the 17th chapter to what
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is known in that realm.<a name=10:1></a> He says, "They have <i>known</i> that all things that thou hast given me are of thee" verse 7, "[they] have <i>known</i> truly that I came out from thee" verse 8, and "These have <i>known</i> that thou hast sent me" verse 25 and "I have made <i>known</i> to them thy name" verse 26.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=10:3></a>E.<a name=10:4></a> Is it of any interest that Peter's wife is not referred to in this gospel?<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:6></a> Say what is in your mind in that regard.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=10:8></a>E.<a name=10:9></a> I was thinking of your allusion to John ruling out the natural element, and I was wondering if the Spirit keeps us, in the narrative, entirely in relation to what is spiritual.<a name=10:10></a> I suppose most of us have in our minds ruled out the element of the world, and of the religious circle, but I wonder whether we sufficiently face this natural element.<a name=10:11></a> I wondered if John is a model to us in that way?<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:13></a> I think he is, and he would help us to see the importance of coming under the hand of divine Persons in view of the knowledge that we are speaking about, that we have in mind, because it is quite evident that we need divine help when it comes to the matter of the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=10:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=10:15></a>G.<a name=10:16></a> In his first epistle he says "we know that we are of God and the whole world lies in the wicked one".<a name=10:17></a> Does that fit in with what we have before us here?<a name=10:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:19></a> Very good.<a name=10:20></a> That is an interesting passage; one was thinking of it in relation to this subject, because he immediately continues, as you will recall, in the following verse, "And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=10:21></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=10:22></a> It bears on what we have here.<a name=10:23></a> John would help us to see what we stand related to, in the environment that we are in -- we know that we are of God.<a name=10:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=10:25></a>H.<a name=10:26></a> Would you say that those negatives of John the Baptist are all the more remarkable on account of what we might speak of as the excellency of John the Baptist on the natural line?<a name=10:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:28></a> Yes, because John was a remarkable personality himself -- a distinguished personality, marked out by an
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		intervention from heaven; one who was filled with the Holy Spirit -- he was a remarkable man in that way, and yet he says in such a precise, definite way "I knew him not", showing that there is no pretension on John's part to advance any premium that he might have put on his link with Christ along natural lines.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=11:2></a>G.<a name=11:3></a>T.<a name=11:4></a> I wondered if the fact that the Spirit of God uses two words for 'knowledge' or 'know' would help in the enquiry.<a name=11:5></a> One is conscious knowledge and the other is objective knowledge?<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=11:7></a> Yes, it does help.<a name=11:8></a> There is what we know objectively, and there is what we know consciously.<a name=11:9></a> It is remarkable that in this verse, verse 9, he says "the true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man".<a name=11:10></a> It is not that every man has the knowledge.<a name=11:11></a> It is not the idea of enlightenment, as Mr.<a name=11:12></a> Darby points out; it is light to every man, sheds its light upon every man; that is, the bearing of it is towards all.<a name=11:13></a> But then we know that we need the Spirit in regard of knowledge that we are speaking of -- Christian knowledge -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=11:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=11:15></a>U.<a name=11:16></a>B.<a name=11:17></a> Is the basis of all this "born of God"?<a name=11:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=11:19></a> Well, we should never know divine things unless we are the subject of divine operations, and "born of God" brings on to our view a class of persons here that are distinctly marked out as having a right -- a right to take a certain place, and in the light of John's epistle it would be a class of persons who know God, because they are begotten of God.<a name=11:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=11:21></a>G.<a name=11:22></a> Is it in your mind that in approaching the knowledge of divine Persons the first essential is the appreciation of Christ, and who He is?<a name=11:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=11:24></a> That is what is particularly in one's mind, and that we should not miss the wonderful Personality that is before us in "the Word"; in this opening section of John's gospel the very use of the appellation 'Word' reminds us that the thought of the revelation of God is a prime matter in John's mind; it is important that we should allow the Spirit of God to have His way in fastening our attention on the glory of this divine Person, of whom John the evangelist, in the Spirit's power, writes.<a name=11:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=12:1></a>K.<a name=12:2></a> So would the negative in verse 18, "No one has seen God at any time", be important in that connection?<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=12:4></a> Well, it would, because there is what we cannot know -- what we cannot apprehend, even in regard to what we are saying as to our subject of the knowledge of divine Persons; we are not seeking in any way to intimate that we can know all that there is to be known of divine Persons, because we cannot, and we do not.<a name=12:5></a> There is what we do not know, and what we do not see, and John would remind us of that to begin with -- that we have limitations.<a name=12:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=12:7></a>P.<a name=12:8></a> When the Scripture in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:14">1 Corinthians  2:14</a> says "the natural man .<a name=12:9></a>.<a name=12:10></a>.<a name=12:11></a> cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned", does it refer to what can be known?<a name=12:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=12:13></a> Yes, the Spirit of God is alluded to as the great instrumentality by whom God is revealing these things to us.<a name=12:14></a> He reveals them to us by His Spirit.<a name=12:15></a> "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (verse 10).<a name=12:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=12:17></a> Have you in mind that the features you have named, what is moral and religious and natural, are calculated to militate against our apprehension of the presentation of the Person?<a name=12:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=12:19></a> Yes, we have to have a judgment in our souls as to this negative side if we are to come in for the knowledge par excellence which John has in mind -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=12:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=12:21></a>E.<a name=12:22></a> Would it be in keeping to ask if there is in the three outstanding titles in these verses an offset to the three spheres that you refer to?<a name=12:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=12:24></a> You mean 'the Word', and 'the Christ'; and what other one are you referring to?<a name=12:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=12:26></a>E.<a name=12:27></a> I was thinking of the Word, and the glory of an only-begotten with a father, and then finally the Son of God.<a name=12:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=12:29></a> Yes, it is; it is important that we should see the way in which Christ is presented in this section, first as 'the Word', and then as 'the Son', the Only-begotten Son, and the glory of an only-begotten with a father -- the truth of Christ's sonship, which the religious
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		world does not understand at all, and then what we have coming in later in regard to 'the Christ' and 'the Lamb of God' and the 'Son of God' and 'He who baptises with the Holy Spirit'.<a name=13:1></a> All that is important in our apprehension of Christ over against these environments that are suggested in the negative statements that we have referred to.<a name=13:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=13:3></a>F.<a name=13:4></a> Does it help to see that there are three more negatives that are referred to in verse 13 as to the way that the believer is born?<a name=13:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=13:6></a> Yes, it does.<a name=13:7></a> "<i>Not</i> of blood <i>nor</i> of flesh's will, <i>nor</i> of man's will, but of God.<a name=13:8></a>" We are reminded thus of the impotence connected with that range of things, so that in coming into the knowledge of God as revealed in this gospel it is important that we should see how much depends on divine help.<a name=13:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=13:10></a>G.<a name=13:11></a>T.<a name=13:12></a> I wondered whether that was not really the force of your calling attention to the negatives, that as we accept the negative side, it throws our thoughts and activities in the direction where what is positive can be secured.<a name=13:13></a> Is that what is in your mind?<a name=13:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=13:15></a> That is right, and the negative side can only rightly be understood and fully apprehended as the glory of the Person of Christ is apprehended.<a name=13:16></a> That is what helps us to see the negativeness of what is in these different realms or environments.<a name=13:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=13:18></a>S.<a name=13:19></a> Does verse 14 bring before us what we may enter into?<a name=13:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=13:21></a> Well, it is an allusion to Christ's sonship.<a name=13:22></a> John's gospel does not treat of sonship in the saints, he would fasten our gaze spiritually on the uniqueness of Christ's sonship; but then in relation to what you say, we can see that that is the mind of God for us, because the mind of God for us as to sonship is set out in Christ in sonship in man.<a name=13:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=13:24></a>S.<a name=13:25></a> Yes.<a name=13:26></a> I was thinking of the contemplation of the glory and the fulness that was there.<a name=13:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=13:28></a> Yes, how important that word 'contemplation' is in that regard.<a name=13:29></a> We need to allow our minds and our affections to be given over to this contemplative attitude.<a name=13:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=14>[Page 14]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=14:1></a>P.<a name=14:2></a> Would you say something about verse 18 in regard to the relation between sonship and the declaration, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=14:3></a> His sonship would of course there be of a special character?<a name=14:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=14:5></a> Yes, only a divine Person could be referred to in this way, "the only-begotten Son.<a name=14:6></a>" It is important to see that sonship not only hinges, as we have been taught, on Christ's humanity, but also on His eternal personality.<a name=14:7></a> It is an important thing to see that, because it is His eternal personality that gives a unique touch to His sonship.<a name=14:8></a> Only a Person who is divine could be referred to as He is in this section.<a name=14:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=14:10></a>E.<a name=14:11></a> Do we come to the term "the only-begotten Son" by way of "the Word was God".<a name=14:12></a> And "the Word became flesh"?<a name=14:13></a> Is that right?<a name=14:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=14:15></a> Well, you mean the allusion to verse 1 to what He was in the pre-incarnate condition of Deity?<a name=14:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=14:17></a>E.<a name=14:18></a> Yes, as you said, His essential personality.<a name=14:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=14:20></a> Yes, so that the mediatorial system is involved in what we have in verse 18 -- the position the Lord has come into; taking a place, as He has, in incarnation, "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us", and then being "in the bosom of the Father".<a name=14:21></a> The mediatorial economy is thus suggested to us in all its attractiveness to begin with; it comes before us officially in its operations later on.<a name=14:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=14:23></a>E.<a name=14:24></a> I wondered if that is why we have no allusion to the Lord's nativity in this gospel, because there is a certain way in which we can be affected naturally by that, is there not?<a name=14:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=14:26></a> That is so.<a name=14:27></a> So it is interesting to see the whole bearing of John's gospel as standing outside of dispensation.<a name=14:28></a> It is not what can be limited to dispensation, although what enters into it particularly characterises and affects our dispensation, but it cannot be limited to it, because of the Persons that are referred to in the revelation of God in it.<a name=14:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=14:30></a> Would not what verse 1 gives us indicate what has to be borne in mind in this enquiry, that the One
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=15>[Page 15]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		who was the Word -- known here as the Word -- the full expression of the mind of God -- was nevertheless God Himself?<a name=15:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=15:2></a> It is important that we should see this, and this verse 1 is very much on one's heart in regard to what we are considering -- the way the appellation "the Word" begins this gospel, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=15:3></a> It is not that He was the Word then, but John the evangelist, in referring to His position in Deity, uses the appellation, "the Word", not that He was the Word then, but that He was known in testimony here among the saints in that way; it seems to suggest at the outset of John's gospel the way the intelligence and affections of the saints were affected by what came within their range in this Person.<a name=15:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=15:5></a> And thinking of the three Persons, we can only identify Them by names They have taken?<a name=15:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=15:7></a> Yes, so that John's gospel presents to us God in the majesty of His Being, revealed in Christ; a glorious Being as He is, the supreme Object of worship, but He has come within our range in Christ, and is known in Christ, known in this Person that is referred to as "the Word", particularly alluding to His ability -- His inherent ability to make God known.<a name=15:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=15:9></a>G.<a name=15:10></a> So that Luke's gospel speaks of "those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on <i>the Word</i>".<a name=15:11></a> That throws light, does it not, on the use of that expression?<a name=15:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=15:13></a> It does, showing how much they had been affected by what came out in the Person of Christ as to the knowledge of God, because "the Word" is particularly expressive in regard to the subject that is before us.<a name=15:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.J.<a name=15:15></a>B.<a name=15:16></a> So would you say he is emphasising rather the truth of His personality?<a name=15:17></a>

		S.McC.<a name=35:2></a> Yes, all that runs through the passages that we have read together, especially stressing the Lord's hand-to-hand service, if I might reverently say so, in regard to individuals; that is, the Lord is viewed here as taking persons on in relation to the different states of soul that are expressed in these passages.<a name=35:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=35:4></a>G.<a name=35:5></a> In that way, do we need to apprehend the Lord as Teacher?<a name=35:6></a> Nicodemus says "a teacher", "thou art come <i>a</i> teacher".<a name=35:7></a> Has that to be corrected to see the greatness of the Lord in this way as Teacher?<a name=35:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=35:9></a> Yes, that is interesting, in contrast to what the Lord said to him, "Thou art <i>the</i> teacher of Israel".<a name=35:10></a> The Lord does not say 'Thou art a teacher of Israel', but "Thou art <i>the</i> teacher of Israel".<a name=35:11></a> Nicodemus was no ordinary man; he must have been a man of good capacity as men would speak of him, and all around we see that.<a name=35:12></a> But the Lord takes him up and speaks very faithfully to him about this matter of new birth, which really leaves Nicodemus wondering as to where he is.<a name=35:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=35:18></a> How important that is; it is the Word that is speaking -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=35:19></a> The One who is anointed to unfold the whole mind of God, He is here speaking, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee", and who can speak after Him?<a name=35:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=35:23></a> Well, surely it is an example set before us, as to whether we are learning; there are those that are always learning, but never seem to come to the knowledge of the truth, and Nicodemus represents that side; he is not

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=36:11></a>G.<a name=36:12></a> I was just wondering, as you were remarking about the Lord taking on each of these cases individually, whether we get the secret of that later on, where the Lord says, "All that the Father gives me shall come to me and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:37">John  6:37</a>).<a name=36:13></a> So that is not each soul the subject of the Father's giving, and of the Lord's taking on and instructing, and of the Spirit's operations?<a name=36:14></a> Is not each soul the subject of the operations of the whole Godhead?<a name=36:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=36:16></a> Well, exactly, so that it sets in wondrous relief the blessedness of the economy from that side -- not only the love that has come into expression in what divine Persons are towards us as shown in the Father's love to the Son, and the Son laying down His life, but this matter of taking us in hand in view of our instruction in the knowledge that has come within our range in the economy.<a name=36:17></a> I think it is most affecting in that way.<a name=36:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=55:2></a>E.<a name=55:3></a> Is it right that when the Lord is speaking to His enemies in this gospel He is very emphatic as to His place in the Deity, but when He has His own around Him He speaks more intimately in relation to His place in manhood?<a name=55:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=55:5></a> Well, that is interesting, especially as we shall see as we come into this section which involves conflict.<a name=55:6></a> The Lord is asserting His own Personality, asserting His Deity, and John's ministry bearing on the last days would impress us with that.<a name=55:7></a> In the church councils of old, centuries ago, there was an attempt to protect the truth by the formulation of creeds, but it led into error, and was derogatory to the glory of His Person in that they put His sonship back into eternity, into the pre-incarnate conditions of Deity.<a name=55:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=55:9></a>E.<a name=55:10></a> Yes.<a name=55:11></a> Was that because there was a lack of understanding that "the natural man understands not the things of God"?<a name=55:12></a> Has it not always been damaging to try and adapt the truth to the mind of man naturally, whereas this gospel shows that it is impossible for the mind to take it in, so that the opening of the narrative emphasises that the writer and those with him understood and valued the deity of Christ, "the Word was God"; but the insistence on the term "I am" is invariably made by the Lord to His enemies, is it not?<a name=55:13></a> And is not that where our protection lies?<a name=55:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=55:15></a> It is, because the Spirit of God in superintending the writing of this gospel has in mind to protect that glorious Person who has come so low, who has entered into such a subordinate position involving relative inferiority.<a name=55:16></a> The Spirit of God protects the glory and greatness of His Person at every turn throughout the gospel.<a name=55:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.Hn.<a name=55:18></a> Do you think that the speaking of the Lord in this gospel is calculated to impress our hearts with who He is?<a name=55:19></a> I was thinking of the remarkable passage in chapter 5, where He has been speaking to His enemies, the Jews, and they sought to kill Him "because he had said that God was his own father, making himself equal

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=56:3></a> Well, it is important that we should see that the greatness of the Person of Christ is to be maintained; therefore care is needed lest we should advance anything that is derogatory to the Person of Christ, because we have to maintain before our hearts and in our thoughts the greatness of who He is -- not only who He was, but who He is, because He is unchanged in His Person wherever we view Him.<a name=56:4></a> His Person is the same.<a name=56:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=56:6></a>B.<a name=56:7></a> Is that borne out by the 9th of Romans -- the reference to His coming in flesh and then immediately guarding it, "Who is over all, God blessed for ever"?<a name=56:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=56:9></a> Yes, it is; it is one of the great passages that guards the truth as to the Person of Christ, lest in thinking of the economy and the lowly subordinate place He has come into in the economy we should think less of Him.<a name=56:10></a> The Spirit of God desires to guard it in our minds, lest we should have any thought that He is any other than God.<a name=56:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=56:15></a> John insists on that, and so it comes out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>, "but ye seek to kill me, a <i>man</i> who has spoken the truth to you".<a name=56:16></a> And as was referred to earlier, "the holy one of God", a beautiful allusion to His manhood, especially on the priestly side -- what is due to God, because Aaron, as we have often heard, would be brought into our minds as a type of this aspect of Christ.<a name=56:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.J.<a name=56:18></a>B.<a name=56:19></a> Would it be right to suggest that the disciples would speak together of Him, so that Peter, when he says "we have believed and known", was able to speak emphatically because together they had arrived at this conclusion that He was who He was?<a name=56:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=56:21></a> Yes, it is a tribute to their contemplation of the Person -- to their observation of Him -- what they had gathered up, while others were disaffected in relation to the teaching.<a name=56:22></a> Here were ones that were wondrously affected, so that Peter says, "We have believed and known".<a name=56:23></a> Not 'we have known and believed', but "we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=57:5></a> I would say, from practical observation that in the body of the saints there is a great desire to protect the truth as to the Person of Christ, and it is preserved, we might say, in a living way in the assembly over against the error embodied in dead creeds.<a name=57:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=57:7></a>E.<a name=57:8></a> Confirming what you remark as to "the body of the saints", would not the fact that the apostles are not referred to as such in this narrative help us to see what is to be expected in the last days -- that the truth is held in the body of the saints affectionately by the Spirit, and that ministry must come on this line of holiness and affection in the understanding of Christ in the two ways you are suggesting?<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=57:10></a> Well, I am sure that is so, and I think we should see the importance of it at this juncture, and then the salutary word the Lord gives over against the attractiveness of progressive knowledge in Peter.<a name=57:11></a> John says in verse 70, that "Jesus answered them".<a name=57:12></a> That is, the Lord takes up Peter's "we" and it says, "Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve?<a name=57:13></a> and of you one is a devil".<a name=57:14></a> Now this is a very humbling and searching matter, and it behoves us to be lowly and sober, and searched in the presence of the truth as the Lord is bringing it forward here.<a name=57:15></a> We have not only progressive belief in Peter, and in the twelve in this chapter, but progressive <i>un</i>belief in those who go away into the drift of apostasy, the full result being seen in Judas.<a name=57:16></a>

		spiritual prosperity in our souls was in being subject to the truth as it comes to you.<a name=58:1></a> That is a great matter.<a name=58:2></a> I was interested the other day in the word that God gave to Ezekiel in chapter 3, verse 10.<a name=58:3></a> He says to Ezekiel, "Son of man, all my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears".<a name=58:4></a> Now we would have reversed that; we would have said, 'Hear with thine ears and receive in thy heart', but God puts the 'receiving in thy heart' first, and then 'hear with thine ears', showing the importance of the activity of faith and the subjective bearing of faith.<a name=58:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=58:16></a> Very good, showing how the heart was the immediate subject of the operation to make way for all that was coming in through Paul's ministry -- a personal operation of the Lord.<a name=58:17></a> One has thought recently that we often speak of the Spirit as augmenting the service of Christ, but it is interesting to see how the Lord augments the service of the Spirit.<a name=58:18></a> The Spirit is the great power for understanding the truth, for understanding spiritual and divine knowledge.<a name=58:19></a> That is a particular feature of His glory.<a name=58:20></a> He is the power for apprehension and for knowledge in us.<a name=58:21></a> But when we come to the Pauline side, the Lord is brought into it; Paul says to Timothy, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding".<a name=58:22></a> Not the Spirit, but the Lord will give thee understanding.<a name=58:23></a> And this passage in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, "whose heart the <i>Lord</i> opened" -- not the Spirit, but the Lord -- "to attend unto the things spoken by Paul".<a name=58:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=59:12></a> There is a beautiful touch in this chapter in that way as to the Father -- as the Lord again says in verse 65, "And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father".<a name=59:13></a> We want to know the glory of this Person more in the economy, "the Father" -- God as known in this Person, how He is operating.<a name=59:14></a> The Father is God, the Spirit is God, and the Son is God -- let us never think anything different.<a name=59:15></a> God is One, involving three Persons, and yet there is the wondrous grace of the economy, "to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things and we for him" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>) -- God coming in in that way in a system of affections to impress our hearts with what He is.<a name=59:16></a> God is love.<a name=59:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=60:6></a> Well, it is one thing to see the Father operating and what He is operating in relation to; but, rightly speaking, while He comes within our range in the mediatorial system and in mediatorial operations, the Father is presented to us as God in the economy, "To us there is one God, the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ, <i>by</i> whom are all things and we by him", so that the mediatorial side is rightly linked with the Lord Jesus and with the Holy Spirit.<a name=60:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=60:8></a>E.<a name=60:9></a> Do we not have to lay hold of this, that the supremacy marking the Father's place in the economy in no sense hinders His delight to serve the saints?<a name=60:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=60:11></a> No, it does not.<a name=60:12></a> We see how He is operating in this gospel, as we have already been referring to it, operating in affecting souls; but the mediatorial position is seen in the Lord pre-eminently, and the Spirit is acting in accord with that.<a name=60:13></a> We could not say the Spirit is the Mediator.<a name=60:14></a> Scripture says, "One Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus".<a name=60:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=60:16></a> Is that not linked up with the suggestion that the Lord has lordship in a sense in a dual way; that is, He had not only lordship as in Godhead but He is made Lord officially?<a name=60:17></a>

		W.S.<a name=64:10></a>S.<a name=64:11></a> I think it was Mr.<a name=64:12></a> Darby who pointed out the importance of what is stated in those verses in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>the gifts of the Spirit and the Lord over the services, but the same God operating, God operating whether in the Lord or the Spirit.<a name=64:13></a>

		P.H.<a name=65:2></a>H.<a name=65:3></a> In relation to what was remarked about 'being', I was thinking of one of J.<a name=65:4></a>N.<a name=65:5></a>D.<a name=65:6></a>'s footnotes to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>: "Who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance".<a name=65:7></a> The footnote says, "Clearly 'substance', 'essential being', not 'person'.<a name=65:8></a> It is of God, not of the Father.<a name=65:9></a>" Now is it in your mind that the greatness of the being of the one great eternal God is to permeate all that we are saying about divine Persons?<a name=65:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=65:11></a> Yes, always.<a name=65:12></a> Not that we can say much about it, but the blessed Spirit, the power for knowledge and apprehension, affords us in a holy and sober way a certain amount of latitude in thinking of God, so infinite in His majesty, in His Being as He is, yet coming within the range of creature mind and understanding to affect our minds and hearts in regard to Himself.<a name=65:13></a> We are reminded in the Scriptures that as far back as we can go "in the beginning" God was there, the great Being to whom we are alluding, involving all three Persons.<a name=65:14></a> Their personality distinct even there, we are never to forget that, one Being, but yet the personality of Each as revealed and distinguished in the economy is seen there -- "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", the preposition 'with' in the Greek denoting communicative associations, signifying distinct personality in those conditions.<a name=65:15></a> What names or forms the relationships took we cannot say -- the form of God is not revealed, but it is important that we should see that one distinct and glorious divine Being in majesty is God -- the Deity -- yet three Persons, distinct in Their personality.<a name=65:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=65:17></a>G.<a name=65:18></a> I suppose the expression "the eternal Spirit" would help as to the separate personality of the Spirit.<a name=65:19></a> In the economy He takes the name, or rather in the name of God in the economy He is the Holy Spirit, because it has reference to man, but personally He is the eternal Spirit.<a name=65:20></a> Would that be right?<a name=65:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=66:4></a> Well, we are going ahead of our subject, but that passage, if we might just allude to it in passing, shows what we have been saying, what we have learned and been taught: that God, not the Father, is the ultimate in assembly service in the worship of God; it is God as God; He has entered into that wondrous relation conveyed in the name Father, so expressive of grace, that we might know Him in the majesty of His being as He is, as God.<a name=66:5></a>

		S.McC.<a name=66:15></a> That is it, and that is what we are to keep in our minds, and also that it is the same in eternal conditions.<a name=66:16></a> It says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, "then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection".<a name=66:17></a> We are to be reminded of what lies behind all that, what is inscrutable to us, that we cannot enter upon, but reminding us of the majesty of the Being with whom we have to do, and who is to be all in all in that scene.<a name=66:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:2></a> Yes, I think so, because I think the great bearing of the knowledge of the Father is to help us to know God, that is, what He is in the fullest sense, in all His supremacy and majesty as the Being to be adored and worshipped.<a name=67:3></a>

		S.McC.<a name=67:7></a> That is the point exactly, all bearing on the activities of the Father and the Son and the Spirit.<a name=67:8></a> We have thus an economy devised by divine love in which divine affections are seen so that we should know God according to what He is -- as it is said, "God is love", and that is how we come to know Him.<a name=67:9></a> The Trinity always has existed in Oneness, and the economy has been devised by divine love, in order that divine affections might be known, and it is in this way that we are brought to know God, that we have come to God, the judge of all.<a name=67:10></a> That involves God in His supremacy.<a name=67:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:22></a> Well, I would rather say in the title "the Son".<a name=67:23></a> "The Son of God" is what He is more as representative of God; "the Son" is the appellation that particularly alludes to His personal greatness and deity.<a name=67:24></a>

		S.McC.<a name=68:7></a> Well, I think that is an important feature of the teaching, because in the Son of God the heart of God is brought near.<a name=68:8></a> In "the Word" we have the full unfolding of the mind of God; in "the Son of God" we have the heart of God brought near, because He expresses to us in a unique way divine love.<a name=68:9></a>

		S.McC.<a name=68:13></a> It does.<a name=68:14></a> As representing God He has come in on God's side; as Son of man He has come in on man's side; but as Son of God He has come in on God's side, to make God known.<a name=68:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=68:25></a> It is very interesting that the Son of man is so much mentioned in the gospels and is mentioned in the Acts, and we have a reference which bears on it in Hebrews, but generally the title is not employed in the epistles.<a name=68:26></a> I think "the Christ" represents, as you say, something on that line, that He is the answer to every human hope, whether it be in man generally, or whether it be in Israel, in regard to the whole scope of prophecy; the Christ is the answer to every human hope in the Gentile world and in Israel.<a name=68:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=69:5></a>E.<a name=69:6></a> I wondered if that was why the Spirit impelled Stephen to use that term at that juncture.<a name=69:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=69:8></a> Yes, I am sure it is, because it is a transitional point.<a name=69:9></a> The metropolis is being transferred to heaven; it had long been here in Jerusalem, but it is being transferred to heaven, and heaven becomes the great centre of the vast extended operations involving the Gentile world where the assembly is to come peculiarly into view in Paul's ministry.<a name=69:10></a>

		P.H.<a name=69:11></a>H.<a name=69:12></a> It is remarkable what you are saying about the term "the Christ", and what Mr.<a name=69:13></a> L.<a name=69:14></a> has raised; in the end of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>the expression is used which belongs to the realm of the Son of man, does it not, "has put all things under his feet"?<a name=69:15></a> But I understand you to say that it is in the setting of the Christ.<a name=69:16></a> Is it as the Head of the assembly?<a name=69:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=69:18></a> Yes, the anointed man -- the Christ.<a name=69:19></a> Ephesians makes a good deal of "the Christ" -- what He is as anointed and filling out the official position.<a name=69:20></a> Everything is headed up in the Christ in the body of that first chapter; it says in regard to what God purposes in Himself, "for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ".<a name=69:21></a> That involves the same thing as the all things being put under the Son of man.<a name=69:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=69:26></a> That is it.<a name=69:27></a> So that John's ministry in the epistle makes the difference between the Son of God and the Christ, that Jesus is the Christ.<a name=69:28></a> In his epistle he does not bring in the Son of man, but alludes to the Christ -- which is more the official title, the One who has come in as the answer to every hope both in regard of the race and also in regard to Israel.<a name=69:29></a>

		S.McC.<a name=70:5></a> Well, we might refer to how the man in the 9th of John comes to the knowledge of the Son of God; we are to see how knowledge comes to him.<a name=70:6></a> The Jews, I suppose, would rule him out, indeed they did, "They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses".<a name=70:7></a> And then later down, verse 34, "They answered and said to him, <i>Thou</i> hast been wholly born in sins, and <i>thou</i> teachest us?<a name=70:8></a>" That is, they are occupied with the man in an external way; they do not see the mystery linked with the works of God in the man, and the knowledge that he has acquired in regard to this Person that had come into his view.<a name=70:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=72:1></a> This tenth chapter, in the portion of it that we have read, brings up the knowledge that is amongst the sheep of Christ in regard to Christ Himself, the Shepherd, and also brings out the thought of His knowledge of them.<a name=72:2></a> What the Lord says in verse 14 is very affecting, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".<a name=72:3></a> It would seem that the divine standard of knowledge is with the sheep of Christ according to that verse, which should affect us; then in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, the knowledge of divine Persons as it comes before us in that exalted setting: first the knowledge of the Father -- how important it is in this gospel that we should know the Father, and God as presented in the Father; then the knowledge of the Holy Spirit, as the Lord says the world does not see Him nor <i>know</i> Him, "but ye <i>know</i> Him", alluding to the disciples, "for he abides with you and shall be in you".<a name=72:4></a> And then His reference to the assembly day, the Spirit's day, and His own place in divine affections -- the perfect state of love that is contemplated in verse 20, "In that day ye shall <i>know</i> that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=72:5></a> A perfect state of love is contemplated, and the wondrous knowledge that is linked with it.<a name=72:6></a> I thought we should consider briefly this 10th chapter, and then give the major part of the time to the 14th chapter.<a name=72:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our place as the sheep of Christ is important -- what we are as marked out in the light of John's ministry in this way: the objects of divine attention, and the peculiar glory of Christ as the Shepherd, the good Shepherd, who lays down His life for the sheep; all this accentuating the holy activities of love, in the mediatorial economy into which God has come.<a name=72:8></a> We shall never understand the economy if we do not understand and appreciate love.<a name=72:9></a> The measure of our spirituality can be taken account of by

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=73:3></a>H.<a name=73:4></a> Is it on that account that the sheep never go astray -- sheep of this kind cannot stray?<a name=73:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=73:6></a> Yes, that is because John's sheep know Christ.<a name=73:7></a> They do not know the voice of a stranger.<a name=73:8></a> A remarkable statement that, in regard to John's sheep -- the sheep of Christ; it says "they know not the voice of strangers" (verse 5) but they know the Shepherd's voice.<a name=73:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=73:13></a> Yes, exactly.<a name=73:14></a> How all this should affect our souls as to our links in holy spiritual affinity with Christ as in the figure of the sheep!<a name=73:15></a> He Himself in this gospel is referred to as the Lamb of God -- a touching allusion to Christ in holy manhood here.<a name=73:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=73:20></a> Very good -- that exactly illustrates what we have here, and it is also seen in the man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>.<a name=73:21></a> He says in verse 36, "who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?<a name=73:22></a> And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.<a name=73:23></a> And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage".<a name=73:24></a> A true sheep of Christ, he discerns whose voice it is speaking, "he that speaks with thee is he", and he answers to it.<a name=73:25></a> The allusion in chapter 10 verse 3 is important, "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.<a name=73:26></a>" There is an abstruse allusion to the Holy Spirit in this figure -- the porter; that is, that we are to be conscious that the Spirit will make way for

		Christ; He is not making way for the false shepherds, those that mount up elsewhere, thieves and robbers.<a name=74:1></a> It is remarkable that the Lord speaks in this way; it must have been the Pharisees and what He had to say to them in chapter 9 which drew out this plain speaking of the Lord as to those that mount up elsewhere being thieves and robbers, "but he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<a name=74:2></a> To him the porter opens".<a name=74:3></a> No doubt an allusion to the holy scene recorded in the synoptic gospels where the Spirit comes upon Him as He enters upon His public ministry.<a name=74:4></a>

		T.J.<a name=74:5></a>G.<a name=74:6></a> Is there a link between the thought of the sheep and the resolving of the question as to who Christ is?<a name=74:7></a> I am thinking of the reference to Solomon's porch later on in the chapter and the Lord then speaking of the sheep as hearing His voice and so on.<a name=74:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=74:9></a> Well, that is the point -- they know the shepherd.<a name=74:10></a> In the 23rd and 24th verses it says, "Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.<a name=74:11></a> The Jews therefore surrounded him and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense?<a name=74:12></a> If thou art the Christ, say so to us openly".<a name=74:13></a> Think of the innuendo in that; think of what they were implying, that He was secretive about matters, the aspersion they cast upon Him and His ministry, "Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense?<a name=74:14></a>" He was not holding their soul in suspense -- someone else was doing that, but He had taught openly in their synagogues and their temple; but they are casting this aspersion on Him, "If thou art the Christ, say so to us openly".<a name=74:15></a> Peter and the others in whom active faith was operative discerned who He was -- the Holy One of God, the Christ.<a name=74:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=74:17></a>S.<a name=74:18></a> You were speaking of spiritual affinity with Christ.<a name=74:19></a> Would that involve our having in our measure the same thoughts and feelings in regard to the sheep as He Himself has?<a name=74:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=74:21></a> Yes, it would; that is, leadership enters into this section.<a name=74:22></a> That is what is in mind in what the Lord says.<a name=74:23></a> As we think of what happened in the 9th chapter, what a wrong lead they would give the man -- they would lead him out of the truth altogether, operating as they were, taking the place of knowing things, and seeking to lead

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=75:3></a>H.<a name=75:4></a> Would you say something as to verse 2, "he that enters by the door", then later down, "I am the door"?<a name=75:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=75:6></a> Well, I think the reference in verse 2 is to the legal way in which the Lord came in.<a name=75:7></a> He did not come in in any clandestine way, He came in the right and legal way; He came in by the door, and the porter opened to Him, and that would be what is in mind in verse 2, whereas in verse 9, "I am the door", is an allusion to what He was in Himself in manhood, in the great mediatorial position.<a name=75:8></a> There is only one way to God, and that is through Christ -- there is no other way.<a name=75:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=75:10></a> The first reference stands connected with His entrance into the fold, but the second to His being a door in relation to the flock.<a name=75:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=75:12></a> That is important to notice as to the fold.<a name=75:13></a> There is no fold now; the idea of the fold is terminated.<a name=75:14></a> Divine Persons now take the place, if we might so say, of the fold, in that the hand of Christ, the Shepherd, and the hand of the Father are the confines in which the sheep are now held, and kept in the region of eternal life, and they shall never perish.<a name=75:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=75:16></a>B.<a name=75:17></a> In referring to verse 3, "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice", etc.<a name=75:18></a>, does that bring in the intimacy between the Lord and the sheep and also the Spirit and the sheep?<a name=75:19></a> It seems as though the Spirit enables us to recognise the Lord's voice.<a name=75:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=75:21></a> That is right, and it is important that we should recognise His voice.<a name=75:22></a> This gospel makes a good deal of the voice of Christ, and it is important that we should recognise His voice down <i>here</i>, because a sheep does not exactly allude to what we are in heaven, or in eternity -- it alludes to what we are down here in a defenceless position externally, but in a well-defended position spiritually, as in the hand of Christ, the Shepherd, and in the hand of the Father.<a name=75:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		P.H.<a name=76:6></a>H.<a name=76:7></a> Does 'the voice' open with us some exercise as to the speaker and the way that he is speaking?<a name=76:8></a> We have earlier the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the Son of God, and now the voice of the Shepherd.<a name=76:9></a> All the same Person, but not saying the same things in the same way.<a name=76:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=76:11></a> No, exactly; so the Shepherd's voice is important in this section, where Jewish opposition has been so strong, and would deflect a man -- the subject of the works of God as we have it in the 9th chapter.<a name=76:12></a> It is important that the Shepherd, the person who has such absolute care for the sheep -- His voice should be known and that He should be followed.<a name=76:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=76:14></a>H.<a name=76:15></a> Does the voice raise with us the exercise as to some living expression at the time?<a name=76:16></a> We might be quite clear in terms as to the Person of Christ and so on, but He is speaking in a different way at different times, and different matters are involved.<a name=76:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=76:18></a> That is one of the things that is particularly on one's mind and heart in this reading -- the importance of the voice, and active love as it is seen in this chapter, because, while we may all be concerned to get the terms of the truth rightly, it is important that we should see that we have to do with living Persons.<a name=76:19></a> The Lord speaks in this gospel of the living Father; we have to do with living Persons, and the matter of divine affections entering into our relations with Them.<a name=76:20></a>

		S.McC.<a name=81:14></a> Very good.<a name=81:15></a> The way that He speaks in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>causes our attention to be focused on those that were given to Him out of this world; while He had been given authority over all flesh.<a name=81:16></a> He gives to them eternal life, as you say, "that as to all thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal"; and then the chapter begins to enlarge on those that have been given to Christ, indicating the peculiar way in which we come in for life -- such a distinctive heavenly way in this dispensation.<a name=81:17></a> But we need to see the importance of the love side in this tenth chapter, the sacrificial side, the laying down of the life -- all this is important in the system of divine affections, because if the saints are to be cared for rightly, and to be served rightly, it can only be in the spirit of Christ and in the grace of Christ as seen in this relation.<a name=81:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=87:10></a> That is it, and He especially stresses in His reference to it the holy ties and links in love that will never be broken; if the sheep represent links with the Shepherd in holy love, <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>brings them on to our view, if we might say, in a greater way; not in a more blessed way, for I suppose the love is the same, but in a more extended way.<a name=87:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=90:8></a> In verse 11 He says, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; but if not, believe me for the works' sake themselves".<a name=90:9></a> You notice that He is referring to the operating side, where the works are coming out.<a name=90:10></a> He says in verse 10, "the Father who abides in me, he does the works".<a name=90:11></a> It is linked with the works, but when we come to verse 20 "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=90:12></a> It is more the inward side of love and affection; not that verse 11 does not involve love, but more the public operative side in relation to the works.<a name=90:13></a>

		W.M.<a name=90:14></a>B.<a name=90:15></a> I wondered if the reference to "in that day" stressed the Spirit's day, the presence of the Comforter -- is that what you had in mind?<a name=90:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=90:17></a> Yes, exactly, because the last part of the verse, "and ye in me and I in you", could not be apart from the Spirit, so that "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you" is possible because of the Spirit.<a name=90:18></a>

		S.McC.<a name=94:15></a> It is felt that these two passages that we have read should complete our enquiry in relation to the subject that has been before us in this gospel as to the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=94:16></a> The verses in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>were read because they are involved in what the Lord says in verse 26 of this 17th chapter, "and I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known".<a name=94:17></a> There are one or two references to the thought of the knowledge of divine Persons in this wonderful chapter, and it has been referred to as the greatest chapter in the apostolic section of the Scriptures.<a name=94:18></a> It is a chapter that is different from all the others; a certain uniqueness attaches to it in that we are not exactly in the presence of ministry in this chapter, but in the presence of the speaking of one divine Person to another.<a name=94:19></a> As we were saying, we are not in the presence exactly of the Lord teaching in ministry in this chapter, but we are privileged to be as it were in the presence of His speaking to the Father, one

		divine Person speaking to another -- on the one hand in the light of His own equality with the Father, on the other as in the subject dependent place out of which He never took Himself as having come into it; and even in this chapter, while His equality is asserted, He takes the place of receiving things from the Father.<a name=95:1></a> And it is thought that we should see first what is referred to in "and this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=95:2></a> The knowledge of God is linked with eternal life; and then towards the end the knowledge of God is linked with the family side.<a name=95:3></a> Eternal life is not so much linked with the family side; eternal life is more linked with God and men.<a name=95:4></a> So that we should consider first what is referred to in this matter, "that they should know thee", "this is <i>the</i> eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=95:5></a> And then the wonderful expressed desires on the part of the Son to the Father as to unity.<a name=95:6></a> There are three great references to unity in this chapter: first in relation to the apostles themselves, the apostolic unity, then in relation to those that believed through their word, and then the thought of unity in glory linked with sonship.<a name=95:7></a> There are other things that may come in, but these are salient features that we should keep before us in what we are about to consider.<a name=95:8></a> The fact that we are in a priestly atmosphere here in itself has its own word for us.<a name=95:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=95:10></a>P.<a name=95:11></a> Why do you say that, a priestly atmosphere?<a name=95:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=95:13></a> The Son is speaking to the Father; we are in a priestly realm, our minds are impregnated through His utterances with the thought of holiness as He recognises what the Father has given to Him out of the world, and expresses His holy desire that they should be kept from the evil that is in the world.<a name=95:14></a> The Lord is priestly in His attitude here, and the whole chapter is filled with priestly utterances in so lofty and exalted a subject as the chapter contemplates.<a name=95:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=95:16></a>H.<a name=95:17></a> Is the thought of eternal life somewhat selective here?<a name=95:18></a> It says first, "thou hast given him authority over all flesh"; then, "as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal".<a name=95:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:1></a> Yes, it is; it is drawn attention to in regard to the position that the Lord has, as given authority over all flesh, which would look on to the millennial world and the millennial day; but our thoughts are particularly concentrated on the disciples and on those that should believe on Him through their word as particularly selected, marked out in relation to this great blessing, this wondrous blessing, not so great as sonship.<a name=96:2></a> Eternal life is not so great as sonship, but it is a wondrous blessing, one of the greatest blessings that we possess.<a name=96:3></a> We have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, and eternal life is one of them.<a name=96:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.E.<a name=96:5></a>B.<a name=96:6></a> Is it to be noted that the thought of giving occurs a great number of times in this chapter, seventeen times.<a name=96:7></a> It is a very precious thought in connection with the Father, is it not?<a name=96:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:9></a> Yes.<a name=96:10></a> I think it is very important, because we might say, reverently speaking, in a certain way that we are in the presence of divine love unhindered here.<a name=96:11></a> We have the flow of divine affections that the economy was specially devised to impress our minds with -- the giving being part of that -- it is the great expression of God in His nature -- God is love, and the giving is a great expression of God in His nature in that way.<a name=96:12></a>

		F.P.<a name=96:13></a>B.<a name=96:14></a> Does the only true God cover that?<a name=96:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:16></a> Yes.<a name=96:17></a> The Lord says, "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=96:18></a> It is remarkable how He refers to Himself in this way, "and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=96:19></a> That kind of man, that order of man, would be particularly stressed -- eternal life linked with God and man in that way.<a name=96:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.J.<a name=96:21></a>G.<a name=96:22></a> Does the emphasis being on <i>eternal</i> in that verse suggest that the knowledge of "the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" is not the acquisition of a mere point of knowledge, but an eternal matter that becomes an integral part of the believer?<a name=96:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=96:24></a> Yes, the word eternal, of course, in "eternal life" should be contrasted with a scene of death, where man's life has been shortened; we know that in the early chapters of Genesis great longevity marked man's life,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=97>[Page 97]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but that has been shortened, and tremendous difficulties and pressures have come in through sin in relation to the shortening of man's life, and eternal life is the great answer to that, in the very scene where sin has brought in such disaster.<a name=97:1></a> Eternal life of course is referring to an out-of-the-world condition of things.<a name=97:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:6></a> No, it is not.<a name=97:7></a> It is important that we should see that, wondrous as eternal life is, it is not on the same plane as sonship; sonship is the highest blessing for man.<a name=97:8></a> We do not reach anything higher than sonship in the way of blessing, and it is linked with the family thought, whereas eternal life is not -- it is God and men.<a name=97:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=97:10></a>E.<a name=97:11></a> Yes.<a name=97:12></a> Why I asked my question is because you were emphasising eternal life coming into evidence and enjoyment where sin was, but sonship belongs to what is outside of that, does it not?<a name=97:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:14></a> Very good.<a name=97:15></a> Sonship is particularly heavenly, although eternal life as <i>we</i> have it is on the heavenly line too, in contrast to the millennial day, where it will be particularly seen in relation to the earth, and the earthly order of things.<a name=97:16></a> Eternal life as we have it in the assembly is on the heavenly line, but its bearing is on the condition of things here.<a name=97:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:22></a> Yes, exactly, so that there is a testimony in life in the saints through their enjoyment of it in the sphere of life as it is contemplated in this great thought of eternal life.<a name=97:23></a> Eternal life underlies the whole position here.<a name=97:24></a> It underlies all the meetings, underlies the service of God.<a name=97:25></a> Properly speaking it is a land thought; it belongs to the land, but it underlies the whole position of testimony as you referred to it here.<a name=97:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=98:5></a> Yes.<a name=98:6></a> This whole chapter is to draw us into the environment of heaven although we are still on earth.<a name=98:7></a> One of the things that is so affecting in this chapter is the way the Lord speaks, as if the geographical setting did not exist.<a name=98:8></a> He says, "and now I come to thee" -- a remarkable statement on His part as to His going to the Father.<a name=98:9></a> This whole section from <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>to this chapter is filled with the thought of His going to the Father, which of course involves the cross, and the grave and His rising again, and ascension; but the Lord speaks of it as if He would draw us into the immediate environment of it and into heaven in that way.<a name=98:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=98:14></a> Yes.<a name=98:15></a> He would draw us into His restfulness, His peace, His joy in the position that He was in; we are left with all the richness of that legacy.<a name=98:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=98:17></a>H.<a name=98:18></a> Is the contrasting thought of eternal life somewhat confirmed in the expression "the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"?<a name=98:19></a> The only true God?<a name=98:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=98:21></a> Yes.<a name=98:22></a> It would stand against what is false, do you think?<a name=98:23></a> It has a relative bearing on what would be around in regard to the multiplicity of gods, "there are gods many and lords many", so that we have an economical reference here in the statement "this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=98:24></a> It is an economical reference; the divine arrangement is in mind, in the only true God as seen in the Father, and Jesus Christ the sent One.<a name=98:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=99:13></a> The thought in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>is to draw our attention to the position of it, where it is positionally, and life in its entirety is positionally in the Son.<a name=99:14></a> The believer has it of course; as John presents the truth the saints have it, but in its entirety John presents it positionally in that exalted position; not in heaven exactly, but in the Son, a wonderful reference to the dignity and glory of its position, so that it would involve divine affections, while eternal life does not involve the family side so much as God and men, yet it involves divine affections, so that the testimony to the eternal life came out in the Lord Jesus in His living relations with the Father.<a name=99:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=99:19></a> There we have the thought of life in an operative way.<a name=99:20></a> Eternal life is not exactly life in an operative way, but points to a sphere of life that is linked with the knowledge of divine Persons.<a name=99:21></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>the verse you allude to brings life before us and conveys, as you say, the highest presentation of life in John's gospel on the operative side -- I mean operative in the sense that it affects us.<a name=99:22></a> We live because He lives, but eternal life is another thought.<a name=99:23></a>

		First, the inaugural side in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, where the assembly is formed by the Spirit, coming as He does.<a name=114:4></a> There is something about the inaugural side that we should never lose sight of, as important principles are set out in regard to ministry and the truth.<a name=114:5></a> The Spirit is helping us to reach consciously in some way what existed at the beginning, although publicly the difference is great, because of the breakdown; there is a glory about the pristine setting in the beginning that we do not have publicly at the end.<a name=114:6></a> But the consideration of what is here in chapter 2 -- the coming of the Holy Spirit, the weight and authority of the speaking, and perseverance in the teaching -- are all prime features that should now engage us.<a name=114:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 15, where the saints are gathered together, the operation of the ministry is seen in the remarkable way in which different ones speak prophetically, thereby promoting unity amongst the brethren.<a name=114:8></a> There was no evidence in what they said of any divergent views, although

	<div class="paragraph">
		These verses in chapter 2 should impress us with the manner of the speaking.<a name=115:2></a> Two things enter into the authority of the ministry (peculiarly set out in the apostles) which are conveyed in the two words employed in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>for authority and power.<a name=115:3></a> One word links authority with the commission given to the apostles, and the other links with ability, by the Spirit, to speak and to set out the truth.<a name=115:4></a> These two features of authority and power are important to notice, and they are seen in the Lord Himself in the gospels.<a name=115:5></a>

		S.McC.<a name=151:11></a> I think it helps us to see the power and authority which becomes a great strength and a bulwark in the operation of things in the assembly.<a name=151:12></a> The assembly, from one way in which the kingdom may be viewed, is within this realm where the full administrative authority of Christ, hidden in the heavens, is seen.<a name=151:13></a> It helps us in the working out of things in the assembly so that we should not come under the snare of the fear of man.<a name=151:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=152:12></a> I think Matthew helps us throughout in discipleship.<a name=152:13></a> It is introduced in the different chapters, because discipleship involves that we are not in the things of God in a haphazard way -- one day up and the next day down, one week in things and the next week out of things.<a name=152:14></a> Discipleship involves education, training, and discipline, so that we become reliable persons who are amenable to the teaching and to the truth, and who allow all its authority in their souls.<a name=152:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=152:25></a> That is what is in mind.<a name=152:26></a> The passage draws attention to the great legislative position, as has often been alluded to by our beloved brother, Mr.<a name=152:27></a> Taylor.<a name=152:28></a> The Lord on the mount is taking up the legislative side and setting out the <i>spirit</i> that should mark us with the result that we are <i>different</i> from others.<a name=152:29></a> The subjects of the kingdom are to be different from other persons.<a name=152:30></a>

		assembly.<a name=186:1></a> This subject is brought up in connection with these two women in John's gospel, and one is concerned, in view of what was said last night, that we should approach it not so much in a doctrinal manner, but from the side of spiritual power.<a name=186:2></a> We would not in any sense minimise the importance of doctrine, for the Lord Himself says in this gospel, "My doctrine is not mine, but that of him that has sent me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:16">John  7:16</a>).<a name=186:3></a> It is thought, however, that we might get help in approaching our subject from the side of spiritual feeling and power, having in mind the teaching that comes out in the Lord's service to these women.<a name=186:4></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>it is brought in by the Lord in such an informal yet remarkable way.<a name=186:5></a> It is noteworthy that the Spirit is stressed at this particular juncture as the thought of the service of God is approached.<a name=186:6></a> Power is needed for this, and we are all tested as to just what we have reached in the way of experience in the conscious sense of the Spirit being with us and in us, and whether we make room for Him and the great order of things suggested in the "springing up into eternal life".<a name=186:7></a> I thought we might get help in considering it this morning from this viewpoint and perhaps this afternoon we might see the assembly in relation to it in the different settings in the epistles.<a name=186:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=186:9></a>M.<a name=186:10></a> Is the approach in John's gospel on the basis of the family of God?<a name=186:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=186:12></a> Yes.<a name=186:13></a> It is remarkable how John would impress us with the thought of the family of God right from the outset.<a name=186:14></a> His distinctive touches regarding it contrast with the synoptic gospels in a remarkable way.<a name=186:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=186:16></a>M.<a name=186:17></a> Would you say that we have to approach the service of God having in mind our relations with one another in the family of God?<a name=186:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=186:19></a> Just so.<a name=186:20></a> Love comes into John's writings in such a wonderful way as it is seen in divine Persons and in the family of God.<a name=186:21></a> We shall never arrive at the truth rightly unless we do so from this basis, because the thought of the family of God promotes confidence in one another and strengthens our links with one another.<a name=186:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:2></a> That is a very striking expression and we should note the word "Exousia" in the footnote.<a name=187:3></a> This is a remarkable word because it would seem as if, from the standpoint of what was moving in Jerusalem in relation to the Lord's presence and ministry, the Spirit of God would emphasise the legality of the position of the family of God.<a name=187:4></a> Whatever the Jews, the priests and the levites may take away from them, the Spirit of God emphasises the legality of the position of the family of God.<a name=187:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		-- .<a name=187:6></a>G.<a name=187:7></a> Is there a fine distinction between "flesh's will" and "man's will", the second perhaps being more difficult to be relieved of in regard to the service of God?<a name=187:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:9></a> It is important that we should see the fine distinctions made by John.<a name=187:10></a> We would have put them all together, but John says; "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=187:11></a> I think it is important to see how 'will', in whatever way it may be viewed, is put out of court in the light of the family of God.<a name=187:12></a> In considering the worship of God in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, the Lord's words to the woman would impress us with the necessity for a right apprehension of Christ objectively coupled with a right apprehension and a conscious enjoyment of the Spirit, as in the living water.<a name=187:13></a> John the Baptist's reference to Christ in the end of chapter 3 is unique.<a name=187:14></a> He is a man whose joy is fulfilled, and we are thus in the presence of something that is completed.<a name=187:15></a> It was said of John the Baptist, when in his mother's womb, that the babe leaped for joy as Elizabeth saluted Mary, the mother of our Lord, but here we are in the presence, not of the beginning of his joy, but of its completion in the introduction of the bride and the bridegroom.<a name=187:16></a> The bride has an essential part in regard to the service of God, but in John's ministry it is introduced informally.<a name=187:17></a> An allusion was made last night to the way in which John refers to it and how it forms a special part of his ministry, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom".<a name=187:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=187:19></a>G.<a name=187:20></a> Is it not characteristic of John's ministry that he gives us the truth informally?<a name=187:21></a> Without exactly naming it, he gives us the thing vitally in the power of the Spirit.<a name=187:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:1></a> That helps us today in our approach to the service of God as seen in connection with the assembly, because we are so inclined to approach it from an academic standpoint, whilst John emphasises the great matter of life.<a name=188:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=188:3></a> Do you think that John, in bringing in the family, has in mind to sweep away the ecclesiastical system so that God may be ministered to according to Himself?<a name=188:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:5></a> Just so.<a name=188:6></a> We were speaking of ecclesiastical unrighteousness, and righteousness yesterday.<a name=188:7></a> We can see in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>how the counter-movements from Jerusalem are baffled by what is coming in from heaven.<a name=188:8></a> They do not understand and are in perplexity as to what the truth is.<a name=188:9></a> The Spirit of God, through John the evangelist, stresses the legal position of the family of God, the children of God.<a name=188:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=188:11></a>C.<a name=188:12></a> It seems striking that the worship of the Father and of God, in this chapter and in chapter 20, is communicated to a woman, where the Lord says, "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=188:13></a> Could you help us as to the thought of the family and the idea of a woman coming in?<a name=188:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:15></a> I think there is something to be noted in the fact that the most wonderful touches as to the service of God and the worship of God come to us through the Lord's service to two women, one of whom He serves as a Prophet and the other as a Teacher, "Rabboni".<a name=188:16></a> We are not seeking to discredit the twelve in any sense, but it is illuminating that, in John's ministry, which bears on the last days, the official element is not in the foreground, but rather what is informal and unofficial, as suggested in these two women who remind us of the assembly.<a name=188:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=188:18></a>G.<a name=188:19></a> Are you suggesting that affection, as suggested in a woman, is a necessary basis for the truth, but affection that needs to be delivered from an unlawful object and centred on a lawful object, that is Christ?<a name=188:20></a> Her affections become governed by the intelligence the teacher would afford.<a name=188:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:22></a> That is exactly what is in mind.<a name=188:23></a> The introduction of the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, immediately following <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, is significant on account of the unique reference

		to Jesus in verse 1 of chapter 4.<a name=189:1></a> It is unique.<a name=189:2></a> John has not used the word "Lord" before, "When therefore the <i>Lord</i>".<a name=189:3></a> Others call Him "Rabbi" and speak to Him in that light, but in chapter 3: 35, it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", which indicates that the economy in a formal way, and administration are committed to the Son.<a name=189:4></a> It then says, "When therefore the <i>Lord</i> knew".<a name=189:5></a> That is, we get the administrative side impressed on our minds which is followed by the woman coming into our view.<a name=189:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=189:7></a>C.<a name=189:8></a> Is your thought that the Lord's service, in a prophetic way, disentangles the woman, sets her affections on a legitimate object, and makes way for the positive teaching of <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>?<a name=189:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:10></a> Just so.<a name=189:11></a> We shall never arrive at the fulness of the truth as to the worship of God, unless Christ personally and objectively, and the Spirit, have a right place in our affections and in our minds.<a name=189:12></a> Mr.<a name=189:13></a> Taylor, years ago, in referring to John the Baptist's statement, "he that has the bride is the bridegroom", asked how the bride came in?<a name=189:14></a> Did she come in through baptism or through the Lord's supper?<a name=189:15></a> She comes in through the apprehension of the greatness of Christ and the power of the Spirit.<a name=189:16></a> John the Baptist's testimony bearing on the greatness of Christ is followed by what we have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=189:17></a> "Come see a man", shows how that Man eclipsed the woman's affections -- that is Christ Himself.<a name=189:18></a> Then there is the living water; the Spirit in His energetic movements and service to us, having in mind the order of things indicated in eternal life and the worship of God.<a name=189:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:23></a> Yes.<a name=189:24></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>reminds us of the mediatorial system, and John's gospel shows the essential need of that system.<a name=189:25></a> "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth.<a name=189:26></a>" That verse brings out the necessity for the mediatorial system, and the mediatorship of Christ which is referred to so much in this gospel.<a name=189:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=190:5></a> Yes, I think what you say is important: the whole economy has been designed that we might know the God whom we worship.<a name=190:6></a> The relations the economy brings before us are that we should know the God whom we worship.<a name=190:7></a> That is why God has come out in these specified relations indicated in the Father and the Son.<a name=190:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=190:12></a> We do.<a name=190:13></a> It is unique here.<a name=190:14></a> As John opens his gospel he would impress us with the way God has tangibly come within our range.<a name=190:15></a> God is a Spirit and this necessitates the mediatorial system.<a name=190:16></a> What comes to light in it is that God has drawn near so as to be apprehended and known in a tangible way.<a name=190:17></a> "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>) has in mind that we should know God tangibly and this reference, "the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life", stresses tangibility in the Spirit.<a name=190:18></a>

		S.McC.<a name=190:22></a> That is why John writes so distinctively of the unique place Christ has in sonship and all the spiritual excellence that is linked with it as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>, and here in the reference to the living water becoming in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.<a name=190:23></a> We are tested as to what we know of God come so near to us tangibly in the economy.<a name=190:24></a>

		in most cases where there is disaffection as to the truth, a moral issue underlies, and I am sure that the Lord would help us to be like this woman and be affected by things tangibly.<a name=191:1></a> We are so prone, I speak for myself, to approach the worship of God from an academic standpoint and to try to work out things just from the principle of light.<a name=191:2></a> That is important, but we want to get an impression as to the tangibility of God who, although He is a Spirit, has come within our range in the mediatorial system in Christ as Man.<a name=191:3></a>

		I have in mind to speak on the thought of divine affection as the portion, refuge, and stay, of our hearts in difficult and testing circumstances.<a name=223:1></a> You will notice that in all the passages read, allusion is made to this thought of divine affection; the love of the Father in the first, the love of Christ in the second, and the love of the Spirit in the last -- in their fulness representing to us the love of God known in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<a name=223:2></a> And yet these passages, dear brethren, remind us of the distinctiveness of each of the Persons of the Trinity in relation to Their position in the economy into which they have come and in which they are known, and particularly, as I have said, viewed as the known portion and stay of the saints.<a name=223:3></a> Other passages indicate to us divine love operating through divine Persons in relation to Themselves, and to and for Their own pleasure and delight.<a name=223:4></a> But these passages are particularly affecting because they represent how love seen in relation to each of the Persons is the known portion, support, and stay, of our hearts.<a name=223:5></a>

		and we by Him.<a name=232:1></a> He says, "I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ", as if all the power linked with that official position, that official Name, would enter into this matter of ministry and its prosperity among the saints, and allied with it the love of the Spirit; on the one hand the power and authority linked with the official Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and on the other the resourcefulness of the love of the Spirit.<a name=232:2></a> Oh, to see, dear brethren, the intimate links between the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the mediatorial operations so well known by Paul that he says, "I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers".<a name=232:3></a> How we need to strive in prayers in regard to the ministry, so that the minister and those who serve in the ministry might be saved from those that do not believe.<a name=232:4></a> Think of his holy concern -- striving together!<a name=232:5></a> It is not a question of striving together in argument, or arguing the pros and cons of the ministry or the truth.<a name=232:6></a> Paul is bringing in the resources of the mediatorial realm, enlisting the sympathies of the saints, that they strive together with him in prayers according to God.<a name=232:7></a> What need there is at all times, in view of the prosperity of the truth, for the saints to strive in prayers.<a name=232:8></a> Striving -- think of the force of the expression, the love of the Spirit entering into it, as if the Spirit is so available, His love so near, that it is a known resource and stay to be brought into this matter, all operating in view of the prosperity of the minister and the ministry.<a name=232:9></a> How much we attach to argument and logical reasoning.<a name=232:10></a> Would that we knew more of repairing into these known resources, as such a minister as Paul must do, on our faces before God and the Lord Jesus, striving in prayer that all the truth may come out and may be entered upon.<a name=232:11></a> It has come out, and it is important that it should be entered on, and that room should be made for the Spirit to help us.<a name=232:12></a>

		I wish to present to you, dear brethren, certain particular lights in which the Holy Spirit is presented in John's writings.<a name=233:2></a> John has an exceptional way of speaking of the Holy Spirit, which has a special bearing upon ourselves, John's writings having especially the closing days in mind.<a name=233:3></a> The presence of the Holy Spirit in the assembly, and as indwelling believers, is of course the great characteristic feature of Christianity, and the truth as to the Spirit occupies an important place in all the epistles.<a name=233:4></a> James refers to the Spirit in a most touching way.<a name=233:5></a> He says, "Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously?<a name=233:6></a>" Peter speaks of sanctification of the Spirit; he speaks of the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon one who is reproached in the Name of Christ.<a name=233:7></a> Jude speaks of the importance of praying in the Holy Spirit and keeping ourselves in the love of God.<a name=233:8></a> But Paul, to whom is given the light of the assembly and to whom it was given to complete the word of God, speaks very largely of the Holy Spirit.<a name=233:9></a> In the epistle to the Romans, for instance, he brings in the Spirit in many ways -- the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us; the Spirit being the power, and the alone power, by which we can fulfil every righteous obligation; the Spirit, too, being the power by which we can mortify the deeds of the

		body and so live.<a name=234:1></a> Indeed, the Spirit is life, as it is said, on account of righteousness, and moreover, the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<a name=234:2></a> In Corinthians the Spirit has a very large place necessarily -- in the first epistle especially, and in the second epistle presented as the anointing, and the earnest, and the seal; then there is that remarkable expression at the end of the epistle, the communion of the Holy Spirit.<a name=234:3></a> In the epistle to the Galatians, how important is the place that the Holy Spirit has -- the Spirit of liberty, the Spirit of God's Son.<a name=234:4></a> In the epistle to the Ephesians the earnest of the inheritance, and the One by whom we have access to the Father, and the Father's Spirit strengthening us in the inner man that we may be able to apprehend the whole expanse of what the Father has in His thoughts.<a name=234:5></a> What wondrous grace, dear brethren, that the Father's Spirit should be operating in our hearts with that in mind.<a name=234:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We might enlarge upon the place that the Holy Spirit has in the various epistles, and yet it will be found that John's writings give the Holy Spirit a place and present Him in certain lights which are peculiar to John.<a name=234:7></a> I suppose we may say that Paul's service was to present the whole extent of the truth of God in a formal way in doctrine, and as we have said, he completed the word of God.<a name=234:8></a> But then John is raised up, as one has said years ago, as a reserve man.<a name=234:9></a> He is raised up having in view days when the truth, established through Paul's ministry, would be given up, and the public position would be in ruins.<a name=234:10></a> The things of God are to go through notwithstanding.<a name=234:11></a> The work of God is not going to fall to the ground, and so John ministers in view of days when the truth is recovered -- not in outward recovery in a general way, but on the principle of life.<a name=234:12></a> John does not name things formally, but he gives us the truth vitally, held in persons who are going on with the Lord and with the Spirit.<a name=234:13></a> In that setting he has a certain way of his own of presenting the Spirit of God, that we may be fully assured that, in the presence with us of the Holy Spirit, we have all that is needed to go through to completion, notwithstanding the difficult conditions that obtain in the last days.<a name=234:14></a> You remember that Paul in writing to Timothy, contemplating days of

	<div class="paragraph">
		departure, all in Asia having forsaken him, said, "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him".<a name=235:1></a> I have no doubt he referred to the fact that, when everything was outwardly going to ruins, he so to speak handed back to the Lord the ministry that had been entrusted to himself, and said, I am assured that He will see it through.<a name=235:2></a> I believe we may say humbly, dear brethren, that we are living in days when the Lord is making good that confidence that Paul reposed in Him, the Spirit is making it good; so that whatever Paul brought out in his ministry is being recovered and held among the saints in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=235:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I start with John's letter to the seven assemblies.<a name=235:4></a> The fact that he is writing to seven local assemblies shows that he has in mind not merely the statement of the truth in a kind of doctrinal way, but that there should be an answer to the truth.<a name=235:5></a> It is important, I believe, to bear in mind, in relation to local assemblies, that it is in the localities that there is (or there is not) an answer to the truth.<a name=235:6></a> The truth should come into expression in localities, and John is writing to seven local assemblies, doubtless intended to represent the whole assembly in its responsible setting.<a name=235:7></a> He presents the Lord walking in the midst of the seven local assemblies, taking account of conditions that He finds there, passing an appraisement upon them, commending what He can commend, but alas, finding much that He has to condemn.<a name=235:8></a> John in writing to the assemblies says, "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come.<a name=235:9></a>" That is, he is presenting God majestically, because he has in mind opposition to the truth rising to its height.<a name=235:10></a> He is contemplating, as this book shows as we proceed, the full development of lawlessness, and power accompanying it, in opposition to the truth.<a name=235:11></a> Having that in mind he presents God majestically.<a name=235:12></a> "Him who is".<a name=235:13></a> That cannot be said of any <i>man</i>.<a name=235:14></a> God IS absolutely; as the Lord Jesus, who is in His Person God, said, "Before Abraham was, I AM".<a name=235:15></a> He stands out majestically as the One who is.<a name=235:16></a> What is man in contrast to that?<a name=235:17></a> He is so to speak but a shadow.<a name=235:18></a> His life may last seventy, eighty, or a hundred years, but

		that is all, and what is that in the presence of Him who IS?<a name=236:1></a> "And who was".<a name=236:2></a> That is what He has proved Himself to be historically.<a name=236:3></a> He who could support a man like Daniel, who could support Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego -- Him who was -- the God who has proved Himself in history.<a name=236:4></a> "And who is to come".<a name=236:5></a> John says, "and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ".<a name=236:6></a> This is something that Paul never does.<a name=236:7></a> This is something peculiar to John.<a name=236:8></a> Paul in his epistles says consistently, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=236:9></a>" John says, "Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come" -- that is God -- "and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne".<a name=236:10></a> He invokes grace and peace upon the saints from the Spirit of God, and he even puts Him before the Lord Jesus -- I will say in a minute why I believe this is so -- not in any sense to interfere with the order in which the Persons of the Godhead stand in the economy, which is the Father first, the Son second, and the Holy Spirit third.<a name=236:11></a> We can see that is right, because the Son sends the Spirit as well as the Father sending Him.<a name=236:12></a> Nevertheless, here John, in the liberty that there is in the Holy Spirit, not only does what Paul never does, invokes the Spirit to afford grace and peace to the saints, but he even puts Him before the Lord.<a name=236:13></a> Why is that?<a name=236:14></a> Is it not, dear brethren, that he is giving peculiar place in our minds to the Holy Spirit of God as the great support, the great standby of the saints in the last days, and so he says, the seven Spirits which are before His throne.<a name=236:15></a> That does not mean that they are in heaven.<a name=236:16></a> Of course, when we come to speak of any One of the Persons of the Godhead, we cannot limit Him by questions of location.<a name=236:17></a> We cannot say that One of Them is on earth and therefore not in heaven, or anything of that sort; so that "the seven Spirits which are before his throne" means that the Spirit in fulness of power is here with the saints in order to support the throne of God.<a name=236:18></a> Everything that affects the rights of God, everything that challenges His rights, every issue as to the truth whatever it may be -- the Spirit is here, the Spirit, who is God, is here personally in fulness of power to support the throne.<a name=236:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a great thing that is, beloved brethren.<a name=237:1></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#59:19">Isaiah  59:19</a>, "When the adversary shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a banner against him.<a name=237:2></a>" The great resource of the saints is the Spirit of God.<a name=237:3></a> Indeed, in John's writings, we have two great supports that we can fall back upon.<a name=237:4></a> In the 13th of John it says, the Lord, "knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end".<a name=237:5></a> It is as though the moment having come for Him to depart, He so to speak took up that attitude of mind and let them know it, that one thing that they could rely upon through everything -- through thick and thin as we say -- was His own love, the love of Christ.<a name=237:6></a> We were having it yesterday -- that nothing can separate us from it.<a name=237:7></a> In the 14th chapter He introduces the Comforter, to be with us for ever and to be in us.<a name=237:8></a> He is giving us a second resource that we can rely upon whatever arises in the course of the testimony here.<a name=237:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John puts the Spirit before the Lord here, and I believe for this reason, that he would establish us first of all in the sense that the Spirit, who is God Himself, is here to carry the testimony right through in power that cannot be overcome.<a name=237:10></a> On what lines is it to be carried through?<a name=237:11></a> It is committed to the saints, because the testimony is committed to men.<a name=237:12></a> It is committed to the Spirit it is true, but it is the saints that are being used in testimony.<a name=237:13></a> It is we to whom God has given the great privilege of being committed to the truth and to carry it through not only in word but in life, right through to the end.<a name=237:14></a> The testimony is entrusted in grace to men, but on what lines is it to go through?<a name=237:15></a> It is to go through on lines of suffering, and so he says, "from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness" -- faithful even unto death.<a name=237:16></a> He is the firstborn from the dead.<a name=237:17></a> Moreover, He is the prince of the kings of the earth.<a name=237:18></a> I understand, dear brethren, that it is a question of the truth going through in testimony right to the end.<a name=237:19></a> The Spirit of God, who is God, here in the scene of testimony and conflict to carry it through in divine power.<a name=237:20></a> The manner in which it is to go through is in faithfulness in manhood, even though it is faithfulness unto death.<a name=237:21></a> He

		is Jesus Christ, the faithful witness; He has gone through.<a name=238:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not enlarge on the doxology that immediately follows.<a name=238:2></a> It is a touching thing, beloved brethren, that when God is presented, or the Lord Jesus, in the scriptures we so often get these doxologies.<a name=238:3></a> I think it is a challenge to one, perhaps a challenge to us all, as to how we hold the truth; whether we just hold it in correctness of terms, or whether we hold it in affection for God and for Christ, and you might say for the Spirit.<a name=238:4></a> Here the Lord is mentioned as the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.<a name=238:5></a> John says, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=238:6></a>" He has washed us from our sins in His blood.<a name=238:7></a> That is to say, we are never to return to them, dear brethren.<a name=238:8></a> Sin is lawlessness, and sins are just the accumulation and detail of the lawlessnesses, the way in which lawlessness is worked out in detail with every one of us, and He has washed us from our sins in His blood.<a name=238:9></a> We are never to return to the principle of lawlessness.<a name=238:10></a> He has washed us from it in His blood, in order that He may hold us as a kingdom, under His own protection and His own administration, in view of the service of God.<a name=238:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I really had in mind is the way the Spirit is presented in John's writings, and so there is this remarkable expression, the seven Spirits before the throne.<a name=238:12></a> We get more than once in the book of Revelation the seven Spirits of God, showing that the Spirit is here in fulness of divine power to meet every exigency that arises.<a name=238:13></a> It may be that the fact that he says, "the seven Spirits", and there are seven assemblies, is in order to bring home to us in our several localities, however weak the position may be outwardly, that the Spirit in fulness of power is available to us in that locality.<a name=238:14></a> The testimony is in localities, and the Spirit is here commensurate to the demands and requirements of the testimony.<a name=238:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I proceed, let me just allude to what is well-known, how at the end of each of the seven addresses to the assemblies we have the word, "He that has an ear, let
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=239>[Page 239]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"; the Spirit speaking to the assemblies.<a name=239:1></a> In each of these addresses the Lord is dealing with the particular conditions that He finds in the assembly which He is addressing.<a name=239:2></a> In five out of the seven He has something to condemn.<a name=239:3></a> In Smyrna and in Philadelphia He has nothing to condemn, but whether He has something to condemn or not, He finishes with this: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the <i>assemblies</i>".<a name=239:4></a> That is to say, the Lord will adjust things in a locality according to the conditions that He finds there, but having adjusted them He has in mind that that locality, with all the others, should link on with the universal trend of the Spirit's ministry.<a name=239:5></a> The Spirit has a voice to "assemblies", in the plural, and he that has an ear is to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.<a name=239:6></a> That of course requires spiritual discernment on our side.<a name=239:7></a> It involves also that there should be with us a recognition of leadership in the ministry.<a name=239:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps one could just add in relation to what we have been saying as to the Spirit presented as power to support the rights of God -- as the brethren will remember -- in the 12th chapter of Luke the Lord is contemplating the saints having to appear before rulers or authorities and to give an answer in respect of their faith.<a name=239:9></a> He tells them not to prepare beforehand what they should say, for, He says, "The Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said".<a name=239:10></a> That is just an example of the way the Spirit is presented in this expression, the seven Spirits before His throne.<a name=239:11></a> It is a question of the rights of God being maintained; it may be the refusal to do something which conscience will not allow one to do, but whatever it is, it is a question of the rights of God, of the rights of the throne, and the Spirit is here to support in that relation, and the Lord says, "The Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said".<a name=239:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now coming to John's epistle, this has not in mind our public position in testimony, but our enjoyment consciously of eternal life.<a name=239:13></a> The apostle is speaking of Jesus the Son of God.<a name=239:14></a> "This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.<a name=239:15></a> And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		truth.<a name=240:1></a>" He then speaks of the three that agree in one witness.<a name=240:2></a> "For they that bear witness are three; the Spirit (putting the Spirit first), and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one.<a name=240:3></a>" They agree in one witness, they all point to one thing, and the witness they agree in is this, as we read later on, "that God has given to us eternal life: and this life is in his Son".<a name=240:4></a> Now this is a remarkable expression, "This is he that came by water and blood".<a name=240:5></a> He is referring to the death of Christ.<a name=240:6></a> He came deliberately to die, in order that in the power of His death we might be set apart from all that attached to us as responsible in flesh and blood here, in order that we might be given life in God's Son.<a name=240:7></a> Not by water only, the apostle says.<a name=240:8></a> If it were water only, it might be regarded as reforming the first man, as an effort to purify and cleanse the first man.<a name=240:9></a> That of course is what the religious world is full of.<a name=240:10></a> He says by water and blood.<a name=240:11></a> I know that the blood meets the claims of God and effects expiation, but this is a cleansing that is effected by mean of death, and nothing less than death.<a name=240:12></a> The blood witnesses to that, that the death of Christ vicariously meant the ending of the man.<a name=240:13></a> I know that all will probably accept that as right teaching, but I wonder whether we have all <i>honestly</i> accepted it.<a name=240:14></a> We ought to accept it; we are not genuine if we do not; it is part of the gospel.<a name=240:15></a> Have we really accepted it, that the first man has been ended vicariously in the death of Jesus, in order that God might give us life by the Spirit in His Son?<a name=240:16></a> Is not that wonderful?<a name=240:17></a> Is not it a great liberation?<a name=240:18></a> Is not it dignifying, to think of God's thought, what God has set us up in?<a name=240:19></a> He has given us eternal life and we are set up before God in His Son, as it says later in this very chapter, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ".<a name=240:20></a> We have a fixed place in the love of God in the Person of His Son; we are set up before Him in His Son.<a name=240:21></a> God has not come in to patch up the first man.<a name=240:22></a> He has come in in Christ to end his history in death, in order that, receiving the testimony brought to us in the gospel, we might receive the Holy Spirit and be set up before Him in life in His Son.<a name=240:23></a> The way God has met the

		situation that came in through the devil is by entering into the situation Himself, first in the Person of Christ and then in the Person of the Spirit.<a name=241:1></a> The more you think about it the more wonderful it becomes, that God Himself has entered into the situation, first by bringing in Christ and then by giving the Spirit.<a name=241:2></a> God takes us completely out of one order of things and sets us up before Him eternally in His beloved Son.<a name=241:3></a> I say, that is a way that is worthy of God, and so he says, We know that the Son of God has come.<a name=241:4></a> Oh, what bed-rock that is!<a name=241:5></a> "We know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true.<a name=241:6></a>" The true God stands out before our hearts in the light of His movements toward us in Christ, that we might know Him that is true.<a name=241:7></a> "And we are in him that is true.<a name=241:8></a>" He that dwells in love dwells in God, John says.<a name=241:9></a> You come more and more to the sense that we are embraced in God.<a name=241:10></a> " .<a name=241:11></a>.<a name=241:12></a>.<a name=241:13></a> in His son Jesus Christ.<a name=241:14></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=241:15></a> On the one hand He is God personally, and presents God to us in the light in which He has shone out; on the other hand He is the presentation in Himself as Man of the perfect answer to that.<a name=241:16></a> But now the Spirit witnesses to this.<a name=241:17></a> It is not a question of stating the truth objectively; the apostle has in mind that we should come consciously into the knowledge that we have eternal life.<a name=241:18></a> It is a question of conscious knowledge, and so he says the Spirit is the witness.<a name=241:19></a> He then says, "for the Spirit is the truth" -- a remarkable statement.<a name=241:20></a> In the gospel of John, Christ Himself is the truth objectively.<a name=241:21></a> In the epistle of John, the Spirit is the truth subjectively.<a name=241:22></a> I believe that is what we have to come to more and more, dear brethren.<a name=241:23></a> It is a question of the extent to which the Spirit personally controls our thoughts, and our affections.<a name=241:24></a> The more the Spirit has place with us in a practical way, controlling our thoughts and directing what we shall say in relation to the truth, the more we shall know it is the truth.<a name=241:25></a> If a brother stands up and is wholly controlled by the Spirit in his thoughts and words, you may rest assured that what he says is the truth.<a name=241:26></a> That is what is so urgent for us now, that we should arrive through exercise at the sensitiveness, each one of us for himself, that is able to discern what is

		I come now to this well-known passage in the 14th of John's gospel, because it is a most affecting one, and is intended to establish us in personal appreciation of the Comforter.<a name=242:3></a> "The Comforter" is a personal presentation of the Holy Spirit which is peculiar to John's writings.<a name=242:4></a> John, of course, refers to the Holy Spirit in many ways, but when we come to this chapter, in which he records, by the Spirit, the Lord's own words, we have this remarkable presentation of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter -- presented in a very personal way, and presented to us in this personal way by the Lord Himself.<a name=242:5></a> The Lord Himself is, if one may say so reverently, introducing us to the Spirit and commending Him to us.<a name=242:6></a> He would have us know Him and appreciate Him, indeed He says, Ye know Him.<a name=242:7></a> It raises the serious question whether we do.<a name=242:8></a> Evidently we are intended to know Him.<a name=242:9></a> The Lord is contemplating going away, leaving the disciples, and it is an interesting thing that in this chapter the Lord is seen speaking with the disciples, and the disciples speaking with Him, in the greatest liberty.<a name=242:10></a> They have difficulties; they do not understand everything, and so they express their difficulties and ask questions of the Lord.<a name=242:11></a> Thomas asks Him something, Philip asks Him something, and Judas, not Iscariot, asks Him something -- they are all at perfect liberty to ask the Lord as to difficulties they have, and He answers them.<a name=242:12></a> But now He was going away, and they would lose all that, and the Lord says, I will give you another Comforter.<a name=242:13></a> That is to say, I will give you the Spirit, who shall be to you what I have been to you.<a name=242:14></a> You have been able to ask Me questions, and you have got your questions answered, and you will be able to ask the Comforter questions, and you will get them answered.<a name=242:15></a> How could He be another Comforter in place of the Lord Jesus if that were not open to the disciples?<a name=242:16></a> Another Comforter to be with you for ever, and not only to be

		One more word and I close.<a name=245:10></a> We have this well-known passage in the last chapter, where the Lord presents Himself: "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the assemblies".<a name=245:11></a> He has not spoken in this intimate way before in the book.<a name=245:12></a> He presents Himself in the beginning in a judicial capacity, involving certain distance between Him and the beloved disciple John, so that when John saw Him he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=245:13></a> The Lord immediately reassured him, laying His right hand upon him and saying, "Fear not: I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold I am living to the ages of ages", but still there was that judicial presentation of Christ.<a name=245:14></a> But now we come to the end, and He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies.<a name=245:15></a> I am the root and offspring of David ".<a name=245:16></a> As dear Mr.<a name=245:17></a> Taylor has well said, the root is the gospel of John and the offspring is the gospel of Matthew.<a name=245:18></a> "And the bright and morning star.<a name=245:19></a> And the Spirit and the bride say.<a name=245:20></a> Come.<a name=245:21></a>" That is a presentation I think that is peculiar to John; the Spirit seen with the bride and the bride with the Spirit -- the Spirit and the bride.<a name=245:22></a> This is the culmination, that which we are coming to.<a name=245:23></a> The Spirit is seeking to get His place with us all, that there should be no hindrance whatever to our moving along with Him; nothing to hinder concerted movement with the Spirit, because He wants the Spirit and the bride to arrive at this point, that with just

		The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=246:15></a> It seems to me that this scripture brings together the two aspects that we had before us in the previous scriptures.<a name=246:16></a> On the one hand, the public aspect, and the word to the Lord Jesus to come is really to come in relation to public conditions in the world and take up His rights where they have been so long denied Him.<a name=246:17></a> The Spirit would urge us in that direction.<a name=246:18></a> But then I believe there is the private side, linking perhaps more with John's epistle and John's gospel, that we cry, Come, to the Lord Jesus because we want Him, and He wants us.<a name=246:19></a> The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=246:20></a> Then He says, "Let him that hears say, Come.<a name=246:21></a> And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely.<a name=246:22></a>" Another presentation of the Spirit peculiar to

		John's writings -- the water of life; what there is in a living way among the saints in the presence of the Holy Spirit here; the water of life refreshing and constantly fresh; the river of God, it says, is full of water -- no diminution.<a name=247:1></a> There is no lack of freshness, and that is what we should be concerned about in our local companies, that as having the Spirit there is a constant flow of that which is fresh and living, so that anyone who thirsts may take of the water of life freely.<a name=247:2></a>

		Well, beloved brethren, I trust what one has said may stimulate our interest in all that the Spirit is prepared to be to us in these closing days, and if there should be the slightest hesitation on the part of anyone here as to speaking to the Spirit of God, may the Lord deliver you from any such fear or hesitation.<a name=247:3></a> There is nothing whatever in scripture contrary to it.<a name=247:4></a> There is liberty for it -- where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.<a name=247:5></a> There is nothing whatever in scripture against it, and plenty in scripture to indicate that such a thing is pleasing to God; and the way the Lord presents the Comforter in the 14th chapter of John is the greatest possible inducement to us to avail ourselves of His presence and seek to cultivate an intimacy with Him which He will richly reward.<a name=247:6></a> May the Lord bless the word.<a name=247:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		am right in saying that Luke and John refer to it peculiarly as appreciating the preciousness of Christ as coming into circumstances where He could dwell among certain persons in a certain way.<a name=249:1></a> "Dwelt among us" -- the "us" is the circle of the lovers.<a name=249:2></a> There are other terms used by persons outside this circle: I might refer to the questions of the synoptic gospels -- <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:35">Matthew  13:35</a>, "Is not this the son of the carpenter?<a name=249:3></a>" -- a term of belittlement, with no love behind it.<a name=249:4></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#6:3">Mark  6:3</a>, "Is not this the carpenter?<a name=249:5></a>"; and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:22">Luke  4:22</a> "Is not this the son of Joseph?<a name=249:6></a>" They are all interrogations of belittlement, outside the circle of the lovers.<a name=249:7></a> One is concerned that we may all consciously locate ourselves within this circle, so that we have no need to say, "Is not this" -- but we may link on with those who said, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us .<a name=249:8></a>.<a name=249:9></a>.<a name=249:10></a> full of grace and truth".<a name=249:11></a>

		In chapter 2, there is no respect paid to Him -- scarcely patronage.<a name=249:12></a> Chapter 3 brings in a certain element of patronage, but little outside that.<a name=249:13></a> We come now to this woman to whom reference has been made, but in relation to whom one desires to say something, in order that Christ in the tenderness of His ways in wooing grace would lay hold of her in a suitable way, that she might be numbered among the lovers, for that is the end in view, and I would suggest that this is a beginning at the bottom.<a name=249:14></a> Many of us I believe have been guilty of an endeavour to begin at the top.<a name=249:15></a> God alone can do that -- as He must do, for if we are to be secured He must come down, come down to where we are, and this He has done in Jesus.<a name=249:16></a> So this dialogue proceeds, and what comes to light is most affecting; that the Lord Jesus, He who is earlier said by the lovers to be the Word -- the Word was God -- He is found here in quest of this person, content to accept the appellation "a Jew" -- a very limited term for anybody, but how much more so for One so glorious as He.<a name=249:17></a> He did not contradict the woman when she brought the name forward.<a name=249:18></a> Neither when she brought in the terms "mountain" and "Jerusalem" did He assume in His language to be anything outside the name she had accorded Him.<a name=249:19></a> This is an important matter, a matter that was enquired into this morning.<a name=249:20></a> There is a scripture which speaks of

		Him, that "If .<a name=250:1></a>.<a name=250:2></a>.<a name=250:3></a> he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest".<a name=250:4></a> "For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.<a name=250:5></a>" That explains to me why the Lord Jesus, great and glorious as He is, was free to come to the level of this woman's word "worship".<a name=250:6></a> Had He employed the other word, it would have betrayed something outside the tribe of Juda.<a name=250:7></a> The Lord did not in His circumstances here ever assume to what belonged to the sacerdotal circle.<a name=250:8></a> But oh, how much else comes into view, dear brethren; so that He in the presentation of matters to the woman is not exactly emphasising a system.<a name=250:9></a> He says, "The hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father".<a name=250:10></a> Why does He say that?<a name=250:11></a> For our sakes: as the writer says at the end of the book, "these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name".<a name=250:12></a> These things are written for us, and this particular term is to emphasise to us the fundamental necessity of known relationship before we can intelligently enter into matters pertaining to a system.<a name=250:13></a> I believe that is why John in this gospel does not refer formally to the assembly, but constantly urges the blessedness of relationships which are essential to its operations.<a name=250:14></a> This term, the Father, is one that the woman had never heard before in that mountain, and probably it was never heard in Jerusalem.<a name=250:15></a> The Lord takes her right away from both and touches something as to the elevated character of relationship in this word, the Father.<a name=250:16></a> "The hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father".<a name=250:17></a> He then says, "Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews".<a name=250:18></a> He keeps to her own language in order to attract her outside a system, false in its character of course, and to make her heart move in the direction of relationship.<a name=250:19></a> I believe, dear brethren (and I say this particularly for those who are growing up amongst us -- youths and maidens and young men and young women -- for with the modern course of schooling it becomes naturally easy to adopt terms) the basic essential is known and enjoyed relationship.<a name=250:20></a> If I may say it reverently, no one could ever

		But, as I said, expansion is in mind, and I come to chapter 20, and one is concerned that what is said about it may be suggestive in this direction.<a name=252:2></a> Oh, how Mary felt the loss of her Lord.<a name=252:3></a> One might say, she felt His absence.<a name=252:4></a> Do we feel it?<a name=252:5></a> Do we really feel, dear brethren, the way that Christ has gone out?<a name=252:6></a> She missed Him, and yet she needed teaching.<a name=252:7></a> If one may say so, the key-word in chapter 4 is connected with what is prophetic, because it has largely to do with the conscience.<a name=252:8></a> Chapter 20 is linked with teaching, and involves the affections and the mind.<a name=252:9></a> We must never divorce these -- never.<a name=252:10></a> There is a danger sometimes of doing this.<a name=252:11></a> The woman, when she is finished with the angels -- they do not seem to be able to help her -- makes a partial turn and she sees Jesus, but does not know it is He.<a name=252:12></a> The Lord was pleased with that movement, even though it was not full.<a name=252:13></a> Teaching is a gradual matter; learning, alas, with most of us is exceedingly slow, but I am not prepared to say it was slow with Mary, for she learned a tremendous amount in the course of one day.<a name=252:14></a> It is a problem sometimes as to whether some of us learn anything.<a name=252:15></a> She says to Him, "Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away".<a name=252:16></a> Now, I say brethren, the Lord was pleased with that remark, because it showed she was prepared to move, and He says, Mary.<a name=252:17></a> Now she turns right round -- we might say with her back even upon angels -- and her face (I say this reverently) looking straight into the face of Jesus.<a name=252:18></a> And what could she see, but this inexpressible love which pervades the circle of the lovers.<a name=252:19></a> Why does the Spirit say, Mary said to Him in Hebrew?<a name=252:20></a> There was another person who used this term, but it does not say he used it in Hebrew.<a name=252:21></a> My own impression is that it links on with this principle of expansion.<a name=252:22></a> It suggests the language of one who is prepared to move further.<a name=252:23></a> Yes, prepared to move further, and still needing help to do it.<a name=252:24></a> Who is to give it to her if it is not the Object of her affections?<a name=252:25></a> See how expanding all this is -- you might say compressed into a very few verses -- but it suggests to us

		The Lord says, in effect, it does not come this way.<a name=253:3></a> Mary.<a name=253:4></a> You must let Me alone, you must not touch Me, but you must go to the circle of the lovers, for they need expansion as well as you, and you will get more as you find your place amongst them.<a name=253:5></a> He then gives her this message as we had it this afternoon, "Go to my brethren".<a name=253:6></a> That is a remarkable statement.<a name=253:7></a> Many are in danger of analysing these expressions, "My God and your God", without embracing in the holiest of affections and subjection, the grandeur of the statement, "My brethren".<a name=253:8></a> Jesus claims us at the level of His own kindred, so that in a certain way all that is His is ours.<a name=253:9></a> I say, in a certain way; there are things which are His and not ours, but He is asserting here that what is His in the blessedness of these wonderful relationships is to be ours; it is ours.<a name=253:10></a> "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God.<a name=253:11></a>" If we were expanded in relation to this, could we afford to reduce Him to the level of a creature, and never think of Him in His Own essential relationship and position?<a name=253:12></a> The thought is foreign to any lover of Christ.<a name=253:13></a> We need expansion in this direction, for it is love that is asserting itself in relation to His kindred.<a name=253:14></a> Think of ourselves here, every one who loves Christ; He would claim us and own us as His own kindred, in view of our sharing and enjoying with Him as far as is possible what He has Himself.<a name=253:15></a> Does not that make matters attractive to us?<a name=253:16></a> This is not the bottom, dear brethren, oh no!<a name=253:17></a> There is no time in the shortness of the period allowed for a meeting like this to deal with the stages.<a name=253:18></a> You might say that the Lord Jesus is about to go to the top, and as He is doing that He is asserting this great matter.<a name=253:19></a> It is the answer I believe to the teaching of the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying, but not now in a figure but in love's assertion.<a name=253:20></a> I wonder sometimes if we really receive it.<a name=253:21></a> We need the Spirit to enjoy it; do not let us overlook that.<a name=253:22></a> Nevertheless the assertion is made by Jesus Himself, and it stands, whether I enjoy it or not.<a name=253:23></a> Thank

		God the Spirit has taken His abode in us in order that we may enjoy it.<a name=254:1></a> As we make use of the Spirit in relation to the enjoyment of this precious setting, we shall find it very easy to fit ourselves into the service of the system connected with Christ in glory, for once our Lord terminates the condition of flesh and blood, He takes up His place as the great Priest who has passed through the heavens, and the whole matter of system service then begins to develop.<a name=254:2></a> I say again, our part in service in that way, in its liberty and freshness, is dependent on the measure of our joy in our normal relationships in this holy circle of love.<a name=254:3></a>

		I come now to this touch in Revelation.<a name=254:4></a> The Lord is addressing the assembly in Philadelphia at the level of love -- not correction.<a name=254:5></a> The more we enjoy our place in love's circle, the more we shall appreciate the matter of expansion, and so the Lord speaks, as He does, to the overcomer in Philadelphia of this very principle.<a name=254:6></a> He had never said anything like this before.<a name=254:7></a> It comes into expression here with those who are enjoying love's circle and are to be expanded in it, because of what is to accrue to God, for our association with Christ, while it goes right through and abides eternally, has in view something distinctly for God Himself.<a name=254:8></a> Because these brethren were in the joy of this association, they were empowered to keep His word and not deny His Name.<a name=254:9></a> Now He says, "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God".<a name=254:10></a> This word temple is the shrine.<a name=254:11></a> In the days of His flesh, our Lord kept His place, and is not referred to as in the shrine at any time, but as having gone up; everything is open to the saints.<a name=254:12></a> When He speaks of the shrine in the days of His flesh it refers to the temple of His body -- the greatest mystery to the Jews, the religious people, but not to His lovers.<a name=254:13></a> "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God".<a name=254:14></a> This word pillar not only suggests stability, but ornamentation, and it just seems to indicate that expansion involves ornamentation in the service of God.<a name=254:15></a> We use the word refinement, and that enters into it.<a name=254:16></a> Then He says, "I will write upon him the name of my God".<a name=254:17></a> He is directing them on the principle of expansion, towards finality with all that it

		I want to observe now this last passage.<a name=255:15></a> We might say, Who is the speaker?<a name=255:16></a> The allusion is to Him that sat upon the throne, and several allusions in the chapters find certain creatures addressing Him who sat on the throne as, "Our Lord and our God" (4: 11): "To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb.<a name=255:17></a>" The chapters are extremely interesting, as the living creatures burst forth in chapter 4 at the marvel of God's pleasure in creation; in chapter 5 -- "Thou art worthy .<a name=255:18></a>.<a name=255:19></a>.<a name=255:20></a> because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God" (a wonderful circle of persons, yes), "made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth".<a name=255:21></a> There is yet another circle whose ascription is completely to the Lamb, and still a wider one whose ascription is to Him that sits upon the throne and to the Lamb.<a name=255:22></a> Oh, how wonderful, dear brethren, the thoughts of God are.<a name=255:23></a>
