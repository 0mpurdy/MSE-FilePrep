		GRACE AS PRESENTED IN DAVID (1)

		<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16">1 Samuel  16</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=1:1></a> One of the great distinctive features of the present dispensation is that it is the dispensation of grace.<a name=1:2></a> It stands out unique in that way, and David particularly, in the Old Testament, stands out in type in administration, and is illustrative of this great feature of grace.<a name=1:3></a> As we have more than once noted, it was an extraordinary thing in David's history that, having sinned as he did, he should have been forgiven.<a name=1:4></a> That is an outstanding thing in the Old Testament, because rightly speaking, his sin deserved death; but as we would take account of it with the help of the Spirit, we can see that God is throwing into relief, in David, this great feature of grace, because he peculiarly sets it out in the Old Testament.<a name=1:5></a> And too, we find not only the matter of having his sin forgiven; but also in regard to his actions and movements we find him breaking through certain bounds, as the Lord Himself said, "Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry .<a name=1:6></a>.<a name=1:7></a>.<a name=1:8></a> How he entered into the house of God and ate the shewbread .<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a>.<a name=1:11></a> ", alluding to a certain occasion.<a name=1:12></a> These features in the type would help us to understand the greatness of grace as presented in David.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brethren will also recall how, in the great administrative gospel of Matthew, the assembly gospel, the line of David is emphasised at the beginning, the Lord Jesus Christ coming in as Son of David; that taking precedence over the Abraham line of faith.<a name=1:14></a> David stressing the line of grace, grace as we may call it in a regal way.<a name=1:15></a> Because when we come to Romans, grace reigns.<a name=1:16></a> And in Luke, which deals with the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		priestly side and the working out of the economy of local assemblies, the line of David is again stressed, as it says in relation to our Lord's incarnation, "And the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father;" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a>.<a name=2:1></a> And then in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>, the charter for the last days, Paul says, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings.<a name=2:2></a>" Also, in the book of the Revelation, David is constantly referred to.<a name=2:3></a> He represents the best side of things, and the best side of things as linked with this glorious dispensation of grace.<a name=2:4></a> There is nothing to surpass it in either what has gone before or what may come after, the assembly coming into the dispensation as the great vessel of grace.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=2:6></a> Do I understand that in regard to David, he is first of all seen as the recipient of grace and then as the exponent of it in a royal way?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:8></a> Both sides are seen in David.<a name=2:9></a> At times he is a type of Christ, as in the chapter before us; at other times he is a type of the believer.<a name=2:10></a> He sets forth both sides -- the administration of grace, and grace received and appreciated.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:12></a>I.<a name=2:13></a> Is it significant that in the last words of the Revelation the Lord says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies.<a name=2:14></a> I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star.<a name=2:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:16></a> So that in all the localities there would be a movement of spiritual emotions in the presentation of Himself as the root and offspring of David, representing the best as David does, and the side linked with the administration of grace.<a name=2:17></a> God must have peculiar pleasure in this great thought of grace.<a name=2:18></a> It says, " .<a name=2:19></a>.<a name=2:20></a>.<a name=2:21></a> that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.<a name=2:22></a>" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:7">Ephesians  2:7</a>.<a name=2:23></a> There must be something

	<div class="paragraph">
		so infinitely pleasurable to God about grace that He is going to display it in His kindness towards us.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=3:2></a>B.<a name=3:3></a> Saul was both fleshly and legal; he had enjoined the people not to partake of honey.<a name=3:4></a> Jonathan had transgressed that injunction and he said, "My father has troubled the land.<a name=3:5></a>" <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#14:29">1 Samuel  14:29</a>.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:7></a> Yes, he represents a side of things which is parallel with David's side of things in the beginning of David's ministry; David has to suffer in relation to it.<a name=3:8></a> Whilst he is anointed here in this chapter, he does not assume the throne immediately.<a name=3:9></a> He has to learn the element of suffering as persecuted by Saul.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:11></a>C.<a name=3:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>we read, " .<a name=3:13></a>.<a name=3:14></a>.<a name=3:15></a> he raised up to them David for king.<a name=3:16></a>" It says He did this, "having removed Saul.<a name=3:17></a>" Is it necessary for the one to be removed before the other can be established?<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:19></a> I think so.<a name=3:20></a> What is established here is that God has rejected Saul, but we find that Saul continues for a good while; and the exercises that would follow in the following chapters and the rest of the book, would involve our having a right judgment of Saul, dissociating ourselves from all that is linked with the system of things built up in relation to him.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.B.<a name=3:22></a> Does this period help to bring out the practical features of grace in David?<a name=3:23></a> On Wednesday evening, you helped us in regard to what is to be viewed abstractly; David never departed in his thoughts from the fact that Saul had been anointed king.<a name=3:24></a> He held to that thought and he acted consistently with it.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:26></a> Showing the greatness of David, that he would not assert his own rights or what really was true of him in the anointing.<a name=3:27></a> He would abide God's time in the matter, while having a right judgment as to what Saul represents.<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=3:29></a>McC.<a name=3:30></a> He comes before us in a feeling way --

		he was feeding the sheep.<a name=4:1></a> And he is attractive, ruddy, and of a beautiful countenance.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:3></a> That would be a feature of grace; grace is on the line of supply, not the line of demand.<a name=4:4></a> The legal man, Saul, is on the line of demand but grace is on the line of supply.<a name=4:5></a> We often get a clue as to persons in their introduction.<a name=4:6></a> What marks Saul in his introduction is that he is looking for something which he cannot find; but David is feeding the sheep and carrying on an administration for Jesse.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=4:8></a>S.<a name=4:9></a> As to the matter of feelings, are they suggested in the sacrifice that Samuel is to take?<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:11></a> I think so.<a name=4:12></a> We do not want to be marked by the wrong kind of feelings, but by right feelings.<a name=4:13></a> We shall see that as we proceed in the subject of David.<a name=4:14></a> The question to Samuel was, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?<a name=4:15></a>" It is a question of what God has done, "I have rejected him from reigning over Israel.<a name=4:16></a>" Think of a spiritual man like Samuel detained in this way!<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=4:18></a> The Saul features are related to the flesh.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:20></a> We have to learn how to judge these features.<a name=4:21></a> Samuel felt so much about Saul, that God had to come in with a word to him, "Fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.<a name=4:22></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.W.<a name=4:23></a>M.<a name=4:24></a> God had another man in His mind.<a name=4:25></a> I was wondering if we see that in the address to Philadelphia in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>.<a name=4:26></a> God definitely had David in mind -- "These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David, he who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.<a name=4:27></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:28></a> I think Philadelphia represents the best and the choicest features of the assembly, and therefore

	<div class="paragraph">
		you can see how suitably the reference to David fits in in that particular phase of church history.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.S.<a name=5:2></a>K.<a name=5:3></a> Would you say that in this prophecy to Samuel, there is the dividing between the light of God and religious flesh, so that true leadership can come in.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:5></a> I think that is the teaching in regard to it.<a name=5:6></a> It is a very sad matter that a man like Samuel, a man of such prophetic ability, should be detained over this matter of Saul.<a name=5:7></a> God says, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him.<a name=5:8></a>" It is not what the people had rejected but what God had rejected.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=5:10></a>S.<a name=5:11></a> It is what we can count on?<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:13></a> How is this to be met?<a name=5:14></a> It cannot be met by a negative side of things, but it can be met by the introduction of David.<a name=5:15></a> The clear line of demarcation between the false, religious darkness in Saul, and the features of freshness and life in David is clearly seen.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.H.<a name=5:17></a>B.<a name=5:18></a> You speak of the regal thought.<a name=5:19></a> Is grace typified as reigning in David -- where sin abounded, grace in David abounded over all that was found in Saul.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:21></a> I think David's history and regime sets out that thought; we shall see that more as we proceed, the regal thought in David, the way it comes into practical expression in himself.<a name=5:22></a> But then we see, as you remarked, God coming in Himself to provide David after the breakdown in Saul.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.H.<a name=5:24></a> Would you say that Samuel is finally adjusted regarding Saul in the presence of David, when David is anointed?<a name=5:25></a> He is adjusted in the presence of the one who typified Christ.<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:27></a> I think Samuel got help as he went along; the full result of it would be seen when David is brought in.<a name=5:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=6:1></a>I.<a name=6:2></a> "I have provided me a king among his sons.<a name=6:3></a>" Is that not a rich suggestion of grace, God coming in with the supply typified in David?<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:5></a> That would bear out what has been said that over against all that had come in in Saul, grace is abounding, although it is not the dispensation of grace in the Old Testament, but the type is there.<a name=6:6></a> "I have provided me a king among his sons.<a name=6:7></a>" It is what God is doing in relation to Himself.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=6:9></a>I.<a name=6:10></a> And then it says, "Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.<a name=6:11></a>" Is that a suggestion as to how things are to be wrought out in the saints?<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:13></a> I think the heifer suggests that if David is to be brought in it must be in relation to a subjective state among the brethren.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.I.<a name=6:15></a> The system of Saul is set aside in order that something may supersede it.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:17></a> I think what is to be noted in the first part of the chapter is the filling of the horn of oil, and the taking of the heifer, both representing two different features of the truth.<a name=6:18></a> The filling of the horn of oil would allude to spirituality in the prophetic ministry, which is to give a lead in this great matter, a lead in regard to the bringing in of David.<a name=6:19></a> Then the heifer is the side which bears on the saints themselves.<a name=6:20></a> The horn of oil stands linked with Samuel.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.B.<a name=6:22></a> The apostle says to Titus, "For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared, teaching us that, having denied impiety .<a name=6:23></a>.<a name=6:24></a>.<a name=6:25></a> we should live soberly .<a name=6:26></a>.<a name=6:27></a>.<a name=6:28></a> .<a name=6:29></a>" Would that involve deliverance from the man of flesh?<a name=6:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:31></a> Exactly.<a name=6:32></a> The thought of grace is referred to in the epistles and in the gospels.<a name=6:33></a> Our minds need to be enriched in relation to it.<a name=6:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=6:35></a>R.<a name=6:36></a> God does not take account of Samuel's fear.<a name=6:37></a> He does not seem to answer that.<a name=6:38></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:1></a> Samuel is a lesson for all of us here.<a name=7:2></a> He was mourning for Saul, though God had rejected him.<a name=7:3></a> In the previous chapter Samuel had said, "He hath also rejected thee from being king.<a name=7:4></a>" But his feelings are operating against the light that has come into the position.<a name=7:5></a> A solemn thing that we should be acting against the light that governs the position.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.R.<a name=7:7></a>G.<a name=7:8></a> Is that the reason why they trembled at the coming of Samuel?<a name=7:9></a> He had not got clear in his own soul before God.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:11></a> You can see how far this influence extended in chapter 14; it says that "the men of Israel were distressed that day" because of Saul's word.<a name=7:12></a> Think of the distress he occasioned in Israel!<a name=7:13></a> Jonathan was marked by faith.<a name=7:14></a> The matter extended, and here we have the elders of the city trembling as Samuel came to Bethlehem.<a name=7:15></a> But Samuel was coming to bring David in.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=7:17></a>W.<a name=7:18></a> Would you say that if the prophetic ministry is to go forward, there must be a corresponding state amongst the saints?<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:20></a> I think the Lord would suggest that He has in mind this great thought of adjustment among the brethren, so that there is a purified state as the heifer suggests, which would help the prophetic service and ministry.<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=7:22></a>McC.<a name=7:23></a> Samuel said to Saul, "Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee today, and has given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou.<a name=7:24></a>" Are we not to take up this scripture, seeking to understand what God is doing at the moment?<a name=7:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:26></a> I think so, and in relation to what you are saying, how are we to meet the negative conditions of Saul and his regime, if it is not in the spiritual power of the ministry and a purified state among the brethren?<a name=7:27></a>

		C.S.<a name=8:11></a>K.<a name=8:12></a> What about his error in relation to Eliab?<a name=8:13></a> Do you think it would be that while Samuel accepted that Saul was rejected because of objectionable features, he had not really come to see the need of a different kind of administration?<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:20></a> It is a question of what God has done -- "Seeing I have rejected him.<a name=8:21></a>" It is not a question of personal likes, but what God is exposing.<a name=8:22></a> He would get to the root of a matter.<a name=8:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:16></a> It is important that we should see that grace does not mean licence in regard to evil.<a name=9:17></a> The more we apprehend grace, the more we shall reject evil, because "the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared, teaching us that having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things.<a name=9:18></a>"

		S.McC.<a name=19:1></a> The chapter before us this afternoon shows us in the type, in Abigail, the great place that the assembly has in the subject of the administration of grace.<a name=19:2></a> The assembly as it comes into the dispensation is a marvellous vessel under the divine eye, because it is the great vessel of grace.<a name=19:3></a> The book of the Acts clearly shows that, especially in regard to the Jewish position when the hatred of man found its expression at the cross; the answer to that in the Acts, is the administration of grace in the coming of the Spirit -- the first feature of divine administration, Christ being glorified.<a name=19:4></a> The assembly is set up and it becomes the great vessel of grace, the great city of refuge, the great sphere of divine protection and salvation here on earth.<a name=19:5></a>

		In the type, Abigail shows us how David is held up in regard to his movements with the sword.<a name=19:6></a> The present time is the time when the sword is put into its sheath.<a name=19:7></a> It is a wonderful dispensation.<a name=19:8></a> David is going on to the throne, and just as Abigail held up David, so the assembly as it were, is standing related to the administration of grace.<a name=19:9></a> The sword will be resumed after the translation; literal warfare will again take place; but in the meantime, we have this wonderful interim, this great period when this vessel is formed, in which the ministry of grace is maintained.<a name=19:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=63:4></a> Yes, exactly.<a name=63:5></a> We were referring earlier this afternoon in regard to Amalek that the hand was on the throne of Jah.<a name=63:6></a> This is quite different here.<a name=63:7></a> God will abundantly shew the wonder of His grace and subjugating power in the Lord Jesus Christ as typified in Solomon.<a name=63:8></a> The Lord is on the throne of Jehovah, Solomon is on the throne of Jehovah.<a name=63:9></a> Not exactly his own throne, but the throne of Jehovah instead of David his father.<a name=63:10></a> One thing is to be noted with the subjugating side, the land is subdued before Jehovah, as we have often had referred to in years past, it is not so much the side of annihilation, but the side of subjugation, the moral sway of God in grace, in the kingdom, subduing, subjugating our wills and our hearts, bringing them under the influence of Christ.<a name=63:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=63:16></a> Well it would, in regard to the way that sonship is being stressed.<a name=63:17></a> It has been so pre-eminently stressed in recent times.<a name=63:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=63:19></a>I.<a name=63:20></a> Is the thought of the great economy of grace largely presented to us in the New Testament under figure of the kingdom?<a name=63:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=63:22></a> In the early chapters of the Acts, we can see how the economy of the kingdom is set up -- the Lord Jesus at the right hand of God, and the Spirit down here, and the power that operates from these positions, involving that hearts are brought under the moral sway of God in grace.<a name=63:23></a>

		S.McC.<a name=63:27></a> Yes, he would be.<a name=63:28></a> It is quite evident in his case the power that subdued him.<a name=63:29></a>

		C.F.<a name=64:1></a>I.<a name=64:2></a> Are the richest thoughts of grace connected with sonship?<a name=64:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=64:4></a> That is what I thought.<a name=64:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=64:6></a>I.<a name=64:7></a> "The praise of the glory of His grace," the thought is spoken of in the first chapter, "wherein He has taken us into favour in the Beloved.<a name=64:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=64:9></a> Exactly.<a name=64:10></a> So Ephesians is a wonderful letter, bringing us to superlative thoughts, bringing us to the richest thoughts of grace.<a name=64:11></a> There are two outstanding features of the truth presented in relation to the saints in Ephesians.<a name=64:12></a> One is sonship, which has in view the pleasure of God Himself, and the other is union, the assembly linked with Christ in union, united to the Heavenly Man, resulting in what is delightful to His own heart.<a name=64:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.B.<a name=64:14></a> Then is the thought of sonship to be apprehended in the Lord Jesus, pre-eminently as to what He is now in the Father's presence?<a name=64:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=64:16></a> Well, exactly, not forgetting what He was in the bosom of the Father here below, the uniqueness of sonship in the humanity of Jesus in the days of His flesh here.<a name=64:17></a> What it must have been to the Father, to have manhood in all its spiritual excellence in Jesus in sonship.<a name=64:18></a> As it is said, "the only begotten Son who <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father.<a name=64:19></a>" He came into that place.<a name=64:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=64:21></a>I.<a name=64:22></a> I feel the importance of the side of sonship; it takes account of the personnel, does it not, in our individual links and our place in divine purpose, whereas if we think only of the assembly as an entity, we are thinking perhaps of something a little different.<a name=64:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=64:24></a> Yes, it is important to see that in regard to sonship it brings out what the saints are severally, not exactly what we are as an entity, wonderful as that is, and glorious in the eyes of Christ.<a name=64:25></a> The assembly is a complete entity for the joy of His heart, but sonship brings out what the saints are severally, each one

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=65:2></a>I.<a name=65:3></a> One has noticed that beloved Mr.<a name=65:4></a> Taylor has said that sonship is greater than the assembly.<a name=65:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=65:6></a> There is nothing that goes higher than sonship, as far as the saints are concerned.<a name=65:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=65:8></a>I.<a name=65:9></a> Would that imply that the preciousness of the saints to God, what the saints are in this way, is even greater than the company that they form?<a name=65:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=65:11></a> Just so.<a name=65:12></a> You mean the company they form as the entity?<a name=65:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=65:14></a>I.<a name=65:15></a> Yes, the assembly femininely.<a name=65:16></a> We have had a good deal of emphasis upon the thought of the greatness of the assembly, and the company as such, but it has been operating to some extent, one feels, to cause us to overlook the importance of the persons.<a name=65:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=65:18></a> Well, it is important that we should see the greatness of the personnel, and it is important that we should see that the family of sons in this dispensation is the assembly, that the assembly is unique amongst <i>all</i> families in the universe of God, because of the uniqueness of sonship in the assembly.<a name=65:19></a> No other family will know sonship in the same way as the assembly knows and enjoys sonship.<a name=65:20></a> Each one of the assembly has firstborn dignity and glory.<a name=65:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=65:22></a> Does the linking of grace with sonship as you were speaking of it give us some connection between the moral history that we have to face, and the purpose of God, that God has been able to reach His purposes in spite of the moral side?<a name=65:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=65:24></a> Well I think so.<a name=65:25></a> I think we want to see the relation between the moral side and the side of purpose.<a name=65:26></a> The one serves the other, but the great end is that we should reach sonship, and so it says in verse 8 of our chapter, "But the word of Jehovah came to me saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars; thou shalt not build a house unto

	<div class="paragraph">
		my name, for thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.<a name=66:1></a>" Now this is not exactly cancelling out the wars of the Lord; they have their place, but we want to see that what is now before God is this matter of sonship, and this influence of sonship in the testimony at this particular juncture.<a name=66:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=66:3></a> Does it necessitate a fresh and new view of Christ in our souls, not now on the side of Lordship?<a name=66:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=66:5></a> I think so.<a name=66:6></a> David was a valiant man, he was a valiant warrior.<a name=66:7></a> You remember how Hushai refers to him as a warrior.<a name=66:8></a> He was valiant for God in matters, but that is not the side of things that is linked with the building of the house.<a name=66:9></a> It is the side of sonship that is linked with the building of the house.<a name=66:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=66:11></a> Does it mean that the conflict is not an end in itself?<a name=66:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=66:13></a> That is it, exactly.<a name=66:14></a> That conflict is a <i>means</i> to an end, but we do not exactly rest in the conflict.<a name=66:15></a> The conflict is a means to an end -- God has a definite end in all the conflict since sin came in, and we are to see that in Solomon he has certain ends reached.<a name=66:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.C.<a name=66:17></a>H.<a name=66:18></a> So would you say that sonship in verse 6 is linked with all the greatness that has come in, is it not?<a name=66:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=66:20></a> Yes, exactly, and it is interesting what David says in verse 5 before that, "Solomon my son is young and tender.<a name=66:21></a>" Well that is a wonderful touch in regard to this great matter, where the glory of the house is going to be expanded before us, under Solomon, that this thought of young and tender enters into it.<a name=66:22></a> It is important to see from Matthew's gospel, the place that sonship has, preceding the great administrative chapter, chapter 18.<a name=66:23></a> You will recall how the Lord anticipated Peter, and how He said in regard to the fish and the stater, to "take that for me and thee.<a name=66:24></a>" We have the truth of His own sonship entering into the beginning

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the chapter, and then the truth of sonship not only in Him, but in the saints, at the end of the chapter, all bearing on the position in testimony in chapter 18, in the administrative side of things.<a name=67:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.B.<a name=67:2></a> "Then are the sons free" you are thinking of?<a name=67:3></a> and the fact of being free from any other obligation, or anything that might rest upon us?<a name=67:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:5></a> Well, it has often been said that we can never rightly carry out administration except from the heavenly viewpoint.<a name=67:6></a> That is, Matthew and Ephesians go together, and we can only rightly fill out the Corinthian position from the viewpoint of our heavenly place.<a name=67:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.B.<a name=67:8></a> So that the sons are free of tribute; they are not under any tribute.<a name=67:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:10></a> Exactly, the sons are free.<a name=67:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=67:12></a> Would you say what you had in mind in referring to Solomon as being young and tender.<a name=67:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:14></a> Well, I think it is to help us to see features that are entering into this latter stage of things, this latter phase of things in 1st Chronicles.<a name=67:15></a> You will note in the final phases of the testimony in different relations, that a good deal is made of youthfulness, and in different ones.<a name=67:16></a> Joseph as in Genesis, following Jacob, and Joshua in relation to Moses, and now Solomon in relation to David.<a name=67:17></a> It is a great thing that young brothers and sisters should see, the prime place that they have in the finishing matters and phases of the testimony.<a name=67:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=67:19></a>C.<a name=67:20></a> Would all that has been shown up in conflict make now for common features as serving in this great matter of sonship and building?<a name=67:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=67:22></a> Yes, that would be what David is moving towards, in all his directions here.<a name=67:23></a> The conflicts have been many and great, as David alludes to them; but how restful David is in the transition!<a name=67:24></a> We want to learn from this, that when it comes to transition, we

		<a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		need to be with God, to be as it were, in the current of His mind.<a name=68:1></a> David goes over matters so restfully, and so marked by accepting the word of Jehovah, as he says in verse 8, "The word of Jehovah came to me saying, " and then what he tells us is a remarkable thing.<a name=68:2></a> It is different from what we get when he went in to sit before Jehovah.<a name=68:3></a> It is a remarkable word that he gets here, and how he goes over it and calls our attention to it.<a name=68:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=68:5></a>McC.<a name=68:6></a> It has been said recently that the assembly is the expression of Christ here, the nearest to deity of all families, very close indeed.<a name=68:7></a> How does that come in with sonship?<a name=68:8></a> I quite understand the thought of Son over the house, because He regulates the house, but where the house is, the family is, is it not?<a name=68:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=68:10></a> The house from another viewpoint is composed of the sons.<a name=68:11></a> The dignity of sonship enters into the house, that is, the cedars of Lebanon represent what compose the house.<a name=68:12></a> It is the house as built under Solomon, expressing the dignity of sonship.<a name=68:13></a> It is not the feminine side so much as the masculine side.<a name=68:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.S.<a name=68:15></a>K.<a name=68:16></a> Is the reference in Colossians to the Son of His love a happy link with the thought here of a Man of rest, that it is the restfulness of love that is to mark these transitional periods.<a name=68:17></a> God would unfold it in that way, would He not, for us?<a name=68:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=68:19></a> Exactly, it is a beautiful expression here -- He shall be a Man of rest.<a name=68:20></a> It is important to see manhood in restful conditions.<a name=68:21></a> It is wonderful to see manhood in conflict in David.<a name=68:22></a> Manhood shines in David in conflict, a man after God's own house.<a name=68:23></a> But then God is saying that the house is to be linked with Solomon the son, who is a man of rest.<a name=68:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.R.<a name=68:25></a>G.<a name=68:26></a> Is that supported by the end of the 2nd Ephesians, where it speaks of what Christ has done in uniting all in one, having slain the enmity, and then it goes on to say "for through Him we have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=69:2></a> Well, exactly.<a name=69:3></a> All that is opening up the greatness of the house at the present time among the Gentiles; the greatness of what God has in the assembly, as His habitation in Spirit, and the beginning of the chapter stresses the thought of rest.<a name=69:4></a> The totality of the work of God is brought before us in the first half of the chapter in an anticipative way, not exactly in an abstract way, but in an anticipative way, and the great thought of rest is stressed, what the saints are as raised up, and made to sit down together, that is, comporting with this thought of the Man of rest.<a name=69:5></a> Sonship involves rest among the saints.<a name=69:6></a> It is an interesting thing to look through Mr.<a name=69:7></a> Darby's hymns.<a name=69:8></a> There are no hymns that are quite their equal; they have their own uniqueness.<a name=69:9></a> But one of the things to be noted is how the thought of rest runs through Mr.<a name=69:10></a> Darby's hymns.<a name=69:11></a> If you were to count the number of times that rest is mentioned, you might be surprised; and also for instance, expressions like "unalloyed," "unsullied;" expressions like these pointing to an unmixed condition of things.<a name=69:12></a> It is important that we should see that side of things.<a name=69:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=72:7></a> That is what I thought, that David is encouraging us now, Solomon being a type of ourselves now, to set our hearts and our souls to seek Jehovah your God.<a name=72:8></a> It is remarkable that he does not say "to seek Jehovah <i>my</i> God," but "to seek Jehovah <i>your</i> God," as if he is trying to inculcate into our minds thoughts that have been linked with his own experiences in his knowledge of God.<a name=72:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=72:13></a> Yes, exactly.<a name=72:14></a> There is the side of what we are brought into by divine powers, the unsurpassing greatness of God's power, but then there is this corresponding side in the setting of our hearts and our souls to seek Jehovah.<a name=72:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		S.McC.<a name=72:22></a> Yes, that would be what was in David's mind; that is, the Psalms give us an insight into what David's exercises were.<a name=72:23></a> I believe that the young people

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=73:6></a> That is the point.<a name=73:7></a> You want the young brothers and sisters to get mature thoughts in their minds, so from this viewpoint, they are not babes, they are sons.<a name=73:8></a> "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=73:9></a>" Sonship is a gift received in the glad tidings.<a name=73:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=74:5></a> Yes, exactly.<a name=74:6></a> God would claim it for Himself.<a name=74:7></a> God thinks so much of it that He would claim it for Himself.<a name=74:8></a> It is to be noted before we move on from chapter 22 that Solomon is reminded of the ordinances which Jehovah commanded Moses for Israel.<a name=74:9></a> That is an interesting thing, and shows that what we are referring to does not exclude the thought of responsibility with us.<a name=74:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=74:11></a> I wondered whether you would say something about the command in verse 17?<a name=74:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=74:13></a> Well, I think it is like the Lord Jesus in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=74:14></a> He is going on to the Father, to set up and inaugurate the heavenly order of things, and He brings in the thought of His commandments.<a name=74:15></a> "If any one love me, he will keep my word.<a name=74:16></a>" It is a great thing to keep the Lord's commandments.<a name=74:17></a> I suppose every one of us here would profess to love Christ, but the question would be as to whether we love Him enough.<a name=74:18></a> We need to love Him more, and have regard to His commandments, and that is what comes in here, but the commandment is regulating matters.<a name=74:19></a> Sonship in that way does not exactly, as we are viewing it in this type, take us out of the sphere of regulation; we are still in a sphere where we have to be regulated by the commanding of Moses, the ordinances which Jehovah commanded Moses, and also David's commandment.<a name=74:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=75:5></a>W.<a name=75:6></a> Would the commandments of Moses bear on the dwelling of Jehovah Elohim?<a name=75:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=75:8></a> The commandment of Moses would involve the law of the house, and Ezekiel refers to it later on, do you think, "The law of the house," that enters into <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>; sonship is alluded to in chapter 17, then the law of the house comes in in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, so we are to be reminded of that.<a name=75:9></a> We do not forget the ministry of Moses, because it gives us the law of the house.<a name=75:10></a>

		Rem.<a name=75:11></a> Would you say that these things are not optional with us?<a name=75:12></a> It is not optional whether we love the brethren, it is the command of the Lord that we love them.<a name=75:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=75:14></a> Exactly, and it is important that we should see the force of the commandments in John's writings.<a name=75:15></a> You would think of all the Gospels that would leave out the thought of the commandments, from the human way of reasoning, it would be John's.<a name=75:16></a> John stresses the love side.<a name=75:17></a> The love side is the side that makes room and way for the commandments.<a name=75:18></a> Now in the 29th chapter, we find how things are gathered up, and the chapter opens again with a reference to "Solomon is young and tender.<a name=75:19></a>" I think there must be something in that, the way David refers to it again, repeats it, as if we are to be reminded of this side of things in the assembly.<a name=75:20></a> The need for impressionableness, and freshness with us, because the legal side would lead to hardness, unimpressionableness; that is one thing in Judaism in the Acts that is to be noted, how Judaism leads to hardness and unimpressionableness, but what is linked with sonship known and

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=76:4></a> Well, that is what I am thinking of in Solomon, that when we come to sonship, we have this side of things stressed.<a name=76:5></a> A state of things among the saints that is impressionable, and marked by what tenderness would suggest.<a name=76:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=76:9></a> Well, exactly.<a name=76:10></a> Matthew has a way of referring to the babes and the children, as suggesting a class of persons, or a state in persons, free from crystallization.<a name=76:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:10></a> Yes, it is remarkable that we have this answer in the saints; David is concerned about all the saints coming to it, all the people of God coming into it.<a name=78:11></a> He said to all the congregation, "Bless now Jehovah your God," and "all the congregation blessed Jehovah the God of their Fathers," and this leads into a remarkable fulness of things in which the people of God are sustained in joy.<a name=78:12></a> It involves spirituality amongst the saints.<a name=78:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=78:16></a> Paul was not stereotyped.<a name=78:17></a> I suppose the brethren will have noticed how in reading the Synopsis and in reading the Collected Writings Mr.<a name=78:18></a> Darby will interrupt a subject, and his soul in richest feelings breaks forth as the truth affects him.<a name=78:19></a> I think we want to let the truth affect our souls more.<a name=78:20></a> It affects our minds, but we want to let it affect our souls more, the feeling part of us.<a name=78:21></a>

		S.McC.<a name=79:1></a> Well, exactly, and so what it says here, in verse 22, "They ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy.<a name=79:2></a>" Now we are to notice that verse, and then it says, "They made Solomon the son of David king the second time.<a name=79:3></a>" Now this is another start you might say, a fresh touch in regard to sonship, as seen in Christ, as typified in Solomon; "They made Solomon the son of David king the second time.<a name=79:4></a>" But the eating and drinking is an interesting matter, because the Davidic side involves what is constitutional.<a name=79:5></a> In Ezra and Nehemiah they came together and they read, they were together three days, and there was the reading of the law, and there was much soul-searching, and feeling in regard to it, but we have another thought in relation to David, (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#12">1 Chronicles  12</a>) they were with David three days, eating and drinking.<a name=79:6></a> And then we get here, verse 22, they ate and drank.<a name=79:7></a> This is a very substantial matter, affecting the saints constitutionally.<a name=79:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak briefly, beloved brethren, as to the manner in which exercises are completed with David at this particular juncture.<a name=85:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The section which we read from, and what surrounds it, is a very humbling one, a section in which David is not a type of Christ, for we could never attach sin to Christ.<a name=85:2></a> David is a type of any one of us, and he is also a type, as the king, of what we have to face in all that is around us in the breakdown of what is authoritative.<a name=85:3></a> David is a remarkable man.<a name=85:4></a> The work of God in him is remarkable, and this section of the Scriptures affords much help in relation to how David is helped through prophetic ministry and goes forward in relation to divine objectives; not that he is saved from further breakdown, for the succeeding chapters show what is possible even after being helped wonderfully through prophetic service.<a name=85:5></a> We are all to learn from David how to walk humbly with God, for there is no knowing with any one of us where we may finish up if we get out of the hand of God.<a name=85:6></a> David had known what it was to celebrate victories in the preceding chapters.<a name=85:7></a> In the 10th chapter we read of a remarkable victory.<a name=85:8></a> How he was helped of God in the victories.<a name=85:9></a> We read, too, of the wonderful way in which he showed grace to Mephibosheth -- the kindness of God.<a name=85:10></a> All these features with David are to help us to see the necessity of continuing in victory that may have come from God.<a name=85:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David is a man of great feeling.<a name=85:12></a> In the second book of Samuel, as the brethren will know, things are very mixed, circumstances extremely testing.<a name=85:13></a> All kinds of personalities are projected on to our view; but I do

	<div class="paragraph">
		not wish to speak of them in the word which is upon one's heart, but to draw attention to Christ as He comes into view in Solomon in the completing of David's exercises in the section from which I have read.<a name=86:1></a> It is well to see how, amid all the darkness and gloom in this book, the work of God in David shines out at different intervals; and the prophetic word comes to him in this section.<a name=86:2></a> He had been caught off guard and what a fearful sin he fell into!<a name=86:3></a> Although he had been conscious in the 10th chapter of remarkable help in victories achieved, in the 11th chapter he is caught off guard; all emphasising the need of holy vigilance with everyone of us that we may be preserved in our relations with God.<a name=86:4></a> God's eye is upon the whole matter.<a name=86:5></a> He knows what His work is in every one of us, and He values His work, and we are to value it too.<a name=86:6></a> Woe betide anyone who despises the work of God in the least in the assembly!<a name=86:7></a> It is a serious thing to make little of the work of God in any city or in any one of the people of God.<a name=86:8></a> And God always brings us back basically to His work in us.<a name=86:9></a> We can rely on it.<a name=86:10></a> There is so much in us that is wholly unreliable, and God would help us in the light of the teaching of this book to face every feature of the man of sin and shame in our souls, that we may get our eyes on the Man that is before God, the Object of His love, the One in whose hands administration cannot break down, as it did in David.<a name=86:11></a> It is preserved eternally in the hands of the true Solomon; for this chapter is the great lesson-book for us in the breakdown in regard to administration.<a name=86:12></a> David comes to it in his soul through the prophetic word from God; but he comes to it at the end of the book as he goes over the features of God's King; it is abstractly in his soul.<a name=86:13></a> He sees and understands the character of an administration that will never break down as he goes over it in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23">2 Samuel  23</a>; especially stressing the

	<div class="paragraph">
		presence of the Spirit in the one anointed of God.<a name=87:1></a> I think we have to make much of that -- the presence of the Spirit.<a name=87:2></a> Right administration can only be preserved as we understand what is linked with the dignity of the anointing, the dignity of the Spirit.<a name=87:3></a> When we fall beneath the level of the anointing we are sure to come to grief.<a name=87:4></a> And so David here, as he faces these serious exercises, having been helped through prophetic ministry, is conscious that the hand of God is upon him in the circumstances in which he is.<a name=87:5></a> What feelings must have passed through David's soul at this juncture; but he knew God, he had a knowledge of God that nothing could take away from him.<a name=87:6></a> And we have to go back to that.<a name=87:7></a> David is brought back to it foundationally, as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>shows.<a name=87:8></a> His confession here is very brief.<a name=87:9></a> There is no enlargement, no embellishment to his confession.<a name=87:10></a> As we go over the Psalm we are reminded of the great link he has with God and the sensitiveness that marks him in relation to those links with God, sensitiveness as to the damage done.<a name=87:11></a> David here is prostrate, facing in his soul this great matter in which he had been caught.<a name=87:12></a> A remarkable thing that such a one as David should be affected in this way!<a name=87:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we read that he arises from the earth and washes.<a name=87:14></a> There is a time for everything.<a name=87:15></a> He arises from the earth and anoints himself and changes his clothes.<a name=87:16></a> Now all this is helpful in regard to the completing of David's exercises, especially to see him arising from the earth.<a name=87:17></a> He felt it was right, but then the time comes when his position is to change.<a name=87:18></a> There is a change in his outlook, a change in his position.<a name=87:19></a> Recovery always results in that, and especially the recognition of the Spirit as is suggested in the type in the anointing of himself; he understands he is brought back to what he basically entered into -- his relations with the testimony in the 16th chapter of the first

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe we have to see the importance of the Holy Spirit.<a name=88:4></a> And David here rises to what is becoming.<a name=88:5></a> He washes himself and anoints himself.<a name=88:6></a> It is not a question of others, it is a question of himself, David anointed himself.<a name=88:7></a> John in his ministry loves to bring us to what there is with ourselves.<a name=88:8></a> It is not a question of David's anointing through the prophetic service, but it is a question of what David is coming to.<a name=88:9></a> He had belied the anointing, but now he is recognising it.<a name=88:10></a> He changed his clothing, meaning that the whole external appearance was changed.<a name=88:11></a> He is not saying what he would say formerly; he is not acting as he would do formerly as having sinned so against God and against Urijah the Hittite.<a name=88:12></a> It says he went into the house of Jehovah and worshipped.<a name=88:13></a> He comes to it that the service of God must go on.<a name=88:14></a> There is power to rise from the circumstances which would hold him down, facing the government of God in them.<a name=88:15></a> How sobering the government of God is in this chapter!<a name=88:16></a> But now he enters into the house of Jehovah.<a name=88:17></a> We come now to what David is basically in his relations with God.<a name=88:18></a> God is before his soul, while facing the searching circumstances of the government of God following up the way he had acted; yet he rises in the dignity that was proper to him and worships.<a name=88:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would now just say a word as to the final matter in verse 24 regarding Bathsheba.<a name=88:20></a> She bore a son and he called him Solomon, and Jehovah loved him.<a name=88:21></a> He is a converging point, if I may reverently say so, between David and God.<a name=88:22></a> You will remember that Solomon says in the book of Proverbs, "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of

		to God!<a name=90:1></a> It is intimated here, and love comes into view in relation to sonship.<a name=90:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, dear brethren, we are to think not only of sonship in Christ but sonship in the saints; the dignity and the glory of it that God would bring us to, so that we might be free and happy in our movements, not in bondage but in liberty.<a name=90:3></a> That is what is in mind here, to bring us to sonship whether seen in Christ or seen in the saints.<a name=90:4></a> Sonship is an outstanding feature of the dispensation.<a name=90:5></a> Paul insists on sonship in Galatians.<a name=90:6></a> He stresses the glory of it.<a name=90:7></a> But he also stresses what sonship was in himself, in his own ministry.<a name=90:8></a> "It pleased God to reveal His son <i>in</i> me," he says.<a name=90:9></a> Meaning that Paul was affected internally by this great thought of sonship.<a name=90:10></a> The saints are formed in conformity to Christ and what benign influences they cast abroad.<a name=90:11></a> And it is only as sonship is amongst the saints that we shall have these benign influences; otherwise we shall have the dreadful influences of Judaism and legality which must be rejected in toto.<a name=90:12></a> For Judaism is against Christ and against God.<a name=90:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So David comes to Solomon and I finish with that.<a name=90:14></a> God has in mind that we should come to the dignity of our dispensation so unique -- sonship, whether viewed in Christ in all its uniqueness, the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, or whether seen in the saints as Paul speaks of it in Galatians.<a name=90:15></a> "The Son of God who has loved me," brings in the love side.<a name=90:16></a> If we do not understand sonship we will not understand love.<a name=90:17></a> Paul tells us that neither circumcision profits anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.<a name=90:18></a> That is all I had to say, dear brethren, but the word is laid upon one's heart as to completing the exercises with us, individually or collectively, that we should be able to rise above the sorrowful circumstances of moving beneath the dignity of our position as seen in David, and come back to the work of God in our

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=94:2></a> I think there is.<a name=94:3></a> It is to be noted in what you refer to, the difference in the words employed, that is the love in verse 5 is the love of settled disposition, whereas the love of verse 36 is the love linked with attractiveness in the one loved -- the love of friendship.<a name=94:4></a> Well, these two sides of the truth are to be noted, the settled disposition of Divine love towards every member of the family.<a name=94:5></a> But then the other side, attractiveness in the one loved is stressed.<a name=94:6></a> "Behold how he loved him.<a name=94:7></a>" This Gospel brings up the matter of attractiveness of the one loved, not only the attractiveness of the love and the One who loves, but the attractiveness in the one who is loved.<a name=94:8></a> For Jesus Himself is viewed in the bosom of the Father in the first chapter.<a name=94:9></a> John in the 13th chapter is in the bosom of Jesus and on the breast of Jesus.<a name=94:10></a> And here we have Lazarus marked out according to the testimony.<a name=94:11></a> "Behold how he loved him.<a name=94:12></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=94:15></a> Exactly.<a name=94:16></a> John would help us to value the work of God in one another, and value what is linked with Mary's action in the honouring of Christ.<a name=94:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.McK.<a name=94:18></a>H.<a name=94:19></a> Would you say a little more about the matter of the settled disposition of love; you connected this passage with the thought of the children.<a name=94:20></a> Paul speaks of sons; is there in the divine family the idea of each member having a place in the affections of the Father?<a name=94:21></a>

		S.McC.<a name=95:6></a> So that both sides are seen in relation to Him.<a name=95:7></a> We think of the settled disposition of the Father's love in relation to Him.<a name=95:8></a> Especially the matter of committing all things into His hand, the formal statement as to the economy.<a name=95:9></a> And then the love referred to in chapter 5 implying attractiveness in Christ, what holy attractiveness was there, and in the same way in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>there should be the element of attractiveness with us, we should desire to be attractive in that way.<a name=95:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=96:6></a> I am thinking of the moral application of it in whatever way it may apply to us.<a name=96:7></a> The chapter is to help us as to things that may invade divine territory the environment where divine affections are radiating.<a name=96:8></a> That is, "Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<a name=96:9></a>" We have the radiation of divine affection in this settled way which nothing can interfere with, nothing can as it were set aside, but death comes in to interfere with the enjoyment of it amongst the members of the family.<a name=96:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=97:5></a> That is how one is looking at it, that it is a background, and Mary's act too was a background to what follows in the chapter, as if in the teaching of the chapter, we are to keep that in mind, that while the Lord is detained and takes another way of moving, it does not interfere with this verse.<a name=97:6></a> "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<a name=97:7></a>" He is going to bring out something.<a name=97:8></a> It may involve tremendous pressure and sorrow as it did here, even, a stench being referred to, the awfulness of what came in through what is referred to here, in relation to Lazarus; Martha says to Him, "Lord he stinks already.<a name=97:9></a>" Think of a reference like that!<a name=97:10></a> But over against that -- we do not want to dwell on that -- is the odour that fills the house in chapter 12; that is the completing of the matter.<a name=97:11></a>

		S.McC.<a name=98:11></a> I think so.<a name=98:12></a> I think in the putting of Martha first, John would help us to see what is in mind, lest we should in any way leave Martha out.<a name=98:13></a> Martha is put first because according to Luke she is not right in what she is doing, and John would help us to see where she is here, that she is not out of the picture here, she is in it, loved by Jesus, with her sister and Lazarus.<a name=98:14></a>

		RADIATION OF DIVINE AFFECTIONS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL (1)

		S.McC.<a name=112:1></a> In suggesting these passages that were read one has in mind the thought of divine affections and the influence they are intended and calculated to have upon us.<a name=112:2></a> It is important that we should come under the influence of divine affection because the way that God has chosen to become known, to make Himself known, involves this very matter.<a name=112:3></a> He has come into relationships intelligible and well-known to men, relationships filled with warmth and tenderness of the affection that peculiarly marks them, and John's ministry, bearing as it does on our time, the last days, would especially have in mind, over against the public breakdown and failure around us, that we should come under the influence of divine affection.<a name=112:4></a> Mr.<a name=112:5></a> Taylor once used the word "radiation" in connection with this gospel as to divine love, the radiation of divine affections.<a name=112:6></a> It needs to be understood better by us, because John the evangelist would bring before us divine love in the movements of Christ coming into manhood.<a name=112:7></a> Subsequent movements linked with His own mediatorial service and the mediatorial service of the Spirit involve that we should understand divine love, not just in an arbitrary way as made known to us in the scriptures, but that we should feel and be affected by the radiation of divine affections.<a name=112:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first passage we have read speaks of the Person of Christ in a peculiar way; John would have us understand the glory of the Person of Christ, an essential point, in his teaching.<a name=112:9></a> We shall not understand divine affections properly unless we see the great import

		of the incarnation, the greatness of what is involved in a divine Person becoming Man, the Son, the Word.<a name=113:1></a> The Son alludes to His personal dignity and glory as representing God and bringing God so near to us; the Word refers to the inherent ability in Him as the "Logos" to make God known, to reveal God.<a name=113:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Into the mediatorial service there enter the unique wondrous positions taken up, and this radiation of divine affection that is calculated to bring others into the current of it and to keep us in it from all that is around in the way of apostate influences and currents, and to hold us in this circle of divine affections.<a name=113:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		S.McC.<a name=113:6></a> Well, that brings out how certain were affected by it.<a name=113:7></a> It was not just something that came across their horizon and passed on.<a name=113:8></a> It involved the most stupendous of all matters, a divine Person here in manhood in a known and intelligible relationship, contemplated in it in all the unsullied blessedness of the relationships that were between Him and the Father, God known in that wondrous name of grace that is presented in this gospel, the Father, not <i>our</i> Father but <i>the</i> Father.<a name=113:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=113:10></a>N.<a name=113:11></a> Would the parenthesis here show how deeply John himself was affected?<a name=113:12></a> He repeatedly breaks out in worship as he writes.<a name=113:13></a> His ministry bearing on our day would draw attention to the importance of this feature of worship with us, would it not?<a name=113:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=113:15></a> I think that is, because John the Evangelist is dealing here with the movement of the Lord Jesus Christ into manhood.<a name=113:16></a> He stops for a moment to draw our attention to radiancy, referring to the glory, because glory involves what is radiant and divine affections here are seen radiating in the understood, well-known, intelligible relationship of an only begotten with a father.<a name=113:17></a> Then the Baptist is drawn in also to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=114:8></a> That is how one understands it.<a name=114:9></a> It is what they observed in His practical everyday movements in His links with God here, His links with the Father.<a name=114:10></a> He was here in a physical sense -- the Word became flesh and dwelt among us; He was before their eyes in that physical condition, and yet there was something which they penetrated beyond, in His links with God as the Father.<a name=114:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=114:12></a>D.<a name=114:13></a> Would the understanding of what you are speaking of as to the affections in John mean that christianity is not just a system of teaching, but rather the affections are caught up in the activity of divine Persons and we become attached to them?<a name=114:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=115:13></a> Well, it is to throw into relief the nearness into which Christ has come to men.<a name=115:14></a> In coming into the mediatorial position into which He has come He is not operating at a distance from us, but He is right amongst us, as John referred to it "and dwelt among us.<a name=115:15></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=115:19></a> I think so because grace and truth would bear upon conditions on our side that need to be met.<a name=115:20></a> If God comes into these circumstances in the way in -- which He has, and man being what He is, of necessity there must be the adapting of divine love to meet these conditions on our side, and grace and truth enter into that, grace enlarging before our minds the side of supply, and truth enlarging before our minds the great adjusting features in what has come in in the way of light as to God.<a name=115:21></a>

		S.McC.<a name=116:1></a> Yes, it does, and the way He speaks to the Father and speaks about the saints.<a name=116:2></a> I think we need to make room for the Spirit, to allow the Spirit to come in and to affect us through His service and ministry, with the warm of divine affections that are flowing in these intelligible relationships in which we contemplate divine Persons.<a name=116:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=116:7></a> Well, I think verse 18 stresses that.<a name=116:8></a> You will notice in verse 14 the figure of speech.<a name=116:9></a> It is not an actual relationship that it refers to, but a figure of speech -- that is, John the Evangelist is describing what came on to their view and appeared in testimony in the position into which Christ had come.<a name=116:10></a> He is naming it through this figure of speech.<a name=116:11></a> But when we come to verse 18 we get the formal statement as to the position of the Lord Jesus in the bosom of the Father.<a name=116:12></a> That would bear out what you are referring to, what Christ was in sonship here as Man to the Father, all the moral and spiritual excellence of a condition of manhood according to the mind of God, the like of which had never been seen before.<a name=116:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=116:17></a> The uniqueness of Christ's sonship is before us here.<a name=116:18></a> It is a question of how we are brought into it through the contemplation of it, especially making room for the Spirit so that He might affect us by this influence of divine love flowing in these intelligible relationships.<a name=116:19></a>

		S.McC.<a name=118:10></a> Well, exactly, therefore the importance of self-judgment in the light of Christ, because there are plenty of persons around us who are going on in self-judgment to a certain degree but are in darkness and distress of soul.<a name=118:11></a> They do penance and other forms of self-judging effort to hold self in its proper place, but it does not bring them anywhere because self is the centre and self is the object.<a name=118:12></a>

		S.McC.<a name=137:6></a> Well, these words, as we know, are instructive words.<a name=137:7></a> They convey different thoughts, the love of chapter 3 in verse 35 is the love of settled disposition, the settled disposition of the Father towards the Son, specially prefacing the matter of the administration of chapter 4.<a name=137:8></a> Whereas in chapter 5 it is the love of friendship, implying attractiveness in the object of the activity of the love, the Son being peculiarly the attractive Object.<a name=137:9></a> I think it is of note that this should come into <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, because <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>refers to what the saints are individually as quickened and made to live in the divine nature and thus capacitated to enjoy the knowledge of God as coming into this divine arrangement, capacitated to serve God as quickened thus.<a name=137:10></a>

		S.McC.<a name=139:2></a> Well, the matter of eternal life is of course somewhat different from quickening.<a name=139:3></a> We have to understand what each feature of life suggests.<a name=139:4></a> Eternal life involves a sphere in which we are made to live, but quickening in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>is a sovereign activity on the part of a divine Person <i>in</i> us, in our souls, involving that we <i>inwardly</i> and <i>spiritually</i> live in our relations with divine Persons.<a name=139:5></a>

		J.C.<a name=139:6></a> Would chapter 4, verse 14, be parallel to it?<a name=139:7></a> "The water which I shall give him shall become <i>in</i> him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.<a name=139:8></a>" Would springing up be the quickening?<a name=139:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=139:10></a> I think the springing up involves the Spirit's activity in the believer on another line, leading to eternal life.<a name=139:11></a> It is not a question of the divine nature in that verse, but of the known presence of the Spirit in a subjective way in the believer involving delivering power, and emancipation from what would hold us, leading up to eternal life.<a name=139:12></a> But quickening in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>is that we are quickened out of a state of death, capacitated and made to live in the divine nature.<a name=139:13></a>

		S.McC.<a name=142:1></a> The great teaching in regard to Lazarus is the truth of resurrection, and as we were referring to earlier, in Colossians resurrection comes before quickening, because resurrection in Colossians is the prime matter; but when we come to John quickening has a unique place in chapter 5.<a name=142:2></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=142:6></a> The point in the teaching is to focus our attention on the <i>Son</i> as co-equal with the Father and as loved by the Father in certain relations.<a name=142:7></a> In this chapter, it says "For even <i>as</i> the Father raises.<a name=142:8></a>" It is not to focus our attention so much on the Father as on the Son in this peculiar glory.<a name=142:9></a>

		S.McC.<a name=143:13></a> Well, that is to stress this prime matter of life in relation to the operational activities of divine Persons in the economy.<a name=143:14></a> The economy would be in mind in that verse, the Father being the Supreme One in the economy.<a name=143:15></a> The Father is always viewed as supreme in the economy.<a name=143:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=144:16></a> It links with eternal life, in that we could not fully enter upon the enjoyment of eternal life apart from it.<a name=144:17></a>

		S.McC.<a name=144:21></a> Well, exactly, that is the whole point, in stressing the operation of the Son in quickening power in chapter 5.<a name=144:22></a> The Spirit in chapter 4 is viewed as delivering us from all the negative results connected with the operation of sin.<a name=144:23></a> You have a woman who is enslaved inwardly, she is a woman of remarkable affections, but she needs to be emancipated, she needs to be delivered inwardly and the Spirit comes in in the way of power, so that she is delivered inwardly; but then <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>involves the operation of the Son of God by the Spirit, the Spirit being in the saints, by which we are made to live in relationships according to God and have part in the divine nature.<a name=144:24></a>

		S.McC.<a name=145:9></a> Exactly.<a name=145:10></a> But the assembly has the prime place in this matter.<a name=145:11></a> It is selective quickening in that way in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, whereas the quickening of the dead may be viewed elsewhere; but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>in that particular part the saints are selected as the present objects of divine quickening.<a name=145:12></a> Now in chapter 13 we come to divine affections entering into the closing phases of the Lord's service.<a name=145:13></a> I think it important that we should see what comes to light in this chapter, the deliberate movements of Christ in relation to His own, as understanding what had been committed to Him (verse 3) looking back on all that we have been considering in chapters 3 and 5, "Jesus <i>knowing</i> that the Father had given him all things into his hand.<a name=145:14></a>" They were given on the basis of His love for the Son.<a name=145:15></a> It involves what was said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>and <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, and in the light of that the Lord proceeds with this great service in the light of what is so great in the economy.<a name=145:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=146:12></a> I think to throw into relief what is involved in the cycle of mediatorial operations.<a name=146:13></a> This wondrous cycle of mediatorial operations involves that the Word becomes flesh, a divine Person becomes Man, including also "Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life," involving that that divine Person should go into death, and too that He should go back to the Father, that He should return to the place whence He came.<a name=146:14></a> I think in that expression the majesty and gloriousness of the scope of mediatorial operations are set out.<a name=146:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=157:14></a> Exactly.<a name=157:15></a> It is love's service.<a name=157:16></a> John is in the place of love and he would serve in love in this matter; so as it has often been noticed, here it says, "But he, leaning on the breast of Jesus, says to him, Lord, who is it.<a name=157:17></a>" In the synoptic Gospels the question is, "Is It I?<a name=157:18></a>" But in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>it says "Lord, who is it?<a name=157:19></a>" Who could it be in such a circle as this?<a name=157:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=161:1></a> The section in John's Gospel from the 14th to the 17th chapters, is a unique section in the teaching of the Gospel -- a section that is replete with references to divine affections.<a name=161:2></a> The Lord is going to heaven, and all that He says is in view of that.<a name=161:3></a> He is going there to establish and set up a new and heavenly order of things, linked with His presence there and the Holy Spirit's presence here in the assembly.<a name=161:4></a> In view of His leaving them the teaching bears upon the coming of the Spirit, and <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>in the latter part of it, beginning with the 15th verse, is particularly contemplating the time of the assembly and the day of breakdown when things would be different from what they were in the beginning; but even in the midst of that, divine thoughts are viewed as workable, even in the reduction to the smallest possible extent, as seen in the Lord's word in verse 23, "If anyone love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him.<a name=161:5></a>" And in verse 21, "He that has my commandments and keeps them he it is that loves me, but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.<a name=161:6></a>" All this supposes the presence of the Spirit in the light of verse 16, as with us and in us, and the Father and the Son moving towards us as loving Christ and as keeping His commandments.<a name=161:7></a> So that it is important that we should understand the divine affections radiating in these particular circumstances.<a name=161:8></a> Because what is provided in these circumstances is

		the possibility of divine Persons going on with us when everything publicly may be broken up.<a name=162:1></a> It throws into relief the greatness of the believer, the greatness of those that belong to the assembly as being the objects of divine Persons, not One, but all Three, as having to do with the believer as loving Christ and keeping the commandments of Christ.<a name=162:2></a> The believer thus becomes the object of the concentrated activity and interest of all three Persons of the Godhead -- love entering into it and affecting the position.<a name=162:3></a>

		S.McC.<a name=185:1></a> It is thought that we should get help from considering the various features that mark Solomon's administration.<a name=185:2></a> There is a remarkable link between David and Solomon, Solomon really being a counterpart to David.<a name=185:3></a> The thought of wisdom comes particularly into Solomon's administration, wisdom in a superlative way, linking on, I think, with what we get related to administration in the letter to the Ephesians.<a name=185:4></a> We will recall how wisdom is mentioned there, in the first chapter, in relation to the counsels of God, then in the third chapter in relation to the all-various wisdom of God seen in the assembly.<a name=185:5></a> Solomon, too, specially stresses the side of sonship.<a name=185:6></a> Throughout the whole administration of Solomon there is diffused the spirit and grace of sonship.<a name=185:7></a> It would seem as if every department of Solomon's regime is marked by coming under the influence of the spirit and grace of sonship supremely set out in Solomon.<a name=185:8></a> And it is thought in considering this chapter this morning we might see how restful and happy conditions are in mind, in the working out of this character of administration among the people of God.<a name=185:9></a> I believe at the present moment, merging into the world to come, we are to know and prove the blessedness of this kind of administration, where sonship is supreme in the minds and hearts of the saints, so that it says in verse 25 "Judah and Israel dwelt safely," a remarkable reference amid the richness and glory of the administration referred to in this chapter.<a name=185:10></a> I believe that the administration working out from the Solomonic viewpoint involves that the saints are brought into conditions of this kind, where

		food abounds, not only ordinary food, but in type, spiritual food in richness and abundance.<a name=186:1></a> Nor is there lack of ministry, either in the way of light and instruction, as we see as the chapter ends.<a name=186:2></a> The chapter opens up with reference to the departmental side of Solomon's administration, introducing into our minds a wealth of personality.<a name=186:3></a> We are not to be afraid of the thought of personality in the assembly, because on the line of sonship, each one being a son, each one having a distinct impression of God and of Christ, we have a wealth in developed personality in the assembly, which is to impress us with the richness and the glory of God's inheritance in the saints.<a name=186:4></a> Unless we see this we shall never be able, in our local gatherings or elsewhere, to work out divine thoughts properly in relation to Christ and the assembly, especially from the heavenly side that 1st Kings, in its teaching, has in mind in type.<a name=186:5></a> I thought we might begin with seeing the departmental side in the opening verses, then the side that comes in from verses 7 to 20, where we have got areas and environment that are not the best, but yet in relation to which Solomon's administration has a part and things are held.<a name=186:6></a> Then the food matter, and then the matter of the ministry and the light that comes abundantly in the last few verses.<a name=186:7></a>

		C.A.<a name=186:8></a>I.<a name=186:9></a> In the opening verses, the first six verses, the idea of persons being sons appears in most instances, does it not?<a name=186:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=186:11></a> It does.<a name=186:12></a> The whole realm of administration proceeding from Solomon's throne is marked, in every detail of it, by the spirit and grace of sonship, suggesting to our minds and to our hearts the liberality connected with this kind of administration.<a name=186:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:5></a> A remarkable reference, and a reference we need to pay attention to, because nobility in the saints works out in the setting on of noble things, not degraded things, but noble things, and also standing to noble things.<a name=187:6></a> It is not only that they are devised but stood to and this is linked with the working out of the administration of the world to come, which is really before us here in this chapter.<a name=187:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:11></a> Very good.<a name=187:12></a> It is interesting to notice that, especially in the epistle to the Philippians, where it is the working out of heavenly light in experience here below.<a name=187:13></a> Philippians rightly follows Ephesians, because it is the working out experimentally of the heavenly light given in the letter to the Ephesians; therefore it is filled with the thought of spiritual refinement.<a name=187:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=187:18></a> Yes, an important thing to notice, how the divine thought is arrived at in this verse.<a name=187:19></a> You remember in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#114">Psalm  114</a>, reference is made to Israel coming out of Egypt, "When Israel went out of Egypt," the house of bondage, "Judah was his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.<a name=187:20></a>" Judah is the Davidic side, where the wealth of the service of God is set up under David, the sweet psalmist of Israel.<a name=187:21></a> Solomon is prominently the ruling side, Israel was his dominion in the Solomonic side;

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=188:2></a>N.<a name=188:3></a> These persons seem to be those who have won or acquired their nobility rather than inherited it.<a name=188:4></a> They are not sons of Solomon, are they?<a name=188:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:6></a> Yes, I think sonship refers to dignity acquired through gift.<a name=188:7></a> We are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=188:8></a> That is, we do not work up to that, it comes to us by way of gift.<a name=188:9></a> But princes represent persons who by moral greatness acquire a place of worth in the testimony.<a name=188:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.A.<a name=188:11></a>I.<a name=188:12></a> You spoke of a link between David and Solomon.<a name=188:13></a> Do we see that in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4">Proverbs  4</a>?<a name=188:14></a> Solomon says, "I was a son unto my father," and "He taught me.<a name=188:15></a>" Is that how it is acquired?<a name=188:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:17></a> Exactly, so that along with this great thought of sonship we have also the feature of love diffused through Solomon's realm, through his administration.<a name=188:18></a> We were looking at the radiation of love the other day in John's gospel, the radiation of divine affections in the working out of the administration according to John; Solomon gives us that in type, "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.<a name=188:19></a>" I think the Lord is stressing the love side in the assembly, pending the rapture.<a name=188:20></a> The rapture is just at hand, we are about to be caught up, and we need to understand the love side, it makes room for spiritual and heavenly refinement amongst us.<a name=188:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.A.<a name=188:22></a>I.<a name=188:23></a> So that the administrative thought is to go forward in the light of sonship, as bearing on the family side.<a name=188:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=188:25></a> And we have to see the greatness of the thought expressed in the word "administration.<a name=188:26></a>" We are so inclined to link administration with the care meeting, the working out of local difficulties when a problem arises, but administration in the divine realm

	<div class="paragraph">
		is a much greater and wider thought than that, involving divine authority, as we had elsewhere, the Lord merging with the Spirit, in bringing divine love into our hearts.<a name=189:1></a> That is only part of administration; there are many other features.<a name=189:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=189:3></a>G.<a name=189:4></a> Has it been said by a beloved servant of the Lord that there will be some form of administration in eternity, because God is love?<a name=189:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:6></a> The administration of love will go right on through all eternity.<a name=189:7></a> We shall never be without administration, and it will be the administration of love, love in activity towards divine Persons and towards one another.<a name=189:8></a>

		D.R.<a name=189:9></a>T.<a name=189:10></a> Verse 29 brings in largeness of heart.<a name=189:11></a> "Largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore.<a name=189:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:13></a> Largeness of heart is a beautiful touch here, as we were alluding to the liberality that is linked with sonship substantially known and enjoyed in the assembly.<a name=189:14></a> While the administration of Solomon involves that every feature of evil is taken account of in all that might adversely affect us, as in the principle seen in Joab, Abiathar and others, on the other hand it is stressing the largeness of heart along with the side of wisdom.<a name=189:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.R.<a name=189:16></a>T.<a name=189:17></a> So all the people should be expressive of this deep affection.<a name=189:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=189:19></a> Well, that is what we are trying to get at; that the whole realm is to be marked by this kind of thing; because 1 Kings, in the immensity of the system of things that come before us under Solomon, stresses christianity at the present time in its heavenly bearing in the assembly; 2nd Chronicles stresses the millennium more, where you have the idea of distance, but in Kings there is no idea of distance.<a name=189:20></a> There is no veil in the temple mentioned.<a name=189:21></a>

		S.McC.<a name=190:11></a> Well, it is very simple to notice that the administration of New Zealand, for instance, is a very extended matter.<a name=190:12></a> It works out from Wellington, but it affects every town and village and everything in the country.<a name=190:13></a> And so in christianity everything is coloured, by what is working out at the present time from Christ on high, in heaven, and the Spirit here in the assembly.<a name=190:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		S.McC.<a name=195:5></a> Yes.<a name=195:6></a> It is very interesting to notice in regard to this man Azariah, he is called the priest here.<a name=195:7></a> In Chronicles, in the genealogies, a remarkable thing is said about this man.<a name=195:8></a> We get a whole list of genealogies in the opening chapters of Chronicles, but there is something specifically said about this man.<a name=195:9></a> We have a bracketed remark in regard to him.<a name=195:10></a> When the Spirit of God comes to Azariah he immediately stops and says, "He is it that exercised the priesthood in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem.<a name=195:11></a>" He is it.<a name=195:12></a> Notice it does not say, "He it is that exercised the priesthood.<a name=195:13></a>" In <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#6:10">1 Chronicles  6:10</a>, we get the levitical line.<a name=195:14></a> Gershom, Kohath and Merari developed in the genealogy, and when it comes to verse 10 it says "And Johanan begot Azariah;" then we get this remarkable comment by Ezra, as it would be, Ezra the scribe; he has something to say about this man.<a name=195:15></a> He says, "He is it that exercised the priesthood in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem," not "He it is" but "He is it;" that is, the stress is on substantiality in the use of the neuter word, it is not the personal pronoun so much that is intensified, but the neuter quality.<a name=195:16></a> "He is it that exercised the priesthood in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem.<a name=195:17></a>" That is, it is typically a question of the full light of the assembly, the Lord's full place on high, the heavenly side.<a name=195:18></a>

		S.McC.<a name=205:1></a> As we did not finish chapter 4 we might refer back a little to it, for the teaching of it is important in regard to the present time.<a name=205:2></a> As was said this morning 1 Kings gives us the heavenly side of the type of the truth bearing on Christ and the assembly at the present moment.<a name=205:3></a> Chronicles gives us more the side linked with the world to come -- the millennium, therefore the remarkable stress of sonship in Kings which we do not have in Chronicles in the same way.<a name=205:4></a> While it is there, it is not seen to the extent to which it is seen in 1 Kings, and the absence in Kings of the veil, the folding doors in the temple, all stressing in our minds in the teaching in the type, the liberty connected with the side of things that we are considering.<a name=205:5></a> We might just refer to this verse 7 to the end of verse 19 and verse 20 where it is alluded to, to see how the working out of the administration under Solomon, as in verse 20 involve felicitous conditions among the brethren, as it says "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.<a name=205:6></a>" It is to point us in our thoughts to the prosperity of an administration of this kind of character where the spirit and grace of sonship is prominent, difficult territories entering into the areas in which influence is exercised, verses 7 and 19, but whatever the area and whatever the disadvantage may be and difficulty, each yields its quota to the richness and fulness of what is linked with King Solomon's table.<a name=205:7></a> I think that souls coming amongst us need to get an impression of King Solomon's table, that there is no doubt amongst us, it is

		S.McC.<a name=206:5></a> Just so.<a name=206:6></a> She was impressed with the happiness of the realm, the relations between Solomon and his servants, and I think souls in coming amongst us should get an impression as to the felicitous conditions that belong to the assembly world.<a name=206:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=206:8></a>W.<a name=206:9></a> Would Paul be referring to that in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4">Philippians  4</a>where he says "And know also ye, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated anything to me in the way of giving and receiving save ye alone" and so on: "Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account?<a name=206:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=206:11></a> The letter to the Philippians is remarkable for the particular happy atmosphere that there seems to be amongst the brethren.<a name=206:12></a> Not just superficial happiness but the settled joy and happiness that is linked with the enjoyment of the truth from the heavenly side.<a name=206:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=207:4></a> Just so.<a name=207:5></a> The difficult things have been gone through in the opening chapters of the book.<a name=207:6></a> The features of the man of sin and shame which appeared to the displacement of David and Solomon were thoroughly gone over in the first three chapters in the book, and Solomon is projected on to our view through the prophetic service of Nathan, the maternal influence of Bathsheba, and the moral weight acquired in military prowess of Benaiah, and Zadok comes into it as bringing the horn of oil out of the tent of meeting, to anoint Solomon.<a name=207:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.I.<a name=207:8></a> Would such conditions as are before us in this chapter greatly facilitate recovery?<a name=207:9></a> I was thinking of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, "How many hired servants of my father's have abundance of bread, and I perish here by famine," and it says "they began to make merry.<a name=207:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=207:11></a> Exactly.<a name=207:12></a> This involves the truth of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, because <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>really involves Ephesians in the full result of it, that we have our happy, buoyant state of things in the house of God referred to there, all conducive to the help of returning ones such as is set out in the teaching.<a name=207:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.A.<a name=207:14></a>I.<a name=207:15></a> So that Naomi had heard that Jehovah had visited his people to give them bread.<a name=207:16></a> Is that the forerunner of the movement to go back?<a name=207:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=208:4></a> Yes, it would point to a spiritual movement in which the Spirit of God is, making way for Christ.<a name=208:5></a> That is the only man that the Spirit of God will make way for.<a name=208:6></a> He will not make way for any other man, but Christ.<a name=208:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=208:10></a> That is it exactly.<a name=208:11></a> It is making way for the wealth of Solomon's administration, especially in view of Judah and Israel being many, eating and drinking and making merry.<a name=208:12></a> There are thus conditions in which the truth prospers as indicated here.<a name=208:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=208:14></a>I.<a name=208:15></a> So what we have considered in the chapter in regard to sonship in the first six verses, and then personality coming out in this way of superintending, things become regulated; is that necessary in view of this felicitous state of things being promoted?<a name=208:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=208:17></a> Well, exactly, and it is important that there should be this testimonially amongst us if the truth of the glad tidings is to prosper.<a name=208:18></a> Souls are going to get help.<a name=208:19></a> We need the enjoyment of the truth substantially with us and amongst us.<a name=208:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=208:25></a> That is right, and especially do we need to be helped to see the importance of putting our hand to matters.<a name=208:26></a> Someone was referring when we closed this morning to the fact that in two instances daughters of Solomon are referred to.<a name=208:27></a> Verse 11 it says "Ben-Abinadab had all the upland of Dor; Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife.<a name=208:28></a>" And then later it

		says in verse 15 as to Basmath: "Ahimaaz in Nephtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon as wife.<a name=209:1></a>" We have the particular links in affinity with Solomon, not only King Solomon on the throne exercising the benign influence objectively, and affecting things subjectively throughout the whole realm, but we have these persons that are referred to -- Officers, persons of moral quality were linking on with all this in its objective way.<a name=209:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=209:3></a>W.<a name=209:4></a> Would the two references given, give an indication that the superintendents were keeping in close touch with Solomon?<a name=209:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=209:6></a> That is what I thought in saying that there were links of affinity between them.<a name=209:7></a> That they were not only officially in the position, but there was a certain link in affinity with them, between Solomon and themselves.<a name=209:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=209:9></a>W.<a name=209:10></a> Do you think these two references might have a bearing on our present day -- sisters being in the care meetings?<a name=209:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=209:12></a> Well, exactly, especially where you have matters working out in this way in regard to the administration of Solomon.<a name=209:13></a> "Solomon had twelve superintendents over all Israel; and they provided food for the king and his household: each man his month in the year had to make provision.<a name=209:14></a>" And these women are brought into it, showing the important part that the sisters have in it too, while not so much is said about them, they are there.<a name=209:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=209:16></a>I.<a name=209:17></a> So that apart from the side of sonship or what there may be in relation to Solomon officially, there is this link on a family line.<a name=209:18></a> The daughters of Solomon would bring in that side, wouldn't they?<a name=209:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=209:20></a> Well, they would, especially stressing the feminine side.<a name=209:21></a> The Lord has been helping us much as to the subjective and feminine side in recent years.<a name=209:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=210:11></a>W.<a name=210:12></a> As to your remarks bearing on the king's table, I think that is important, it would be far reaching with us.<a name=210:13></a> The superintendents not only caring exactly for Solomon's interests, but caring for the interests of the brethren so to speak.<a name=210:14></a> That links on, does it, with the administration that flows from King Solomon's table?<a name=210:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=210:16></a> And so it says in verse 27 "And those officers provided food for King Solomon, and for all who came to King Solomon's table, every man in his month: they let nothing be wanting.<a name=210:17></a>" It is not only for King Solomon but for all who came to <i>King</i> Solomon's table.<a name=210:18></a> Notice the constant reference to the regal thought, and we need to keep regal thoughts in our minds from the standpoint of the administration in its heavenly bearing.<a name=210:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=210:20></a>W.<a name=210:21></a> So that would be a real thought for us to have before us in relation to our local meetings -- prayer meetings and reading meetings, addresses, ministry meetings and so on.<a name=210:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=210:23></a> That is how administration would work out in effect and result.<a name=210:24></a> Reconciliation as it is brought in connection with the truth of the glad tidings involves unity and affection among the brethren.<a name=210:25></a> Now that is a point that we are inclined to miss in regard to reconciliation.<a name=210:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.R.<a name=211:9></a>T.<a name=211:10></a> Is that what Paul is after in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4">Philippians  4</a>in the Epistle you referred to, "being of the same mind in the Lord?<a name=211:11></a>" I refer to the two sisters.<a name=211:12></a>

	</div>

		S.McC.<a name=281:1></a> We were noticing in Nelson last weekend the dignity and greatness of the position that comes into view in relation to Solomon.<a name=281:2></a> He sets out the great thought of sonship, and the whole system of things in the opening chapters of 1 Kings in relation to Solomon's regime, suggests in type the greatness and magnificence of christianity from the heavenly viewpoint.<a name=281:3></a> It is important that we should understand the greatness of christianity as presented in Christ in the assembly from the heavenly side, because we are formed generally by what engages us; and one thing to be noted too in relation to Solomon is this great feature of wisdom which seems to mark the position established in relation to him.<a name=281:4></a> I think that we need to understand this feature more.<a name=281:5></a> There would be a difference between light and wisdom.<a name=281:6></a> I think that the more sonship is apprehended according to the mind of God as characterising the dispensation, the more the resource linked with wisdom will be seen in operation amongst the saints in the solution of all the administrative matters.<a name=281:7></a> The legal system would train the legal mind to think along certain lines and would like precepts to guide and a book of definitions in administrative matters; but in Solomon's regime we are impressed with the dignity of sonship, with which is linked this great feature of wisdom.<a name=281:8></a> Wisdom is the handmaid of love, and where you get sonship apprehended and enjoyed among the saints and love operating, we may expect this quality of wisdom in the local gatherings in the working out of the truth, especially on the public and administrative side.<a name=281:9></a> You will remember that in chapter 7, verse 13, it says, "And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out

		S.McC.<a name=306:1></a> This letter, as the brethren know, brings before us the greatest thoughts in the divine mind in relation to the saints of the present dispensation.<a name=306:2></a> The ministry in this epistle has in mind that our thoughts might be elevated and enlarged in relation to the immensity of the scope of divine operations, proceeding from Christ in heaven and working out in the power of the Spirit here.<a name=306:3></a> While we generally accept, as a matter of doctrine, that the Lord is in heaven; having been raised from the dead and carried up into heaven as Luke tells us, we need to make way for the greatness of this actually in our minds; the greatness of the position linked with Christ as Man in heaven, and from that position things being administered, as we have reference made in this chapter, the whole realm of the testimony being in mind in relation to what is working out from Christ in His position as Man in heaven; the centre of all divine administration, and the administration having particularly in mind in this dispensation, the assembly, although the administration in Ephesians would go far beyond our dispensation.<a name=306:4></a> The Lord Jesus when here was administering, He secured the nucleus of the assembly in the disciples, the Spirit coming down in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, and forming the assembly.<a name=306:5></a> The men that were theme, the personnel, were the fruit of Christ's service here, and then He will administer in the day to come, when the fulness of times will be reached.<a name=306:6></a> Things will be headed up in the Christ.<a name=306:7></a> He is administering now, as known to faith, in the present dispensation, in heaven, with the whole realm of the testimony in mind, and

		S.McC.<a name=317:4></a> According to His good pleasure, first of all, verse 9, which He purposed in Himself.<a name=317:5></a> As if this matter of sonship as we understand it in the light of these expressions would have a commanding place in our thoughts.<a name=317:6></a> What a serious thing it would be to fall beneath the level of it, to fall beneath the dignity of it, and to interfere with the liberty of it.<a name=317:7></a> I think that is what the Lord is stressing on the eve of the translation, that the saints might be set free in the greatest and most distinctive of the blessings in the dispensation -- sonship.<a name=317:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=317:21></a> Well, I think it is important to see how redemption comes in, specially stressing its position "<i>in whom</i> we have redemption.<a name=317:22></a>" I think it would stress what beloved Mr.<a name=317:23></a> Taylor has referred to in the course of his ministry as the "glory of redemption.<a name=317:24></a>" It is the glory of it, the position of it here, in whom, in the Beloved, that exalted Object of divine affections, that redemption is presented.<a name=317:25></a>

		A.I.<a name=318:2></a> As Paul says in Colossians, "the Son of his love," and he goes on to say "in whom we have redemption.<a name=318:3></a>" I was thinking of "the Son of his love" as connected with the Beloved.<a name=318:4></a>

		C.F.<a name=318:9></a>I.<a name=318:10></a> Would the contemplation of this thought, "Taken us into favour in the Beloved," help us in the enlarging of the divine affections made known in sonship; to think of One who is the Beloved, who fully answers to that love?<a name=318:11></a>

		S.McC.<a name=323:6></a> It is interesting that the first prime feature that is mentioned is sonship.<a name=323:7></a> That is, the hope of his calling would be sonship in a heavenly way; it is heaven and the great thought of sonship that is in mind in the hope of God's calling.<a name=323:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=323:12></a> Well, I think so, because as to the great matter of sonship, while it is presented as a gift in the glad tidings, to be laid hold of by faith, God sends out the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, showing how we are to be inwardly affected by it.<a name=323:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=323:17></a> Well, exactly.<a name=323:18></a> The work of God in all its greatness, as viewed in Ephesians has in mind this great change, morally, in the saints, which enables them to take in and appreciate the richness of these thoughts that we have as to the saints of the assembly.<a name=323:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=345:1></a> We should be helped in considering this chapter, in keeping in mind the Lord functioning as Man in heaven in regard to the great administration that is proceeding from there, in relation to the whole realm of the testimony, and having in mind the full scope of the truth.<a name=345:2></a> We shall see, as comes out in this chapter, the great place the assembly has, and the greatness of divine thoughts that are linked with the assembly in this particular setting.<a name=345:3></a> Paul, you will recall at Ephesus, stressed the fact that in his service and ministry among them, he had not shunned to declare to them the whole counsel of God, reminding us of the scope of the truth in relation to his service and ministry in Ephesus.<a name=345:4></a> Resident, as he was, three years among them, serving in patient and devoted service from house to house, showing how extensive his labours were, admonishing each one, as he says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, showing how all the saints were in his mind in his service in that locality.<a name=345:5></a> And what we should keep before us in our inquiry this morning together, in a subject and dependent way, is his own distinctiveness first, then the way that the assembly is brought in in relation to the thought of the mystery, and then the greatness of the realm of mediatorial operations as in verses 14 to 19; then the great end in the assembly where the worship of God is particularly before us, God in the most extended way we can think of Him, involving Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and answering glory issuing to Him in the assembly, as viewed in the 21st verse.<a name=345:6></a> The position of Paul in the prison is to be noted, detained as he was through circumstances,

		no doubt in view of the fulness of the truth coming out.<a name=346:1></a> We are thus reminded that circumstances in themselves do not necessarily hinder the outflow of divine thoughts; it may be as under the Lord's hand they may be used in view of the fulness of the truth coming out.<a name=346:2></a> The latter part of the second chapter, particularly leaves our minds with an impression as to the greatness of the assembly as the family or the vessel that would be intelligent in regard to every divine thought.<a name=346:3></a> For the holy temple in the Lord, in its full result involving the world to come, would show what a vessel of intelligence the assembly is, as F.<a name=346:4></a>E.<a name=346:5></a>R.<a name=346:6></a> said many years ago, the library of the universe.<a name=346:7></a> She is the great light-bearer of the universe and the greatness of the present moment in the Gentile assembly, the habitation of God in Spirit, leads Paul to proceed with this great parenthesis in the 3rd chapter, where the greatness of his ministry is stressed.<a name=346:8></a>

		I.L.<a name=346:9></a> What had you in mind in drawing attention to Paul's labours in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>?<a name=346:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=346:11></a> I think it is to show us, that the matter of this coming into the truth in relation to the spiritual and heavenly side is not an easy matter.<a name=346:12></a> It involved much for Paul in his ministry and service -- much in the way of arduous labour and toil, and yet so prospered by the Lord as it was.<a name=346:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=346:14></a>I.<a name=346:15></a> Have you in mind the Lord operating from His position in heaven in relation to Paul's prisonership now?<a name=346:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=346:17></a> Well, exactly, that it is all part of the functioning of this great administration which has its centre in heaven.<a name=346:18></a> The Spirit here in the assembly, commensurate with the position in heaven where Christ is as Man, functions in that position, in relation to the administration which involves the unfolding of all the truth in regard to the counsels of God in this dispensation.<a name=346:19></a>

		P.B.<a name=347:1></a> So in the first chapter of Ephesians and the 2nd and 3rd you have a climax in relation to the assembly?<a name=347:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=347:3></a> Yes, and it is to be noted that in each of the first three chapters they close with unique references to the assembly.<a name=347:4></a> All the chapters which are dealing with the doctrine of the truth, in regard to the purpose and counsels of God, end with unique references to the assembly.<a name=347:5></a> When we come to the hortatory part of the epistle, we do not get the same references to the assembly, but we specially get it where the doctrine of the truth is being opened out.<a name=347:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.S.<a name=347:7></a>K.<a name=347:8></a> In this 3rd chapter the apostle almost makes a second salutation.<a name=347:9></a> It is certainly different from the beginning of the first, now referring to himself as the one in bonds, or the prisoner of the Christ Jesus.<a name=347:10></a> Is there a suggestion in this that what peculiarly sets out the mystery here will be in conflict and in suffering?<a name=347:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=347:12></a> I think so.<a name=347:13></a> It involves that the truth of the assembly from the standpoint that we are considering and looking at it, comes out of circumstances of pressure.<a name=347:14></a> Yet on the other hand they are circumstances in which the servant, as free from the arduous nature and character of his service, can take account of the full scope of the truth, and is used of the Lord to bring it to us.<a name=347:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=347:16></a> I think our attention was drawn to the disposition on the part of the Lord Jesus when in the garden of Gethsemane, the way He disposed of the disciples, taking with Him the three, under circumstances of the greatest pressure.<a name=347:17></a> Is it to be wondered at that He disposes of His servants, although it may involve them in great pressure, so precious are the matters in hand?<a name=347:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=347:19></a> So that the difference between chapters 3 and 4 has been often noted; in chapter 4 it is what Paul has accepted in his own soul in regard of the circumstances into which he has been brought, the prisoner

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=348:3></a>I.<a name=348:4></a> Would the result be seen in verse 4, "Ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ?<a name=348:5></a>" Is it a great thing that one has this intelligence?<a name=348:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=348:7></a> Well, it is indeed.<a name=348:8></a> Whoever of us may not know too much about it, here is one man that can speak; as we have had pointed out before, his intelligence, "my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ," a remarkable allusion of Paul's to himself, not in any egotistic way, but as restfully understanding his part in the administration of the mystery.<a name=348:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.R.<a name=348:10></a>H.<a name=348:11></a> Does this administration from heaven largely take shape in Paul's ministry?<a name=348:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=348:13></a> In its fulness it does, but we must not leave out the twelve -- the Lord reserved Paul for the completing of the word of God, involving the knowledge of the mystery -- Christ and the assembly as uniquely presented in this epistle.<a name=348:14></a> This is peculiarly linked with the Pauline ministry.<a name=348:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=348:16></a>C.<a name=348:17></a> Might the activities of the Lord towards the assembly and through the assembly in the present time practically be described in this term, "the administration of the grace of God?<a name=348:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=348:19></a> Well, it shows, does it not, that in regard to Paul's service in bringing out the great truth as to Christ and the assembly, that the administration of the grace of God entered into it.<a name=348:20></a> We might have put in there, had we been writing it, the administration of the glory of God; but the administration of the grace of God shows us what a dignified feature grace is, as entering into this matter in view of the revelation of the mystery.<a name=348:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=349:2></a> Well, I think it is to project on to our minds, on to our view, the greatness of the present time of faith, in which the Gentiles play such a large part.<a name=349:3></a> Just like Joseph exalted in Egypt, the great realm of administration that proceeds from him, so faith would understand the great position of Christ in heaven functioning as Man, the administration proceeding, bringing out the truth of Christ and the assembly, proceeding in relation to the nations, the Jews being brought in too, "joint partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus.<a name=349:4></a>" It enlarges our minds as to the immensity of the scope of this administration.<a name=349:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=349:6></a>B.<a name=349:7></a> Do verses 10 and 11 in the next chapter illustrate how the administration works?<a name=349:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=349:9></a> Yes, we shall see that this afternoon; the way that administration enters into chapter 4 in a subsidiary way involving the gifts, so that the truth might be set on and enforced, in relation to the saints.<a name=349:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=349:11></a>W.<a name=349:12></a> The administration is a more extensive thought than the ministry.<a name=349:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=349:14></a> The administration that we are alluding to, proceeding from Christ in heaven, goes right on into the millennium, and in result goes into eternity.<a name=349:15></a> It is concentrated at the present moment in the functioning of Christ, as Man in heaven, in relation to the great thought of the assembly; every prophetic line held up, as it were, to make way for the greatness of the assembly at the present moment.<a name=349:16></a>

		S.McC.<a name=349:20></a> It is.<a name=349:21></a> Love enters into administration, the operation of it, the working out of it, and so in Ephesians, right through from beginning to end the feature of love is stressed.<a name=349:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=351:6></a> It shows it is not a question of what is academic with Paul, "according to the working of his power," power enters into the matter of the truth, as it is coming out here, "The gift of the grace of God given to me according to the working of his power.<a name=351:7></a>" Notice how he is amplifying the thought of grace in bringing in the truth of the mystery and what was distinctive to his own commission.<a name=351:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=351:9></a>I.<a name=351:10></a> So that the knowledge of the mystery in revelation given to him was one thing, but this grace, the making of it known in the power that was in that, was another thing.<a name=351:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=372:22></a> Well, that is an allusion to one item in the moral universe, the body.<a name=372:23></a> The body is a great item in the moral universe.<a name=372:24></a> One body and one Spirit and it has a peculiar place, and verse 16 would bring in how it works out practically among the saints.<a name=372:25></a>

		S.McC.<a name=372:29></a> The whole chapter is full of the theme of administration beginning with this thought of the moral universe, the great basis in the one body and the one Spirit, then the great working out of the administration in the one Lord, one faith, one baptism, working out even to the physical universe.<a name=372:30></a> Because the administration in relation to Christ in heaven, not only involves the moral but the physical universe.<a name=372:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=373:3></a> Well, I think a sense of the fixity of the moral universe would help us when things are working out, when the storms rise and the ship may be filled with the waves; it is a great thing to be steadied in our souls in the sense of the fixedness of the administration linked with the moral universe.<a name=373:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=380:5></a> And then it has in mind, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith.<a name=380:6></a> Now it is a great matter that the saints should arrive at the thought of the unity of the faith, to which the administration is directed in the work of the ministry.<a name=380:7></a> That means, that we all think and say the same things.<a name=380:8></a> We are marked by the same apprehension of the truth in a general way.<a name=380:9></a>

		S.McC.<a name=380:14></a> Yes.<a name=380:15></a> So that while each gift would have a distinctive impression of Christ, and it is not for us to compare the gifts, for comparisons are odious, we have to bear in mind that there is infinite variety in the work of the ministry in that way, but there is this idea of the pattern, the unity of the faith which governs all the ministry.<a name=380:16></a>

		S.McC.<a name=380:20></a> Well, I think it is to bring out what a prime matter this is, that the Son of God has come into manhood and as such He has become a standard for manhood according to God, and all the ministry is directed towards bringing us to that standard, the knowledge of the Son of God over against the development of what is around us in the world.<a name=380:21></a> This is manhood in relation to another world of which the Son of God is the centre.<a name=380:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=381:6></a> Well, of course Paul and Silas sang in prison.<a name=381:7></a> They sang before men, but I do not think there is much in our singing to commend itself in public testimony on the street -- the brethren will pardon the reference -- the singing is not just exactly something to be presented in testimony in that way, because it is the preaching that involves power in the message which is a little bit different from the singing.<a name=381:8></a>

		The thought of leadership is in mind in this service this afternoon.<a name=410:1></a> Leadership, of course, is spoken of in many ways in the scriptures.<a name=410:2></a> We were alluding this morning to leadership by principles.<a name=410:3></a> A very important thing in its setting, that we should know how to be led by right principles.<a name=410:4></a> It is easy to be led by wrong principles but at the very outset we are reminded in being recovered morally from the ruin around us, that we have to follow right principles.<a name=410:5></a> Right principles are wonderful in that relation.<a name=410:6></a> We must not minimise them; we must not make little of them, we must hold them all in their relative values, because they are our salvation, in days of public confusion, difficulty and breakdown.<a name=410:7></a> But I want to speak of leadership in persons, which Is also a great matter in its place, for it is important that we should understand right leadership in persons and the door is open for leadership for all of us in different ways, as we may know and have observed in the scriptures.<a name=410:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One great feature of leadership is that we are to take the lead in paying honour one to another.<a name=410:9></a> For we shall never love one another rightly, according to divine thoughts, unless we respect one another, and value one another, as it is our right to value one another in connection with divine thoughts.<a name=410:10></a> And I want to speak first of all of leadership in Christ, our great Model.<a name=410:11></a> Then I want to speak of it in Moses, God leading in and through Moses, and then in David -- choice men as they are, two of the greatest men in the Old Testament.<a name=410:12></a> They are a great example to us, persons like ourselves, of like passions, a great example to us in relation to the truth and in care and love

	<div class="paragraph">
		for the people of God.<a name=411:1></a> It is obvious to most of us, to all of us I would suppose, here, that it is right and befitting that we should begin with our Lord Jesus Christ, for He has left a model for us.<a name=411:2></a> Leadership, in Christ, according to John's gospel involves more than an arbitrary lead, it is leadership presented to us in One who can say He is altogether that which He says.<a name=411:3></a> A very important matter in leadership, that we should lead as being living exponents of the truth.<a name=411:4></a> And the Lord Jesus sets the example for us in John's gospel and I want to refer to Him in relation to His leadership in this section.<a name=411:5></a> As we know this chapter is unique to John's gospel, we do not find it in Luke, nor in Mark, nor in Matthew.<a name=411:6></a> It is special to John, as if it is a chapter that we need to understand in the last days, because John's ministry is specifically dealing with the last days.<a name=411:7></a> This is one part, one chapter that needs to be understood in our time and in our day, because the Lord Jesus stresses in regard to the sheep that they hear His voice and that they will never perish.<a name=411:8></a> He says "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give them life eternal and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.<a name=411:9></a>" We were referring to security this morning and we need to get a sense of the security from this viewpoint also, that we are in the hand of Christ.<a name=411:10></a> The Lord Jesus is not as it were, in this relation far from the sheep nor the sheep far from Him.<a name=411:11></a> Luke in chapter 15 brings in the matter of estrangement and distance through sin but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>the sheep are viewed as in the hand of Christ.<a name=411:12></a> It is a wonderful thing to take account of, dear brethren, that we are in His hand.<a name=411:13></a> There are many things and forces of evil that would take us out of that position if they could, but the Lord Jesus will give us the fixed assurance and we need that assurance in view of being restful in the divine realm,
	</div>

		<a name=412>[Page 412]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		restful in the path of the testimony.<a name=412:1></a> We need this assurance for our hearts that "I give them life eternal and they shall never perish and no one shall seize them out of my hand.<a name=412:2></a>" "My Father, who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.<a name=412:3></a>" You can see, dear brethren, in this relation how intimately the Father and the Son are bound up with the matter of the sheep, according to John.<a name=412:4></a> Because the Lord does not speak of His own hand the second time, He speaks of the Father's hand.<a name=412:5></a> It is affecting that God should come into the realm of understandable language, so that we should know the feelings of His heart about us, and toward us, because the Father remains in the inscrutableness of Deity; yet in this gospel we are reminded of how He comes within our range in expressions that are calculated to touch our spiritual feelings and emotions.<a name=412:6></a> You will remember how the bosom of the Father is referred to in the first chapter, and the One who is in that place, the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=412:7></a> The delightfulness of manhood in Jesus in all its spiritual excellence is in view in that position in the first chapter.<a name=412:8></a> But it is not exactly a question of the Lord Jesus that is being stressed here and His links with the Father, although they are in the chapter, but the sheep and what the sheep are, not only to Christ but also to the Father.<a name=412:9></a> I think it is a wonderful thing in this gospel, dear brethren, that we come under the notice of the Father because we love Christ, and this chapter would intensify that thought in our minds that as loving Christ the Shepherd, the true Shepherd, as hearing His voice and following Him we come under the Father's notice, yea, we are in the Father's hand, the hand of the Father.<a name=412:10></a> So that over against all the apostate currents and movements so swiftly flowing in the scene through which we

	</div>

		pass, we, the sheep of Christ, are in the hand of Christ and in the hand of the Father.<a name=413:1></a> What security, dear brethren, as we think of the Father and the Son bound up in this great matter of the care of the sheep.<a name=413:2></a> You will have noticed too how the Father and the Son are bound up in the matter of the administration of the Spirit.<a name=413:3></a> The Father sent the Spirit, and the Son sent the Spirit.<a name=413:4></a> What a prime matter the coming of the Spirit is in that both the Father and the Son should enter into that administrative act seen at Pentecost.<a name=413:5></a> What a prime place the saints of the assembly have in the divine mind.<a name=413:6></a> What concentration of interest and feeling in relation to the saints is seen in the Father and the Son in Their activities towards the saints in all the glory of the economy into which They come, yea, in which we have part, serving with the fixed objectives that are in mind in the glory and grace of the economy, the like of which has never been seen since time began.<a name=413:7></a> And John would stress in this particular part, the holy interest in the matter of the sheep.<a name=413:8></a> What the saints are in all that defenceless character publicly in a scene marked by hostility, yet they themselves are subjects of the work of God and true to the work of God in them, hearing the Shepherd's voice and following the Shepherd.<a name=413:9></a> The Lord Jesus, in speaking about this matter of the sheep, and His place as the Shepherd does not omit references to the false persons that are alluded to in the thief and the robber.<a name=413:10></a> He says, "Verily, verily I say to you, he that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, he is a thief and a robber.<a name=413:11></a>" We have to be reminded, you see, of the legal way, the right way I mean, the door reminds us of the right way.<a name=413:12></a> It was not a surreptitious movement that the Lord speaks of here in His coming in but there were those who were marked by surreptitious movements just as in the time of the Galatians Paul

		Now I want in passing, dear brethren, just to allude to what this kind of leadership involves for Christ.<a name=415:3></a> We have mentioned it in the hymn which we have sung.<a name=415:4></a> It is mentioned in the chapter, His laying down His life for the sheep.<a name=415:5></a> We are not to forget what this leadership cost Him; we, any one of us here, may have a part in leading the sheep but we shall never have to pass through the waters that this Shepherd passed through in love for the sheep.<a name=415:6></a> We shall never have to go where He went.<a name=415:7></a> Let none of us make too much of our pressure and our suffering, let us remember that the One who has pioneered the way in suffering love for the sheep has gone where none of us shall ever be called to go.<a name=415:8></a> How wonderful it is, dear brethren, to think of His leadership, to think of what it cost Him, to bring them out of the fold.<a name=415:9></a> There is no fold in christianity.<a name=415:10></a> I know we use the word sometimes; you hear it used but it does not properly belong to christianity.<a name=415:11></a> The word that belongs to christianity is "the flock.<a name=415:12></a>" As has been said Judaism is a circumference without a centre, christianity is a centre without a circumference.<a name=415:13></a> We want to understand the intensity of leadership in this chapter.<a name=415:14></a> The thieves and the robbers, why is the Lord using these terms?<a name=415:15></a> He sets on the matter as to the fold, the Jewish fold, and the thieves and the robbers and those that are serving for wages.<a name=415:16></a> How totally contrary to the spirit and grace of the economy into which this blessed Shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ, has come to serve the sheep even unto going into death for them.<a name=415:17></a> The Lord throws into relief, you see, wrong leadership, the elements and the principles and the

		Now I want to speak of leadership in Moses.<a name=417:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#63">Isaiah  63</a>we have this reference to the leadership of God in Moses; you will remember how the section opens with the people relating their experiences, the remnant is speaking, someone is speaking here, "I will record the loving kindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he hath bestowed upon them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.<a name=417:5></a>" Then it says, "And he said, they are indeed my people, children that will not lie; and he became their Saviour.<a name=417:6></a> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bore them and carried them all the days of old.<a name=417:7></a>" We are reminded, dear brethren, of the care of God for us in this relation, and before saying a word as to Moses and what came to light in divine leadership in Moses, I want to just draw our attention to this great matter of God Himself, and His identification with us in all the vicissitudes of the path here.<a name=417:8></a> It says, "He became their Saviour, in all their affliction he was afflicted.<a name=417:9></a>" That touches our hearts, dear brethren, as we think of our afflictions, we think of what they are to ourselves, we think of what they are to the saints and how the saints feel about them; but think of what they were to God, what they were to the One who became their Saviour, as it says, "In all their affliction he was afflicted.<a name=417:10></a>" Think of that, dear

		It is before one, dear brethren, to speak a word this afternoon, on divine intervention, having in mind that our thoughts may be enlarged in relation to God and our knowledge of Him, and His faithfulness, especially as it appears over against the dark background linked with days of brokenness publicly.<a name=424:1></a> This prophecy has to do with conditions analogous to our own, but light is brought in in this prophecy to stimulate the remnant in faith, and our faith needs to be stimulated, and the more we read the prophets, the more our faith will be stimulated.<a name=424:2></a> So that however difficult the circumstances, the sense of the faithfulness of God to His people, should help each and all of us to go forward with Him in what He is doing.<a name=424:3></a> It is a wonderful thing to be with God in what He is doing in the finishing days of the dispensation.<a name=424:4></a> It is a sorrowful thing not to be with God in what He is doing, but it is important to see that God takes account in this book of those that are with Him.<a name=424:5></a>

		The thought of the Spirit in relation to divine administration is on one's mind and heart for this hour tonight.<a name=438:1></a> I am sure that we need to apprehend more the importance of the presence of the Spirit with us and in us, not only in relation to this matter but many other matters; but I wish to stress in what I have to say now the administrative side.<a name=438:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice the reference to the Holy Spirit in both chapters from which we read in the New Testament, and the reference to the well which is a type of the Spirit in Exodus.<a name=438:3></a> One feels, as no doubt most of us feel, especially in the days that we are in, the need for understanding the Spirit's presence in the way in which He is with us and in us in this dispensation.<a name=438:4></a> And not only understanding His presence but coming to a better apprehension of what His presence means, a better enjoyment of what it is to know Him as with us and in us, in the way in which He is.<a name=438:5></a> It is something that will never fail us if we make room for the Holy Spirit.<a name=438:6></a> Many things may fail, many things may break down, as indeed things have broken down in the dispensation publicly; but there is one thing that never changes, and that is the presence of the Spirit.<a name=438:7></a> So that whatever may be the vicissitudes of the testimony, whatever may come into the course of things in the days that may be left to us before our Lord come, although they may be few -- for we wait momentarily for His coming, for the rapture -- but whatever they may be, few or many, it is important that we should see more and more the need of communing with the Spirit and of allowing the

		presence of the Spirit to have full weight with us as set together on the side of administration.<a name=439:1></a> Moses was a great administrator as we shall see.<a name=439:2></a> You will remember the challenge they raised against him in verse 14 as to administration, and Moses had to flee and he sat by the well.<a name=439:3></a> We shall come to that, but I wish to begin with John and what he says in this unique section in his reference to the Spirit.<a name=439:4></a> John's ministry has in mind the last days; he has in mind the days when breakdown has set in, when Paul's ministry has been given up on every hand.<a name=439:5></a> John comes in to bring in what goes through despite the breakdown.<a name=439:6></a> There are many things in his gospel that are unaffected by the breakdown to which he calls attention, as, for instance, the great feature of life.<a name=439:7></a> John speaks of life more than any other of the evangelists, and whatever may have come into the dispensation in a public way, the life line goes through, an important thing for us to see.<a name=439:8></a> Now in chapter 20 the Lord Jesus breathing into them saying to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit," inaugurated an administration the like of which has never been seen before in the hands of men; a mandate was delivered to them which had never been delivered to men before.<a name=439:9></a>

		You can see that John's ministry would help us to see what comes in through degeneracy of doctrine, and when the mind of man apart from the Spirit injects itself into the great matter of the truth, there can only be one result and that is disaster.<a name=442:14></a> What error has come through the church councils in which men endeavour to preserve the truth, their endeavour, perhaps, well meant.<a name=442:15></a> And then the great truth of the Reformation came in, and much was done, servants of God were raised up and gleams as to the truth came forward -- the great servant of God, Martin

		The assembly, as has often been said, is the family of families.<a name=467:3></a> There is no family in the universe of God that will ever have the same dignity and glory as the assembly has.<a name=467:4></a> Every family, of course, in God's universe will bear the touch of the Father's impress -- He who gives names to every family.<a name=467:5></a> And in Ephesians where the Father is referred to as naming every family in heaven and on earth, the writer does not go on to speak of these families, he goes on to speak of one family.<a name=467:6></a> The other families recede, as it were, from our view, as he goes on to speak of the great family that is found in the assembly, the vessel to which there is glory to God at the present time.<a name=467:7></a>

		Now there are many ways in which the assembly may be viewed.<a name=467:8></a> We think of the type in Eve.<a name=467:9></a> Jehovah saw that it was not good that man should be alone and he furnished in Eve a counterpart, a helpmate for the man.<a name=467:10></a> We find too, in regard to Rebecca, that the father sends the servant out on that glorious mission of finding a wife for Isaac his son.<a name=467:11></a> But that is not the side that I wish to speak of.<a name=467:12></a> We find also with Joseph, in Egypt, that a wife is given to him, Asnath, but I do not have in mind to speak of that side in regard to the assembly.<a name=467:13></a> I want to speak of the assembly, dear brethren, as she is in herself, a woman of worth; as she is in the types we have read about, a woman, who can make way for herself in the midst of difficult circumstances and difficult matters.<a name=467:14></a> Now we are to understand the assembly from this viewpoint, because

		as we do we shall be helped in our localities, in taking on this feature of the assembly, to work out things ourselves, to be industrious, to be energetic, to make a way for ourselves in whatever it may be in regard to the truth and to draw out what is in Christ as standing related to us.<a name=468:1></a> You might say, is not all that is in Christ toward us and available to us, and is He not constantly moving toward us in relation to it all?<a name=468:2></a> He is, but He loves to have things drawn out from our side.<a name=468:3></a> He loves to take account of us in the working out of matters as making a way in His affections, winning our way in His affections, for that is what the woman of worth involves.<a name=468:4></a> It is right that we have been given to Christ according to the counsels and purposes of eternal love, in the divine mind before time, but it is also right that the assembly comes under the divine eye, as furnishing divine Persons with a reason why They should do this and why They should do that.<a name=468:5></a> Matthew's gospel shows us that whatsoever is bound on earth is bound in heaven.<a name=468:6></a> The assembly, you see, comes under the divine eye in her judicial glory as doing things and divine Persons are with the assembly in what is done.<a name=468:7></a> The Lord Jesus says, "I am with you all the days until the completion of the age," to remind us as we do things, as we operate, the Lord is with us.<a name=468:8></a> The Lord is operating from on high.<a name=468:9></a> Mark tells us that and He set himself down at the right hand of God and the servants go forth and the Lord is working with them.<a name=468:10></a> The Lord is operating but He loves to see us operating, and this thought as to the assembly is to intensify this in our minds, that we have to operate, and in the operating, we are to draw out the resources of Christ.<a name=468:11></a> There are marvellous resources in Christ, dear brethren, and they are all towards us but the Lord Jesus loves to have them drawn out or drawn upon.<a name=468:12></a> And, each of these women, Ruth, Leah and Abigail, represents the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to refer to Ruth as drawing out the resources linked with power in redemption.<a name=469:2></a> The glory of redemption enters into this book and Ruth draws it out.<a name=469:3></a> She operates with a view to drawing it out; Boaz is a wonderful type of Christ, as a mighty man of wealth, not just a man of wealth, but a mighty man of wealth.<a name=469:4></a> In him is strength.<a name=469:5></a> In this book it is power in relation to redemption, the taking up of the right of redemption.<a name=469:6></a> The assembly, typified in Ruth, is drawing it out; she is winning her way in the heart of Boaz.<a name=469:7></a> He was a great operator, with a great range of operations under his hand, and in the working out of these operations there comes under his notice this maiden called Ruth.<a name=469:8></a> Just as in a gathering like this the young people may come under the attention of Christ in His mighty operations and as subject to Christ in relation to the area, the limited sphere and area of His operations, they come in for His attention, and that is chapter 2.<a name=469:9></a> Let none of us think that we are not getting the attention of Christ.<a name=469:10></a> I believe the Lord loves to see every one of us here.<a name=469:11></a> He loves to look upon a gathering like this and see the young brothers and the young sisters, loves to see the children too, not that we are forgetting the older ones, far be the thought.<a name=469:12></a> The controlling influence in this book is the older ones, Naomi, who is furnishing Ruth with the opportunity to make her way.<a name=469:13></a> I would say to the older brethren, in the light of the type in Naomi, it is a great thing to help the younger ones, to make their way in affections of Christ, to promote the idea of winning their way in the heart of Christ, so that His power may be drawn out towards them because they have to face much, as Ruth had to face much.<a name=469:14></a>

		I want to speak of another man that was known in heaven, and that is David.<a name=491:5></a> Think of being greatly beloved in the sight of heaven.<a name=491:6></a> This is the moral road to it, dear brethren.<a name=491:7></a> So, as to David.<a name=491:8></a> The passage is beautiful in itself without commenting on it.<a name=491:9></a> There was a crisis and the king said to Zadok "Carry back the ark of God into the city.<a name=491:10></a> If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah he will bring me again and show me it and its habitation.<a name=491:11></a> But if he thus say I have no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.<a name=491:12></a>" I do not think Zadok ever heard a word like that before.<a name=491:13></a> Think of that man Zadok listening to what David was saying.<a name=491:14></a> In the time of the crisis, in the time of distress, he was the king.<a name=491:15></a> He could have said a lot; he could have done a lot to marshal forces in support of him, but he says "Carry back the ark of God into the city.<a name=491:16></a>" Typically the great thing in his mind is the assembly.<a name=491:17></a> He is in type thinking of the assembly, and the place of Christ in relation to the assembly; and as he says, "I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah he will bring me again and show me it and its habitation.<a name=491:18></a> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.<a name=491:19></a>" Now, the crisis brings out the inner secret of David's moral power, that he was a man that was with God and in the test what stands him in good stead is the integrity of his relations with God.<a name=491:20></a> David is a man who is prepared to humble himself, prepared to go out completely that God might be justified, that

		In what I have to say in reading these passages I desire to promote with us the spirit of recovery.<a name=493:1></a> It is a day of recovery.<a name=493:2></a> We, ourselves, have come into the truth, into the position in which we are on this basis.<a name=493:3></a> God has intervened in the closing years of this dispensation on the principle of recovery, both as to the truth and as to persons, and where we are tonight and what we have, we owe to the great work of God in recovery.<a name=493:4></a> And the work of recovery is going on, it is a day of recovery, and God would inculcate into our minds through the teaching this great thought of recovery.<a name=493:5></a> For one feels that if we are true to our ancestry on the line of faith we shall be marked by this spirit, this grace, of desiring to recover our brother.<a name=493:6></a> You will recall that with the one who is said to be the father of us all, the heavenly man unofficially, Abraham, one of the outstanding features that shines in him early is this feature of interest and care for the recovery of his brother, Lot, who had declined from the testimony.<a name=493:7></a> Lot had chosen the well watered plains of Jordan, figurative to us as they are of all the advantageous opportunities that may spread themselves abroad for us in the scene through which we pass, but may cause us to lose our lives in the assembly.<a name=493:8></a> Abraham was great enough to reach out in the spirit and grace of this feature that we are referring to and to go after his brother Lot; and, as if heaven would show us what it thinks of this matter, heaven's resources are mysteriously moved into the scene, projected on to our view in the service of Melchizedek to show how heaven would support this kind of spirit and grace amongst the people of God.<a name=493:9></a> The ministry

		of Melchizedek stands particularly related to the return from the great conflict linked with the recovery of Lot.<a name=494:1></a> We have often referred to it, dear brethren, as fortifying Abraham against what was to come in in the overtures of the King of Sodom, but I think we need to look at it also in its retroactive bearing in regard to the activities of Abraham in seeking to recover his brother Lot.<a name=494:2></a> While the ministry suggested in the bread and the wine would have a prospective view it has also a retrospective view, in that heaven was as it were saying that here is a man that must be supported, and encouraged, and strengthened on the line that he is on, holding the ground for God.<a name=494:3></a> He is said to be the friend of God, a wonderful reference to a man like ourselves, dear brethren, and I desire in the word that is laid upon one's heart tonight, to promote this spirit among the brethren, especially in view of the imminence of the rapture, the Lord's return for which we watch and wait every moment.<a name=494:4></a> For the rapture will mean that every redeemed saint will be secured, none will be lost; there will not be one left behind, as it was said by Moses in Egypt, not a hoof would be left behind.<a name=494:5></a> So it will be in the great exodus of the assembly to be with Christ for ever; what an exodus it will be, dear brethren, when we shall go out in the sense of victory in our souls in response to the rallying shout of Him who shall come forth to receive us.<a name=494:6></a> He is going to take the matter into His own hands.<a name=494:7></a> He is not going to leave it to another, the Lord <i>Himself</i> will descend with a shout.<a name=494:8></a> The Spirit will not conduct us to heaven.<a name=494:9></a> The Lord Jesus will conduct us to heaven, such is His care for us and His interest in us.<a name=494:10></a> There is a lot to be done in many souls, maybe a lot to be done in the souls of some of us here in this audience, but it will be done, and everything will be secured in and from this scene that God has a claim to on the basis of redemption.<a name=494:11></a>

		If the glory of redemption laid hold of our souls in the way in which it should do, we should be more and more concerned in our prayers and in our outlook as to the securing of every bit of material that on the ground of redemption belongs to God.<a name=495:1></a> You will recall that when the great reverberating blast of the trumpet was heard in the fiftieth year, the year of jubilee, every man was to be returned unto his possession, every hold was to be relaxed upon their brother, and we need, dear brethren, to be marked by the spirit of the year of jubilee in relation to things being set up again on their proper basis on the ground of redemption.<a name=495:2></a>

		I have read these passages because of a reference in them to the covenant and to the blood of the covenant because I think the blood of the covenant would especially help us as to this matter of the spirit of recovery.<a name=495:3></a> The covenant reminds us of certain fixed conditions, conditions that are linked with divine faithfulness and our souls need to be imbued more and more with an appreciative sense of divine faithfulness.<a name=495:4></a> Every one of us must know in some way or another, experimentally, that when we have failed at different times in our lives, as indeed others have failed, for who amongst us here has not failed, yet divine faithfulness has remained.<a name=495:5></a> The covenant reminds us of what abides and what remains in a fixed and permanent way despite the perfidy of man after the flesh.<a name=495:6></a> As you recall, in the book that speaks of the latter glory of the house, Haggai the prophet, the word is given, "the word which I covenanted with you, when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit, remain among you.<a name=495:7></a>" That was a word given in days of recovery, dear brethren, in days when the building, the reconstruction period was difficult and required the energy of the prophetic word to stimulate and strengthen the hearts and the hands of those that were strengthening

		the things that remain.<a name=496:1></a> It is in that book, that we get the word, "the word which I covenanted with you" as if God is reminding them that whatever had departed from them, whatever they may have lost, the word that He covenanted with them was the same, it remained among them.<a name=496:2></a> So that one desires to speak of these passages from that viewpoint, especially too to draw attention to the blood of Christ in this relation because I believe the blood in this relation reminds our hearts, that the basis on which God goes forward to effectuate His great thoughts of blessing in recovery, is in the blood-shedding of Jesus.<a name=496:3></a> The blood has been shed.<a name=496:4></a> It has been poured out freely, without reserve, that the Lord Jesus, if I may speak reverently, might furnish God with a free hand, taking full account of the moral question, to go forward on the lines of recovery and set us up in relation to Himself.<a name=496:5></a> You will recall in this first passage that we read it says "But the God of peace, who brought again from among the dead, our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, in the power of the blood of the eternal covenant, perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will.<a name=496:6></a>" Why these references, to the shepherd of the sheep and the blood of the eternal covenant?<a name=496:7></a> We must remember the way that this letter is written and to whom it is written, especially with the intent that they might be saved from apostatising from the faith, and that they might be preserved from falling short of the great end in mind.<a name=496:8></a> For we are not, as the writer says, of them that draw back, we are not of the drawers back, dear brethren.<a name=496:9></a> Young people, I would speak to you tonight.<a name=496:10></a> It is a great matter not to be among the drawers back to perdition, but to be amongst those that are marked, as it says, "of faith to saving of the soul.<a name=496:11></a>"

		round about and will be the glory in the midst of her," chapter 2, verse 5.<a name=504:1></a> What divine protection is suggested, one of the most interesting things that runs through this book.<a name=504:2></a> God through the prophet, says at the beginning of this chapter, "Jehovah hath an eye upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel.<a name=504:3></a>" That is, the localities of the brethren.<a name=504:4></a> He looks out upon the tribal setting.<a name=504:5></a> He sees how we are getting on, how we are working out things, whether the spirit of grace and recovery commensurate with His own spirit and grace is operating amongst us.<a name=504:6></a> He has got an eye on these matters, the tribes of Israel, the local settings in which we are, and He is encamping about His house to protect things in view of His own rights.<a name=504:7></a> Then we have the Lord Jesus presented as coming in and the receding of the idea of conflict.<a name=504:8></a> Notice this, that if the work of grace operating in recovery is coming more into prominence, the spirit of conflict is receding.<a name=504:9></a> So it says, "And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle-bow shall be cut off.<a name=504:10></a>" That is, these matters are receding, right in their place, and employed well in their place in the wars of the Lord as they might be, but they are receding now.<a name=504:11></a> "And he shall speak peace unto the nations.<a name=504:12></a>" Think of the way the Lord Jesus could come in and speak peace to the brethren -- how He could enlarge on the thought of a son of peace in sending out the disciples.<a name=504:13></a> That is what we need in our local gatherings, dear brethren, ambassadors of peace among the brethren.<a name=504:14></a> Then it says, "As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant, I will send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.<a name=504:15></a>" Think of this kind of release, for God is addressing Zion and Jerusalem, and He is speaking of the receding of conflict and He is enlarging on the thought of peace and release.<a name=504:16></a> The time of release, we might say, is come, and then it says, "For I have bent Judah for

		me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim.<a name=505:1></a>" What flexibility this suggests in the people of God.<a name=505:2></a> They are not crystallised, unyielding, unbending, but pliable, and flexible in the divine hand.<a name=505:3></a> "I have bent Judah <i>for me</i>," not to be used by men.<a name=505:4></a> How much Judah suggests to the mind of faith.<a name=505:5></a> "I have filled the bow with Ephraim.<a name=505:6></a>" And He says, "I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, against they sons, O Greece, and make thee like the sword of a mighty man," Greece, representing as we know in our time and day, the great idea of education and learning.<a name=505:7></a> It is the world in that cultured and philosophical form.<a name=505:8></a> God is raising the sons of Zion up against it; and He says "And Jehovah will be seen over them.<a name=505:9></a>" It is delightful, dear brethren, the way that God comes into the position, and adorns His people, and supports them on the line of recovery, and what has been liberated in the work of recovery.<a name=505:10></a> It further says, "and they shall be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar.<a name=505:11></a>" Notice this suggestion of correspondence with the altar -- correspondence with the sufferings of Christ amongst His people; as it says, "filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar," alluding to what received the blood.<a name=505:12></a> It represents the saints, accepting the position of suffering under the divine hand.<a name=505:13></a> Think of how Paul says "I fill up that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake.<a name=505:14></a>" What an impression that man had and how far he was prepared to go and suffer!<a name=505:15></a> Then it says, "And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people.<a name=505:16></a>" We come back to the flock, dear brethren, the great potential value of the saints in the light of the flock, in whichever way we may view them.<a name=505:17></a> Then it says, "They shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up upon his land.<a name=505:18></a>" Think of that, dear brethren, and the testimony in it -- the saints appearing as God's land and shining in all the beauty of divine workmanship, ornamented as the

		stones of a crown adorning the inheritance, for that is the thought.<a name=506:1></a> They are not as it were, enslaved by sin, nor by the principles of self-will, detracting from the glory of the inheritance, but adorning it "lifted up as the stones of a crown, lifted up upon his land," adorning the inheritance, enhancing, as we might say, the thought of it.<a name=506:2></a> Then it says, "For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!<a name=506:3></a> Corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maidens.<a name=506:4></a>" Christ ministered constitutionally affecting the young men, the youths amongst us, and the Spirit made room for in the figure of the new wine, stimulating the maidens.<a name=506:5></a> What prosperous conditions are here suggested, fruit of the operations of divine grace in recovery!<a name=506:6></a>
