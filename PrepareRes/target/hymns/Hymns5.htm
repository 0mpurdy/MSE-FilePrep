		The book is still "The Little Flock Hymn Book," that is, it is a continuation, so far as grace has been given, of the labours of G.<a name=1:2></a>V.<a name=1:3></a>W.<a name=1:4></a> and J.<a name=1:5></a>N.<a name=1:6></a>D.<a name=1:7></a>, and in no sense a new collection of hymns.<a name=1:8></a> The notice of G.<a name=1:9></a>V.<a name=1:10></a>W.<a name=1:11></a> as to the edition of 1856, taken from the cover of the "Present Testimony," December 1857, is here given, so that those who use it may have before them, with Mr.<a name=1:12></a> Darby's preface (save that part which refers to the arrangement of the edition of 1881), a complete history of the book.<a name=1:13></a><p>T.<a name=1:14></a>H.<a name=1:15></a>R.<a name=1:16></a>
