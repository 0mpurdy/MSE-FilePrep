		NOTES OF READINGS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEW [1932] HYMNBOOK
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jottings of a reading at Paignton with reference to the revision of the hymnbook, at which C.<a name=1:1></a>A.<a name=1:2></a>C.<a name=1:3></a> was present, November 13, 1931

		Scriptures read - <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:16">Colossians  3:16</a>,17; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:18">Ephesians  5:18</a> - 21

		The service of song is primarily the service of Divine Persons, therefore the affections should be engaged in it.<a name=1:4></a> The singing is to the Lord in Ephesians and to God in Colossians, so it should be an exercise with us as to how far the word of the Christ dwells in us and we are filled with the Spirit, because the singing, should be in keeping with these conditions.<a name=1:5></a> Then "Speaking to yourselves" shows that what we sing has also the character of edification of the saints.<a name=1:6></a> This is subordinate to the service of Divine Persons but nevertheless essential.<a name=1:7></a> Singing is stimulating to our affections.<a name=1:8></a> A whole meeting may be elevated by the singing of a hymn.<a name=1:9></a> We are comforted and elevated, and the saints get something; it would not be like Divine Persons to retain all for themselves.<a name=1:10></a> Teaching and admonishing one another is based on "the word of Christ dwelling in you richly".<a name=1:11></a> The ministry forms the melody.<a name=1:12></a> We cannot sing beyond the depth and power of the ministry that comes to us, but our exercise is to be up to it.<a name=1:13></a> The effect of the word of the Christ dwelling in us richly would be that the mind of Christ would be known by the saints in intelligent affection.<a name=1:14></a> In Colossians prominence is given to the Head; everything should be attuned in the mind of the saints from the Head; in Ephesians prominence is given rather to the Spirit.<a name=1:15></a> It is suggested in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>that the saints sing with intelligence, and this necessitates that we should carefully consider what we sing; that is one great gain of the revision of the hymnbook.<a name=1:16></a> A great point in considering any proposed alteration is to inquire whether any spiritual gain accrues by it; therefore the matter becomes educational for the saints.<a name=1:17></a> Singing may be either individual or collective; in Colossians and Ephesians it is collective.<a name=1:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The hymnbook should provide hymns of Assembly character suitable for all meetings of saints.<a name=1:19></a> In some hymns the thought of sin or sins has been deleted because when in Assembly, and in the enjoyment of its privileges, we do not speak to the Father of what is offensive to Him.<a name=1:20></a> As in sonship we do not talk about what has been totally and eternally removed from His presence.<a name=1:21></a> The son in the Father's house wearing the best robe would have been unhappy to have spoken of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the far country and the swine.<a name=2:1></a> It is a matter of spiritual intuition.<a name=2:2></a> The question of sin and judgment are most essential in their place, but assuredly not to be brought into the worship of Divine Persons.<a name=2:3></a> The basis of everything is that divine righteousness has judged with authority in the death of His Son everything contrary to God, but in the Father's presence we dwell on the positive.<a name=2:4></a> Sin and sins have been removed by Christ.<a name=2:5></a> But why?<a name=2:6></a> In order that they might be replaced by what is positively delightful to God.<a name=2:7></a> As we know, He took away the first - the whole legal system - that He might establish the second - the whole pleasure of God.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:6">Romans  15:6</a> supposes a collective ascription of glory to God and is dependent on our being in unity and peace with one another "according to Christ Jesus".<a name=2:9></a> We cannot sing together if these conditions are not present.<a name=2:10></a> How can I sing if I am thinking of the way a brother has annoyed me?<a name=2:11></a> The instrument would not be tuned.<a name=2:12></a> We come in assembly in festive robes.<a name=2:13></a> Thank God, I am entitled according to His grace to think of each one according to Christ Jesus.<a name=2:14></a> He declares the Father's name to His brethren, a sanctified company; He declares the name of God; He declares God in the blessed name of revelation, of Father, and takes His place delightedly in the assembly to hymn God.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We sing because we are on the ground of what has been brought in for God's pleasure; everything offensive has been removed, we have not therefore to consider that.<a name=2:16></a> In connection with the supper we read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:24">1 Corinthians  11:24</a> "This is my body which is for you".<a name=2:17></a> In that body He has brought in everything for God's delight.<a name=2:18></a> It is strange that in such a connection we should give thanks for what He removed.<a name=2:19></a> Is not what He brought in infinitely greater than what He removed?<a name=2:20></a> He has brought in every detail for the perfect pleasure of God.<a name=2:21></a> This puts us on a positive ground of joy, we have Christ before us instead of self.<a name=2:22></a> There is no need even to think of what we were in Adam because we are in the presence of One who has brought in what is for the pleasure of God, and in the cup we have before us the blessed love of God in contrast with the whole world system which shuts Him out.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such a hymn as 227 would not be out of place at the beginning of the meeting as we come together, for we come together as those who know the Lord and who are in the common confession of His blessed Name.<a name=2:24></a> Thus all start together.<a name=2:25></a> It is not very happy if the meeting starts on such a high level that it leaves half the saints behind.<a name=2:26></a> We must keep rank.<a name=2:27></a> But then, we do not want to stop at a low level.<a name=2:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be well if we could keep in mind the three thoughts: first, the mind of the Head (Colossians); second, the Holy Spirit filling the vessel (Ephesians); third, perfect accord amongst the brethren "according to Christ Jesus" (Romans).<a name=3:1></a> These are three dominant notes.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Giving out hymns suitably is a matter of spirituality, of being in touch with the mind of the Head and having thoughts and affections subordinate to the Spirit.<a name=3:3></a> It is not a matter of precedents, for each occasion is a new occasion, something more will have been acquired than we had last Lord's Day if we are moving on with the Spirit and the brethren.<a name=3:4></a> A hymn should give tone and fibre and character to our praises.<a name=3:5></a> We need spiritual sensibility as to what suits each occasion.<a name=3:6></a> What suited a previous occasion may be unsuitable at a following one.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of the Christ suggests the mind of the Head and then what a wonderful thing it would be to be "<i>filled</i>" with the Spirit - most marvellous expression!<a name=3:8></a> No room for a thought or feeling or impulse that is not the direct result of the Spirit of God.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		None of us would do anything to belittle the thought of the blood.<a name=3:10></a> It is the great divine basis of all blessing.<a name=3:11></a> Everything rests on the blood.<a name=3:12></a> But Scripture speaks of the blood in certain specific relations, and we must pay heed to the particular setting in which Scripture puts it.<a name=3:13></a> In some hymns mention of it is introduced in a way that is not supported by Scripture.<a name=3:14></a> For example, Scripture does not appear ever to connect the thought of salvation with the blood, and while every statement in Scripture concerning the blood is part of the subject matter of faith it does not seem to be presented in Scripture quite as an object of faith.<a name=3:15></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:24">Romans  3:24</a> - 25 may appear to be an exception but the better rendering is "Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat in the power of His blood through faith"; that is, Christ Jesus Himself is the Mercy Seat to be laid hold of by faith, we trust in Him.<a name=3:16></a> Scripture suggests that we trust the Person who did the work.<a name=3:17></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:2">1 John  2:2</a> does not say that He made propitiation (although that is true) but that "He <i>is</i> the propitiation for our sins".<a name=3:18></a> All the value of the work resides in the Person who did it and this changes the outlook of the believer.<a name=3:19></a> Certain facts may be accepted, and the work of Christ rested upon and the heart be left practically without an object, whereas the Person should get the supreme place in our affections.<a name=3:20></a> The value of what He did resides in Himself.<a name=3:21></a> What He did has infinite and everlasting value, but the value resides in Him.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A good reason exists for deleting the 4th verse of hymn 393.<a name=3:23></a> Does He bring a poor vile sinner into His House of Wine?<a name=3:24></a> The reference is to the "Song of Songs" (Chapter 11: 4), where He has brought His loved one into all

	<div class="paragraph">
		that delights His own heart, so that she can sit undistractedly in suitability as being graced in all the grace of the Beloved.<a name=4:1></a> How could we talk about being poor vile sinners in such surroundings?<a name=4:2></a> It is morally impossible.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Anything, which is not according to God's mind brings in a discordant note.<a name=4:4></a> Suppose the Prodigal robed and ringed and sandaled were to persist in talking about rags and husks, could you imagine anything more incongruous?<a name=4:5></a> As regards thanking God for what He has delivered us from, opportunity to do that occurs every day; under all circumstances we can thank the Divine Saviour for all that He has saved us from, but as assembled with the saints we are on another platform altogether.<a name=4:6></a> We have this glorious Person before us.<a name=4:7></a> He has come in in His unique glory as God's Anointed to effectuate and establish everything for God's pleasure and glory.<a name=4:8></a> The contemplation of Him changes the whole character of praise.<a name=4:9></a> We do not come together as poor vile sinners but as devoted lovers of the Lord Jesus.<a name=4:10></a> The Supper is a Feast for lovers, it repels everything incongruous.<a name=4:11></a> Referring to this great Festival for lovers of the Lord Jesus we read that "the Lord Jesus took bread".<a name=4:12></a> He rises before us in the supremacy of His love and glory; He absorbs our heart.<a name=4:13></a> His death indeed comes before us, but it is the supreme proof of His love.<a name=4:14></a> Thinking of sins after all relates to self.<a name=4:15></a> The Lord says "This do for the calling <i>me</i> to mind", not to remember this done for you.<a name=4:16></a> The communion service of the Church of England puts it "Christ died for thee" but that is not the point at all.<a name=4:17></a> "This do in remembrance of <i>me</i>"; He would absorb the thoughts of everyone who participates.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture never speaks of drinking the wine, mention being always of the Cup.<a name=4:19></a> The Cup speaks of communion; there is one Cup, whereas wine might be in many cups.<a name=4:20></a> The word wine has been used in hymns purely for metrical purposes or easy rhyme, but it would be far better to maintain the scriptural thought of the Cup.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:11">2 Timothy  2:11</a> - 13 appears to be an example of the way in which early Christians spoke to themselves in hymns, because in the original the passage is written metrically.<a name=4:22></a> We could do with more hymns like it.<a name=4:23></a>

		Notes of meetings on the new hymnbook, Redland, Bristol
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Afternoon Meeting, March 5, 1932
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=5:1></a>M.<a name=5:2></a> There has been for some time a desire that our hymnbook should be brought into line with the present truth, and that there should be additional hymns included to provide an outlet for the emotions of the saints at the present moment.<a name=5:3></a> In pursuance of that desire it was generally felt that Mr.<a name=5:4></a> Coates should undertake the work, but he did not feel physically equal to it, and in the end five or six brothers undertook the responsibility of the revision.<a name=5:5></a> Many brethren were brought together at times for consultation; much correspondence was received from all over the world; and over two thousand new hymns were submitted for examination; several thousand old ones were also examined, the work running into practically eighteen months of constant labour and finally some four weeks were spent by the brothers responsible in coming to final decisions.<a name=5:6></a> I only mention that because there has been much prayer and expression of sympathy from the saints and throughout the work of revision there was a feeling of support from the Lord in every way.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Coming to the actual work itself, brethren felt that it was incumbent on them to follow the lines laid down by Mr.<a name=5:8></a> Wigram, and more fully by Mr.<a name=5:9></a> Darby, so that the first thing was to examine the doctrine of the hymns.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=5:11></a>B.<a name=5:12></a> That was necessary, I suppose, because a good many of our old hymns were written by men who had much piety and devotion but comparatively little light.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=5:14></a>M.<a name=5:15></a> Some that had to be altered were written by brethren with us; so there was a real need for revision of doctrine.<a name=5:16></a> I believe it is right to say that many of the saints take their doctrine from hymns much more than from the Scriptures.<a name=5:17></a> Hymns are easy to remember, and they are often sung, and the very expressions seem to become a part of our make-up; so in that way the hymns mould our thoughts.<a name=5:18></a> That is clearly contemplated in Scripture when the idea of singing is linked up with <i>teaching</i>; that is to say, a hymn must not only be a vehicle for the expression of united praise, but in its teaching it must be according to the truth.<a name=5:19></a> So that hymn-writing is one of the most difficult and most precious services that can be rendered to the church.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In pursuance of this examination of doctrine practically every feature of the truth came under scrutiny.<a name=5:21></a> As a result many of the older hymns will be found
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		slightly altered, just a word here and there in some of them, and others more radically altered; but it was felt that those which required much alteration should be omitted.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may also say as regards the omission of hymns that wherever it seemed evident that hymns were not in general use, this was taken as an indication that they should be omitted from the new book; but we found that in some districts certain hymns were well used, and in others quite unknown; but the counsel and help we had from all over the world helped to balance that feature, so that brethren will find generally that hymns not sung fairly regularly have been left out, and others put in their places.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=6:3></a>B.<a name=6:4></a> I suppose it was necessary to leave out some hymns to make room for newer hymns more clearly expressing the truth of the present time.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=6:6></a>M.<a name=6:7></a> Of course we might have made the book larger, but actually it is smaller.<a name=6:8></a> But hymns not used are no good to the book at all.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature which we may go into more fully in the evening meeting, if the brethren think well, is the question of making hymns serviceable for meetings; that is to say, a hymnbook is not merely a compilation of good hymns without regard to serving us for certain meetings.<a name=6:10></a> The right of any hymn to be in the hymnbook is that it provides definite service for the saints on some occasion when we are together.<a name=6:11></a> So following those lines, there are many hymns which are suitable for individual singing, and many that are quite suitable for household singing, which have been left out; but in the tune-book, an appendix has been added, by the brother responsible, to provide hymns suitable for children and also for general household use.<a name=6:12></a> It is hoped that that book will fill this need; but as the hymnbook stands, it is primarily intended for use in the meetings.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		HYMN 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first altered hymn we find is No.<a name=6:14></a> 2.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=6:16></a>B.<a name=6:17></a> That hymn gives a good idea of one of the reasons for altering a hymn where it is not exactly a question of bad doctrine, but a mixture of thoughts which are not quite consistent.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=6:19></a>M.<a name=6:20></a> That is so.<a name=6:21></a> The first verse in the old No.<a name=6:22></a> 2 begins with an address to the Father and refers to divine purpose, the affections of the Father before the earths foundation, and the constraining love that drew

	<div class="paragraph">
		us to Jesus, and then concludes with the thought of being kept -- salvation.<a name=7:1></a> That verse confuses what is proper to divine purpose with what is necessary because of the conditions in which we are found in the world.<a name=7:2></a> Both parts of the verse are true, but I think the Lord has shown us in recent years that when we come together for certain occasions we are not at liberty to roam through all the thoughts of Scripture; He has shown us that a certain meeting is governed by a certain light.<a name=7:3></a> Of necessity Scripture breaks up things into various aspects because of our smallness; hence we learn the governing light of any particular moment, and we cannot be as to our consciousness both in "the land" and in "the wilderness" at one moment.<a name=7:4></a> The two thoughts go on concurrently, but we cannot be conscious of them both at one time.<a name=7:5></a> When we are in the conscious enjoyment of what belongs to purpose, we are not in "the wilderness"; and when conscious of the need for salvation we are not in our consciousness in the sphere of divine purpose.<a name=7:6></a> So this is an example of a hymn which is not altered because it is wrong, but because, owing to a mixture of thoughts, it is unserviceable to the brethren.<a name=7:7></a> You will note how the first verse has been altered, preserving the thought of worship and sons; and the second verse (which has been gathered from another source) continues the theme of worship.<a name=7:8></a> No.<a name=7:9></a> 2 will now make a serviceable hymn for the latter part of the morning meeting.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=7:11></a>B.<a name=7:12></a> One has often been inclined to give it out from the first clause of the hymn, and yet held back on account of the mixture of ideas.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=7:14></a>M.<a name=7:15></a> That reminds me that there is another feature about a hymn which I should have mentioned at the beginning; that is that many of our old hymns are deceptive in that the first line is not a true indication of where the hymn is going to lead.<a name=7:16></a> Many unsuitable hymns are given out because they have a good opening which seems to promise a high note, and, generally speaking, many brethren only have the first line in their minds, and we wander through all sorts of paths not at all on the same line.<a name=7:17></a> Now the Psalms are all marked by this feature that the opening expression intelligently conveys to us the setting of the psalm.<a name=7:18></a> It is a scriptural principle that the first line should be a true indication of what is to follow.<a name=7:19></a>

		HYMN 3

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is part of the old No.<a name=7:20></a> 212 which is another example of a mixture.<a name=7:21></a> Verses 3 and 4 of the old hymn are within the sphere of worship and they are a very nice vehicle of praise, whereas verses 1 and 2 are in the sphere of pilgrimage, which again is the wilderness.<a name=7:22></a> The first line of the old verse 1 has a doctrinal error.<a name=7:23></a>

		"Called from above, and heavenly men by birth" is not doctrinally correct, and in result the first two verses were altered and set together with verse 7.<a name=8:1></a> to form a separate hymn (212 in the new book) in a wilderness setting, suitable for a prayer meeting, a reading or an address.<a name=8:2></a> Verses 2 and 3 form the new Hymn 3.<a name=8:3></a>

		A.E.<a name=8:7></a>M.<a name=8:8></a> We become heavenly men as we put on the features of Christ, the "Man out of heaven".<a name=8:9></a> Our birth is connected with a divine operation, a movement of God, whereas "heavenly" is rather the character we are to bear.<a name=8:10></a> "Jerusalem .<a name=8:11></a>.<a name=8:12></a>.<a name=8:13></a> above, which is our mother" brings in more the idea of character: the mother gives character to the children.<a name=8:14></a> We have the thought of "As the heavenly One, such also the heavenly ones" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>, Darby Translation) The expression has been looked into carefully, together with all the Scriptures that bear upon it, and the conclusion was that it could not stand.<a name=8:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are several examples of the same thing: if you turn to hymns Nos.<a name=8:31></a> 25 and 26, you will note that these hymns have been formed by dividing the old No.<a name=8:32></a> 25 (written by J.<a name=8:33></a>N.<a name=8:34></a>D.<a name=8:35></a>) with the addition of three verses (by the same author) which are found at the beginning of the new No.<a name=8:36></a> 26.<a name=8:37></a> No.<a name=8:38></a> 25 in the new book is a wilderness hymn which brings in the thought of <i>children</i> in relationship to the Father, but not the thought of <i>sons</i>.<a name=8:39></a> That hymn speaks of us as "absent" and "resting in hope, treading the desert path" and concludes with a prayer that we might be kept.<a name=8:40></a> It is now a beautiful wilderness hymn, but those verses linked up with the verses of the next hymn (as in the old No.<a name=8:41></a> 25) made it unsuitable for a morning meeting unless we omitted certain verses, to

		This was one of the most difficult hymns to correct, the reason being that as it was written it confused the idea of "closed doors" as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>and the breaking of bread in the Corinthian aspect.<a name=10:22></a> "In Thy presence break the bread".<a name=10:23></a> The two thoughts are interwoven in one, and bring about a confusion of thoughts, so that the hymn has been altered to keep it in one setting, that is: we are recalling the Lord in the emblems.<a name=10:24></a> It is a hymn that would be used before we partake of the Supper.<a name=10:25></a>

		HYMN 11 (FORMERLY HYMN 401)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This hymn and No.<a name=13:22></a> 181 were the two most difficult hymns to be revised.<a name=13:23></a> We might take them together because they deal with expressions relating to the Lord's place in Deity.<a name=13:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		 "Thou art the everlasting Word" was the original first line of this hymn (No.<a name=13:25></a> 11); the difficulty there was the same as applies to the expression "Eternal Son".<a name=13:26></a> Both expressions imply that our Lord's place in Godhead in the past eternity was that of a Son, and that of the word, that these were His eternal Names, whereas "Son" is a term that is relative to "The Father" and we now understand that it is connected with revelation and not with the eternal relations of the Godhead.<a name=13:27></a> What our Lord's Name in the Godhead was no one knows; it says in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:13">Revelation  19:13</a> (Darby Translation) "His name is called The Word of God", and it also says, "having a name written which no one knows but himself" (verse 12) I think if we consider the meaning of "the Word" it will become at once apparent that it also is a term connected with revelation.<a name=13:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=14:1></a>B.<a name=14:2></a> Does not the very thought of a <i>name</i> suppose revelation, so that when we speak of divine Persons as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, it is God in revelation?<a name=14:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=14:4></a>M.<a name=14:5></a> I think so; and the Word is the expression of God, the expression of the mind of God, and that must involve creatures being in view, because if our minds were capable (which they are not) of going back to the past eternity we should find that there were only divine Persons there; everyone, outside of divine Persons, is a created being; angels are created beings.<a name=14:6></a> Therefore the expression "the Word" involves men, because the mind of God is not expressed to angels but to men.<a name=14:7></a> Therefore the expression "the Word" would have no force till men came to light, and so you could not apply that expression to our Lord as in Deity.<a name=14:8></a>

		Ques.<a name=14:9></a> Would <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> emphasize that, "The Word was God"?<a name=14:10></a> The term "Son" is not used there?<a name=14:11></a> It was taught by Mr.<a name=14:12></a> Raven that the title "Word" was a name given to the Lord by the early disciples; it is not one of His divinely given mediatorial names.<a name=14:13></a> "Jesus Christ" was divinely given to Him, and "the Son" was divinely given; many of His titles are so, but "the Word" is not.<a name=14:14></a>

		F.H.<a name=14:15></a>B.<a name=14:16></a> Do you gather that "the Word" was a title given to Him by His disciples from <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>, which according to the Darby Translation contains the expression: "eye witnesses and attendants on <i>the Word</i>"?<a name=14:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=14:18></a>M.<a name=14:19></a> It is a name of apprehension; the disciples apprehended Christ to be the expression of the mind of God, and so they spoke about Him as "the Word".<a name=14:20></a>

		F.H.<a name=14:21></a>B.<a name=14:22></a> Really that title supposes incarnation; if He is to be the expression of God's mind there must be incarnation.<a name=14:23></a>

		Notes of meetings on the new hymnbook, Redland, Bristol

	<div class="paragraph">
		Evening Meeting, March 5, 1932
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=23:1></a>M.<a name=23:2></a> It occurred to me that we might look at some of the new hymns with a view to seeing what means exist for giving expression to the light of the moment, and that we might also dwell on the practical point of how to use the hymnbook intelligently.<a name=23:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=23:4></a>B.<a name=23:5></a> I am sure that will be very helpful to us; it is very needful.<a name=23:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=23:7></a>M.<a name=23:8></a> I would like just to make a remark as to accuracy of expression in the hymns.<a name=23:9></a> Accuracy itself is not the goal, but inaccurate expressions are something like the stopping up of the outlets of our spiritual emotions; that is, a wrong expression obscures so much, whereas the thought of the truth, together with the divine accuracy connected with it, is that we should have an unhindered view of every feature of the glory of Christ.<a name=23:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Coming, to new hymns, it might be well to remark that there were many excellent compositions sent in which had a high individual value, but which dealt with a theme or a feature of truth in connection with which we already had an ample supply.<a name=23:11></a> For instance, there were 22 hymns in the old book dealing with the Lord's coming -- quite a large percentage.<a name=23:12></a> At one time they were much used; they are not so much used now.<a name=23:13></a> So a new hymn on that subject stood no chance of getting in the new book unless it was super-excellent.<a name=23:14></a> Whereas, we had only about six or eight hymns at the most which were addressed to the Lord as Head, so a hymn of only moderate value poetically would have a good chance of being included, because of the need for hymns on that theme.<a name=23:15></a> Then in the whole of the old book we have not one hymn dealing with the new covenant, showing how that feature of the truth was not prominently before the mind of hymnwriters when the book was prepared, but since then the adjustment regarding the use of one cup at the Supper has brought to light the great features of the new covenant, and now it is prominently before us in thanksgiving for the cup.<a name=23:16></a> Two or three hymns of that character have been included in the new hymnbook.<a name=23:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=23:18></a>B.<a name=23:19></a> Would what you have said about hymns relating to the Lord's coming apply to hymns addressed to the Father?<a name=23:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=23:21></a>M.<a name=23:22></a> We have not many hymns addressed to the Father in privilege; there are many addressed to the Father in relation to wilderness experience, but not many addressed to "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ", which is the title which stands in relation to our sonship.<a name=23:23></a> Hymns

		This is a hymn written by a sister.<a name=25:12></a> I refer to this hymn because it seems to express the proper spirit and attitude of mind in which we should approach the Lord's Supper; that is, it does not dwell on the thought of our sins having been put away, nor of our unworthiness, but it refers to the saints as under the marvellous influence of the love of Christ, and throughout the week we have been finding delight in the Lord, and the result is that our spirits are freighted with treasure.<a name=25:13></a> That is the proper attitude in which to come to the Supper.<a name=25:14></a>
