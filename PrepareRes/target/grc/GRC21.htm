		I desire to say a word on greatness, because God would have us become accustomed to greatness.<a name=3:2></a> Our own destiny is great, for we shall move and serve ultimately in the presence of greatness in the fullest sense of the word.<a name=3:3></a> These passages bring greatness before us; the greatness of Christ, the greatness of God, and also the greatness of the saints as God's workmanship.<a name=3:4></a>

		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>refer to the greatness of Christ in a striking way, particularly the former.<a name=3:5></a> It is essentially the chapter of greatness as regards Christ.<a name=3:6></a> It brings Him before us as the One in whom God has spoken, and is speaking, because the speaking goes on.<a name=3:7></a> God has spoken "in Son", and the speaking is now from the place where Jesus is.<a name=3:8></a> It is not simply an historical matter; the scripture brings before us the place from which the present speaking comes.<a name=3:9></a> As it says "When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the greatness on high".<a name=3:10></a> In this chapter the Scriptures, particularly the Psalms, are quoted extensively to bring out the greatness of Christ.<a name=3:11></a> The chapter brings out who He is in His Person.<a name=3:12></a> As it says lower down, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands.<a name=3:13></a> They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old

		as doth a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same".<a name=4:1></a> That is a title of Deity -- "Thou art <i>The Same</i>", although applied to the Lord in manhood.<a name=4:2></a> "Jesus Christ, <i>the same</i> yesterday, and today, and for ever", chapter 13, verse 8.<a name=4:3></a> In His Person the Lord Jesus has never changed.<a name=4:4></a> He is the same whatever may be the circumstances into which He has come.<a name=4:5></a> He Himself is unchangeable in His unspeakable greatness, whether on earth, or going into death, or risen and ascended.<a name=4:6></a> His conditions have changed, but He in His Person has never changed.<a name=4:7></a> Though, truly, in His perfect manhood here He learned obedience in the things that He suffered (chapter 5), yet that does not affect the truth that in His Person He is unchanging and unchangeable.<a name=4:8></a> It is a great thing to get that into the soul.<a name=4:9></a> And yet He is truly Man.<a name=4:10></a> He has come into manhood in order that the whole mind and will of God as to man might be expressed, including God's disposition towards man, and the speaking involves these things.<a name=4:11></a>

		The Son is said to be "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance"; thus the One in whom God speaks is entirely in accord with the speaking.<a name=4:12></a> He could say when here, "I am altogether that which I say unto you".<a name=4:13></a> The expression, "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all", implies that God is always what He purports to be; His word is a true expression of Himself.<a name=4:14></a> And so this blessed Person, in whom God has spoken, is the full expression and out-shining of God; and, at the same time, the expression of His pleasure in man.<a name=4:15></a> He is the

		Man who can fill out everything for God.<a name=5:1></a> What a delight to God to have such a One, the One who is going to take up all things as the true Heir.<a name=5:2></a> But redemption was a necessity, and so it says, "having made by himself the purification of sins, he set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high".<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to commend that expression to you, because the Lord Himself is ineffably great, and yet as Man He has set Himself down at the right hand of <i>the</i> greatness.<a name=5:4></a> That word "the greatness" is the supreme expression of greatness in Scripture.<a name=5:5></a> The right hand is the most important seat.<a name=5:6></a> How great Christ must be, to be able, without presumption, to set Himself down at the <i>right hand</i> of the Greatness on high.<a name=5:7></a> We cannot measure what is involved in that expression "<i>the</i> greatness".<a name=5:8></a> It involves, no doubt, essential Deity, but how it magnifies the Lord Jesus that as Man He has gone in and set Himself down at the right hand of the Greatness on high.<a name=5:9></a> That is the blessed place He has taken as Man and it is from that point that the speaking comes at the present time.<a name=5:10></a> It comes from the very presence of the Greatness on high.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I pass on I would just say this: <i>love</i> enters into the whole matter.<a name=5:12></a> "Taking a place by so much better than angels".<a name=5:13></a> No angel could ever have that place, no angel could set himself down there.<a name=5:14></a> That was reserved for man, but only one Man.<a name=5:15></a> He is more than man, of course -- He is The Same.<a name=5:16></a> He Himself has part in Deity, and yet this is intended to magnify to us the great fact that a <i>Man</i> has sat down there.<a name=5:17></a>

		Only One who Himself had part in "the greatness" could do it, but how wonderful it is that a divine Person has taken manhood, and <i>as Man</i> has taken a place that an angel could never take!<a name=6:1></a> But that Man is the Son.<a name=6:2></a> "To which of the angels said he ever, Thou art my Son?<a name=6:3></a>" We must not think that the thought of greatness shuts out affection.<a name=6:4></a> Love marks the whole position.<a name=6:5></a> "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<a name=6:6></a> And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a son".<a name=6:7></a> That is how God regards this One who has set Himself down at the right hand of the Greatness.<a name=6:8></a> He is the object of the Father's love.<a name=6:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now in chapter 8 it is Christ on our side.<a name=6:10></a> In chapter 1 we see Christ on God's side, the One through whom God speaks, and in that respect He must be alone in all His greatness, but in chapter 8 the apostle says, "Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking is, We have such a one high priest, who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".<a name=6:11></a> It is what <i>we</i> have.<a name=6:12></a> In chapter 1 it is what God has -- His Son, through whom He can speak.<a name=6:13></a> Chapter 8 is what we have.<a name=6:14></a> "We have such a one high priest, who has set himself down (see J.<a name=6:15></a>N.<a name=6:16></a>D.<a name=6:17></a>'s note) at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man".<a name=6:18></a> He is there as our High Priest, our Representative.<a name=6:19></a> He is there as the true Aaron.<a name=6:20></a> We are in the position of Aaron's sons who were with him in the service.<a name=6:21></a> But how great it is that the Lord Jesus as the High Priest has set Himself down as our

	<div class="paragraph">
		Representative; He has set Himself down at the <i>right hand of the throne</i> of the Greatness in the heavens.<a name=7:1></a> What a wonderful contemplation!<a name=7:2></a> The Man, speaking reverently, who is our Representative has, without any presumption, set Himself down in the seat of the greatest honour and <i>power</i>, at the right hand of <i>the throne</i> of the Greatness in the heavens.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are part of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man; we are in immediate proximity to the throne.<a name=7:4></a> We must not be geographical in our thoughts.<a name=7:5></a> The true tabernacle has its present application to the assembly here on earth and as belonging to the assembly we belong to the most holy place; in fact we form it, like the boards that surrounded the ark.<a name=7:6></a> At the same time we are also like Aaron's sons, who could go in with him to serve in the holy place.<a name=7:7></a> Not that they could go in in the fullest sense -- the way into the holy of holies was not then made manifest (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:8">Hebrews  9:8</a>).<a name=7:8></a> But now it is fully manifested, for the very Person in whom God has made known Himself and His mind and thoughts is the One who has gone in as High Priest and who is over the whole service, and who links His brethren with Him in the service, in the presence of God Himself.<a name=7:9></a> As I said, I believe God would help us to become more accustomed to being in the presence of greatness -- the greatness of Christ, and then -- what is even more wonderful -- <i>the</i> Greatness; that which is beyond us to comprehend, and yet as in the presence of God we have a sense of it.<a name=7:10></a> We know God as revealed and yet we are in the presence of One who, though known as

	<div class="paragraph">
		revealed, is in His own Being beyond our comprehension.<a name=8:1></a> We know Him revealed as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, His Father and our Father, His God and our God, yet there is always that which is beyond us, but it is the very sense of that, <i>the</i> Greatness, that gives the highest note to our worship.<a name=8:2></a> We are in the presence of "the King of the ages".<a name=8:3></a> Paul says, "to him be honour and glory to the ages of ages".<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are before Him as sons.<a name=8:5></a> The more we enter into the relationship of sons the more we shall cherish the thought of greatness, the greatness of the One we know as Father, His ineffable greatness as God.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now there is the question of the greatness of the saints.<a name=8:7></a> In thinking of the greatness of the saints we need to be very careful always to maintain that Christ's greatness is outstanding.<a name=8:8></a> In a way there is no comparison.<a name=8:9></a> I love to make that clear for the joy of my own heart.<a name=8:10></a> Think of the ark, and then think of one of those boards.<a name=8:11></a> Yet the board was made of the same material as the ark, and the boards put together made a fit setting for the ark, they made the shrine where the ark was.<a name=8:12></a> In that sense the saints are great, although Christ's greatness is unique.<a name=8:13></a> Even the church complete cannot compare with Christ in the greatness of His Person, although as regards His manhood she is His fulness.<a name=8:14></a> The saints are great because they form an adequate setting for Him.<a name=8:15></a> We sing, "Of Thy body, Lord are we".<a name=8:16></a> We are a necessity to Christ, not only for His heart's affections but for the display of His glory and to be a fit setting for Him.<a name=8:17></a> We are a necessity to

		God, too, for His habitation, because it is where Christ is enshrined, and all is in keeping with Him, that God can dwell complacently.<a name=9:1></a> It is a great thing to see that the assembly is a necessity to Christ and to God.<a name=9:2></a> God will never dwell with angels in that sense.<a name=9:3></a> God dwells with <i>men</i>.<a name=9:4></a> Man is the order of being that alone can satisfy the affections of the heart of God and provide Him with a habitation according to His own thoughts.<a name=9:5></a> His eternal purpose is in regard to <i>man</i> -- Christ, indeed, supremely, and yet -- I speak reverently -- the saints are a necessity to Christ in connection with the setting in which He is to be seen eternally, and the saints similarly are a necessity to God.<a name=9:6></a> Divine Persons are always self-sufficient, of course, but divine love and glory require the saints.<a name=9:7></a> It makes the assembly great in our minds, it makes the saints great, and yet Christ is ever outstanding.<a name=9:8></a> Yet in whatever setting we see Christ, in their measure the saints correspond with it.<a name=9:9></a> If we see Christ as the ark, the saints are the boards, of the same material; if we see Christ as the veil, the saints are the curtains, the same material.<a name=9:10></a> We think of Aaron -- we are the sons, clothed with garments for glory and ornament, though not so resplendent as Aaron's, associated with him in the service of God.<a name=9:11></a> "He that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one".<a name=9:12></a> It is a wonderful thing to see that the saints correspond with Christ.<a name=9:13></a> In whatever setting Christ is seen, the saints, in their measure, correspond with it.<a name=9:14></a> "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=9:15></a> And so when you come to the thought of sitting in heavenly places, Ephesians shows that
