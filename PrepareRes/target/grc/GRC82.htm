		G.R.<a name=58:1></a>C.<a name=58:2></a> I thought we might consider -- for want of a better word, and because it is a word that is often used -- the 'position' and the question of Christian fellowship, which involves a path.<a name=58:3></a> There is a position and a path, and the chapters in Ephesians bring out what I have in mind as to the 'position'.<a name=58:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>the position is a threefold one and it is contingent upon the gift of the Holy Spirit; contingent, of course, upon redemption and the forgiveness of sins, but contingent upon the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=58:5></a> Thus the threefold position is first that everyone who has the Spirit is made by God a member of the body -- there is <i>one body</i>; and secondly everyone who has the Spirit is placed by God under the authority of the Lord -- there is <i>one Lord</i>; and translated into the <i>kingdom</i> of the Son of His love, and thirdly they are in the <i>house of God</i>, for it says there is one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and <i>in</i> us all which involves the house of God.<a name=58:6></a> He is in us all.<a name=58:7></a> It takes us back to the first verse we read that "in Jesus Christ, the corner stone, we are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit".<a name=58:8></a> He is in us all.<a name=58:9></a> So you have there a threefold position contingent upon the gift of the Holy Spirit, not in itself resting on our responsibility, but upon what God has been pleased to do in His sovereignty and in His grace.<a name=58:10></a> He has made us members of the one body -- the greatest membership we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=59>[Page 59]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		could possibly have; He has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, so that we are all under the one Lord and we all call upon Him; and we belong to His house, we are builded together, a habitation of God in the Spirit.<a name=59:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Timothy develops really that verse "One God and Father of all, who is over all", because 1 Timothy deals with the house of God.<a name=59:2></a> It maintains the truth that God is one and that He is God our Saviour and God our Father -- verses 1 and 2; and in the reference to Him as Creator and Preserver, it shows He is through all; and, in reference to Him as the blessed and only Ruler, it shows that He is over all.<a name=59:3></a> But He is <i>in us all</i> for we belong to His house, the house of the blessed and only Ruler, the house of the King of the Ages, the greatest royal household in the universe.<a name=59:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this threefold position in which we are placed sovereignly by God in grace, is the position in which every one who has the Spirit is placed.<a name=59:5></a> Everyone thus who receives the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit is in that position.<a name=59:6></a> There is no special position for any Christian or sets of Christians.<a name=59:7></a> There could not be a more special position than this threefold one.<a name=59:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.R.<a name=59:9></a>S.<a name=59:10></a> Is that the impregnable position, the citadel the Lord Jesus spoke of, "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>?<a name=59:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=59:12></a>C.<a name=59:13></a> Quite so.<a name=59:14></a> "My assembly" not only involves what the assembly is to Him as His body, but what the assembly is as the house of God, the assembly of the living God.<a name=59:15></a> Both ideas are in that passage, because Peter confesses Him as "the Christ" -- in that respect He stands related to His body -- and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=60>[Page 60]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as the "Son of the living God" in which He stands, related to the assembly as "God's house the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=60:1></a> So it is a grand thing to lay hold of the threefold position.<a name=60:2></a> I do not like the word 'position' much.<a name=60:3></a> It is not in scripture, but I am using it to describe something that God has established, whether we understand it or not, and we would all like to understand it better -- the grandeur of this threefold position, that we are members of <i>Christ's body</i>, we are in the <i>kingdom of the Son of God's love</i>, and we belong to <i>God's house</i>.<a name=60:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.S.<a name=60:5></a> What you are saying gives us a broader view of the position.<a name=60:6></a> It is a word that has been sadly misused has it not?<a name=60:7></a> And you are helping us, I think, to see the breadth of the view from the divine side.<a name=60:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=60:9></a>C.<a name=60:10></a> That is it.<a name=60:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.S.<a name=60:12></a> I wondered too, if I may just ask further, regarding your reference to <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3">1 Timothy  3</a>which I think you have in mind as to God's house.<a name=60:13></a> It is immediately followed by the other great verse is it not -- "the mystery of piety is great" -- could you say something about the juxtaposition of those two verses?<a name=60:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=60:15></a>C.<a name=60:16></a> One thing it brings out, I think, is that the manifestation of God in this world was in a Man in Whom piety was perfectly seen.<a name=60:17></a> He is a Divine Person, of course, but had come into our circumstances.<a name=60:18></a> It was not only that God was here, but He was <i>manifested</i>.<a name=60:19></a> "God has been manifested in flesh".<a name=60:20></a> It was not simply that He was here without anybody being able to observe anything, but it says, "God has been <i>manifested</i> in flesh", and the way He was manifested was because the One who came -- Who Himself is God, it is true -- trod a path of perfect piety.<a name=60:21></a> Down

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		here in that path of piety He expressed God at every point so that God was manifested -- not only present but manifested.<a name=61:1></a> And that bears on us, because if there is to be a manifestation of God through us, it can only be as we are maintained in the path of piety according to the way Jesus Himself has marked it out; not according to what man may say about it, but according to the way Jesus Himself has marked out the path.<a name=61:2></a> As Peter says, He has left us a model, that we should follow in His steps -- <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:21">1 Peter  2:21</a>.<a name=61:3></a> Is that right?<a name=61:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.S.<a name=61:5></a> I am sure it is, thank you.<a name=61:6></a> What you are saying is helping us, I am sure, because the apostle says that we are to know how to behave ourselves in that house; and I wondered if the last verse which you are speaking of now is to help in relation to that!<a name=61:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=61:8></a>C.<a name=61:9></a> It is only in a path of piety that we can maintain the behaviour suited to God's house.<a name=61:10></a> In God's house every institution that God has placed, whether natural or spiritual, is maintained in integrity.<a name=61:11></a> That is essential if the house is to be "the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=61:12></a> Every divine institution is to be maintained in integrity, whether it is marriage or other things or whether it is the spiritual institutions that we have spoken of -- the one body and so on.<a name=61:13></a> <i>All</i> the institutions, normally in the thought of God, are to be maintained in integrity in those who form His house; and then, with that background, they are to express God in all they do.<a name=61:14></a> This is the highest responsibility of man.<a name=61:15></a> God is to be expressed in His house -- that is in those who form His house -- and that requires a path of piety.<a name=61:16></a> This is a great mystery because it cannot be explained away.<a name=61:17></a> The natural cannot understand the motives that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.R.<a name=62:2></a>S.<a name=62:3></a> Had you in mind then, that though <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a> was primarily and outstandingly the pathway of the blessed Lord Jesus Himself, each one of those things in detail is to be seen, in some measure, in all who follow Him?<a name=62:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=62:5></a>C.<a name=62:6></a> Yes -- in the principle of it.<a name=62:7></a> Of course <i>we</i> are not preached among the nations as <i>He</i> is, but we <i>are</i> to be in accord with the preaching; and we should know something about being justified in the Spirit; that is, to have the consciousness of the Spirit's support and approval, whatever outward circumstances may appear to be.<a name=62:8></a> Outwardly, circumstances may seem to have gone all wrong.<a name=62:9></a> People may say, 'there is no evidence that you are with God or that God is with you because -- look at the outward circumstances -- everything has gone wrong outwardly'.<a name=62:10></a> But then that is how it was with the Lord Himself, and how it was with Paul too.<a name=62:11></a> Outwardly, everything looked black, and as though all that was laboured for had come to nothing.<a name=62:12></a> But what sustains anyone on the path of faith is the sense that they are not justified by circumstances but by the Spirit.<a name=62:13></a> You do not need circumstances to justify you if you have the consciousness that you are justified in the Spirit; and the Spirit gives the sense of His justification and His support to a man who is in the path of true piety following the Lord, is that right?<a name=62:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.R.<a name=62:15></a>H.<a name=62:16></a> One feature of the mystery of piety in that passage is "believed on in the world".<a name=62:17></a> Is that why the Lord could utter the remarkable word, "Ye believe on God, believe also on me"?<a name=62:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=64:9></a>C.<a name=64:10></a> Yes.<a name=64:11></a> For Jesus trod the way of holiness -- we could not say anything else than that.<a name=64:12></a> If He went into Levi's house He was still in the way of holiness, living wholly to God, separated in heart entirely to God and yet most accessible to men.<a name=64:13></a> If He went into the Pharisee's house -- as He did into three separate Pharisees' houses in Luke -- to eat -- it says each time He went there to eat -- it was still the way of holiness for the Lord.<a name=64:14></a>

		Now in connection with the fellowship, I regard it as having two aspects -- one is <i>walk</i> and the other is <i>sharing in common</i>.<a name=64:24></a> The walk must come first.<a name=64:25></a>

		Some of our brethren in the sects may surpass us in the way they carry out every natural institution.<a name=79:2></a> As husbands and wives, masters or servants, they carry out those things with integrity, as Christians.<a name=79:3></a> But there is another range of things altogether to be carried out, and that is to put into practice the truth of the <i>one body</i>, and to put into practice the truth of <i>the kingdom</i> -- true to our baptism and the Name called upon us there, and true to the whole Christian faith, one Lord, one faith, one baptism -- and true to <i>God's house</i>.<a name=79:4></a> Now pursuing righteousness involves <i>both</i>.<a name=79:5></a> Righteousness is not merely that we maintain every natural institution that God has created in integrity, but for a Christian to follow righteousness means that he also maintains in integrity the divine institutions, the spiritual ones.<a name=79:6></a> If I am not governed by the truth of the one body, from that standpoint.<a name=79:7></a> I am an unrighteous man -- because I am a member of it and I have got responsibilities as well as privileges.<a name=79:8></a>
