		I wish to speak, dear brethren, of the Great Priest over the house of God, and in a particular way of the Urim and the Thummim.<a name=1:1></a> The glory of Christ shines before us in the passages we have read, as indeed throughout scripture.<a name=1:2></a> He is the One who, as the Apostle and High Priest, has inaugurated the great system to which we belong, a system which remains unimpaired whatever the failure of man down here; the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=1:3></a> The point on our side is to be in keeping with the system to which we belong, because we form part of the true tabernacle.<a name=1:4></a> We form part of the one body, we form part of God's habitation in the Spirit.<a name=1:5></a> Nothing can rob us of our part in these things, from the divine side, but our concern is to be in the gain of them.<a name=1:6></a> And there is no reason why we should not be in the gain of them, and be true to them in our walk, outlook, and conduct, because we have a Great Priest over the house of God.<a name=1:7></a> As the Apostle He has inaugurated the system, and as the High Priest He sustains it.<a name=1:8></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>tells us that He upholds all things by the word of His power.<a name=1:9></a> From that point of view the heavens themselves are a tabernacle for the Sun -- typical of Christ.<a name=1:10></a> The whole vast creation is a kind of framework in which God is working out His spiritual purposes and will display them and their fruits.<a name=1:11></a> And the One by whom God made the worlds

		and who is upholding all things by the word of His power, is the One who upholds the spiritual system.<a name=2:1></a> If He can uphold this great material universe, He can also do what is greater, uphold the great spiritual system of which He is the Head.<a name=2:2></a> He is the Centre, though men do not recognise it, of the material system.<a name=2:3></a> All things were created by Him and for Him, not for man.<a name=2:4></a> Man would use the world as a stage in which to display his own glory; he struts across the stage, in his brief life here, in his fancied greatness, and goes off the scene; his name never to be remembered.<a name=2:5></a> Certain men's names are remembered at present, but as to men who have no part in the divine system, their names will never be remembered in the day to come, whatever kind of a figure they have made here.<a name=2:6></a> This vast creation was created by Christ, for Christ, for the display of <i>His</i> glory, and it is going to be filled with His glory.<a name=2:7></a>

		And then it says, "all things subsist through Him".<a name=2:8></a> That is, He sustains everything.<a name=2:9></a> The material system could not continue apart from Him and His power.<a name=2:10></a> And that One who does it all is my Saviour, my Lord, my great High Priest, and therefore we can trust Him implicitly to sustain the divine and spiritual system which we apprehend by faith through the Spirit.<a name=2:11></a> The true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man is far more real than the material system.<a name=2:12></a> It will abide forever.<a name=2:13></a> But then, if He is upholding the spiritual system, it means that none of us need be out of it in the experience of our souls.<a name=2:14></a> He can uphold each one of us.<a name=2:15></a> He never forgets any of us.<a name=2:16></a> Unless our will is at work, and thus we prevent it, He will uphold us all in relation to the spiritual system of which He is the Centre.<a name=2:17></a> Whether we are many or few, even if we are

		alone like John appears to have been in the isle of Patmos, He can sustain us in relation to this great spiritual system which is more real and abiding than the physical one; He, the Great Priest over the house of God.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these scriptures present Him thus, and the passage in Exodus is very affecting.<a name=3:2></a> It views Him typically as in the presence of God bearing all our names upon His shoulders.<a name=3:3></a> In the type there were six on one and six on the other of the sons of Israel according to their birth.<a name=3:4></a> "Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial".<a name=3:5></a> So through God's grace, our names will never be forgotten.<a name=3:6></a> Not that we would want our names to be thought about, we want everyone to be occupied with the Name which is above every name, the Name at which every knee will bow.<a name=3:7></a> Nevertheless we are marked out beforehand for adoption, chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.<a name=3:8></a> So that our names will never be forgotten, they are borne before God, as a memorial, by Christ Himself.<a name=3:9></a> I believe this chapter helps us to understand what it says in Hebrews, "now to appear before the face of God for us".<a name=3:10></a> Infinitely great in His own Person and His own rights, both rights of Deity and rights of Manhood, His rights are absolute and perfect.<a name=3:11></a> And yet He has been pleased to go in as our Forerunner, as though we were important.<a name=3:12></a> We have no importance in ourselves, but we are important through the sovereign choice of Divine love which marked us out beforehand for sonship.<a name=3:13></a>

		How blessed to think of the Lord Jesus thus appearing before the face of God for us, carrying us there according to our place in divine purpose; and at the same time, in priestly grace and power, able to put His hand upon us in our weakness down here, and so support us, that we can be maintained according to the measure of our growth, in the light of that purpose and walking according to it!<a name=5:4></a> That is the great function of the High Priest.<a name=5:5></a> He maintains things in their perfection before God as a memorial before Him; our place there secure, the place prepared, because He is there, and holding it for us as it were.<a name=5:6></a> But on the other hand, having been touched with the feeling of our infirmities, having learned obedience from the things He suffered, Jesus is ready to stretch out His hand and uphold us at all times, saving completely those who come to God by Him.<a name=5:7></a> He upholds all things; He can uphold you, He can uphold me.<a name=5:8></a> You may be going through a testing time; you may find that your enemies are those of your own household.<a name=5:9></a> The test may come home in a poignant way day by day.<a name=5:10></a> But the One who is upholding all things by the word of His power can uphold every saint, and maintain each in the enjoyment of the place that is his, as represented on the shoulders in sonship and as represented on the breast-plate in his own distinctive place in the testimony.<a name=5:11></a> We are thus able to function in the place given to us in Divine sovereignty in the body of Christ, and to serve God in His house, though here in conditions of weakness.<a name=5:12></a> How great

		If you lean on His breast you come into great gain in every way, which I will speak about in a moment; but I want to speak first about the Urim and the Thummim -- 'Lights and Perfections'.<a name=7:7></a> Great glory attaches to Jesus in this respect.<a name=7:8></a> The plural means the fulness of the thing, and the word 'Perfections' involves the thought of <i>completeness</i>.<a name=7:9></a> Fulness of light is in the Person of Jesus, and fulness of perfection.<a name=7:10></a> One answers to the other.<a name=7:11></a> One relates to what He is from God to us -- "The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=7:12></a> The full outshining of God is in the Person of the Son; He is the effulgence of God's glory.<a name=7:13></a> Everything that can be known of God is expressed in Him, in His glorified manhood.<a name=7:14></a> Think of the glory of God radiating in the face of a Man!<a name=7:15></a> The face of a man is a remarkable creation, it was created with a view to man expressing God, being God's image and glory.<a name=7:16></a> Thus the face of a man is capable of expressing love, kindness, gentleness, compassion, even anger of a right kind, mercy and so on.<a name=7:17></a> The face of an animal cannot do that.<a name=7:18></a> The face of a man can.<a name=7:19></a> He is the Image of God because He is God, yet a glorified Man; and radiantly, in His face, is expressed every feature of the Divine glory.<a name=7:20></a> God's righteousness is displayed in Him, so also is God's majesty.<a name=7:21></a> The time will come

		Think of the face of Jesus; what a study it is!<a name=8:3></a> In regard to the assembly, His eyes are dove's eyes, but when He looks at the assembly as in responsibility His eyes are as a flame of fire, and they search us through and through.<a name=8:4></a> What are those eyes, as a flame of fire, looking for?<a name=8:5></a> To see whether He finds Himself in your heart, as the controlling object, enthroned and enshrined, to the exclusion of any rival.<a name=8:6></a> It is a blessed thing to be in the presence of Jesus, and even when we have to meet that all-searching gaze, to let Him have His way, because He is searching us in love and in the jealousy of His <i>love</i>, He has a full right in looking to see if He has the supreme place in your heart, your motives unmixed for Christ.<a name=8:7></a>

		I would like to distinguish here between the Ark and the Priest.<a name=9:2></a> In the holiest you see the Ark of the Covenant, covered in every part with gold, and the Cherubim of glory overshadowing it.<a name=9:3></a> The Ark is another type of Christ referring to Him, as one might say, in His fixed position as the Head and Centre of God's system.<a name=9:4></a> There could be no tabernacle system apart from the Ark and the Mercy-seat, and the blood on the Mercy-seat -- the Lord in His settled position as the Head and Centre of the system, God perfectly glorified in Him, and He glorified in God.<a name=9:5></a> Everything is in keeping with the Cherubim of glory; God shining out from between the Cherubim because His glory is met, God shining out in the same blessed Person, "Thou that sittest between the Cherubim shine forth".<a name=9:6></a> We see the shining forth in the face of Jesus.<a name=9:7></a> All that is a fixed matter as it were.<a name=9:8></a> He is the effulgence of God's glory, and the expression of His substance.<a name=9:9></a> But the priest is an <i>active</i> type of Christ; Christ viewed, not in His fixed position, as I might say, but as in the activities of His love, even in offering Himself.<a name=9:10></a> It was the High Priest bringing the high priestly offering when He offered Himself without spot to God.<a name=9:11></a> He went in, in the power of His own blood, and now He sustains the system, and He is active in it.<a name=9:12></a> It is wonderful to think of the activities of Christ ever living to intercede for us.<a name=9:13></a> He does not simply rest in the fact that He is the Head and Centre of the system, but He is active to maintain the system in activity, in order that all might be maintained in living light, and living response.<a name=9:14></a> The Urim and the Thummim suppose that.<a name=9:15></a> It is not only that all the glory of God is shining in the face of Jesus, but how it applies to particular circumstances.<a name=9:16></a>
