		I suppose that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob represent three sides of a believer's history, three sides which I should link with the scripture in the Revelation where it tells of the judgment of Babylon, and we know Abraham was called out of Babylon.<a name=77:2></a> It says of the kings, "They each shall make war with the Lamb and He will overcome them, for they that are with Him are called chosen and faithful".<a name=77:3></a> I believe these three points of history to be connected with the three patriarchs and represent the three phases in our history as believers.<a name=77:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the <i>called</i> is connected with Abraham, <i>chosen</i> with Isaac, and <i>faithful</i> with Jacob.<a name=77:5></a> These three lines run back in our histories.<a name=77:6></a> One is an upward line.<a name=77:7></a> The call is a call from earth to heaven.<a name=77:8></a> It is a heavenly calling, and the path is an upward one.<a name=77:9></a> At the end of his life Paul was pressing on in it to reach "the goal for the prize of the calling on High".<a name=77:10></a> On that line we are always going higher, but lay hold of that wonderful prize the place He is giving us there, Who can measure what that place is?<a name=77:11></a>  --  the height of the Christian calling, should make us a heavenly people.<a name=77:12></a> Abraham's history includes the way he went, but Isaac represents another line.<a name=77:13></a> While we are pressing on we can also take what is already there in the Counsels of God because <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>, says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame".<a name=77:14></a> So that we can view our

		position as already cleared and established in Christ before the world was, so that heaven is our right place on the lines of Abraham and we go on an upward way to reach it.<a name=78:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point of view.<a name=78:2></a> Although we are going to on attain it, the place is already secured for us.<a name=78:3></a> We were chosen to be there before the world began.<a name=78:4></a> The thought of being heavenly is that we make heaven's interest on earth our interest.<a name=78:5></a> That is where things become real with us.<a name=78:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob was a man who needed much education and patience on the thoughts of God, so that it is encouraging for us.<a name=78:7></a> At first sight you would not think of Jacob as faithful.<a name=78:8></a> Jacob held on to what had been revealed to him down here in the main.<a name=78:9></a> So I would like to link Jacob with the Epistles to Timothy, because while Ephesians gives our place in Heaven and Philippians shows a man pursuing to reach it, Paul writes to Timothy in Ephesus and says that he needs to make his position practical down here.<a name=78:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you are really heavenly you will be faithful down here.<a name=78:11></a> Timothy means "the fear of God" and the more we know God in intimacy, the more we shall fear Him, but we should not allow anything unholy to mar the fear of God.<a name=78:12></a> "A faithful man is a fearful man" in that sense.<a name=78:13></a> So as I say Timothy means "the fear of God".<a name=78:14></a> The answer to the heavenly calling is abiding down here.<a name=78:15></a> The order of God's house down here should be suitable to God.<a name=78:16></a> So that when he writes to Timothy and says how I ought to behave myself in God's house (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>), it really takes in the whole of my life in my house and especially in relation to my brothers and sisters, and whether I behave myself as one who really fears and honours God.<a name=78:17></a>

		Jacob was a young man leaving home.<a name=78:18></a> I want to touch on these important points of Jacob's history.<a name=78:19></a> Prior to this he dwelt in tents with Abraham and Isaac.<a name=78:20></a> He had been brought up in the light of the

		heavenly calling and he loved to be a tent-dweller.<a name=79:1></a> I do not believe anyone can readily serve God if he is not morally a tent-dweller, so that he can give his whole time to the house of the Lord.<a name=79:2></a> To begin with, Jacob was faithful to his instincts; so at the outset he takes his brother by the heel.<a name=79:3></a> Dear young people, it is a menace, if you have to be governed by your instincts.<a name=79:4></a> You will early find no end of attractions in the world.<a name=79:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Esau was a very attractive man, but Jacob was a plain man.<a name=79:6></a> A homely man does not appeal to a man of this world but he was an ideal man to live with and that is the great thing.<a name=79:7></a> God is going to fill heaven with men who are a delight to live with.<a name=79:8></a> What one would encourage those who are growing up in the light of the heavenly truth is to be true to your spiritual instincts.<a name=79:9></a> Do not give way to the man of the world!<a name=79:10></a> Do not give way to that which seems so attractive!<a name=79:11></a> Esau did not care to live in tents.<a name=79:12></a> He wanted to be out and about, a skilful man and a clever business man, and it mentions in one place that he wore expensive clothes, (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:15">Genesis  27:15</a>).<a name=79:13></a> It is not of God, and you cannot imagine such a spirit in the house of God.<a name=79:14></a> It would disintegrate the whole thing.<a name=79:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A king is not a homely tent dweller.<a name=79:16></a> The genealogy of Esau is full of kings and dukes.<a name=79:17></a> God is not filling His house with kings and dukes.<a name=79:18></a> The saints are such, as made by God (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:6">Revelation  1:6</a>), but down here they are mere tent dwellers.<a name=79:19></a> Kingdom (or kings) and priests.<a name=79:20></a>.<a name=79:21></a> I would encourage everyone here to supplant the kind of man in this world.<a name=79:22></a> If you do not begin like this you cannot be of any use in the house of the Lord.<a name=79:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob valued the birthright.<a name=79:24></a> That is another thing where he was true to his instincts.<a name=79:25></a> Although he took advantage of his brother when it came to the question of the blessing, we are not told that he valued the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thought that the blessing involves a personal touch with God.<a name=80:1></a> The idea of a birthright is to be cherished spiritually.<a name=80:2></a> I would encourage all to go in for a birthright.<a name=80:3></a> Esau despised it, but Jacob valued it.<a name=80:4></a> Can you imagine anything greater than having your name registered in heaven, far greater than in this world.<a name=80:5></a> We need to value our birthright, but we must also value the blessing.<a name=80:6></a> His mother valued it and saw that he got it.<a name=80:7></a> Jacob had to leave home and he went out from Beersheba.<a name=80:8></a> We are always coming to points in our lives where the sun sets with us  --  certain phases of our lives come to a definite end  --  they will never come again.<a name=80:9></a> They are solemn moments in our history.<a name=80:10></a> One of the most solemn phases is when a young man has to leave home to start on his own.<a name=80:11></a> What are you going to do now?<a name=80:12></a> Jacob had been faithful to his instincts and God was faithful to him.<a name=80:13></a> The best of anyone being faithful down here is that God is faithful to him.<a name=80:14></a> He has called us to be something down here, and He is faithful, otherwise we should be afraid to commit ourselves.<a name=80:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are faithful sayings recorded in Timothy.<a name=80:16></a> You can lean back on them when you leave home.<a name=80:17></a> You cannot get worse than the "Chief of Sinners".<a name=80:18></a> Jacob was leaving home sore with a great rift between him and his brother.<a name=80:19></a> He was fleeing, and that was humbling, but it is good for us to be humbled, and all our circumstances come about because we have not learned to trust in God.<a name=80:20></a> We are scheming our own way, and upset things.<a name=80:21></a> So Jacob was fleeing from his brother, but God was faithful to him, and if you are faithful to your instincts and value your birthright, you may be sure that when you have to make a fresh move God will be faithful to you.<a name=80:22></a> Jacob dreamed a dream; God was honouring his faithfulness.<a name=80:23></a> He saw a ladder set up from earth and the top reached to heaven.<a name=80:24></a> For a long time I used to think of this ladder as hanging down from heaven, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		God was at the top of it and Angels ascending and descending.<a name=81:1></a> What do you see in that?<a name=81:2></a> I see that from this standpoint that we are speaking of the centre of God's interest is earth and Christ is set up on the earth.<a name=81:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So God wanted to impress Jacob  --  and us  --  that the centre of His interest is earth and He had established something which the angels could ascend from without coming down to it.<a name=81:4></a> Therefore it must be a heavenly institution set up on earth which is so great that the top of the ladder reaches to heaven.<a name=81:5></a> There is direct communication with heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending.<a name=81:6></a> The Lord Jesus speaks of angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:51">John  1:51</a>).<a name=81:7></a> Everything that God delighted in was in Him, and you could understand that when Christ was here He was the point of departure.<a name=81:8></a> Now God has established his house down here.<a name=81:9></a> We cannot belittle the house of God.<a name=81:10></a> It is a question of the Spirit of God being here indwelling the Saints, and it is of the utmost importance that this position should be maintained.<a name=81:11></a> God's glory is connected with maintaining glory on the earth.<a name=81:12></a> Christ is at the right hand of God.<a name=81:13></a> But what is of primary importance to God in this dispensation is that there should be maintained on this earth that which is in accord with Him, something so great that being set up it reaches to heaven.<a name=81:14></a> At all costs that must not be allowed to break down.<a name=81:15></a> God wants the expression of it here.<a name=81:16></a> Now Jacob has the intelligence to name it.<a name=81:17></a> "This is none other than the house of God".<a name=81:18></a>  --  something so great on earth that it reaches to heaven.<a name=81:19></a> With man's institution only the sins reach heaven, but here is an institution on earth reaching to heaven in a way which gives God complacency, and the angels of God ascending and descending.<a name=81:20></a>

		he sets up this <i>pillar</i> and pours oil upon it.<a name=82:1></a> Applying it to us, one would suggest that this is God revealing to a young soul what He has on earth and that young soul was getting a sense of how necessary it is that there should be a <i>public expression</i> of it and also getting a sense that they can only be in the power of the Spirit, although Jacob got the light of this he had no thought of staying there.<a name=82:2></a> I believe that young Christians growing up in the circle of the saints have little idea that God is there.<a name=82:3></a> Jacob says "I knew it not".<a name=82:4></a> That is he knew that he was not fit to be there.<a name=82:5></a> But how gracious it is that God commits Himself to Jacob.<a name=82:6></a> "I am unfit for fellowship".<a name=82:7></a> I point you again to that just and faithful saying  --  "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:15">1 Timothy  1:15</a>) etc.<a name=82:8></a> Jacob was very conscious of being a sinner.<a name=82:9></a> We know that he had an awkward brother, but that did not excuse him upsetting his brother.<a name=82:10></a> I have no doubt that Jacob was conscious of this sinnership.<a name=82:11></a> You may have some such feelings.<a name=82:12></a> But Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.<a name=82:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem a dreadful place at first, because God could not have you there if you had not a sense of what you are.<a name=82:14></a> God commits Himself to Jacob.<a name=82:15></a> He will be with you everywhere you go and says "I will bring you again to this place and will not leave you until I have accomplished all I have spoken of.<a name=82:16></a> I am going to be with you all the way until I have brought you into the good of it".<a name=82:17></a> 'If you will be with me in the way that I go and give me bread to eat and garments to wear and bring me again to my Father's house then this pillar shall be God's house'.<a name=82:18></a> I would encourage everyone here to make a vow in the light of God's faithfulness.<a name=82:19></a> It is not presumption to vow in the light of how faithful God is.<a name=82:20></a>

		At this point Jacob answers to the truth of Timothy's thoughts and says, 'If you will give me bread and garments .<a name=82:21></a>.<a name=82:22></a>.<a name=82:23></a> etc'.<a name=82:24></a> Paul says: "But having

	<div class="paragraph">
		He was definite.<a name=83:6></a> It was his own suggestion.<a name=83:7></a> I would desire that we might be more definite, both as to our time and as to our money, and everything in a general way, but to be definite.<a name=83:8></a> God will honour that.<a name=83:9></a> Jacob goes through discipline but God is with him.<a name=83:10></a> But the man who schemed to get spiritual blessing also schemes to get prosperous in business  --  the speckled and spotted sheep.<a name=83:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob goes on with this scheming, and for the time being he appears to be diverted.<a name=83:12></a> He thinks his success is a result of his scheming, but it was all God's doing.<a name=83:13></a> So just as it was his, so it is our scheme; instead of being prepared to let God undertake for us we think we know what would be the best in our business matters, we think we know how to scheme.<a name=83:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God goes to Jacob and tells him to go back to Bethel.<a name=83:15></a> He reminds Jacob of the vow, and Jacob sets his tent hard to go back.<a name=83:16></a> He realizes that what he is coming back to is a dreadful place to him, but God wants you to be perfectly at home in that place, and the first thing that is to be met is his brother Esau.<a name=83:17></a> He must face Esau, and God uses that exercise of facing Esau to bring Jacob to the end of his schemings.<a name=83:18></a> It brings Jacob to learn to limp, and one feels that this exercise, to learn entirely to trust in God, is largely got by facing up to the fact that if we are to be here for God we must learn to get on with our brethren.<a name=83:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me".<a name=84:4></a> So God blessed him there, and Jacob gave up all his schemings, and limped upon his thigh.<a name=84:5></a> It is wonderful to learn that God can do better for us than we can do.<a name=84:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes what I regard as the most sad part of Jacob's history.<a name=84:7></a> He is no longer worried about getting a living.<a name=84:8></a> God has come in for him.<a name=84:9></a> He is very successful in business.<a name=84:10></a> Now, what is he going to do?<a name=84:11></a> I think that is the most testing part of our lives.<a name=84:12></a> Jacob builds him a house.<a name=84:13></a> He had not got to Bethel yet, but he settles down;  --  he has departed from that simple touch.<a name=84:14></a> We need to maintain our beginnings.<a name=84:15></a> We see the world in front of us, but the test comes later in life, Are we going to build a house, or are we going on with the Lord?<a name=84:16></a> He puts an altar up there, but the result is disorder.<a name=84:17></a> His daughter goes into the world.<a name=84:18></a> What a warning it is that we should be content with food and clothes!<a name=84:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many so-called Christians think that the blessing of God is to be successful in business, and to have your altar in your house.<a name=84:20></a> They have no idea of the house of God.<a name=84:21></a> That is the current level of the ordinary Christian body.<a name=84:22></a> God would have you make Him an altar in His house.<a name=84:23></a> I need to preserve my beginnings; to be homely and a tent dweller, and to be content with food and raiment.<a name=84:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob comes to Bethel, and he builds the altar.<a name=84:25></a> It is not a question of God at the top of the ladder now; it is the impression of one that has not known it in his own soul, and now God is talking with him.<a name=84:26></a> Jacob sets up a pillar in the place where He talked with him; and the result of God talking with him is that He called his name Israel.<a name=84:27></a> Now Jacob sets up

		So God blesses Jacob here, and says, "Kings shall come out of thy loins".<a name=85:8></a> In pouring the drink offering on the pillar, all that is natural has to go, and then he gets the full blessing from God, and finally it says that he journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.<a name=85:9></a> It means that his service is unselfish.<a name=85:10></a> He devoted himself to the service of God on this earth.<a name=85:11></a>

		But before dwelling on Malachi, I wish to say a few words as to the earlier history of the children of Israel, to indicate how God operated to secure His end, according to the word "Let my son go that he may serve me".<a name=87:11></a> The people were thinking of their burdens, their needs, and that is how we think.<a name=87:12></a> We long to be free from the burden of our sins, from the slavery of sin and from the pressure of death, for we labour under these burdens until we are converted and come to know God; we are thinking of that side and we appreciate the death of Christ as that which sets us free.<a name=87:13></a> That is how <i>we</i> come into it, but how good it is to think of the way that <i>God</i> was looking at the

		To pass on to the question of government, in covenanting to maintain stable creatorial conditions, God had no intention that the world should relapse into the state of anarchy existent before the flood.<a name=102:3></a> He, therefore, introduced magisterial government, giving authority for the execution of capital punishment.<a name=102:4></a> "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God He hath made man" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:6">Genesis  9:6</a>).<a name=102:5></a> This is an immense mercy from God.<a name=102:6></a> Why do not conditions relapse into the corruption and violence prevalent before the flood?<a name=102:7></a> Because <i>God</i> has set up and supports magisterial government for the punishment of the evil-doer and the reward of them that do well, so that His testimony might go forward.<a name=102:8></a> The maintenance of such government in a world of lawlessness is a miracle; and it is our privilege to pray continually for its maintenance in every land, and to give thanks to God for it; praying feelingly at the same time for those who are in the positions of authority and responsibility.<a name=102:9></a>

		Later, in order to limit man's pride and check the working of organised sin, God divided the race into nations; again looking on to the present day when the blessing of Abraham should come to the nations in Christ Jesus (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:14">Galatians  3:14</a>); and later still, after the breakdown of Israel, to prevent national barriers, a mercy in themselves, proving disadvantageous to the testimony, He placed <i>imperial</i> government in the hands of Gentile rulers.<a name=102:10></a> These rulers have often been marked by great pride, attributing their greatness to themselves.<a name=102:11></a> Nebuchadnezzar, the first of them, became lifted up in heart and said, "Behold this Babylon which <i>I</i> have builded".<a name=102:12></a> But he had to learn

		The Book of Daniel helps us much as to our attitude to these authorities and would help us also to pray intelligently in regard to them.<a name=103:4></a> If it is God who changed times and seasons; if it is <i>He</i> who deposes kings and sets up kings (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:21">Daniel  2:21</a>) then we can be sure that, whatever feature of rule appears, it can only serve <i>His</i> purpose.<a name=103:5></a> Each of the metals in the image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream represents a feature of rule that appeared specifically in the empire to which it relates, but which has remained in measure ever since, and will remain to the end (see <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:35">Daniel  2:35</a>) Thus, the silver for instance, represents the feature of rule that is favourable to God's people and recognises, in some degree, His rights over them.<a name=103:6></a> This characterised the Persian Empire but it also represents the attitude of government over a large part of the earth today; and we continually thank God for it.<a name=103:7></a> On the other hand, the brass represents rule of a profane and ruthless character, seen in the Grecian Empire, and very evident in Europe today.<a name=103:8></a> God uses such rule to administer necessary chastisement to His people, and to the nations, and will do so to the end, for the King of the North is an instrument of this kind.<a name=103:9></a>

		In speaking of this chapter I trust we shall be able to see how God's acceptable year developed in the early days of Christianity, and also how it enters into our soul experience, and in a certain measure into the Lord's supper.<a name=108:5></a> In the early days of Christianity, these set feasts or fixed times had a remarkable fulfilment, beginning with the passover, typically the precious death of Christ, which is the basis of everything.<a name=108:6></a> In this chapter the passover is not related to the wilderness but to the land and the harvest, so it says, "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest .<a name=108:7></a>.<a name=108:8></a>.<a name=108:9></a>".<a name=108:10></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23:10">Leviticus  23:10</a>.<a name=108:11></a> There is such a thing as wilderness experience, but it is a blessed thing to view the death of Christ in relation to the land, and the harvest.<a name=108:12></a> When Christ rose from the dead the land came into view  --  life in a risen Christ.<a name=108:13></a> As typified by the wave sheaf, He is firstfruits of the harvest.<a name=108:14></a> How precious the death of Christ is, viewed as that from which the whole harvest for God, which will fill heaven and earth, is come.<a name=108:15></a> It is instructive that the passover was in the month Abib.<a name=108:16></a> We are told in a note in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>, it was the month in which the corn ripens.<a name=108:17></a> The Lord Jesus Himself bore the winter.<a name=108:18></a> This chapter has not the winter in mind.<a name=108:19></a> These feasts occupied the summer period.<a name=108:20></a> The Lord Jesus Himself bore the winter, and we know what a winter that was.<a name=108:21></a> It was He who cried, "My
