		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> It is in mind to refer to other scriptures in Numbers in the later readings, but in this reading one feels the Holy Spirit would give us an impression of what is incumbent upon us in view of God having taken up His abode amongst His people.<a name=1:3></a> We might consider that point first, the wonder of it, of God having taken up His abode amongst His people in the wilderness.<a name=1:4></a> One thing that immediately comes into view is conscription for military service, the appointment of the Levites in verse 50 of chapter 1, and the appointment of the priests in chapter 3: 10.<a name=1:5></a> "Thou shalt appoint them for the priest's office".<a name=1:6></a> But this follows God taking up His residence in the habitation which love had provided: "they shall make me a sanctuary" was the proposal in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, as some of us were considering last night.<a name=1:7></a> "They shall make me a sanctuary" every one was to be in it "that I may dwell among them".<a name=1:8></a> The willing hearted and the wise hearted operated, the sanctuary had been provided -- that is the exercise of Exodus, that we should provide the sanctuary, sanctuary conditions for God.<a name=1:9></a> And God had taken up His residence in the last chapter of Exodus, "on the first day of the first month of the second year".<a name=1:10></a> Then a month had elapsed, during which what we have in Leviticus took place: "And Jehovah called to Moses and spoke to him out of the tent of meeting", <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#1:1">Leviticus  1:1</a>.<a name=1:11></a> What a new departure it was!<a name=1:12></a> They had known what it was for God to speak from heaven; but now God was dwelling amongst them, and He calls to Moses and speaks to him out of the tent of meeting,

		G.R.<a name=2:13></a>C.<a name=2:14></a> So that the tabernacle, seven or eight times in this book is called the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=2:15></a> Is not that a very precious view of the assembly?<a name=2:16></a>

		G.R.<a name=2:19></a>C.<a name=2:20></a> I wondered in that way whether it was illustrated in Corinth!<a name=2:21></a> Corinth gives us the assembly in the wilderness and Paul says "the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you"; and, in chapter 2

		he says that he came amongst them with fear and trembling and so on, announcing the testimony of God.<a name=3:1></a> So that Paul came to Corinth carrying as it were, the testimony of the Christ and the testimony of God; but the point was, where was that testimony to find a residence in that city?<a name=3:2></a> Well, it involved eighteen month's work straight away; eighteen month's work, much people there, much material, but the initial work took eighteen months, as it were, in principle, to set together the tabernacle of witness.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:4></a> Would the thought of testimony involve the setting out of the light in the locality?<a name=3:5></a> I was thinking of the setting in Numbers, they were to be numbered according to their <i>tribes</i>, and set in relation to their standards and their <i>father's houses</i>.<a name=3:6></a> Would all that suggest that the testimony is to shine out in localities; while it is universal in its bearing, it is expressed locally, is it?<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:8></a>C.<a name=3:9></a> Yes, that is developed under Paul's ministry, that while the tabernacle of testimony is a great universal idea, God's habitation in the Spirit, at the present time I suppose, stretches to the four corners of the earth; yet it is to be expressed, the features of it are to shine in every locality; what is proper to the tabernacle of testimony as a whole is to be seen in every locality.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:11></a> That is a very dignified word that Stephen uses, "<i>the</i> assembly in the wilderness".<a name=3:12></a> I thought it would connect with a system of glory really, not merely a congregation going through, but a setting out of divine attributes and order and dignity.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:14></a>C.<a name=3:15></a> You can understand therefore why Paul remained in Corinth eighteen months teaching.<a name=3:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:17></a> Is the church of God the testimonial name?<a name=3:18></a> I was thinking of how it is introduced at Corinth -- "the assembly of God".<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:20></a>C.<a name=3:21></a> I think it is in the way it is used in that epistle, the assembly of God.<a name=3:22></a> It is the residence of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:2></a> Does this link on with the current exercise as to all our meetings being public, that the testimony of God might shine out?<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:4></a>C.<a name=4:5></a> Well, in considering this exercise, we should have to take this idea of the testimony of God into account.<a name=4:6></a> And the assembly is the vessel where the testimony of God and the testimony of Christ are enshrined.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:8></a> You had something in mind as to conscription.<a name=4:9></a> Last night, in Exodus, you were drawing our attention to everyone whose heart prompted him.<a name=4:10></a> This is rather different from that, is it?<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:12></a>C.<a name=4:13></a> Yes, but God does not bring it to bear upon the people until He has taken up His residence in His habitation, and they had had a month, and there had been the opportunity to draw near to Him, then He asserts what He ever had the right to assert, but He asserts His rights in love over the people.<a name=4:14></a> But the only answer to love like that that had led Him to come down to dwell, and has led Him now to come down to dwell among us in these mixed conditions, is that we should all accept conscription; because God so loves us that He has not postponed His dwelling until conditions are perfect, until we reach the eternal state.<a name=4:15></a> But we ought to pay more attention to, and contemplate more earnestly, the amazing character of the proposal -- and of what has actually taken place -- of God having such affection for His people that nothing would meet or satisfy the desires of His heart but to dwell among us <i>now</i>.<a name=4:16></a> How He loves us, that He should want to dwell among us now!<a name=4:17></a> We dwell with those we love; dwelling is a matter of love, and God has come to dwell among His people.<a name=4:18></a> But then, in such mixed conditions, and in an unholy city like Corinth, if sanctuary conditions suitable for God are

		to be maintained, it is essential that we should all accept conscription.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:2></a> So it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>"But now having got your freedom <i>from</i> sin and having become bondmen to God".<a name=5:3></a> Would bondmen to God involve this matter of conscription?<a name=5:4></a> It goes on to speak of "ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end eternal life".<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:6></a>C.<a name=5:7></a> Quite so.<a name=5:8></a> If we recognise bondmanship, the claims of God in the way of conscription would not present any hardship to a bondman, he is already committed to whatever he is called upon to do.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:10></a> Does this matter of the military question involve that the divine presence needs to be guarded?<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:12></a>C.<a name=5:13></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:15></a> I was thinking of how early the idea of guarding enters into the divine thought; man was set in the garden to begin with, not only to till it, but to guard it.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:17></a>C.<a name=5:18></a> That is very helpful.<a name=5:19></a> And of course he failed in that, but still it is a wonderful thing to think of, that guarding came in at the very outset, there was the garden of God's delight, and it was to be guarded; well how essential now that the habitation of God should be guarded!<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:21></a> And is it to be noted that the view of the assembly in Corinth, what is referred to as the dwelling-place, is the temple, the shrine, the house itself.<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:23></a>C.<a name=5:24></a> Quite so.<a name=5:25></a> And Hebrews says "Whose house are <i>we</i>, if we hold fast the boldness of the boast of hope firm to the end", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>.<a name=5:26></a> That is the Exodus view, "Whose house are we".<a name=5:27></a> We, as Christians, <i>form</i> the material <i>for</i> the house; the willing hearted involves <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, that we present our bodies, each of us, one great living sacrifice <i>for</i> the one great end, that is, providing God with a sanctuary, sanctuary conditions.<a name=5:28></a> So that that views us as forming the house; but then Numbers views us as in our responsibilities relative to it.<a name=5:29></a>

		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:1></a> Is not that the way the apostle takes the matter up with the Corinthians, being such a house, he has to regulate them, does he not, as to what is external?<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:3></a>C.<a name=6:4></a> And I think there you get the idea of the "holy nation".<a name=6:5></a> You see Peter applies to us what was applied to Israel in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.<a name=6:6></a> Peter says in his epistle, "ye are a chosen race", well that would bring in I suppose sonship and so on -- "Israel is my son, my first-born".<a name=6:7></a> And then he says "a kingly priesthood", which might link with Leviticus, and then "a holy nation", which I think links with Numbers, because in Numbers the whole nation is organised relative to the habitation of God in the midst.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:9></a> So that the word goes on, "that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light".<a name=6:10></a> Is that the testimony of God?<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:12></a>C.<a name=6:13></a> It is, and I think it is important to keep in our minds that from the standpoint of the title "tabernacle of testimony", it implies that the assembly is the vessel in which the testimony of the Christ, and the testimony of God are enshrined, and nothing is to be allowed to sully that, and showing forth the excellencies of Him who has called us out of darkness into his wonderful light would bear on that.<a name=6:14></a> Nothing is to bedim the excellencies of the God whose testimony is enshrined in the tabernacle.<a name=6:15></a> And we need to keep these things in our minds -- the testimony of the Christ and the testimony of God.<a name=6:16></a> There is no other thought than that the assembly, universally, and also as seen in its local setting, should be the vessel in which the testimony of the Christ and the testimony of God are enshrined <i>unsullied</i>.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:18></a> Would you just say a few words as to the distinctive features of those two testimonies in the way you speak of them?<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:1></a>C.<a name=7:2></a> I wish I could say something about them, they are very great thoughts.<a name=7:3></a> "The testimony of the Christ" is so linked up with the vessel that in chapter 12 of Corinthians Paul, in referring to it as the assembly here, can say "so also is the Christ".<a name=7:4></a> It is really the assembly as the anointed vessel now.<a name=7:5></a> The whole tabernacle -- every part of it -- and the priests were anointed; everything was in the grace of the anointing.<a name=7:6></a> In every way the system was descriptive of Christ.<a name=7:7></a> The material of the tabernacle -- while the curtains and the boards represent the saints -- in character, was all Christ, and nothing but Christ, and therefore anointed on that account.<a name=7:8></a> And then Christ personally was enshrined there: the ark, the table, the candlestick, all were to be seen at Corinth.<a name=7:9></a> There was a company anointed, and Christ enshrined amongst them, so that anyone coming in touch with that company would get an impression of Christ's day -- a testimony to Christ's day.<a name=7:10></a> But then not only that, the testimony of God was there, therefore Paul does not close that epistle without referring to the day of God, because the day of God is touched in the assembly, "that God may be all in all".<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=7:12></a> So that, as I understand what you are saying, it is a very wonderful thing that in the testimony at the present time there is ability to present things as they will appear <i>in</i> glory in the world to come and in the day of God.<a name=7:13></a> Is not that a very wonderful conception, a very wonderful standard to keep <i>in</i> our minds and <i>in</i> our hearts?<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:15></a>C.<a name=7:16></a> It is very wonderful.<a name=7:17></a> As the tabernacle went through the wilderness as the tabernacle of testimony, whether it was stationary or in movement, the first thing I take <i>it</i> that would impress anyone who came <i>into</i> touch with it would be the perfume, the odour of the anointing -- "a perfume after the work of the perfumer" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#30:35">Exodus  30:35</a>, it says as to the holy anointing oil.<a name=7:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=8:1></a> Would that connect with the word in Corinthians again, "the odour of his knowledge in every place"?<a name=8:2></a> That would not only apply to what was conferred, but what was brought out amongst the saints, specially with Paul and those with him.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:4></a>C.<a name=8:5></a> Paul had to refer to that, relative to himself and those with him, because of the absence of it in practical reality among the saints in Corinth, so he says "God makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place".<a name=8:6></a> But then that was true; the idea was that as Paul left every place, he should leave behind the anointed vessel itself, so that the odour of God's knowledge in that place remained.<a name=8:7></a> And then the next thing that would impress a person who came in touch with the tabernacle, or perhaps equally so, with the presence of God in it, whether the tabernacle in movement or stationary, was the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.<a name=8:8></a> People should get an impression of the odour of the Spirit of Christ, the anointing, and an impression of the very presence of God amongst His people.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=8:10></a> That is what is in mind in relation to a simple person coming in, or an unbeliever, "reporting that God is indeed amongst you", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:25">1 Corinthians  14:25</a>.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:12></a>C.<a name=8:13></a> That is it.<a name=8:14></a> And that is the testimony of God, God is indeed amongst you.<a name=8:15></a> And you think of what that means to anyone who comes to the Lord's supper, an exercised soul, a simple person as you say.<a name=8:16></a> The service does not end until the saints are in spirit touching the day of God.<a name=8:17></a> What an effect that would normally have on a soul that was exercised, to hear the praise at the close of the meeting, the touches of eternity!<a name=8:18></a> That is how the testimony of God comes into expression in the fullest way I take it.<a name=8:19></a> But then it is there all the time, in our ministry meetings and at other times, God is there.<a name=8:20></a>

		G.R.<a name=10:8></a>C.<a name=10:9></a> So it is a basic thing in national life nowadays, and here we have the holy nation, and the first thing that regulation brought in nationally, as we may say, was conscription.<a name=10:10></a>

		And so, if we think of Paul at the end of his life, in 2 Timothy, we see how his priestly energy was undimmed, for "the testimony of our Lord" governed him on the one hand, and the appearing of Christ on the other -- like the priests who encamped at the east side of the tabernacle; it was between the sunrising on the one side, and the tabernacle of testimony on the other.<a name=29:5></a> And those were the only two things that Paul was concerned about.<a name=29:6></a> That is, the priestly outlook; they are the only two things that matter, the Lord's appearing which is imminent, and on the other hand, that the tabernacle of testimony is here, the testimony of our Lord is still here.<a name=29:7></a> And so we need to be prepared to submit to the trial of jealousy on the one hand, and on the other hand to be committed to the Nazarite's vow, in chapter 6.<a name=29:8></a> Chapters 5 and 6 therefore vitally follow the ordering of the camp.<a name=29:9></a> I think those two things would keep and preserve us in spiritual energy, because the Nazarite separates himself from wine and strong drink; he not only separates himself from what is unclean, but from wine and strong drink; that is, he makes a vow not to be stimulated by anything that is down here.<a name=29:10></a> All his stimulation is in God, and the things of God, "The God of gladness of my joy", as the Psalmist says.<a name=29:11></a>

		G.R.<a name=31:4></a>C.<a name=31:5></a> It seems to me that in Egypt itself the people would be considering their own need and their own peril, and although the rights and ordinances of it are given there -- for instance they were to feed on the lamb roast with fire -- and it says "ye shall eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with its inwards".<a name=31:6></a> While they were to do that, and did it, yet they ate with haste; and it is just a question as to how far in soul history, at a time like that, the extent to which persons can truly appropriate the passover, they do appropriate it, they did eat it, but not with the appreciation one would judge, with which they would do it in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#9">Numbers  9</a>.<a name=31:7></a>

		G.R.<a name=31:12></a>C.<a name=31:13></a> Yes, I would say that.<a name=31:14></a> God had the assembly in mind in the passover, because it is the first time the word assembly is used, I think, in scripture, "Speak to the whole assembly of Israel", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>.<a name=31:15></a>

		G.R.<a name=31:18></a>C.<a name=31:19></a> Yes.<a name=31:20></a> It would appear that the tabernacle was set up, and then on that day the princes began to offer -- the dedication of the altar -- which would take twelve days, and then very soon after that God would be speaking about the passover, in view of being observed on the fourteenth day.<a name=31:21></a>

		G.R.<a name=36:14></a>C.<a name=36:15></a> That is what I thought.<a name=36:16></a> If you apply it generally, in these last days the truth of God dwelling amongst His people in these mixed conditions has been recovered -- the idea of the tabernacle of testimony -- the saints have been recovered to the truth of that, but then it has exposed to us all that we were unclean; for instance, take Sardis, "Thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead".<a name=36:17></a> So that even if we go back to Luther and the reformation; well, what has grown out of that is dead.<a name=36:18></a> And we have our links with a dead body.<a name=36:19></a> Of course, in other ways, we have had links too, but I am referring to the general situation; therefore <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>comes in with a view to our days of recovery being in accord with the truth of the tabernacle of testimony and of God dwelling here.<a name=36:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=64:9></a>C.<a name=64:10></a> Quite so.<a name=64:11></a> It is relative to the general position that the burnt offering stands.<a name=64:12></a> The assembly, according to God's own thoughts, is before Him on this immutable basis; and what a comfort it is to our souls, and what deep feelings it would bring about in us as to what follows -- the sin offering!<a name=64:13></a> And then, as to the individual soul, he brings his sin offering -- a she goat -- which, I suppose suggests the subjective side of things, that he has gone into things deeply.<a name=64:14></a> The individual sin offering, as we know from Leviticus, was fed upon by the priests.<a name=64:15></a> The sin offering for the assembly was burnt outside the camp, but the individual sin offering became food for the priests; and I believe that is an important matter, that we should learn to feed not on the sin, but upon the sin offering.<a name=64:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=64:17></a> Is it important to see that these matters are completed: "It shall be forgiven" is just as much a completion of the matter of the sin of inadvertence as the soul being cut off in verse 31, as to the matter of a high hand?<a name=64:18></a>

		Chapter 33 speaks of their journeys, their goings out; there is the initial going out through the Red Sea, when we accept the doctrine of baptism, and in our measure at the time accept baptism itself.<a name=129:6></a> But these journeys bring home the truth of it to us more and more; they are all called the goings out.<a name=129:7></a> In the Red Sea we acknowledge that our old man has been crucified with Him; but the working of it out -- so that we are practically free from that old man involves the lessons of the wilderness, a pivotal point in which is the brazen serpent.<a name=129:8></a> So that you can understand Balaam saying here, as he beholds Israel, "It is a people that shall dwell alone"; their goings out at this time were so complete -- "they shall not be reckoned among the nations".<a name=129:9></a> But then, at this last encampment, referred to again in the beginning of chapter 25 at Shittim -- which as we know means <i>acacias</i> -- "Israel abode in Shittim", the enemy attacks on that very point, the very point as it were that Balaam began with.<a name=129:10></a> We are told in chapter 31: 16 "these through the counsel of Balaam, caused the children of Israel to commit sin against Jehovah in the matter of Peor".<a name=129:11></a> So that although Balaam had been compelled to speak God's mind about the people, because of the corruption of his motives, he counselled

		Moab and Midian as to how they could attack such a people; and the attack was based on that very verse -- it is a people that shall dwell alone.<a name=130:1></a> The very thing that he had said about them, he used the light of it that was given him, against the people; and he gives counsel to Balak and Midian, as much as to say: 'Now that is where you can overcome them, that is where you can weaken them -- on that point'.<a name=130:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After all their journeys and goings out they come to the last encampment, and there is a final attack on this particular line.<a name=130:3></a> So that even if we could credit ourselves -- which alas we cannot -- with being at the last encampment, we would have to face this.<a name=130:4></a> And in fact what we are facing, and have been facing, is pretty much this kind of thing, the counsel of Balaam to strike at the root of things by seducing the saints so that we are no longer a people dwelling alone; so that we are reckoned among the nations, we have a place amongst men.<a name=130:5></a> And so this Midianitish snare comes in, the people began to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab; it is the fair and attractive side of the world.<a name=130:6></a> The people at the last encampment should not be carried away by the base things of the world, the fair and attractive side of the world, the seducing side.<a name=130:7></a> But it says: "And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods, and Israel joined himself to Baal Peor".<a name=130:8></a> I suppose there was no graver point in their history than this, in view of the point they had reached with God, that then they should allow themselves to be seduced.<a name=130:9></a> And so the very thing that is brought forward here, as an example, suggests the awful seduction of the world.<a name=130:10></a> Social status, high positions -- it says in verse 14, "And the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, the prince of a father's house of the Simeonites.<a name=130:11></a> And the name of the Midianitish

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we need to take account of this; God is bringing us, I believe, to this last encampment; so we need to be very vigilant as to the Midianitish snare.<a name=131:8></a> But the thing was met, the plague was stayed, and immediately following that, they are numbered for the land in the next chapter; for the land is in view at this last encampment.<a name=131:9></a> There was not one left of the old generation except Caleb and Joshua.<a name=131:10></a> Here is the new generation, Caleb and Joshua being the link with the old, which gives the continuity of it in Christian experience -- that we are the same persons.<a name=131:11></a> But the new generation is now numbered, numbered for the land, and the family side is stressed all through this numbering.<a name=131:12></a> You see the family links amongst the brethren; how we need to keep a pure strain; a Midianitish woman with an Israelitish prince is a dreadful mixture!<a name=131:13></a> We need the pure strain, if there is to be pure family affections amongst the saints.<a name=131:14></a> The moment you get an admixture of the world, it cuts right across divine family affections; you are bringing in something entirely extraneous to the family of God.<a name=131:15></a> And we need the basis of family affections if we are to move together into the inheritance.<a name=131:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so this numbering is in view of going into the land.<a name=132:4></a> And again it speaks of this encampment in verse 3 of chapter 26, "in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho".<a name=132:5></a> That is where this numbering goes on; it is at this last encampment that the new generation has clearly come to light, and can be taken account of and numbered for the land.<a name=132:6></a> Following that, we have the daughters of Zelophehad -- because, you see, the land is in view at this last encampment, nothing less, and the daughters of Zelophehad come forward indicating the true spiritual state that God is looking for, <i>valuing the inheritance</i>.<a name=132:7></a> And God answers their desire, this energetic spiritual state that would claim the inheritance.<a name=132:8></a> And then following that, God says in chapter 27: 12 to Moses "Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land that I have given unto the children of Israel.<a name=132:9></a> And when thou hast seen it, thou shalt be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother was gathered, because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, as to hallowing me in the matter of the water before their eyes".<a name=132:10></a> The serious side of things is brought forward there as to Moses.<a name=132:11></a> What a solemn thing, those hasty words!<a name=132:12></a> But then, although God says that to Moses here, his departure does not take place here; that is impending, for there is much to be done yet.<a name=132:13></a> There is the appointment of Joshua; and then to think of those chapters, 28 and 29, marvellous chapters, and how they come in here!<a name=132:14></a> Think how privileged Moses was to give this instruction: "<i>My</i> offering, <i>my</i> bread for my offerings by fire of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so if we move on to chapter 31, we have the war to "Avenge the children of Israel upon the Midianites".<a name=133:5></a> And that is a thing we need to attend to; Midian must not become a snare any more.<a name=133:6></a> So we must go to war against the Midianites; every tribe represented, every local meeting, as we may say.<a name=133:7></a> We go to war with the Midianites -- these principles of seduction.<a name=133:8></a> And the war was successful; and one feature of it was, according to chapter 31: 49, that not one man was lacking.<a name=133:9></a> Twenty-four thousand died in the plague, but not one died in the war; so that once we face the matter, there is salvation.<a name=133:10></a> But you will notice that in this war, and what follows it, how much purification is stressed in chapter 31, verses 19 - 24!<a name=133:11></a> How thoroughly they were to purify themselves, as well as the booty they had taken!<a name=133:12></a> "The gold, and the silver, and the copper, the iron, the tin, the lead, everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the water of separation;" Even after going through the fire, it was all to go through the water: "And everything that cannot pass through the fire shall ye make go through the water.<a name=133:13></a> And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterwards ye may come into the camp".<a name=133:14></a> What a thorough going matter this was!<a name=133:15></a> Not only warfare, but this utterly thorough and complete purification!<a name=133:16></a>

		That brings us on to chapter 33 where we read about these journeys.<a name=134:1></a> Here we have a wonderful view of the wilderness in retrospect.<a name=134:2></a> "And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah; and these are their journeys according to their goings out".<a name=134:3></a> They are not called wanderings here.<a name=134:4></a> We might well say that the truth of the brazen serpent was always true, and why did not they acknowledge it just after they left Egypt?<a name=134:5></a> But you see, the wilderness lessons had to be learnt experimentally, and while the prolonged time in the wilderness was because of sin in the flesh working in the people -- which, of course, you cannot excuse -- yet from the Divine side God was over it all.<a name=134:6></a> Those in whom He was working were getting the good of it -- Caleb and Joshua were getting the good of it -- the new generation, if we may say so, was getting the gain of it.<a name=134:7></a> God did not cease to order their movements, they were journeys, it says, "by the commandment of Jehovah".<a name=134:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#9">Nehemiah  9</a>, the confessional chapter that was referred to this afternoon, it says in verse 19 that "The pillar of cloud departed not from them by day .<a name=134:9></a>.<a name=134:10></a>.<a name=134:11></a> neither the pillar of fire by night".<a name=134:12></a> The faithfulness of God is wonderful.<a name=134:13></a> If God had been impatient He would have left them -- for they could have done the journey in only eleven days.<a name=134:14></a> But think of the patience of God operating so that those who were His elect might truly learn all the lessons experimentally -- during 40 years.<a name=134:15></a> Many died by the way, many fell out, but there were those who got the gain; we would like to be amongst those who get the gain, and to come to this last encampment.<a name=134:16></a> And so at the end of this record of the journey it says "and they encamped by the Jordan", verse 49.<a name=134:17></a> It again gives us the previous description, they "encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho" verse 48.<a name=134:18></a> But then it goes on to give a further description and says "they encamped by the Jordan,

		from Beth-jeshimoth unto Abel-Shittim, in the plains of Moab".<a name=135:1></a> Now the note indicates that Abel-Shittim means the plain of acacias.<a name=135:2></a> And by the time we come to this chapter, the people are viewed as having really reached that experimentally, the plain of <i>acacias</i>; they were in keeping with the acacia wood of which the tabernacle was made, and of which the ark was made.<a name=135:3></a> God's end had been reached so far as the wilderness was concerned.<a name=135:4></a> That is what I understand this to mean; that there was nothing in evidence but the acacia wood.<a name=135:5></a>

		Now, I believe that is what Paul has in mind in the last chapter of 2 Corinthians.<a name=135:6></a> He wants to bring the Corinthians to the last encampment of the wilderness; they have gone round that mountain long enough, and so he says "Examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; Prove your own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?<a name=135:7></a>" Now, dear brethren, do we recognise ourselves?<a name=135:8></a> May I ask, what you think about yourself?<a name=135:9></a> You say, well, I come from a good family, brought up in the meeting; I have a good education, I have got a good deal of ability.<a name=135:10></a> Well, it may take us a long time to recognise the kind of man we really are.<a name=135:11></a> What we may be boasting in does not count with God; He has overruled those things that we may have in His mercy and goodness; He has overruled your forbears and so on, but nothing we derive naturally from that source has any part in His system.<a name=135:12></a> The only ground for our having any part in His system is that Jesus Christ is in us.<a name=135:13></a> Have we discovered that yet?<a name=135:14></a> You see, if you have discovered that Jesus Christ is in you really, and therefore recognised yourself, you will say, 'Well, I cannot tolerate anything else.<a name=135:15></a> Everything except Jesus Christ in me springs from the flesh which has come under divine condemnation at the cross; and I cannot recognise that as myself, I must disown it, and not boast in it any more.<a name=135:16></a> <i>I disown it</i>'.<a name=135:17></a> So that at

		this last encampment we really come to a knowledge of ourselves according to God, to recognise ourselves as we really are according to God, that Jesus Christ is in us, and that is the only thing that matters.<a name=136:1></a> And it is because Jesus Christ is in us that we are part of this great system, like boards of the tabernacle.<a name=136:2></a> You could not have anything but acacia wood.<a name=136:3></a> You can see that if you bring anything else into the matter, you are spoiling your availability as a board of the tabernacle; the board of the tabernacle is just acacia wood and nothing else.<a name=136:4></a> And that is me.<a name=136:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>Paul says it is not I that do it; he would disown the other man completely.<a name=136:6></a> It is the sin that dwells in him.<a name=136:7></a> But Paul is very specific in Corinthians, because he had taught the word of God there with a view to setting them together tabernacle-wise, as we may say; and he wanted it to be a practical reality.<a name=136:8></a> So he ends with this challenge, which if answered to, would bring us I believe, to the last encampment, "Do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?<a name=136:9></a>" Mr.<a name=136:10></a> Stoney used to deprecate the idea even of being a good Christian man as the world speaks; you see, it attaches things to myself.<a name=136:11></a> To attach Christianity to myself to make anything of myself is one of the worst things.<a name=136:12></a> The point is Jesus Christ is in me.<a name=136:13></a> And if He is in me, and I rightly realise that, and recognise myself in that way, I cannot tolerate anything else.<a name=136:14></a> That is how we <i>arrive</i> I think at the plain of <i>acacias</i>.<a name=136:15></a> And he was wanting the Corinthians to arrive there, at this last encampment.<a name=136:16></a> He did not mind what they thought of him as long as they arrived there.<a name=136:17></a> He would rejoice even if he was thought a reprobate, he says "For we rejoice when we may be weak and ye may be powerful", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:9">2 Corinthians  13:9</a>.<a name=136:18></a> He did not mind what happened as long as the saints arrived at this last encampment.<a name=136:19></a> And of course if they arrived at that, there would be no need for him to use severity.<a name=136:20></a> The authority he had been given was for building up, not

		for overthrowing; and if they arrived at the last encampment all that would be needed would be building up.<a name=137:1></a> So he says "For the rest, brethren, Rejoice".<a name=137:2></a> These are the things that would mark the last encampment.<a name=137:3></a> Earlier he says, "But this also we pray for you, your perfecting", verse 9.<a name=137:4></a> And I think he has in mind this point that I am seeking to bring before us, this arriving at the last encampment; "your perfecting", from the standpoint of getting the gain of the wilderness and its lessons -- "your perfecting".<a name=137:5></a> And as I say, what characterises the position is joy, "Rejoice" he says, "be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.<a name=137:6></a> Salute one another with a holy kiss.<a name=137:7></a> All the saints salute you".<a name=137:8></a> And then these three great things I have referred to already that have come out earlier in Numbers, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ", the living and heavenly priest, "and the love of God", told out at the cross, but resident now in Christ Jesus our Lord; "and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all".<a name=137:9></a> What marks the last encampment is that those things are enjoyed without hindrance.<a name=137:10></a> We may touch them and come into them as they did typically in chapters 17, 20 and 21; but they had still got more to do, they had got to overthrow Sihon and Og, and they had got to face the Midianitish snare.<a name=137:11></a> But now the point is that all those things being faced, then these three things can be enjoyed without any hindrance; "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all".<a name=137:12></a> Well, you are in a wonderful position now.<a name=137:13></a> Just ready for the land, ready for the last trumpet, ready for Deuteronomy.<a name=137:14></a>

		He does not in that book view his not going into the land as the penalty on himself -- that is another side of it -- but he views it, typically, as the vicarious sufferings of Christ, Jehovah was angry with me on your account.<a name=138:1></a> That should touch all our hearts, beloved brethren, Jehovah being wroth, as we may say, speaking reverently, with Christ, not only to deliver us from Egypt, but because of all our rebellions in the wilderness.<a name=138:2></a> Jesus had to take them all up vicariously at the cross, the whole history of things was entered into there, prospectively.<a name=138:3></a> How it would humble us and touch our hearts as we think of the manifestations of the flesh in the various forms in the wilderness, and to think that Jehovah in that sense, has been wroth with Christ on our account.<a name=138:4></a> We can understand, in delivering us from Egypt, that He should have to bear the wrath; but why should He have had to bear wrath because of our naughtiness in the wilderness?<a name=138:5></a> That should touch our hearts very much.<a name=138:6></a> And it is at this last encampment that Moses can speak like that to the people.<a name=138:7></a> While we are still going on in naughty ways, we would not have any appreciation of that.<a name=138:8></a> You see, you come to a point at the end of 2 Corinthians in which, if they answered to what the apostle exhorted them, they would come to a greater appreciation of the vicarious sufferings of Christ because of the rebellion and state of things at Corinth.<a name=138:9></a> And so, if we think of church history, well, what a load has been His to bear!<a name=138:10></a> We are called upon to bear it in our spirits; to bear the iniquity of the priesthood and of the sanctuary, to carry it in our spirits.<a name=138:11></a> But Jesus bore it vicariously.<a name=138:12></a> But in Deuteronomy, you see, we could only take that in at the last encampment.<a name=138:13></a> The words of one who loved the people, Moses, laying bare his heart, not just communicating commands direct from God, but going over the ground as to what he had commanded.<a name=138:14></a> He had commanded what God commanded, but he speaks over and over
