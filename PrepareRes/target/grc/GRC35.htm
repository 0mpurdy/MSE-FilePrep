		That was the position typically in Haggai.<a name=4:2></a> A remnant had returned from captivity in Babylon and had begun to build, but the enemies had got to work, and the king had issued an order that the work was to stop.<a name=4:3></a> Historically it would appear that the king's order was the reason the work stopped.<a name=4:4></a> But the prophet tells us the real reason.<a name=4:5></a> The work stopped because the people became half-hearted in it, and a half-hearted worker is of no use to God.<a name=4:6></a> They began to consider their own things.<a name=4:7></a> It is remarkable that in Philippians, the most exalted epistle as to Christian conduct, where Paul speaks much of the work and those engaged in it, he says, "all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ".<a name=4:8></a> What a statement to make!<a name=4:9></a> And that was the state of the returned captives within a few years of their return.<a name=4:10></a> Have we got into that state?<a name=4:11></a> It is a terrible state for returned captives -- brands plucked from the burning, brought back from captivity in the pure mercy of God and recovered to His own thoughts.<a name=4:12></a> How base to use their release from captivity just to devote themselves to their own matters!<a name=4:13></a> There is a great system around us, which claims catholicity, and which exacts so much from its devotees that nations under its sway become poor.<a name=4:14></a> God has, in mercy, released us from that fearful domination.<a name=4:15></a> Men, too, are led captive by their lusts.<a name=4:16></a> How much they spend on lusts and pleasures from which we have been delivered!<a name=4:17></a> From all these captivities we have been set free.<a name=4:18></a> What then are we doing with our time and our money?<a name=4:19></a> Are we spending it just for our own
