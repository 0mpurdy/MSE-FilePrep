		G.R.<a name=1:2></a>C.<a name=1:3></a> I have in mind our work as builders, our business being in whatever manner it falls to us to do it, to build God's house.<a name=1:4></a> If the house is to be built, the foundation must first of all be laid.<a name=1:5></a> I think there is a danger of the language of the second verse coming into our mouths, and our being tempted to say, "The time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built".<a name=1:6></a> That is to say, we might feel that what marks the present time is scattering; and the enemy would suggest that now it is not possible to work out anything collective, thus leading us on to independent lines -- individually independent, and companywise independent of other companies -- and we may settle down to build our own houses.<a name=1:7></a> But the question is raised in verse 4, "Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses, while this house lieth waste?<a name=1:8></a>" That has its application to our own personal dwellings to which we may devote our minds; but I think it also has application to the possibility of our saying to ourselves, 'Well, as long as we can keep comfortable in our own little meeting, we won't bother about anything further afield.<a name=1:9></a> We will just be a little independent meeting, and remain neutral on issues of the truth; why should we let them concern us?<a name=1:10></a>' But when in Jerusalem the Lord said, in relation to the temple, "Your house is left unto you" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#13:35">Luke  13:35</a>).<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we go on independent lines we are treating the local meeting as our house and not as God's house, so that we want to make it more comfortable for ourselves, and to leave out anything which might disturb us.<a name=1:12></a> We are then not really considering for God,

		because God's house is not my meeting.<a name=2:1></a> God's house is spread over the earth, it is commensurate with the one body, there I am not in line with God's thoughts or the Lord's commandment if I limit my thoughts to my own locality.<a name=2:2></a> If I am simply thinking of making it comfortable for myself the Lord will say eventually, "your house".<a name=2:3></a> He will refuse to own it as His.<a name=2:4></a> So Haggai writes to encourage us to work.<a name=2:5></a> If God is to have any features of His house in broken days, or at any time really, it entails work and toil.<a name=2:6></a>

		Things had all gone wrong at Corinth on almost every point; <i>they</i> were wrong; God had not been considered.<a name=2:7></a> They were temple of God but they were not acting accordingly.<a name=2:8></a> So Paul exhorts them at the end to be "Firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil" -- it involves toil -- "is not in vain in the Lord".<a name=2:9></a> Is it worth toiling for God?<a name=2:10></a> Or is it better to sit down and make ourselves comfortable and leave Him out of our thoughts and practice?<a name=2:11></a> -- To just have little, comfortable times of fellowship on our own, and to think that so long as we enjoy things a little nothing else matters.<a name=2:12></a> Well that is not the divine thought and we shall not be blessed on that line.<a name=2:13></a> Even our own matters will not flourish.<a name=2:14></a>

		J.R.<a name=2:15></a>C.<a name=2:16></a> While the thought of individuality has been greatly re-emphasised in recent happenings, are you suggesting that although we may move accordingly we must never lose sight of the fact that what is individual has what is collective in view?<a name=2:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:18></a>C.<a name=2:19></a> That is right.<a name=2:20></a> It is of the utmost importance that in, and as a result of, the present crisis we should strengthen our individual links with the Lord, have even closer communion with Him, and that He should become everything to each one of us.<a name=2:21></a> But if so, the house of God will become our great concern.<a name=2:22></a> As the Lord said prophetically, "The zeal of thy house devours me".<a name=2:23></a> So it is no good speaking of our close

		G.R.<a name=8:14></a>C.<a name=8:15></a> Yes, the reference is to the bottom of the altar, in Exodus and Leviticus, so that <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#3:3">Ezra  3:3</a> seems to show that in a day of recovery foundations have to be looked to, and this is so whatever you are constructing; the first thing is the altar, and so it was at the beginning of the present recovery, that is, the idea was to separate from unsuited conditions so that the Lord's supper could be celebrated.<a name=8:16></a> That was the first idea, it was the idea of the altar, breaking bread and responding to the Lord and to God, because in sectarian conditions, though persons may come together to break bread they do not eat the Lord's supper, as Paul tells the Corinthians.<a name=8:17></a> Corinth was a fine and gifted meeting outwardly, but the apostle has to tell them that when they came together to eat, it was not the Lord's supper.<a name=8:18></a> And the moment we allow something out of accord with the foundation, we do not eat the Lord's supper, whatever we may claim about it.<a name=8:19></a> The Lord's supper is when the Lord is present.<a name=8:20></a> We can go on for some time perhaps and yet not realise that He is not present.<a name=8:21></a> The Corinthians might have thought He was present, but Paul says it was not the Lord's supper; He was not there; there were not the conditions, because they had divisions among them.<a name=8:22></a>
