		This passage, dear brethren, refers to a number of different activities; and while the person Timothy, to whom Paul writes, is addressed "O man of God", it seems to me that if we are to be truly preserved in the path pleasing to God, and consistent with the position into which God's grace has put us as belonging to His house, we need to engage ourselves in all these activities.<a name=66:1></a> And, moreover, it is well to consider that God would have us all, each in his or her measure, to be men of God.<a name=66:2></a> We read in the Old Testament of more than one "man of God" being alive at the same time; some are unnamed, simply called men of God; and I do not think there is anything in Scripture to suggest that God would have only one man of God at any one time.<a name=66:3></a> Paul, Peter and John, and others of the apostles, were all contemporary, as were others, such as Apollos.<a name=66:4></a> None of these is expressly termed "man of God" but that is what they were; and one thing that characterized them was that they were each distinctive.<a name=66:5></a> No one copied another or used the language of another.<a name=66:6></a> That is a feature of the work of God, which those who seek to serve ought to keep in mind.<a name=66:7></a> Paul says, "Be my imitators", but he adds, "even as I also am of Christ".<a name=66:8></a> While seeking to serve in our measure, it is not God's thought that we should be copyists.<a name=66:9></a> There are distinctions of gifts but the same Spirit.<a name=66:10></a>

		ministry given to John was another feature.<a name=68:1></a> The great matter undertaken by the Lord Jesus himself was the <i>declaration of God</i>.<a name=68:2></a> We do not go to Paul to learn about the declaration of God, or to Peter or to John.<a name=68:3></a> Only "the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>, and in whom all truth resides, could declare God.<a name=68:4></a> That declaration is complete and final and glorious in its uniqueness.<a name=68:5></a> If we were to say, 'Because Peter and John do not mention the body, I am not interested in it', well, we should seriously err.<a name=68:6></a> We have to go to Paul for the opening up of that wonderful disclosure; and if we were to say that because Peter and John and Paul do not refer to the great Name of God declared in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> therefore we take no notice of that, how foolish and ignorant we should be!<a name=68:7></a> In the Lord Himself was the full declaration of God.<a name=68:8></a> It is good to see how Scripture is framed in that way.<a name=68:9></a> We have gradually got far from it in our thoughts, and we need to get back to it.<a name=68:10></a> We were speaking this afternoon about making room for the Spirit even in directing all matters of the service, taking directions from Him and not setting up human organisation.<a name=68:11></a> So we need the help of the Spirit that whatever the Lord has given to anyone of us might become available to all, without involving our being challenged -- as has so often happened -- because it is not on precisely the same line as what somebody else is saying and with what they are saying at any particular time.<a name=68:12></a> "What is that to thee", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>, the Lord said.<a name=68:13></a> If it comes from the Spirit -- and the Spirit is sovereign -- it will fit according to God.<a name=68:14></a> If it comes from our natural minds, it will not.<a name=68:15></a> What the Spirit has distributed to each one will be found in practice,

		if we take heed to it, to fit in in perfect harmony and unity with what is given to others, and, further, to be indispensable, and we need to get the gain of it all if we are to grow up in the truth.<a name=69:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same principle applies to practical body services.<a name=69:2></a> We should, for instance, make room for brethren who have a special capacity for visiting.<a name=69:3></a> It speaks of those who give in simplicity, and those who show mercy with cheerfulness.<a name=69:4></a> Paul speaks in this chapter from which we have read, "Enjoin on those rich in the present age".<a name=69:5></a> Well, a person who is allowed to be rich in the present age, if it is in God's ordering, is in that way an enrichment of the Church.<a name=69:6></a> God very rarely entrusts to the same man spiritual wealth to minister and material wealth.<a name=69:7></a> But material wealth is part of the endowment or provision that God makes for His people.<a name=69:8></a> Not everyone is capable of being entrusted with material wealth, but those "rich in the present age" are to use their very means for the edifying of the body.<a name=69:9></a> It is put that way in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>"He that gives, in simplicity".<a name=69:10></a> There are some who have the capacity to give, God has put it under their hand, and they give in simplicity without attention to themselves, or seeking to gain influence, but soberly as entrusted by, and responsible to, God.<a name=69:11></a> So Paul here enjoins such "to be rich in good works, to be liberal in distributing, disposed to communicate of their substance".<a name=69:12></a> As members of the body we all have some function to fulfil.<a name=69:13></a> Another thing said in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>is "He that shews mercy with cheerfulness".<a name=69:14></a> You might think, well, that is surely a very ordinary sort of thing, to show mercy and do it cheerfully, but there are some specially capacitated for that.<a name=69:15></a> They have a distinctively suited way of

		expressing this in deed and manner and word; they are specially furnished and we should make full use of such, full use for the body of every kind of ability given in the body.<a name=70:1></a> We need to get back to these fundamental things, because it is in these fundamental matters that we find Christianity so wonderful and so living.<a name=70:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the activities in the chapter to which I am referring, they are of different kinds.<a name=70:3></a> Paul says after referring to certain injurious features, "But <i>thou</i>, O man of God, flee these things".<a name=70:4></a> The first activity is that you are <i>running away</i> as hard as you can, and you are always running away.<a name=70:5></a> Next, you are <i>pursuing</i> as hard as you can and doing that constantly.<a name=70:6></a> These things seem to be contradictory.<a name=70:7></a> Thirdly, you are <i>fighting</i> as hard as you can.<a name=70:8></a> The authorised version says, "Fight the good fight of faith".<a name=70:9></a> Fourthly, we are to <i>lay hold of eternal life</i> with all our might.<a name=70:10></a> 'Lay hold', as the note says, is the same as 'seize'; it is an energetic action.<a name=70:11></a> Finally we are solemnly enjoined to "keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=70:12></a> So we are to flee, to pursue, to fight, to lay hold, and to keep the commandment.<a name=70:13></a> We ought to try to keep these things in mind, because we are apt to forget them.<a name=70:14></a> For instance, when the test comes as to that from which we are to flee, maybe we fail to run away.<a name=70:15></a> And how much we fail in the positive things -- the pursuit -- the laying hold -- the fight; sometimes we may be cowardly and do not fight.<a name=70:16></a> All this really leads up to keeping the commandment spotless and irreproachable, and, finally, to worship.<a name=70:17></a> If we do not continue in these various enjoined activities we shall to some extent be hindered as worshippers, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		if we are energetically fulfilling them we shall be worshippers like Paul himself, who is prostrate in worship as he freely goes on to this further doxology, speaking of, "The blessed and only Ruler .<a name=71:1></a>.<a name=71:2></a>.<a name=71:3></a> the king of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship .<a name=71:4></a>.<a name=71:5></a>.<a name=71:6></a> To whom be honour and eternal might.<a name=71:7></a> Amen".<a name=71:8></a> He finishes the epistle in prostration of soul before God, in one of the most profound doxologies he utters.<a name=71:9></a> It is worth looking into all the doxologies of the New Testament, and all the cases where it speaks of those who glorified God.<a name=71:10></a> There are at least fourteen doxologies to God as God, and to God as Father there are about twenty.<a name=71:11></a> There are five or six to the Lord Jesus, and numerous instances of the glorifying of God.<a name=71:12></a> You may be surprised to find how rich the New Testament is, the gospels, the epistles, and the Revelation, with worship, but here is one of the most profound notes of worship in the whole of the Scriptures: "Who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see".<a name=71:13></a> And yet He has been fully declared, and we may know all that is open to us as creatures to know of our glorious Creator and God.<a name=71:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return to these needed activities, Paul has already spoken about the love of money being the root of every evil, and about many unwise and hurtful lusts.<a name=71:15></a> These are the things that govern men; they govern Christians, alas, for it speaks in verse 5 of the teaching which holds gain to be the end of piety, the teaching of men corrupted in mind and destitute of the truth -- they are professing Christians.<a name=71:16></a> Beloved brethren, how much all this has entered into the system we have left!<a name=71:17></a> Gain of <i>some</i> kind has been considered the end of piety; and especially now,

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		because strangely and sadly enough what has happened is that men we loved and esteemed and, who in days past really had the truth, now have sorrowfully to be described as corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth.<a name=72:1></a> Young people we know have turned for help to men whom we esteemed for long years, and who certainly once had the truth; but they have found that they are now destitute of it.<a name=72:2></a> This is exceedingly sad and solemn that once genuine Christians who had the truth have come under corrupt influence, and have become in result already corrupted in mind -- an awful thing -- and destitute of the truth.<a name=72:3></a> What have they got left?<a name=72:4></a> Well, only gain, and material gain gradually becomes a dominating and deceiving matter.<a name=72:5></a> "Holding gain to be the end of piety" -- the position in that system we have in love for Christ abandoned.<a name=72:6></a> We have through grace a position in the divine system; why should we hanker after one in any system of man or men?<a name=72:7></a> And so, with these motives, governing not only men in the world but professing Christians, what are we to do?<a name=72:8></a> Paul tells us, "But <i>thou</i>, O man of God, flee these things"; because every lust and unbridled desire that moves amongst men has an answer in each of our hearts, and the only thing to do when they present themselves -- whether it is love of money or place, or whatever it may be, anything but Christ -- the only thing to do is to run away.<a name=72:9></a> We are not to be bold, imagining we are strong enough to meet it.<a name=72:10></a> We have it in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>, "youthful lusts flee".<a name=72:11></a> That is not merely for youths.<a name=72:12></a> Youthful lusts pursue us as long as we are in flesh and blood conditions; we have to flee from them all our lives.<a name=72:13></a> "<i>Thou</i>, O man of God, flee these things".<a name=72:14></a> This may seem very negative but it is

		The next thing is -- pursue; so while running away from certain things, you are always trying to catch up with others.<a name=73:7></a> You could never say you have fully caught up with any of them.<a name=73:8></a> Who can say he is fully a righteous man -- that he has rendered and renders to all their dues in the sight of God -- to his family, his business people, the brethren and to God?<a name=73:9></a> Nevertheless we are pursuing righteousness, that is our earnest objective, "to fulfil all righteousness", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:15">Matthew  3:15</a>.<a name=73:10></a> Likewise, who could claim to be a fully pious man, bringing God into every detail of his life?<a name=73:11></a> But you are pursuing it, it is what you seek to do; you desire to walk with God in every detail of your life.<a name=73:12></a> You may perhaps fail every day in some particular, yet you get back to God and have things right with Him; you are pursuing piety.<a name=73:13></a> Then it says pursue faith -- faith is the complement of piety.<a name=73:14></a> Faith enters into God's things, and God's world, and God's thoughts; piety brings God into my things; and you cannot maintain one without the other.<a name=73:15></a> If you give up piety you will surely make shipwreck of faith.<a name=73:16></a> If you are not prepared to bring God into your own matters and walk before Him there, sooner or later you will give up faith, as to all

		practical application.<a name=74:1></a> Conscience enters into the matter of piety, and so it says, "maintaining faith and a good conscience, which last some, having put away, have made shipwreck as to faith", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:19">1 Timothy  1:19</a>.<a name=74:2></a> Giving up a good conscience means I cease to walk before God, under His eye alone, in the realm of piety, and, as sure as I do that, I shall make shipwreck as to faith.<a name=74:3></a> So we are to pursue and, while not able to claim that we have fully overtaken any of these things, we continue to stretch out to be here in full righteousness, full piety, full faith, then love.<a name=74:4></a> You cannot be righteous without love.<a name=74:5></a> "Love is the whole law", it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13">Romans  13</a>.<a name=74:6></a> A man who does not love and -- putting God first -- put others before himself is unrighteous, because righteousness in the full sense is that I act like God.<a name=74:7></a> Man's highest dignity was to be in the image of God -- to be what God made him, but we have all sinned and come short of that glory; we have failed to be in the true image of God.<a name=74:8></a> We are to be like God in every way, and God is love.<a name=74:9></a> Then, it says pursue endurance, because if you are not able to endure, you are not much good in the testimony.<a name=74:10></a> The shittim wood of the tabernacle was the wood of endurance, it was to bear the gold, so if you cannot endure, how can God put gold on you; how can He rely on you to represent Him if when tested you are apt to fail and perhaps show the flesh?<a name=74:11></a> So after the reference to endurance there is meekness of spirit.<a name=74:12></a> I cannot say much about these things, I am merely seeking to exhort myself with the brethren to maintain these two activities -- fleeing and pursuing.<a name=74:13></a> Running away so that we do not get caught and captured by the various lusts which hold men in bondage; and pursuing things which in their full sense are always beyond us; but

		Now the passage goes on to something different.<a name=75:2></a> You have to fight, otherwise you become a casualty.<a name=75:3></a> Do not think a Christian here can ever leave off fighting!<a name=75:4></a> We have to be warriors in the spirit of Jesus to the end of our days, because Christianity is now a battle.<a name=75:5></a> We are in a world whose god and prince is against Christ and us.<a name=75:6></a> Influences governing men are manipulated by the prince of the power of the air, the winds of doctrine and every other wind of influence, they are all against us, and Satan's objective is not only to hold men under his authority as god and prince, but to invade what is for Christ and to get in amongst Christians.<a name=75:7></a> In time of war sentry duty is a prime essential; hence the Lord repeatedly says, "Watch .<a name=75:8></a>.<a name=75:9></a>.<a name=75:10></a> What I say unto you I say unto all, watch"; and Paul too, that wise and devoted warrior.<a name=75:11></a> If an army does not maintain sentry duty it leaves itself exposed and would soon be overthrown; so the first duty for each of us as soldiers, is to be on sentry duty night and day, to guard the base, and the essential base to be guarded is our own hearts.<a name=75:12></a> "Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:23">Proverbs  4:23</a>.<a name=75:13></a> So you maintain sentry duty, to ensure, first, that no rival to Christ shall ever enter your heart.<a name=75:14></a> Satan will use anything to displace Christ.<a name=75:15></a> We have been tested as to this.<a name=75:16></a> We have had lots of meetings, and many mercies and favours, but when the test came we found that Christ was either the last, or nearly the last in our affections.<a name=75:17></a> So very many things were discovered to be actually more to us than Christ -- the position, our place, our prominence, or

		reputation, money or service, whatever it may be, big meetings, excitement, and, as so often, our social links amongst the brethren were all more to us than Christ when we came to analyse things.<a name=76:1></a> We have to get back to the fact that Christ alone has supreme right to our hearts.<a name=76:2></a> By faith He is to dwell there, unrivalled, and so controlling the whole of our lives.<a name=76:3></a> But if He is to have that place, we have unremittingly to keep on sentry duty, and if we maintain that in our own hearts, there may be some way in which God will use us in a wider way as a sentry.<a name=76:4></a> We read of shepherds watching their flock by night; there is that kind of sentry duty too, but if we are not keeping our own hearts with all diligence we shall not be any good at keeping the saints.<a name=76:5></a> That is what the Lord had in mind in certain of His injunctions; while Paul too, before reminding the elders of Ephesus how he himself watched there for three years night and day with tears, enjoins them, "Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>.<a name=76:6></a>

		But then, the whole duty of a soldier does not relate to himself, "Strive earnestly in the good conflict of the faith".<a name=76:7></a> We have to be vigilant lest anything should come in not in keeping with the faith.<a name=76:8></a> Of a truth, things have flooded in, and are still flooding in, that are not in accord with the faith; well, where are the soldiers in view of meeting this position?<a name=76:9></a> Our sentry duty collectively has been lacking.<a name=76:10></a> Things have got in, as Jude says, "certain men have got in unnoticed"; but if the sentries were all on duty, they would not thus get a footing unawares.<a name=76:11></a> But if they get in, they have to be met, and the faith so precious is a big thing to fight for, it is the whole system of Christian teaching and doctrine.<a name=76:12></a> Beset by foes it can

		be attacked on many fronts simultaneously.<a name=77:1></a> In this world of which Satan is the god and prince, the truth and those who contend for it are surrounded all the time like a beleaguered city, with a keen and skilful enemy looking for any opportunity to make inroads; and very vigilant sentry duty is needed.<a name=77:2></a> Paul shows us in this epistle the character of the initial attacks.<a name=77:3></a> "The Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith".<a name=77:4></a> You might say, 'Whatever does that mean?<a name=77:5></a> Maybe that they are openly going to give up the truth of the atonement, or the deity of Christ'.<a name=77:6></a> The sentries would, however, be alert to that, if somebody came and, for instance, denied the deity of Christ.<a name=77:7></a> But as we read on it says, "Giving their mind to deceiving spirits" -- that is the enemy that is all around us, spiritual powers of wickedness in the heavenlies, the universal lords of this darkness and their armies are around about us, and they get hold of men who give their minds -- they may not realise it -- to dominating influences, to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.<a name=77:8></a> You say, 'teachings of demons, that must be terrible teachings, something very debased even in the eyes of men'.<a name=77:9></a> But it does not say that; what it does say is, "speaking lies in hypocrisy, cauterised as to their own conscience, forbidding to marry, bidding to abstain from meats".<a name=77:10></a> Many religious-minded people would say, 'Well, what devotion!<a name=77:11></a> Think of people loving the Lord so much that they give up marriage'.<a name=77:12></a> Well, some might do so, and some might rightly give up marriage for the Lord's sake.<a name=77:13></a> But the law teachers -- who have become thus so easily, to get power over their brethren -- finding a few devoted souls prepared to give up marriage for the Lord's sake, say, 'You
