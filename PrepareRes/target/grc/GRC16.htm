		I desire to speak this evening, dear brethren, upon the subject of assembly foundations and assembly privilege; the section of Matthew, from which I have read, is education in view of the assembly.<a name=1:1></a> Not that the assembly was yet formed, but the education is in view of what now exists; and it is of great importance because it is the Lord's own instruction.<a name=1:2></a> <i>He</i> has taken matters in hand in order to instruct us as to assembly foundations and assembly privilege.<a name=1:3></a> The passages read form a kind of centre to the section, which begins with chapter 13 verse 53, and ends at the close of chapter 18.<a name=1:4></a> Some may have noticed that the gospel of Matthew is divided into sections, each fresh section being indicated by the words, "when Jesus had finished" certain things.<a name=1:5></a> (See chapters 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1).<a name=1:6></a> Chapter 13 verse 53 reads "When Jesus had finished these parables".<a name=1:7></a> From that point we have the assembly section until the close of chapter 18.<a name=1:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 16 we have what I have referred to as assembly foundations -- first, the <i>spiritual</i> foundation "on this rock I will build my assembly"; (verse 18) and then, in the latter part of the chapter, the <i>moral</i> foundation, because, if the assembly was to be set up here, the moral foundation had to be laid <i>in the death of Christ</i>, and if we are to enjoy our part in the assembly, that moral foundation must be made good in our souls.<a name=1:9></a> It means that we must accept the truth of the cross.<a name=1:10></a> As these foundations are understood, the way is open for assembly privilege as indicated in chapter 17 where the Lord takes with Him Peter,

	<div class="paragraph">
		One delights in chapter 16 because of the joy it must have been to the heart of Christ -- what a joyful moment in His pathway here, speaking reverently, when for the first time He was able to say "My assembly" -- to speak of that upon which His heart was set -- the primary object for which He had come and for which He was serving.<a name=2:3></a> Peter's confession enabled Him to say that!<a name=2:4></a> He says "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ".<a name=2:5></a> I want you to notice the emphatic pronouns as shewn in Mr.<a name=2:6></a> Darby's translation.<a name=2:7></a> Peter says "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=2:8></a> I believe the emphatic pronoun there means that it was said in the spirit of worship: this glorious Person filled Peter's vision.<a name=2:9></a> It was not a cold, formal statement of the truth but it burst forth from Peter's heart in the spirit of worship, as if to say 'No-one can compare with You!<a name=2:10></a> You are beyond compare!<a name=2:11></a>' The Lord had been saying "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=2:12></a>".<a name=2:13></a> They had been linking Him up with worthy men; some said Elias, some Jeremias or one of the prophets, -- that is the background of Peter's confession.<a name=2:14></a> The Lord says, "But <i>ye</i>, who do ye say that I am?<a name=2:15></a>" and Peter says, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ"!<a name=2:16></a> Who was Elias or Jeremias compared with <i>the Christ</i>?<a name=2:17></a> They fade right out of the picture, and rightly so, when we are in the presence of the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=2:18></a> No-one else was that, nor could be, and here is a soul telling Him so, and worshipping.<a name=2:19></a> There is no doubt that Peter was a worshipper at that moment.<a name=2:20></a> I believe it indicates that <i>we</i> should approach assembly matters in the spirit of worship towards Christ.<a name=2:21></a> I believe we should approach the Supper in this way for at the Supper we are engaged with Christ Himself.<a name=2:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then think of the joy in the Lord's heart as He replies, "<i>I</i> also, I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter".<a name=3:1></a> I think the pronoun "thou" is emphasised to bring out the joy with which the Lord said it.<a name=3:2></a> What it meant to Him that here was assembly material coming to light!<a name=3:3></a> As we are in the spirit of worship towards Christ, He is free to tell us what we are to Him, without fear of our being self-occupied or lifted up.<a name=3:4></a> Peter was in the spirit of worship towards Christ, and the Lord says "<i>Thou</i> art Peter".<a name=3:5></a> The Lord loves to do this at the Supper.<a name=3:6></a> As we are in the spirit of worship He is free to tell us what we are to Him, -- what His assembly is to Him.<a name=3:7></a> He delights to do so.<a name=3:8></a> Then He goes on triumphantly to say, "on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=3:9></a> I think we can enter a little into the joy that was in the heart of Christ at this time -- what a sense of victory, because the spiritual foundation of the assembly had come to light.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to say a word about the spiritual foundation.<a name=3:11></a> It was in Peter's confession that it came to light.<a name=3:12></a> The Lord says to him, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=3:13></a> That is, the <i>Father</i> had revealed to Peter that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=3:14></a> The confession proved what had gone on in Peter's soul, and the Lord says, "on this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=3:15></a> So that the rock, the spiritual foundation of the assembly, is the apprehension in the souls of the saints, by the Father's revelation, that the Lord Jesus is "the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=3:16></a> Peter is a sample man; while, no doubt, the revelation in his case was special, we are all to be brought into it.<a name=3:17></a> I would like to raise the question now as to whether we <i>have</i> been brought into it, because there can be no doubt the Father would bring us into it if we are ready to receive it.<a name=3:18></a> Prior to this the Lord had been extricating and freeing them from religious systems;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		exposing all they had revered, until He brings them to this place in the region of Caesarea Philippi, on the very confines of Palestine, far north of the Sea of Galilee, in the neighbourhood of Lebanon, where the religious man was not in evidence.<a name=4:1></a> He did not bring them to Jerusalem, but outside and free from all that men revered and held great religiously, that was the place where He became the subject of the Father's revelation to Peter.<a name=4:2></a> Surely to-day if the Lord brings a people out in separation, it is in order that, as freed from what is around, they may be able to take in this wonderful revelation of what Christ is to God.<a name=4:3></a> I believe that is what bowed Peter's soul in worship, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=4:4></a> It is a question of apprehending <i>what Christ is to God</i> as the centre of His counsels.<a name=4:5></a> If you realise that, you will understand that it can only be by revelation of the Father.<a name=4:6></a> Who can tell us what Christ is to God except the Father?<a name=4:7></a> The revelation did not relate to previous experience.<a name=4:8></a> Many christians have experienced <i>what Christ can be to them</i> in meeting their need, healing them and bringing them forgiveness: we can all understand that.<a name=4:9></a> But the spiritual foundation of the assembly lies in apprehending <i>what Christ is to God</i>, not what He is, or has done for us, great though that is.<a name=4:10></a> It is a great thing to know that the Son of God has come to us in our need (see chapter 14:33), -- but it is an entirely different thing to apprehend the Christ, the Son of the living God, as the centre of God's counsels and thoughts.<a name=4:11></a> Not until we understand that can we really understand the assembly; it is the spiritual foundation of the assembly in our souls.<a name=4:12></a> Christ coming to our side to meet our need does not necessitate the assembly; nor Christ as the promised One coming to Israel.<a name=4:13></a> Then in what setting does the assembly become a necessity?<a name=4:14></a> In relation to Christ as the centre of the counsels of God.<a name=4:15></a> God says of Adam, typifying
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ as Head and Centre of God's world, "It is not good that Man should be alone", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>.<a name=5:1></a> Nor would the scene have been complete for God if Adam had been alone; the woman was a necessity to complete the scene.<a name=5:2></a> As we apprehend Christ as the centre of the counsels of God, the truth of the assembly begins to dawn upon our souls.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord at this stage begins to speak of "My assembly"; the only time He uses that expression.<a name=5:4></a> He used it because, with this light in his soul, Peter was now able to take in the thought of "My assembly".<a name=5:5></a> In making his confession Peter had a large view of Christ's glory, of what He was to God; not only as connected with Israel, for the Lord says, "Who do men say that I the <i>Son of man</i> am?<a name=5:6></a>".<a name=5:7></a> The whole setting is away from Israel, in Caesarea Philippi, shewing that Christ in His glory as the Man of God's counsels is before Peter's eye; the Father had revealed it to him.<a name=5:8></a> If we think of these two titles, the Christ, and the Son of the living God, speaking reverently, how the Lord Jesus needs the assembly in both of these characters.<a name=5:9></a> The Christ refers to His glorious Manhood and is a characteristic title of Ephesians.<a name=5:10></a> We are justified in reading Ephesian truth into this, for there is no doubt that later Peter became an Ephesian man.<a name=5:11></a> It was not given to him to tell out Ephesian truth, but no doubt when Peter received the Spirit and had come fully into the power of all this, he appreciated Paul's ministry.<a name=5:12></a> As we understand that Jesus is the Christ, we see the need for the assembly, for He is "head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a> - 23.<a name=5:13></a> We understand the place which the assembly has in the divine system as with Him in the headship -- His "helpmate, His like" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>): this surely lays the foundation in our souls for assembly formation.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other title, "Son of the living God" means that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter apprehended that God was the living God and Jesus was His Son.<a name=6:1></a> In that character also the Lord Jesus needs the assembly in view of the service Godward.<a name=6:2></a> As Son He considers for God perfectly, and so the assembly is called "the assembly of the living God", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=6:3></a> The assembly is to correspond with Him as Son of the living God, associated with Him in service, praise and worship to God.<a name=6:4></a> So the Lord says, "hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=6:5></a> In Israel Christ's portion is denied and the praises of God have ceased; but praises will never fail in the assembly.<a name=6:6></a> Hades is the place of <i>silence</i> and the enemy would silence the praise in the assembly if he could but the Lord says, "Hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=6:7></a> God is served and praised in this vessel.<a name=6:8></a> So we have first what the assembly is to Christ, and then what the assembly is to God as associated with Christ, maintaining in priestly service all that is due to God's name.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we can see therefore, that assembly formation must be based on this two-fold apprehension of the glory of Christ in the souls of the saints.<a name=6:10></a> The building goes on, on this foundation.<a name=6:11></a> The Lord used Paul specially, but the building still goes on, "I will build my assembly".<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then immediately the Lord passes to the moral foundation: "From that time", note those words!<a name=6:13></a> The Lord had not spoken of the cross before that time, but the truth of the assembly having come to light it says "From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he must.<a name=6:14></a>.<a name=6:15></a>.<a name=6:16></a> suffer".<a name=6:17></a> Another foundation had to be laid, the moral foundation where the question of good and evil was settled at the cross of Christ.<a name=6:18></a> So He begins to speak of His sufferings.<a name=6:19></a> Peter shrinks from this moral side -- and in this he is still a sample man.<a name=6:20></a> Who of us have not shrunk from it?<a name=6:21></a> Have we not enjoyed spiritual things on

		the Lord's day and been tested on Monday morning?<a name=7:1></a> So Peter says, "God be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee", verse 23.<a name=7:2></a> Peter would compromise; but, dear brethren, if the Lord Jesus had compromised the whole position would have been lost.<a name=7:3></a> The assembly is a spiritual structure, but it had to be secured on moral grounds.<a name=7:4></a> At the cross there could be no compromise.<a name=7:5></a> How natural it is to us to compromise!<a name=7:6></a> You may say, I do not seem to touch the spiritual side much, I wish I touched it more.<a name=7:7></a> I would raise this question: has compromise been allowed in connection with the moral side?<a name=7:8></a> Here we read, "Then Jesus said to his disciples, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me", verse 24.<a name=7:9></a> These verses are often used in the gospel, and rightly so, but let us see them first in their own setting.<a name=7:10></a> It says, "Then Jesus said <i>to his disciples</i>".<a name=7:11></a> This is a word for christians; in fact it is a word for those who have the light of the assembly.<a name=7:12></a> I would not speak to you in this way if I were addressing christians not in separation, who had not the light of the assembly, for it is "From that time" Jesus began to say these things.<a name=7:13></a> How far have we accepted the moral foundation of "Jesus Christ and <i>him</i> crucified"?<a name=7:14></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>.<a name=7:15></a> Paul laid that foundation at Corinth.<a name=7:16></a> The assembly as set up, is a responsible vessel here.<a name=7:17></a> If we want assembly prosperity and joy down here, and freedom to move on to the spiritual side, we must accept this moral side.<a name=7:18></a> Paul determined not to know anything among the Corinthians "save Jesus Christ and <i>him</i> crucified", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>.<a name=7:19></a> He laid the foundation at Corinth, "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:11">1 Corinthians  3:11</a>.<a name=7:20></a> The cross shut out every other man, Jesus Christ is the only Man to be allowed in our local responsible setting.<a name=7:21></a> The word of the cross will shut out every other man <i>there</i>.<a name=7:22></a> We are apt to forget that the teaching of the cross is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it": he will find his life in the assembly of the living God; the only place where true life is.<a name=8:2></a> You may have the light of it, but if you are to find it, it must be on this principle.<a name=8:3></a> I speak to myself as well as to the brethren, I do feel we need to take home the challenge to our hearts, as to whether we are really prepared to lose our lives as far as this world is concerned.<a name=8:4></a> Why is it that we have not more assembly joy, more wholeheartedness in spiritual things?<a name=8:5></a> This is the secret, we cannot have both worlds.<a name=8:6></a> "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself"; it means that we disown that man entirely, "and take up his cross and follow me".<a name=8:7></a> One wonders whether one has really got a cross, for it says, "his cross".<a name=8:8></a> We know how the Lord got His cross: the world gave it to Him because of His faithfulness.<a name=8:9></a> Are we true enough to Christ to get a cross?<a name=8:10></a> To be regarded by men generally as fit only for the scaffold?<a name=8:11></a> and to take that up gladly at the hands of the world?<a name=8:12></a> If we took up that side of things more, allowing the truth of the cross its place in our minds and hearts, how fully we should find our life in the assembly!<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord in chapter 16 makes that remarkable appeal, "For what does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul".<a name=8:14></a> Again I say it is right to use that in the gospel, but I am using it tonight in the setting in which it is given, shewing the danger of a christian losing his soul or life -- not eternally, of course, but as far as the present enjoyment of his place in the assembly is concerned.<a name=8:15></a> Would gaining the whole world be worth losing the enjoyment of even one good morning meeting?<a name=8:16></a> We have to weigh things up.<a name=8:17></a> Peter speaks of soul salvation in his epistle as a present thing, "receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I just say a word as to this matter of assembly privilege.<a name=9:6></a> Following this teaching the Lord "takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart".<a name=9:7></a> Not that the disciples were in the gain of the experience at the time, but we can view it from the standpoint that they are now free for entering into what <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>brings before us, God's sovereign choice and our place with Christ on high.<a name=9:8></a> The Lord chose three, but Ephesians indicates that all who form the assembly were chosen in Him before the world's foundation, and are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>,4.<a name=9:9></a> The "high mountain apart" would refer to present enjoyment of our blessing in the heavenlies.<a name=9:10></a> As the previous instruction is accepted, we are set free, as those chosen in Christ, to go up to this elevated place, there to see Jesus <i>as He is</i>.<a name=9:11></a> If there is one thing we need, it is to see Jesus as He is.<a name=9:12></a> He was transfigured before them.<a name=9:13></a> They saw anticipatively a glorified Christ.<a name=9:14></a> He is actually glorified now and we need more acquaintance with Jesus as He is.<a name=9:15></a> Inside the tabernacle all the furniture spoke of Christ as He is.<a name=9:16></a> We are much more familiar with Christ as He was, as in the brazen altar: the altar and the offerings upon it bring before us Christ as He was.<a name=9:17></a> But in the sanctuary itself what occupies the heart is Christ as He is, -- the Ark, the mercy seat, the golden altar, the pure table, the candlestick, -- all referring to Christ as He is.<a name=9:18></a> The disciples are

		privileged to get a vision of this: "His face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light", verse 2.<a name=10:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage shews that education still proceeds even in circumstances of assembly privilege.<a name=10:2></a> Peter says, "let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elias".<a name=10:3></a> He put the Lord first: he speaks in a subject spirit "If thou wilt", but "While he was still speaking" the Father takes up their education.<a name=10:4></a> It is beautiful to think of the Father's word here, He had revealed to Peter who Christ is.<a name=10:5></a> Now as these three men are brought into these glorious surroundings, the Father takes up the matter of their education, "While he was still speaking".<a name=10:6></a> The Father is not waiting for Peter to finish.<a name=10:7></a> It was necessary that he should make his remarks in order to learn his lesson, but "A bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud saying <i>This</i> is my beloved Son".<a name=10:8></a> The emphatic pronoun is again used, suggesting here the feelings of the <i>Father's</i> heart.<a name=10:9></a> It is not enough to put Christ first.<a name=10:10></a> The Father would have us to understand that Christ is everything and in all, the One who fills all in all.<a name=10:11></a> What would Moses have thought if in his day you suggested making a tabernacle for him as well as the Ark, one for the Ark and one for Moses.<a name=10:12></a> He would have shrunk from it with horror.<a name=10:13></a> There is only one Ark and there could be only one tabernacle; the Father teaches these three men that great truth.<a name=10:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cloud that filled the tabernacle overshadows them now -- there is only one tabernacle, one sanctuary, "the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched, and not man".<a name=10:15></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:2">Hebrews  8:2</a>.<a name=10:16></a> The tabernacle in the full sense is a picture of the universe where Christ fills all in all.<a name=10:17></a> This is necessary education for assembly privilege.<a name=10:18></a> As Christ gets this place in our hearts we can enter into the conscious enjoyment of union with Him as "the fulness of him who fills all in all", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:23">Ephesians  1:23</a>.<a name=10:19></a>

		I wish to say a word, dear brethren, as to the death of Christ being the basis of everything which God has established in grace, and particularly for the basis of His dwelling-place, as the Lord Jesus says by the Spirit in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>"Thou art holy, Thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel".<a name=12:1></a> We would ever be affected when we think of the precious death of Christ, particularly as typified in the sin offering; not that I am confining my thought entirely to that, for there was usually a combination of offerings.<a name=12:2></a> For instance, at the consecration of the priests there was the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the ram of consecration; and all typified the one death of Christ.<a name=12:3></a> "For by one offering He has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:14">Hebrews  10:14</a>.<a name=12:4></a> But as we think of His death as the sin offering we cannot but be profoundly affected because of what it cost Him and what it cost God.<a name=12:5></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, "God, having sent His <i>own Son</i> in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin".<a name=12:6></a> Think of what it cost God to lay the foundation in the death of His Son; we cannot measure what it meant for Divine love to take such a course; yet it is on that account Divine glory and love have come into display.<a name=12:7></a>

		What is mainly in my mind tonight, dear brethren, is the thought that a true remnant is always marked by the features proper to the whole.<a name=22:1></a> If it fails to be marked by the features proper to the whole it is no longer a true remnant.<a name=22:2></a> In saying this I am not wanting to lead anyone to assume that <i>we</i> are a remnant.<a name=22:3></a> We need to be <i>free from all assumption</i>.<a name=22:4></a> The moment we begin to assume anything we are on very unsafe ground, but we would much desire that there might be a true remnant, and I think we can be assured that God will see to it that there <i>is</i> a remnant; not comprising perhaps all those who profess to be in the right place, but a remnant that He can take account of.<a name=22:5></a> The Lord spoke of a remnant in Thyatira -- "the rest who are in Thyatira", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:24">Revelation  2:24</a>), those who had not known the depths of Satan.<a name=22:6></a> There were also a few in Sardis who had not defiled their garments, (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:4">Revelation  3:4</a>).<a name=22:7></a> Philadelphia, as a whole, was marked by <i>a remnant state</i>, yet in all these cases, even after speaking of a true remnant state in Philadelphia, the Lord addressed the overcomer, showing that remnant conditions can only be maintained in the spirit of overcoming.<a name=22:8></a> No one can claim to be an overcomer until he has finished the course, and then it will be for the Lord to give His estimate of it.<a name=22:9></a> The conflict goes on to the end -- the fight of faith, which will never cease while we are here, and everything depends upon overcoming.<a name=22:10></a> The Lord Himself is the great Overcomer.<a name=22:11></a> He overcame in all things and the appeal

		If there are to be those marked by features proper to the whole we must apprehend these features, and in that connection I would say how important it is to get Divine conceptions as to the truth.<a name=23:2></a> We do not arrive at the truth by looking round on what is here on earth but by getting Divine conceptions from God Himself as to His own thoughts, so that we can clothe the saints with His thoughts; and God is ready to give us these conceptions and especially to the young people.<a name=23:3></a> What marks the christian dispensation is that the young men see visions, and the sons and the daughters prophesy (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:17">Acts  2:17</a>).<a name=23:4></a> It is normal to see things as God sees them, to be let into Divine thoughts and secrets.<a name=23:5></a> John stresses it in his ministry.<a name=23:6></a> The Lord is asked "Where abidest Thou?<a name=23:7></a>" and His answer is "Come and <i>see</i>", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:38">John  1:38</a>,39), and so in Revelation John <i>sees</i> things.<a name=23:8></a> He saw a new heaven and a new earth.<a name=23:9></a> They are not yet existing but he got the conception.<a name=23:10></a> He saw the new Jerusalem, and God would give all of us visions like that, to see things as He sees them.<a name=23:11></a> The church is not actually complete, but He would give us to look at things from His point of view.<a name=23:12></a> It is most important in this day.<a name=23:13></a> You cannot speak about things properly until you have seen them.<a name=23:14></a> The Lord says -- "We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:11">John  3:11</a>.<a name=23:15></a> It is open to christians to see things in their measure.<a name=23:16></a> John saw things and God wants us to see things.<a name=23:17></a> He would help the young men and women to see things.<a name=23:18></a> Vision is needed if we are to go forward.<a name=23:19></a> Caleb and Joshua went and saw things for themselves and were preserved in movement.<a name=23:20></a> I would say to any young brother or sister, God wants you to be a seer.<a name=23:21></a> You must be a seer before you can be a prophet.<a name=23:22></a> There

		In our first scripture it says -- "Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God".<a name=24:13></a> It raises the question as to how much we can say about it.<a name=24:14></a> Have we a conception of this great city of God?<a name=24:15></a> A Londoner, wherever he went on earth, would not be slow to speak about the city of his birth, and God would have us to be like that, to be able to speak of the glorious things of the city of God.<a name=24:16></a> For us, of course, that is the assembly.<a name=24:17></a> What can we say about the assembly?<a name=24:18></a> All of us can say something about Christ, and it would be a sad thing if we could not.<a name=24:19></a> We want to say more and more about Christ, but there is also this point as to how much we can say about the assembly.<a name=24:20></a> Have we grasped Divine thoughts as to this great city, the city of God?<a name=24:21></a> There is no other city to which this title applies so fully as it does to the assembly.<a name=24:22></a>

		It has often been said that we are between the two glories.<a name=25:6></a> Haggai says -- "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former glory", <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:9">Haggai  2:9</a>.<a name=25:7></a> The book of Revelation brings before us the latter glory, the glory of the church complete.<a name=25:8></a> We thus have the light of the latter glory and we can also look back to Pentecost and can see the former glory.<a name=25:9></a> We have the light of both shining upon us and it is for us to take on features proper to this great vessel; and I suppose our first touch with the assembly is in the character of mother.<a name=25:10></a> The mother side of the assembly would particularly link on with our beginnings and our growth.<a name=25:11></a> The Apostle brings it in -- "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:26">Galatians  4:26</a>.<a name=25:12></a> The Apostle did not give way to the law teachers.<a name=25:13></a> He brings in the thought of Jerusalem above which is free, which is our mother.<a name=25:14></a>

		This Psalm contrasts those who are born in the city of God with those who are born in the world's cities, and I would like to say in this connection that we should all be true products of the gospel, free and untrammelled by human religion of any kind or of the features of men and women of this world.<a name=25:15></a> So it says -- "I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there", verse 4.<a name=25:16></a> God is drawing attention to these places, but to contrast them with those who are born in Zion.<a name=25:17></a> A city gives character to those who are born in it.<a name=25:18></a> Rahab is Egypt and we see plenty of 'Egyptians' around us.<a name=25:19></a> Egypt boasts in God's resources as its

		I want to touch briefly on Galatians in this connection.<a name=26:10></a> To be born in a city makes a man a citizen of that city, and it is because Jerusalem above is our mother that we belong to the assembly, but how much maternal exercises are needed if we are to be marked by assembly features.<a name=26:11></a> You may say -- 'What would mark a citizen of God's city?<a name=26:12></a>'.<a name=26:13></a> I think it would be that Christ is formed in the citizen.<a name=26:14></a> The assembly is our mother and she would not tolerate anything that is not of Christ.<a name=26:15></a> Paul speaks of Christ being formed in the Galatians.<a name=26:16></a> One has often said, and I think it is true, that the Epistle to the Galatians is the language of an <i>outraged mother</i>, a mother who feared that damage would come to her children.<a name=26:17></a> Paul speaks strongly of those who would damage his children, and if there is one thing which will damage the saints and hinder their being marked by their true character as citizens of Zion, it is legal principles -- the Jerusalem that now is.<a name=26:18></a> When Paul wrote he referred to Jerusalem the actual city, but at the present time the Jerusalem that now is, is established in Christendom.<a name=26:19></a> Naturally we love the bondwoman and her son, but we have to learn that they are to have no place at all.<a name=26:20></a> We belong to a great free city, where all are sons of God, as the Apostle says -- "For ye are all God's sons by faith

		G.R.<a name=67:1></a>C.<a name=67:2></a> We have before us in these readings the truth of the assembly as presented in five of Paul's epistles, showing the constructive line on which he worked.<a name=67:3></a> We commenced with Thessalonians because that is fundamental.<a name=67:4></a> He writes to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=67:5></a> That is to say, while he had the assembly before him, he based matters upon the family.<a name=67:6></a> The assembly of the Thessalonians suggests the personnel who form the assembly, and he calls them Thessalonians.<a name=67:7></a> We noticed that at times, when he was governed by deep feelings, he addressed the saints in that way, namely as Thessalonians, Corinthians, Galatians and Philippians.<a name=67:8></a> His love went out for them as viewed thus in their local settings.<a name=67:9></a> They were like the treasure, which, when a man found, he hid.<a name=67:10></a> And so, while they were Thessalonians, their life was not in the city; they were in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; and yet it is from that setting that the testimony sounded out.<a name=67:11></a> Their life was hidden, but <i>they</i> were not hidden.<a name=67:12></a> The word of the Lord <i>sounded out</i> from them, because it is a warmth of love amongst the saints as the family of God, which attracts souls, and which forms the basis of the gospel testimony.<a name=67:13></a> It is upon that basis Paul would rear, as it were, the assembly structure, and he writes to the Corinthians as the assembly of God in Corinth.<a name=67:14></a>.<a name=67:15></a>.<a name=67:16></a> In that epistle he does not refer to the word of the Lord sounding out from them, he presents the assembly of God as the very shrine of God in Corinth, and it is a question

		of people <i>coming in</i> -- if a simple person or unbeliever enter in, they find that God is there.<a name=68:1></a> And that led us to dwell on the great sin that marked the brethren at Corinth, the sin of independency; and what a dreadful sin that is, because whether those who practise it realise it or not, it is a direct attack upon the assembly of God.<a name=68:2></a> It would destroy any expression of God's assembly in a place.<a name=68:3></a> And so he exhorts them to say the same thing and to be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.<a name=68:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians supposes that the truth of Thessalonians and Corinthians is known.<a name=68:5></a> Paul addresses the saints as the holy and faithful brethren in Christ which are in Colosse.<a name=68:6></a> That implies that the family links of Thessalonians are known and held in holiness and faithfulness on the true level, in Christ, which shuts out all natural family influences, and social influences.<a name=68:7></a> Then in chapter 2:5, he says "for if indeed in the flesh I am absent, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ".<a name=68:8></a> That verse shows that they were in the gain of Corinthians.<a name=68:9></a> The order proper to the assembly of God was maintained in Colosse, and the apostle rejoiced in it.<a name=68:10></a> And so he now brings in a further step in his constructive work, namely, the truth as to the Head.<a name=68:11></a> He refers to the body, the assembly, as though that truth was well known to them; but he says of Christ, "<i>He</i> is the Head of the body, the assembly".<a name=68:12></a> He does not need to pause to tell them what the body is, as he does to the Corinthians, but he speaks of <i>the Head</i>, and our relations with the Head.<a name=68:13></a> We thought, in our first reading, of our relations with one another; that is basic.<a name=68:14></a> Then in the second reading, the need of sensitive relations with the Spirit, Who manifests Himself through the members of the body, and distributes as He pleases.<a name=68:15></a> But those matters being settled, we are ready for introduction to the Head.<a name=68:16></a> After elaborating upon His greatness, he says, "<i>He</i> is the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Head of the body, the assembly".<a name=69:1></a> And so this epistle brings in what is mysterious.<a name=69:2></a> The idea of the shrine of God in a place was not mysterious.<a name=69:3></a> People were accustomed to heathen shrines.<a name=69:4></a> The idea of manifestations of the Spirit was not something that would appear strange, because they were used to demon manifestations; now there were manifestations of the Spirit of God.<a name=69:5></a> Those things would be readily understood by souls who received the gospel.<a name=69:6></a> But when we come to the idea of Christ as Head, we come to what is mysterious.<a name=69:7></a> He says "to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you" (or among you) "the hope of glory".<a name=69:8></a> The general thought in Corinthians is that <i>God</i> is among you.<a name=69:9></a> It is the same preposition here, Christ in you, or among you, the hope of glory.<a name=69:10></a> Those who are in the gain of Thessalonians and Corinthians provide a sphere where <i>Christ</i> can be known as among us in the wealth and greatness of His Headship.<a name=69:11></a>

		which is unclean and an abomination in the sight of God.<a name=86:1></a> And I think we should pay attention to Mr.<a name=86:2></a> G's remark that the attack in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:8">Colossians  2:8</a> is an attack on the truth of the Godhead; it is an attack on Christ, but relative to the truth of the Godhead.<a name=86:3></a> Human philosophy would endeavour to define the Godhead, and wherever that happens, it leads to limiting Christ in some way.<a name=86:4></a> The danger recently has been to limit Christ to the place He has taken as Man on our side -- not in doctrine; persons may hold right doctrine as to His Person and yet, in their thoughts and responses, limit Him to what He is in grace as Man on our side.<a name=86:5></a> So it says here "for in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" -- which gives us an idea of the glory which attaches to the position of "Christ in (or among) you" -- "and ye are complete in him".<a name=86:6></a> Now we cannot define that, but it is "<i>all</i> the fulness".<a name=86:7></a> It shows that we <i>cannot</i> put limitations upon the Person of Christ, because <i>all</i> the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily.<a name=86:8></a> Again, in chapter 1 it says that he is the "image of the invisible God".<a name=86:9></a> Philosophy would lead men to make a graven image.<a name=86:10></a> A philosopher may reject the idea of a material idol, but his <i>mind</i> fashions, as it were, a graven image, as though his mind could compass God, as though he could define God, which cannot be.<a name=86:11></a> And so, "holding fast the head" involves that we hold the truth as to Christ's Person, that He is the image of the invisible God, and that in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=86:12></a> If we are not holding those truths in an affectionate way in our souls, we are not holding fast the Head.<a name=86:13></a> And then the accompanying attack which springs from the same thing, is against true response to God, (chapter 2:18) "Doing his own will in humility and worship of angels".<a name=86:14></a> We would not think of anyone known to us bringing in the worship of angels, but it is around us in christendom, where there is the attempt to

		define Godhead in creeds on the one hand, and the bringing in of innovations into the worship of God on the other.<a name=87:1></a> Those are the two ways in which the attack develops.<a name=87:2></a> And preservation in both respects lies in holding fast the Head as presented in this epistle.<a name=87:3></a> I thought it was right to make those few remarks because we know we have all suffered from these attacks, and we <i>each</i> have to watch lest we become serviceable to the enemy.<a name=87:4></a>

		G.R.<a name=105:1></a>C.<a name=105:2></a> We have had the assembly before us as introduced by Paul in his epistles, seeking to pursue a constructive line.<a name=105:3></a> Yesterday afternoon we were speaking of it as presented in Ephesians, that is, according to God's eternal purpose.<a name=105:4></a> Paul begged Timothy to remain in Ephesus according to <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:3">1 Timothy  1:3</a>, so that the instruction of this epistle was intended for the saints at Ephesus as complementary truth, and it was to be conveyed to them affectionately through his true child in the faith.<a name=105:5></a> It presents the assembly in a remarkable way, as the house of God, the assembly of the living God, and the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=105:6></a> It is viewed down here amongst men in testimony.<a name=105:7></a> Ephesians views it according to God's eternal purpose, which, of course, as we saw in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, includes present assembly service.<a name=105:8></a> But in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, those who are looking on are said to be the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies.<a name=105:9></a> But Timothy presents the assembly down here under the eye of men and of angels, but specially under the eye of men in testimony, with a view to men being saved and coming to the knowledge (it might read, the full knowledge) of the truth.<a name=105:10></a> If men are to be saved, they need to know the Saviour God Who is dwelling in His house, and if they are to come to a full knowledge of the truth they need to come into touch with the assembly as the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=105:11></a> The truth that is treasured and maintained in the assembly is that "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom

		The epistle therefore develops the behaviour suited to those who form God's house and the level of administration proper to the living God's assembly.<a name=106:3></a> Instruction as to behaviour begins with prayer (chapter 2:1) but chapter 5 deals with the level of administration in the assembly of the living God; and whether it is in the administration of the saints' bounty to widows and elders, or whether it is in dealing with evil, it is to be carried out as before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, and is to be done without prejudice or favour.<a name=106:4></a> The final word to Timothy is that he should keep the commandment spotless and irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=106:5></a> That is, the truth is to be carried through inviolate, and our conduct maintained in conformity with the truth, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=106:6></a> And a remarkable thing is that the heart of the apostle rises and bursts out in doxologies on the highest level.<a name=106:7></a> No doubt his heart was specially free, because he was writing to his true child in the faith in an Ephesian setting.<a name=106:8></a> Therefore I believe his notes of worship in this epistle disclose the depths of his soul more than any others.<a name=106:9></a>

		I desire, dear brethren, to say a word on the trustworthiness of the assembly.<a name=138:1></a> In considering such a subject we have, of course, to take an abstract view of the assembly; but I hope such a view will stimulate our desires to be marked by the feature of trustworthiness proper to the assembly.<a name=138:2></a> Each of the passages we have read in the Old Testament bring the assembly before us, in type, in its wifely character.<a name=138:3></a> In the first case, Isaac led Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent, and, it says, he took her and she became his wife and he loved her and he was comforted after his mother's death.<a name=138:4></a> I think the reference to Sarah's tent indicates that the Lord relies upon the assembly to carry through, in spiritual power, every feature of the testimony that was once committed to Israel, and to carry it through with heavenly lustre -- to carry it through on a level to which Israel could never rise.<a name=138:5></a> In Samuel, Abigail comes forward as marked by discernment; she had discernment to meet the crisis in such a way that David's name was not dishonoured.<a name=138:6></a> It says, David sent ten young men to greet Nabal <i>in his name</i>, and his name and Jehovah's name would have been dishonoured had not Abigail come forward to meet the situation.<a name=138:7></a> David says, "Blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou".<a name=138:8></a> I think the chapter brings before us the trustworthiness of the assembly in that respect.<a name=138:9></a> The Lord counts upon the assembly to be trustworthy in meeting conditions of crisis by the exercise of true discernment, and in doing what is required to maintain the glory of His Name.<a name=138:10></a> Then

		in Proverbs, both the wifely and motherly features come into evidence in connection with the virtuous woman; and it says, "The heart of her husband confideth in her".<a name=139:1></a> It is evidently a matter of trustworthiness particularly in regard to the household.<a name=139:2></a> It is a very important matter that the household should be cared for, so that, in the ultimate issue, her children rise up and call her blessed.<a name=139:3></a> Surely the Lord counts upon the assembly to fill out that role, so that there should be children who rise up and call the assembly blessed as having proved the maternal care that is found in it.<a name=139:4></a> I read the passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>because it shows that the trustworthiness of the assembly is on account of the material of which it is composed and the rock upon which it is built.<a name=139:5></a> ".<a name=139:6></a>.<a name=139:7></a>.<a name=139:8></a> Thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly and hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=139:9></a> We should be exercised to be characteristically that kind of material, because if we are not true 'Peters', that is, true living stones, we shall not be reliable in the settings to which I have already referred.<a name=139:10></a>

		Now in connection with Rebekah, the secret underlying her fitness for the position in Sarah's tent was the service of Abraham's servant, who is a type of the Spirit; and the fact that room was made for him and his service.<a name=139:11></a> One would raise the exercise with us, dear brethren, as to how far we make way for the Spirit's service in our local gatherings.<a name=139:12></a> We would all desire that the Rebekah character should mark the local companies, and I think it helps to see that this type peculiarly fits in with local settings, because Rebekah is a type of the assembly at the present time.<a name=139:13></a> Eve, as a type, includes the church as a whole -- the church complete; but Rebekah applies to the present time, as Paul says to the Corinthians, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>.<a name=139:14></a> The provisional position in Sarah's tent has to be filled out now.<a name=139:15></a> It will not apply when we

		What is the secret behind the feature of assembly trustworthiness seen in Abigail?<a name=143:10></a> I think it is that we learn individually to judge ourselves; learning in the secret of our own soul history with God what good and evil is.<a name=143:11></a> The truth of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>is involved in this.<a name=143:12></a> Abigail was Nabal's wife and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>brings out the truth of having had one husband and now being to Another.<a name=143:13></a> We all have to learn, if we are to be of any value in this respect, what Paul says, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:18">Romans  7:18</a>.<a name=143:14></a> We are linked closely with the flesh; in one sense it is <i>me</i> -- "I know that in <i>me</i>, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell".<a name=143:15></a> Paul came to a thorough judgment of good and evil in himself.<a name=143:16></a> That is why Paul could be relied upon to have a sound judgment in assembly matters.<a name=143:17></a> In such matters, it is not only a question of discerning evil.<a name=143:18></a> We are apt to think that to discern evil and talk about it is spirituality.<a name=143:19></a> But the test lies in discerning the good which will overcome the evil, the way to meet the situation in keeping with the character of the dispensation.<a name=143:20></a> That is how Paul met the situation in Corinth.<a name=143:21></a> Think of the food he brought in, glad to spend and be spent for them, and the discernment with which he handled every matter that was troubling them.<a name=143:22></a> And so you see Abigail had come to a definite judgment of Nabal.<a name=143:23></a> "Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly
