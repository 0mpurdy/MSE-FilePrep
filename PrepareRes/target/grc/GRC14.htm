		I wish to speak, dear brethren, on the subject of spiritual vision, first as bearing on the glory of Christ and the revelation of God and His purposes; secondly, as bearing upon the state of the church and our state at the present time; and thirdly, as bearing upon the public ways and dealings of God, this last being connected with the beasts or living creatures who were full of eyes, before and behind, around and within.<a name=1:1></a> I need not say that the matter of spiritual vision is a very important one; without it there can be no spiritual history at all for, if we are to have a spiritual history, we must have our eyes opened to see the Son of God.<a name=1:2></a> John as a writer makes a great deal of spiritual vision.<a name=1:3></a> In chapter 1 he says, "we <i>beheld</i> his glory", and the Lord Himself says to the two disciples of John, "Come and <i>see</i>", and to Nicodemus, "except any one be born anew he cannot <i>see</i> the kingdom of God".<a name=1:4></a> Again, the woman in chapter 4 says, "Come <i>see</i> a man".<a name=1:5></a> All these statements emphasise the necessity of vision.<a name=1:6></a>

		Chapter 9 records this great sign wrought by the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:7></a> Each sign is great in its place, but this is a remarkable one for the Lord speaks of the <i>works of God</i> being manifest in the man; and He also says, "<i>I</i> must work the works of him that sent me while it is day".<a name=1:8></a> So that in connection with the man born blind, He stresses His own works and the works of God.<a name=1:9></a> You will notice the initiative is entirely from His own side.<a name=1:10></a> It says, "as Jesus passed by, <i>he</i> saw a man which was blind from his birth".<a name=1:11></a> Then further down it says, "when he had thus spoken, he spat on

		the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay".<a name=2:1></a> As long as He was in the world He was the light of the world, and He would open this man's eyes in order that he might see the light of day in Himself, and He operates from His own side.<a name=2:2></a> This is the way of divine operations.<a name=2:3></a> Everyone here who has spiritual vision is a monument of the works of God -- they are manifest in him, and also of the works of Christ, who still works, though it may be through His servants here.<a name=2:4></a> He is no longer in the world but He is in a greater place; the Lord Jesus is now in the place given to Him in purpose; as Man He has reached that place.<a name=2:5></a> The full light shines and the full truth is expressed in His Person where He is, so that it is an even greater matter today to have our eyes opened than when the Lord was here.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This incident is to teach us, that we are all <i>born</i> blind.<a name=2:7></a> Our state by nature is such that we have no power to see anything spiritually at all, and that state has to be met if we are ever to have vision.<a name=2:8></a> Two operations are involved: firstly, the Lord Jesus makes the clay and anoints the man's eyes; then He tells the man to go and wash in the pool of Siloam, and he goes and washes and comes seeing.<a name=2:9></a> These two operations have to take place.<a name=2:10></a> In figure, the Lord Jesus applies the truth of His Person to the man's eyes -- that is His side of the matter; but then the man would never have seen if he had not washed, because it is <i>our state</i> that renders us <i>blind</i>.<a name=2:11></a> Unless we are prepared to go and wash, that is, to own our need of and accept the gospel, we shall never see.<a name=2:12></a> The clay on the man's eyes would make the man more blind, if that were possible, but in washing he came seeing.<a name=2:13></a> In this sign the Lord Jesus illustrates the truth of the previous chapter where He was faced with self-righteous men who would not admit the need of washing, and, though blind, claimed that they could see.<a name=2:14></a> In His

		ministry to them He emphasised the need of washing, going so far as to say that they were children of the devil.<a name=3:1></a> They had proved themselves so because murder was in their hearts towards Him.<a name=3:2></a> The Lord did not call people "children of the devil" until they came out in the devil's likeness; they had murder in their hearts towards Him, so He tells them plainly, "ye are of your father the devil .<a name=3:3></a>.<a name=3:4></a>.<a name=3:5></a> he was a murderer from the beginning".<a name=3:6></a> He would bring home to them that the essential thing was to wash, to cleanse themselves from that generation, for the whole state of man is wrong.<a name=3:7></a> Then at the end of the chapter He applies, in principle, the clay to their eyes, for He says, "Before Abraham was I am".<a name=3:8></a> He brings before them the truth of His Person, the great truth of the incarnation, and it is <i>this</i> that the clay represents.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is a man born blind, representative of us all, and the Lord, it says, spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle -- referring to His Deity but as coming into Manhood.<a name=3:10></a> It is a wonderful symbol.<a name=3:11></a> The spittle speaks of His Essence -- His essential Deity -- for He is God over all, blessed forever!<a name=3:12></a> -- and yet He has "come in flesh", as symbolised in His making clay of the spittle.<a name=3:13></a> The clay therefore represents the wonderful character of His Manhood, a unique Manhood of a new order.<a name=3:14></a> That is the kind of ministry which the Lord presented to His enemies in John's gospel!<a name=3:15></a> "Before Abraham was I am", chapter 8, and "I and my Father are one", referring to Himself here in manhood, chapter 10.<a name=3:16></a> He puts the highest truth before them.<a name=3:17></a> It is an example for us today.<a name=3:18></a> We should not hesitate to put the highest truth before men, the truth of the Lord's Person, His Deity and the unique character of His Manhood.<a name=3:19></a> Let us present it to men, because if they will go and wash they will see.<a name=3:20></a> Sight is given to this man to enable him to see the Lord Jesus.<a name=3:21></a> It is one thing to have the greatness of His Person presented in ministry, but it

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is another thing to see <i>Himself</i>.<a name=4:1></a> There is a process to go through until the wonderful moment comes when he is in the presence of the Son of God, and the Lord says, "thou hast both <i>seen</i> him and he it is that speaketh with thee".<a name=4:2></a> His eyes had been opened in view of the great moment when he actually saw the Son of God for himself.<a name=4:3></a> "And he said, Lord I believe, and worshipped him".<a name=4:4></a> This is what we might call normal spiritual vision.<a name=4:5></a> Our eyes are opened to see the Lord Jesus, as appreciating the greatness of His Person.<a name=4:6></a> It is a wonderful thing to apprehend in any measure the greatness of His Person, His essential Deity, yet His perfect and unique Manhood.<a name=4:7></a> That is what makes a person unshakable in this world: "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=4:8></a>" You apprehend who the Person is.<a name=4:9></a> The title Son of God, as applied to Christ, implies that One possessed of absolute Deity has come into Manhood as a Man of a new order, Jesus the Son of God!<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this book shows that from this point the believer's vision develops, for the Lord Jesus says, in chapter 14, "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father".<a name=4:11></a> You have had your eyes opened to see the Son of God, but it is with a view to your seeing the Father.<a name=4:12></a> That is a wonderful thing!<a name=4:13></a> Philip says, "Shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us".<a name=4:14></a> I wonder if we have all seen the Father!<a name=4:15></a> Our eyes have been opened in order that we might see the Father in the Son.<a name=4:16></a> "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father".<a name=4:17></a> It is a distinct apprehension in the soul of the Father revealed in the Son; the Father is a distinct Person.<a name=4:18></a> It is one thing to apprehend the Person of Christ and His greatness as the Son, it is another matter to apprehend the Father, though He is revealed in the Son; and the Lord says, "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father, and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?<a name=4:19></a>" It is a wonderful thing that God has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		given us spiritual sight that we might see the Father!<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in that chapter the Lord seems to indicate, by implication, that we see the Spirit, because lower down it says, "whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him".<a name=5:2></a> Of course, the Spirit is not incarnate; one would not suggest that we can see the Spirit personally, but I judge the Lord has in mind that we learn to recognise His movements and to discern the manifestations of the Spirit.<a name=5:3></a> The Spirit is here as Comforter taking charge of God's family, and we have been given spiritual sight in order that we might discern and become acquainted with His movements as abiding with and in the saints.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord goes on to speak of seeing Him in resurrection.<a name=5:5></a> "The world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live".<a name=5:6></a> It is a wonderful thing to see the Lord risen, triumphant over death.<a name=5:7></a> It means that we have life in Him: "because I live ye also shall live".<a name=5:8></a> Finally He speaks of vision in His prayer to His Father in chapter 17, saying, "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may <i>behold</i> my glory, which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".<a name=5:9></a> What a wonderful climax that is!<a name=5:10></a> Our eyes have been opened in order that, as with Him where He is, we may behold His glory; that we might arrive at a full appreciation of Christ as He is and where He is.<a name=5:11></a> That, of course, involves apprehending our own place <i>with</i> Him; He is ever unique, but how blessed that we have a place <i>with</i> Him!<a name=5:12></a> This links up with what the apostle speaks of in Ephesians, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of "the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe".<a name=5:13></a> We have the eyes of our hearts en-

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		lightened to see all these things.<a name=6:1></a> So that vision in John's gospel is normal spiritual vision and has normal development in view in the apprehension of the Father and the Son and the place the saints have in relation to divine Persons; and you can understand that it will result in formation.<a name=6:2></a> We shall be formed in spiritual manhood and affection.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>.<a name=6:4></a> The Lord says there, "I counsel thee to buy of me", and He counsels us to buy three things, the third being "eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see".<a name=6:5></a> I do not think that this suggests a normal condition such as we have had before us up till now.<a name=6:6></a> The suggestion seems to be that eyesight has become defective so that eye-salve is needed -- something to heal and to put matters right.<a name=6:7></a> It does not speak here of the Lord doing it for us, although we are to get the eye-salve from Him.<a name=6:8></a> We are to do the anointing, "anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see".<a name=6:9></a> I feel that this is a word for us at the present time, because while we have been helped greatly on the line to which I have been referring, it seems to me we have suffered from defective vision in regard to a sober view of ourselves and the present state of Christendom.<a name=6:10></a> So the Lord here speaks of what implies exercise, that we are to <i>buy</i> of Him eye-salve.<a name=6:11></a> I suggest that it needs exercise to get it, so that the eyesight might be put right.<a name=6:12></a> I think our experiences in the last few years have indicated that our outlook upon ourselves, as part of the responsible profession, and our outlook upon the profession generally, has hardly been in accord with the Lord's own outlook, so that we have been taken by surprise by many things which the Lord has allowed.<a name=6:13></a> It may be that the Lord would raise an exercise with us as to getting our sight thoroughly adjusted.<a name=6:14></a> We have had adjustment; we have been adjusted in many ways, but one would raise the question as to whether the adjustment has been
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sufficiently thorough, whether we are <i>thoroughly</i> adjusted in this matter.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What caused the blindness in Laodicea was self-satisfaction and complacency.<a name=7:2></a> The Lord describes their state, they were saying, "I am rich, and increased with goods and have need of nothing".<a name=7:3></a> That was not <i>His</i> outlook upon them, it was their outlook upon themselves.<a name=7:4></a> The Lord says, You do not know what you are really like -- they were blind in that sense, they had never seen themselves aright.<a name=7:5></a> "Thou .<a name=7:6></a>.<a name=7:7></a>.<a name=7:8></a> knowest not that thou art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked".<a name=7:9></a> The passage seems to indicate that what will cause blindness in the sense in which we are speaking is self-satisfaction and complacency.<a name=7:10></a> We are all liable to be coloured by the outlook of the part of the world in which we live, and complacency has been the outlook of the Anglo-Saxon world in their own affairs -- rich and increased with goods and needing nothing -- and it has almost brought them to ruin.<a name=7:11></a> The question is as to whether, in measure, we have been coloured by that outlook in <i>our</i> affairs, as those who have had much to be thankful for in the way of ministry and light, for the ministry and the light and many privileges of the past few years have been great.<a name=7:12></a> I am not in any way desiring to impute a Laodicean state, but to point out the danger and touch upon the principles involved -- the tendency to be satisfied with what we have in the way of light, and perhaps to attach it to ourselves, assuming that it has been formed in us in a far greater measure than it has.<a name=7:13></a> Coupled with this is the danger of connecting our blessings with earth, because we enjoy them here on earth, whereas our blessings are heavenly and our outlook needs to be heavenly.<a name=7:14></a> Any measure of <i>self-satisfaction or earthly mindedness will cause defective vision</i>.<a name=7:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There has been surprise that the war should come while we are still here, surprise that the brethren

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		should suffer in their homes and in their bodies.<a name=8:1></a> But why were we surprised?<a name=8:2></a> We all feel now that the outlook we had was not a right one, and would suggest that the Lord would help us to go into the matter thoroughly with Him so as to be really adjusted.<a name=8:3></a> Not to accept adjustment in a grudging kind of way, coming to it slowly by force of circumstances, but that we should get into His presence in order to learn the underlying principles which caused the blindness, so that with sight restored we might see things as He sees them, for that is what is in view in this address to Laodicea.<a name=8:4></a> The Lord desires to bring us into intimacy with Himself; friendship is in mind -- "as many as I love" -- "love" there is the love of friendship.<a name=8:5></a> He wants us wholly in His confidence, and sharing His outlook.<a name=8:6></a> "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent".<a name=8:7></a> We need <i>zeal</i> in repenting, not a grudging repentance and admission.<a name=8:8></a> You say you do not think we need repentance?<a name=8:9></a> If we do not need repentance we are putting ourselves either in Smyrna or Philadelphia, the only two churches where the Lord does not call for repentance; and if we put ourselves in Philadelphia we are very much in danger of Laodicea.<a name=8:10></a> We need to be in continual repentance and to be zealous in it.<a name=8:11></a> We need adjustment of vision to discern our own state and the state of Christendom, and to discern the Lord's active judicial dealings in Christendom which are going on all the time.<a name=8:12></a> We are not living in a kind of gap when the Lord is inactive in this regard.<a name=8:13></a> There is a tendency to relegate some things to the past and to put other things off to the future.<a name=8:14></a> But the Lord's dealings with Jezebel and those who commit fornication with her are going on all the time.<a name=8:15></a> Similarly His dealings with Protestantism, as to which He says, "I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I shall come upon thee".<a name=8:16></a> Well, He says to Laodicea, "As many
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as I love I rebuke and discipline".<a name=9:1></a> These movements are going on <i>now</i>; the Lord is doing these things now.<a name=9:2></a> To suggest that no upheavals will come while we are here, is to suggest that the Lord is <i>not</i> doing these things.<a name=9:3></a> But the Lord <i>is</i> doing these things all the time, and surely <i>we</i> need the discipline as well as others, perhaps more than others, because we have more light.<a name=9:4></a> How we need to be with the Lord in these matters!<a name=9:5></a> He desires friendship, true friendship and confidence.<a name=9:6></a> Certain things were tending to blind us, but the Lord would bring us into closest intimacy with Himself, "I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me", suggests a meal where all secrets are shared.<a name=9:7></a> What a wonderful end the Lord has in view as we accept adjustment!<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to chapter 4, and here it is a question of being, as to outlook, in accord with the throne and with God in His public dealings.<a name=9:9></a> I am assuming now that we are clear in our outlook as to our own state and the state of Christendom -- clear, too, that our blessings are heavenly, so that we are not surprised at discipline on earth.<a name=9:10></a> As adjusted and at rest on our side we are at leisure now to share the outlook of the throne, to be with God as to His public dealings.<a name=9:11></a> So we have here in the midst of the throne and around the throne four living creatures full of eyes, "before and behind".<a name=9:12></a> Lower down, in verse 8, it also says that "round and within they are full of eyes".<a name=9:13></a> The elders and the living creatures both refer to the saints; no doubt others are included as well as the saints of the assembly, but they certainly include those who form the assembly.<a name=9:14></a> These things are not simply written to tell us that at some future time we shall be in accord with the throne, but are intended to have a present bearing upon us, so that we may be in accord with it now, surrounding the throne now in mind and affection, and so with God in what He is doing.<a name=9:15></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, referring to the

		work of God, says that we are already raised up together and made to sit down together in heavenly places; it is regarded as a present thing.<a name=10:1></a> So God would have us in spirit already with Him, able to see things as He sees them, and to be with Him in what He is doing.<a name=10:2></a> This is brought out in a remarkable way in these living creatures, <i>full</i> of eyes before and behind, round and within.<a name=10:3></a> One would desire to be something like that -- to be full of eyes in regard to God and His ways and His movements.<a name=10:4></a> "Before and behind", that is, there is the forward look and there is the backward look.<a name=10:5></a> In both there is <i>full</i> discernment as to God's ways.<a name=10:6></a> Their note of worship is "Lord God Almighty, who was" -- that would refer to the backward look, we can look back upon the ways of God.<a name=10:7></a> God intends the saints of this dispensation to be fully intelligent in regard to His ways in past dispensations.<a name=10:8></a> "And who is to come" -- that is like the forward look.<a name=10:9></a> Surely God has in mind too, that we should be intelligent, full of discernment, as to all that God has before Him, all that lies ahead.<a name=10:10></a> Then it says, "round and within" they were full of eyes.<a name=10:11></a> One would link that with the God "who is".<a name=10:12></a> God ever <i>is</i>, and if we are to walk before the God who is we need to be full of eyes round and within.<a name=10:13></a> All those principles which we discern in God's ways in the past and in the future are to be brought to bear on the present and are to be judged in our own souls.<a name=10:14></a> We are to be full of eyes <i>within</i> as walking before God, and also to have a present judgment before God as to all that is <i>around</i>.<a name=10:15></a> This book develops the way the elders and living creatures are with God in all that is happening; they are linked together, and I think one can see that they must be linked together, because unless we have this discernment, how can we gain experience?<a name=10:16></a> The elders are those who have experience and worship God as the result of experience; so that both the elders and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the living creatures represent the saints.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book shows that the elders and living creatures are able to worship God, as entering into His ways and thoughts, as Ruler, Creator, Redeemer and Judge.<a name=11:2></a> As regards God in each of these characters they are worshippers.<a name=11:3></a> One feels, dear brethren, that the Lord would help us to have a greater appreciation of God as Paul speaks of Him, "the blessed and only <i>Ruler</i>".<a name=11:4></a> That is how Paul regarded God; to Paul there was only one Ruler and He was blessed!<a name=11:5></a> He looked beyond the immediate instruments -- there was <i>one</i> Ruler.<a name=11:6></a> It would help us in our outlook on the general state of affairs at the present time, God's public dealings, if we see <i>Him</i> as the blessed and only Ruler.<a name=11:7></a> He is blessed in what He allows and in what He orders.<a name=11:8></a> Whatever happens we trace it back to Him.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then these eyes, this discernment, would help us to value Him as <i>Creator</i>.<a name=11:10></a> We find in this chapter the elders are profoundly affected by God as Creator; they fall down before the throne, they are prostrate, they do homage to Him who lives for ever and ever, and they say, "Thou art worthy .<a name=11:11></a>.<a name=11:12></a>.<a name=11:13></a> to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou hast created all things".<a name=11:14></a> You see, having this kind of spiritual vision will make us worshippers of God, not only as the blessed and only Ruler, but also as Creator.<a name=11:15></a> It involves the forward and backward look, taking us right back to original creation and right on to the new creation.<a name=11:16></a> The physical creation is the great framework in which His purposes are carried out.<a name=11:17></a> He has not left His creation to function, as it were, by itself, but He sustains it and operates in it continually.<a name=11:18></a> "In him we live and move and have our being".<a name=11:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we are worshippers of Him as <i>Redeemer</i>, and we discern that all His ways have in view the securing of His rights in redemption.<a name=11:20></a> If He permits upheavals in His over-ruling government of this world, one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, the most extensive note of worship in this book is in chapter 19, and is addressed to God as <i>Judge</i>, the word being "true and righteous are his judgments", and the living creatures and elders fall down and worship.<a name=12:4></a> God would have us as worshippers of Him in that character.<a name=12:5></a> We need to be <i>full</i> of eyes to be with God in His judgments, to be so with Him in His judgments, so fully on His side, that we are worshippers of Him as Judge.<a name=12:6></a> We have come "to God the Judge of all", Hebrews says.<a name=12:7></a> That is what marks a true elder, that he is thoroughly with God in His judgments; he is a worshipper of God as Judge; but how can that come about unless we are full of eyes, before and behind, round and within?<a name=12:8></a> Dear brethren, that is what will qualify us, it is a necessity to qualify us as worshippers of God in these four aspects which I have mentioned: as Sovereign Ruler, as Creator, as Redeemer and as Judge.<a name=12:9></a> We need to be "full of eyes" to discern His outlook on things, His judgments and His ways.<a name=12:10></a>

		It is thought that we might get help so as to be more clear as to the fundamental place the sin-offering has relative to the economy of God which is in faith, and also to the service that is proper to the saints as brought into the economy; so that, while, except for the fat, etc.<a name=13:1></a>, it was not offered on the altar, yet the service at the altar was based upon it.<a name=13:2></a>

		If we are to be free in the economy, and free according to God in our relations with one another and with God Himself, it will depend a good deal on our apprehension of this truth.<a name=13:3></a> The divine thought is that we should so understand the truth in relation to the sin-offering that we can move freely in the economy without being occupied actively with it.<a name=13:4></a> The fact that it is foundational is seen in that the <i>blood of the sin-offering was poured out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering</i> -- I do not know that that is true of any other offering -- and the altar of burnt offering is the place of the public service of God.<a name=13:5></a> The blood was also put on the horns of the altar of incense; finally, it was sprinkled on the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat.<a name=13:6></a> So that in whatever phase of the service we are engaged, whether it be what corresponds with the altar of burnt-offering or the altar of incense, or whether we come into the immediate presence of God as typified in the cloud on the mercy seat, this truth is foundational; our presence in such surroundings depends on it.<a name=13:7></a> At the same time one feels that it should be so known in the soul that

		we do not need to be actively engaged with it, but it is there as a foundation which sets us free in the economy.<a name=14:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The economy of God stands related to <i>thoughts that are outside the sin question</i>; therefore we do not normally bring references to the sin-offering into the service.<a name=14:2></a> In that connection it helps us to see where the sin-offering was burnt.<a name=14:3></a> The sin-offering, as it says in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4">Leviticus  4</a>, was burnt <i>outside</i> the camp; it was not burnt on the altar, nor in the court, nor even in the camp, but outside the camp, which in itself is a dreadful consideration when we think of what it typifies.<a name=14:4></a> It was not burnt on the altar of burnt offering.<a name=14:5></a> All that went up from the altar of burnt offering was of sweet odour -- for the service of God is connected with what is sweet -- and the fire on that altar hardly speaks of judgment; the word for "burn" in relation to the altar of burnt offering means "to cause to ascend".<a name=14:6></a> The fat that covered the inwards of the sin-offering, and the kidneys, and the net above the liver, were put on the altar of burnt-offering and went up as a sweet odour as part of the service; but the atoning sufferings of Christ are represented in the burning of the body of the animal outside the camp, and in that connection the word for "burn" means <i>to consume utterly</i>.<a name=14:7></a> So it is manifestly wrong to attempt to burn that on the altar of burnt-offering; the sin-offering was never burnt there, but was consumed to ashes outside the camp, conveying the idea of the unsparing judgment of God against sin that Christ bore.<a name=14:8></a> Christ has glorified God in His nature and His attributes in the work of atonement.<a name=14:9></a> The claims of His throne as a righteous and holy God had to be met, and the sin-offering has met them.<a name=14:10></a> On <i>that basis</i>, the economy of God comes into view; that is, God known as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; and the purposes of divine love, which moved God to come out and declare Himself in that way, are made known.<a name=14:11></a> They really have no relation in

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>links with the golden altar.<a name=15:3></a> He speaks to the Father about matters of purpose, but He does so, speaking typically, on the basis of the blood being put on the horns of the altar of incense; so He opens His prayer by saying, "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have completed the work that thou gavest me that I should do it".<a name=15:4></a> The viewpoint there seems to be the way in which He has, speaking reverently, <i>set God free</i> to come out in the economy in which we know Him, and to declare His purposes; whereas the epistle to the Hebrews presents the same truth to set <i>us</i> free that we may move in the economy without the slightest twinge of conscience; so that Hebrews has the altar of burnt-offering more in view, and our liberty to serve there, for we read, "How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered Himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works <i>to worship the living God</i>".<a name=15:5></a> "Worship" there, is public priestly service linked with the altar of burnt-offering.<a name=15:6></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>gives us what answers to the blood upon the mercy seat, because it is a matter of our acceptance in the Beloved.<a name=15:7></a> At that point it says, "In whom" -- in the Beloved -- "we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences"; so at the centre of the system the blood is there.<a name=15:8></a>

		The passover presents Christ's sacrifice from the standpoint of our need as needing deliverance from judgment and from Egypt, but what we are considering now is connected with <i>the tabernacle system</i> which typifies <i>the economy of God</i>.<a name=17:3></a> God was making Himself known in connection with the tabernacle, as today He is known relative to the assembly.<a name=17:4></a> The tabernacle system began with a divine desire, "They shall make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:8">Exodus  25:8</a>, and this is what is in mind in the present economy.<a name=17:5></a> The Lord, as forsaken, quoted from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=17:6></a>" and it is important to keep in mind that in that Psalm, in spirit He goes on to say, "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel", shewing that in connection with the abandonment what was in the Lord's mind, and governing His thoughts and affections, in taking such a place, was that God would inhabit the praises of Israel; that is, <i>the economy is in mind in that Psalm</i>.<a name=17:7></a> In that same Psalm He later says, "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee".<a name=17:8></a> We have spoken of the inwards of the sin-offering, and we see in that Psalm that the Lord has in His mind nothing less than the establishment of the economy as we know it, and the praises of God in the assembly.<a name=17:9></a>

		It is important that as being priests of God and of Christ, we should be intelligent as to what is proper to the different stages of the service, and know where to put things.<a name=17:10></a> In the scriptures we have read the blood of the sin-offering was poured out at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering; it was also put upon the horns

		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>we have access to the centre of the system, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus".<a name=18:9></a> The blood having been poured out at the bottom of the altar of burnt-offering, and having been put on the horns of the altar of incense, and having been put on the mercy-seat, it has met every question, and glorified God as to the whole matter of sin, so that we can go freely into every part of the divine system.<a name=18:10></a> All is open to us.<a name=18:11></a> The sin-offering presents the sacrifice of Christ as the basis of the economy of God in which He has come out, and as the basis on which we can be free to go in before Him.<a name=18:12></a>

		The appreciation of that would lead to true liberty and intensity in the service.<a name=19:1></a> As bringing with us what corresponds with the inwards of the sin-offering we should come with a deep sense of the profound character of the love which took the Lord that way.<a name=19:2></a> We should put that on the altar of burnt offering with our peace-offerings and our burnt-offerings, and it would give an intensity to it all; for the service of God proper is made up of burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, with the appropriate meat-offerings and drink-offerings.<a name=19:3></a>

		It would appear that the blood is intended to be the sign of love, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood".<a name=19:4></a> In connection with the supper it is the sign of love; it does not occupy us with the matter of atonement; that is a settled matter, and our souls are set free; but by the blood we are reminded of the love of Christ and set free in every part of the divine domain, and to move on the line of purpose.<a name=19:5></a> While the bread and the cup indicate to us the way in which the Lord has moved, and where He has gone in His love, yet He does not ask us to be occupied with that exactly, but with Himself, "This do for a remembrance of <i>me</i>".<a name=19:6></a> At the same time, in the account given to us by the apostle Paul of the institution of the supper, as received from the Lord in glory, there is the allusion to the night in which the Lord Jesus was delivered up.<a name=19:7></a> There is the fact that the Lord as being here with His people is still feeling that; He is feeling it in some ways, perhaps, more keenly because the opposition against Himself, about which He is very sensitive, is directed against His own, which is harder in some ways for the Lord to bear than if it were directly against Himself.<a name=19:8></a> The world, and particularly the religious world, is still against Him, and expresses its opposition as against His people.<a name=19:9></a> The Lord is in need of present comfort.<a name=19:10></a> <i>He needs to have a foretaste of what He will get from the assembly eternally</i>; on

		In these three services taken up in different localities, the Lord was undoubtedly, through Peter, preparing the way for Paul.<a name=32:5></a> The early part of chapter 9 is engaged with the conversion of Saul of Tarsus right up to the verse we read.<a name=32:6></a> The Lord Jesus communicated to Saul the truth of the body, for He said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou <i>Me</i>?<a name=32:7></a>", and Paul was the servant who was to bring in the present administration of the assembly in local companies.<a name=32:8></a> Up to that time, things had been somewhat centralised at Jerusalem, and there had been twelve apostles to do things for the brethren under the Lord's hand.<a name=32:9></a> That phase of things had drawn to a close, and the vessel through whom the Lord was to organise (if one might use the word) the feature of the dispensation which was going to continue right through, was already converted; it was to be his service to set up local assemblies; <i>the assembly on earth taking the form of local companies</i>, and those local companies would have to learn to do things for themselves.<a name=32:10></a> There was not even one apostle attached to each local company.<a name=32:11></a> There were twelve at Jerusalem.<a name=32:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will find in these three incidents the Lord is making way for Paul's teaching; Peter laying moral foundations.<a name=33:1></a> Paul, in his ministry, confirms and develops these foundations but also brings in the heavenly side, the full truth of the assembly, and the doctrine of the body.<a name=33:2></a> Paul could say to the Thessalonians, "Ye, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:14">1 Thessalonians  2:14</a>.<a name=33:3></a> Lydda and Joppa were two of these assemblies in Judaea, and Paul was not slow to admit that the assembly of the Thessalonians, which he set up, became imitators of them; they were founded on right lines.<a name=33:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, in his teaching, develops the lines which Peter indicates in these incidents.<a name=33:5></a> Romans and 1 Corinthians develop the principle of doing things for ourselves.<a name=33:6></a> Peter says to Aeneas, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:34">Acts  9:34</a>; while Colossians deals with the truth illustrated in the raising of Dorcas -- the necessity for living conditions in our local settings; "Your life is hid with the Christ in God", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>.<a name=33:7></a> We must be concerned to maintain <i>living</i> conditions and not simply activity in service.<a name=33:8></a> Then, in Caesarea Jew and Gentile are brought together, Peter and those with him enjoying full fellowship with Cornelius and his house, upon whom the Holy Spirit had come even as upon believers at Pentecost.<a name=33:9></a> This links with the gospel of peace in Ephesians, peace between man and man.<a name=33:10></a> Peter says to Cornelius, "Preaching peace by Jesus Christ".<a name=33:11></a> The hatred between Jew and Gentile was annulled as it says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:14">Ephesians  2:14</a>: "For he is our peace, who has made both one .<a name=33:12></a>.<a name=33:13></a>.<a name=33:14></a> having annulled the enmity in his flesh, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace".<a name=33:15></a> If the greatest enmity (that between Jew and Gentile) had been slain, then every other enmity has been slain, and there should be nothing

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I had in mind was to dwell particularly upon the first incident which is basic, that is, the question of rising up and making our couch for ourselves.<a name=34:3></a> The name Aeneas means praise, and unless we are able to do this in some measure, the praises of God will suffer.<a name=34:4></a> People who, in faith have acted on the injunction Peter gives here, are the people who are free and available in the praise of God, and we all agree that every local company should be marked by the praise of God.<a name=34:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to take up the thought of 'making our couch for ourselves' in three ways: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, with reference to our own bodies, our own persons.<a name=34:6></a> In that connection I read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:25">Romans  7:25</a>, "So then I myself with the mind serve God's law".<a name=34:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, in connection with our houses; because if we have learned in some measure at any rate, to control our bodies, the next thing is to control our houses, and to take a stand like Joshua and say, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord".<a name=34:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then finally, which is the main point, we should learn as local companies to make our couch for ourselves, ordering our local conditions for the pleasure of God and the comfort and prosperity of His people.<a name=34:9></a> This is indicated in the verses I read in Philippians, where we are exhorted to work out our own salvation.<a name=34:10></a> That is said to a <i>local company</i>.<a name=34:11></a> It is a question of the local company working out its own salvation with fear and trembling, because "it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure".<a name=34:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first point it is remarkably illustrated in Paul himself, because in giving an account of his conversion before Agrippa he says, "The Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: but rise up and
	</div>

		stand on thy feet'".<a name=35:1></a> One feels that is the call to each of us.<a name=35:2></a> How can we do it?<a name=35:3></a> Where is the power coming from?<a name=35:4></a> Peter gives the answer, he says to Aeneas, "<i>Jesus, the Christ, heals thee</i>: rise up, and make thy couch for thyself".<a name=35:5></a> He presents to him Jesus, the Christ, and, dear brethren, in Jesus, the Christ, there is every resource that our souls need.<a name=35:6></a> Jesus, the Christ, is the One who has endured the cross for us; God "made him to be sin for us, who knew not sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=35:7></a> He has endured the cross for us in order that as the Christ, the living Head, the new Head, He might have the wherewithal to meet every need of our souls.<a name=35:8></a> He can make us thoroughly whole spiritually.<a name=35:9></a> We are ruined and undone, but Jesus the Christ is available.<a name=35:10></a> What is there in Him for us?<a name=35:11></a> To begin with we have righteousness in Him, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>.<a name=35:12></a> We have no righteousness of our own.<a name=35:13></a> We could not establish our own righteousness; our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.<a name=35:14></a> But "from all things from which ye could not be justified in the law of Moses, in him everyone that believes is justified", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:39">Acts  13:39</a>.<a name=35:15></a> What a great thing that is!<a name=35:16></a>

		My desire tonight, dear brethren, is to speak of liberty in the service of God, and I think this liberty is largely bound up with three things.<a name=59:2></a> The first is an understanding of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>, that is, an understanding of sanctification -- "He that sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one".<a name=59:3></a> I believe that lies at the basis of any liberty as serving God in His own presence.<a name=59:4></a> That is connected with the service of the Mediator.<a name=59:5></a> It was carried out by Moses in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>-- "The Lord spoke to Moses, saying .<a name=59:6></a>".<a name=59:7></a>.<a name=59:8></a>.<a name=59:9></a> The Sanctifier is the Lord Jesus as Mediator.<a name=59:10></a> But then the Lord brings in what is additionally necessary in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>; there is that which His own service has effected, which He speaks of as "he that is washed all over".<a name=59:11></a> There is also the service of love that is left for us to do for each other in washing one another's feet.<a name=59:12></a> We have been washed all over -- Moses took Aaron and his sons and washed them with water, they were washed all over.<a name=59:13></a> He that is washed all over still needs to wash his feet and that is a service of love left to us to perform for each other.<a name=59:14></a> And then finally, what is needed also is the attitude that is referred to in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#5:12">2 Chronicles  5:12</a>, where it says that the priests and the Levites were standing at the east side of the altar; they were standing as holding themselves in readiness to serve -- not coming to the meeting, as it were, with the idea of being spectators in what is going on.<a name=59:15></a> They come as standing -- they do not sit down -- at the east side of the altar, the side of expectancy,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To return for a moment to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>; I believe that is a matter all the people of God need grounding in -- sanctification.<a name=60:2></a> Before I speak of it in detail it will be well to say a few words on the service of God generally, and you will understand that what I mean now is the service of God as in Leviticus, that is, priestly service.<a name=60:3></a> In Numbers it is levitical service; in Leviticus it is serving God in His presence.<a name=60:4></a> The service of God has two parts to it; there is the service of God at the altar and the service inside the tabernacle.<a name=60:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Priestly service at the altar was a public matter; that is anyone could have come along and could have seen the priests serving at the altar; but inside the tabernacle no one saw what went on, only the priests themselves knew.<a name=60:6></a> Typically, they entered into a scene where all was of God.<a name=60:7></a> And you will find in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29">Exodus  29</a>and 30 that those two sides of the service went on every morning and every evening; every morning the priests went to the brazen altar and offered the morning lamb, and every evening the evening lamb, with its meat offering and drink offering.<a name=60:8></a> But then the priest also went inside the tabernacle every morning and evening, and he trimmed the lamp and put incense on the golden altar.<a name=60:9></a> You can understand that when a priest went inside and looked around as entering in spirit a scene where everything was of God, what kind of prayers and praise would go up from him at the golden altar!<a name=60:10></a> Our prayers and praise must be affected by our environment, and the prayers and outgoings of the hearts of the saints at the golden altar -- that is in spirit in a scene where everything is of Himself -- are sweet incense to God.<a name=60:11></a> That is the kind of prayer the Lord prayed in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>.<a name=60:12></a> He is there as Priest at the golden altar, serving in spirit in a scene where everything is of God; He views the saints from that angle -- "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To take up priestly service at all we need to know something of sanctification, but what I have in mind to occupy us tonight is the service of God in connection with the morning meeting, the Lord's supper.<a name=61:5></a> I believe that this matter of sanctification according to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>has an important bearing in connection with the cup.<a name=61:6></a> We have been occupied this afternoon with the truth of reconciliation.<a name=61:7></a> Now reconciliation refers to the way Christ has laid the basis in divine righteousness for this scene where everything is of God.<a name=61:8></a> Reconciliation does not only bear on the church, but on all things in heaven and in earth.<a name=61:9></a> You now has He reconciled, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:21">Colossians  1:21</a>, 22.<a name=61:10></a> But reconciliation touches the whole scene of glory.<a name=61:11></a> We should be in liberty at all times in our spirits to enter into the immediate presence of God, without embarrassment, as a matter of enjoyment and contemplation.<a name=61:12></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>is a matter of enjoyment, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>and 10 a matter of contemplation.<a name=61:13></a> If we understand the work of Christ we shall be free at all times to go into the holiest as a matter of enjoyment and contemplation.<a name=61:14></a> Think of going into a scene where everything is of God, and <i>that comes into the morning meeting</i>.<a name=61:15></a> It is a question of going into the scene as a matter of enjoyment in the first instance, but then there is also the question of serving God actively, in a priestly way.<a name=61:16></a> It is one thing to be in the enjoyment of God's presence, and it is <i>another thing</i> to be free actively to serve Him in it.<a name=61:17></a> If we are to serve Him actively we must have something acceptable to offer.<a name=61:18></a> When it comes to a question of actively serving God in His own immediate presence, we need something more

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Sanctification</i> refers especially to the bearing of the work of Christ <i>on the church</i>.<a name=62:2></a> It is not so much what the work of Christ has done for God in its vast and extensive character, but what the work of Christ has done for us <i>in making us all of one with Him</i>.<a name=62:3></a> If we are actively to serve God in His own immediate presence, we need to have a sense that we <i>have part</i> with Christ as entirely suitable, as all of one with Him.<a name=62:4></a> Many companies will come into the meaning of reconciliation, heavenly and earthly companies, but no company will come into sanctification like the church.<a name=62:5></a> They will have part in the universe of bliss, but no company will have part with Christ in the holy service of God like the assembly.<a name=62:6></a> What the Lord had before Him in a special way in going into death was that He should sanctify us by the offering of His body once for all to bring us in as a priestly company with Himself in the service of God.<a name=62:7></a> That is what is set out in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>.<a name=62:8></a> I should connect <i>reconciliation with the cup</i>, and I should connect <i>this also</i> with the cup <i>at the supper</i> because it is the Mediator who does it.<a name=62:9></a> I suppose there was really no greater service that the Mediator did than this; it was probably the greatest act of Moses' service -- to sanctify a priestly company to draw near to God, to serve Him.<a name=62:10></a> That was the great end in view in the covenant.<a name=62:11></a> God had come out to man and made known the terms on which He would be with man.<a name=62:12></a> God is with us on the line of supply, and it is all in view of our being with God in His realm of things and in such liberty that we are free to serve Him as consciously having part with Christ and as all of one with Him.<a name=62:13></a> What a wonderful thought it is.<a name=62:14></a> What could be a greater act on the part of the Mediator than to secure for God this great return from the covenant, this great response, that there is a company

		You will notice that the whole assembly is brought into it.<a name=63:2></a> What this means in Christianity is that all the saints take it up, we are all priests; we do not set apart a certain priestly class, but it is the saints moving together, all intent on God having an answer to His great thought, just as in Numbers the whole assembly move together to offer up the Levites.<a name=63:3></a> We are all in it on a priestly line.<a name=63:4></a> I would encourage even the youngest here tonight that what we are speaking of is your portion.<a name=63:5></a> There was no age limit to the priests.<a name=63:6></a> We have been sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<a name=63:7></a> The Levite had to become 30 years of age before he was entrusted to carry these holy things.<a name=63:8></a> It needs maturity.<a name=63:9></a> But how are we to get maturity except by taking up priestly service?<a name=63:10></a> And when we grow to maturity how delighted we shall be to be entrusted with the carrying of holy things!<a name=63:11></a>

		Let us look for a moment at this chapter to see some of the important things in it.<a name=63:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a> that He that sanctifies and those that are sanctified are all of one.<a name=63:13></a> That is, the saints are entirely identified with Christ as a Man in the immediate presence of God.<a name=63:14></a> How has that been brought about?<a name=63:15></a> By Christ's wonderful service to us as the Mediator by the offering of His body once for all, typified in <i>the sin offering, the burnt offering and the ram of sanctification</i>.<a name=63:16></a> And so what has happened is that, through the work of God to begin with, everyone of us has a link with Christ through the service of Christ towards us as Mediator.<a name=63:17></a> We have all been washed all over.<a name=63:18></a> You say, why did Aaron need washing all over?<a name=63:19></a> -- Aaron is a type of Christ.<a name=63:20></a> The Lord said "I sanctify myself for their sakes".<a name=63:21></a> The Lord Himself has left flesh and blood conditions <i>for our sakes</i>.<a name=63:22></a> He need not have done,

	<div class="paragraph">
		but He Himself has gone through the waters of death; His position as Man before God is based on the fact that He died and has risen again; He did it for our sakes.<a name=64:1></a> <i>Aaron and his sons</i> were washed all over -- we are brought before God on the grounds of death, and that is the very same ground on which Jesus is before Him for our sakes, that we might be brought with Him before God; and the precious ministry of the Mediator as to His death has this practical effect of washing us all over.<a name=64:2></a> The Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, "He that is washed all over .<a name=64:3></a>".<a name=64:4></a>.<a name=64:5></a> The word of God, through the Mediator, through Christ, has come home in power to the soul, giving me a sense of a link with Him beyond death.<a name=64:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then to go forward -- <i>Aaron and his sons</i> were all clothed; Aaron in his special garments -- Christ is unique in that -- but the sons also were clothed.<a name=64:7></a> The part I want to dwell on most is that <i>Aaron and his sons</i> put their hands on the head of the sin offering; they put their hands on the head of the burnt offering, and on the head of the ram of consecration.<a name=64:8></a> Following that, Aaron and his sons had the blood put on the right thumb, the right ear and the right toe, and Aaron and his sons had their hands filled with what was delightful to God.<a name=64:9></a> Aaron and his sons were anointed and were sprinkled with blood.<a name=64:10></a> Thus the sanctifier and those that were sanctified were all of one, brought before God on sacrificial ground as all of one.<a name=64:11></a> I believe that to have that in our souls is going to set us free in the presence of God.<a name=64:12></a> It is involved in the cup and the covenant because it is the work of the Mediator.<a name=64:13></a> We come into the presence of God conscious that the sanctifier has made us all of one with Himself.<a name=64:14></a> It is man going in to God -- not God coming out to man -- on the same ground before God as Christ is as Man.<a name=64:15></a> How marvellous the grace of Christ, that He is now before God on the ground of a sin offering having been offered!<a name=64:16></a> Aaron and his sons put their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The details of what was put into their hands speak wonderfully of the perfection of Christ in that precious sacrifice and of His precious Manhood; He would fill our hands with these things.<a name=65:8></a> How could brethren be silent if their hands were filled with these things?<a name=65:9></a> And they were all anointed; so that in every way "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=65:10></a> I believe that has a very important bearing on what we may speak of as <i>the transition</i> at the supper from what God and Christ are to us to what we are to God as having part with Christ in the service of God.<a name=65:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When it comes to the practical working out of it, <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>helps.<a name=65:12></a> Once the priests were sanctified, when they were washed all over, they were never washed all over again, but every time they approached to serve God they had to wash their hands and feet at the laver.<a name=65:13></a> We cannot wash one another's hands -- that is

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read these scriptures, dear brethren, because in those in Matthew, Peter is brought before us, and we noticed this afternoon that Peter is one of the New Testament writers who calls Christians priests; and I think this section in Matthew gives us Peter's education and experience in view of becoming a living stone in the spiritual house, and a member of the holy priesthood.<a name=72:2></a> The scriptures in Revelation are written by John.<a name=72:3></a> He is the other New Testament writer who calls Christians priests, and I think in his vision of the elders and the living creatures, he portrays certain features which God intends to mark His priests, features which will mark them certainly in the future, but which are written down in order that we may be exercised as to their marking us now, because we have to keep in mind that the elders and the living creatures are a priestly company.<a name=72:4></a> It says in chapter 5 that <i>each one of them</i> had "a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints", each one of them had those qualifications for priesthood.<a name=72:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope to return to them later, because I believe that is a side of priesthood in which God would specially instruct us in our present experiences and afflictions; but I want to begin with Matthew because we have there the normal side of priesthood in view, that is, assembly service -- or one might rather say, the service that attaches to those who form the assembly, because, as we noticed this afternoon,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=73>[Page 73]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		priestly service is to be a <i>continuous</i> matter.<a name=73:1></a> It reaches its highest character when the assembly is convened, but God's intention is that those who form the assembly should be engaged in priestly service continually.<a name=73:2></a> You remember that of old the priests, after having been consecrated, (that is, their hands filled), were to keep the charge seven days, showing that it was to be their one concern.<a name=73:3></a> Their hands were <i>filled</i> in the holy service of God; they had no room for anything else; and that is God's intention for each one of us.<a name=73:4></a> We have our responsibility to fulfil in this world, but that being done, as consecrated, we have no other occupation but the service of God.<a name=73:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think Peter in the gospel of Matthew illustrates the doctrine of his epistle.<a name=73:6></a> He exhorts us there to "desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation, if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is good".<a name=73:7></a> And then he says, "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood".<a name=73:8></a> He had come that way himself.<a name=73:9></a> As companying with the Lord he had learnt to value the sincere milk of the word.<a name=73:10></a> A newborn babe wants nothing else, and that should mark a Christian throughout his course here, that he wants nothing else but the pure mental milk of the word.<a name=73:11></a> A babe will reject anything but milk; so should a Christian reject anything which is not the pure mental milk of the word; and if we are on those lines we shall indeed taste that the Lord is good, and grow up to salvation.<a name=73:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>, Peter represents one who has grown up to salvation.<a name=73:13></a> It is illustrated in the incident which we read where he walks on the water to go to Jesus.<a name=73:14></a> I purposely did not read of his failure, although I may refer to it; but the great point in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		passage is that he did it: he walked on the water to go to Jesus.<a name=74:1></a> He did a thing which cannot be done in the power of nature.<a name=74:2></a> He made a mistake in looking at the wind and the waves; but in the power of nature it is just as impossible to walk on a calm sea as on a troubled one.<a name=74:3></a> The whole situation is outside the power of nature -- this walking on the waters to go to Jesus -- but it is what comes from feeding on the sincere mental milk of the word.<a name=74:4></a> Peter says in his epistle that we are born again of incorruptible seed by the living and abiding word of God.<a name=74:5></a> As feeding on it we shall receive strength to do what Peter did.<a name=74:6></a> It is because people do not pay enough attention to the word that so few have strength to step out and go to Jesus.<a name=74:7></a> Where the word of God is attended to with an honest heart, people acquire strength, even though their faith be small.<a name=74:8></a> The Lord said to Peter, "O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?<a name=74:9></a>"; still there was faith and affection and spiritual strength there to say to the Lord, "If it be thou command me to come to thee upon the waters"; and the Lord said, "Come"; and Peter did it; he walked on the waters to go to Jesus.<a name=74:10></a> I think the waters represent the adverse elements here.<a name=74:11></a> Unless we learn to be superior to them, we shall not be free in our spirits to function as priests.<a name=74:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This section of Matthew begins with chapter 13: 53.<a name=74:13></a> The various sections of Matthew's gospel are indicated to us, because each begins with an expression something like this: "And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables .<a name=74:14></a>".<a name=74:15></a>.<a name=74:16></a> Following that we get the natural view of Jesus: He came to His own country, and taught in their synagogue, "so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this man this wisdom and these works of power?<a name=74:17></a> Is not this the son of the carpenter?<a name=74:18></a>" That is one of the elements that we have to overcome; it is one of the elements that is suggestive of the waters upon which

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=75>[Page 75]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we have to walk.<a name=75:1></a> It is the natural view of Jesus, men regarding merely His natural origin, bringing Him down to the level of an ordinary man.<a name=75:2></a> There is a great deal of that going on in Christendom.<a name=75:3></a> Following that, at the beginning of chapter 14, we have the character of the world, the careless, godless world, seen in Herod.<a name=75:4></a> The world celebrates such functions, and professes to take a certain amount of interest in divine things, but they are really callous in heart, and prepared for the sake of vanity to murder the saints.<a name=75:5></a> We have to learn not to fear that element, but to overcome the world; and we must remember that today the professing church is largely a department of the world, and we have to learn to be overcomers.<a name=75:6></a> But then, all the time we are being helped and fed.<a name=75:7></a> The Lord feeds the five thousand.<a name=75:8></a> We taste that the Lord is good, and move with Him, and the result of it all with Peter is that he walks on the waters to go to Jesus.<a name=75:9></a> The Lord is looking for this movement with each one of us here tonight.<a name=75:10></a> He is waiting to hear us say, like Peter, "If it be thou, command me to come to thee upon the waters".<a name=75:11></a> The Lord is apart from everything here -- "Disallowed indeed of men", cast out as worthless by men, but chosen of God and precious.<a name=75:12></a> He loves to see souls who are prepared to step out to Him, and as we do so, even though our faith may be little, and we begin to sink, we can be sure of the strength of His arm.<a name=75:13></a> We shall never sink.<a name=75:14></a> The Lord has a perfect care for all who move in this way.<a name=75:15></a> So it was not only that Peter walked on the waters to go to Jesus, but the incident finishes with Peter walking with Jesus; they came up together to the boat.<a name=75:16></a> This walking on the water is what characterises the christian dispensation.<a name=75:17></a> If there is such a thing as a boat at the present time, we might apply it to the mercy we have in being able to walk together; yet the value of the boat position is dependent on the <i>ability of each one in it to walk on the water to go to</i>

		But then, the Lord had in mind that Peter should be a living stone in the full sense of the word.<a name=76:3></a> In chapter 16, Peter is developed so that the Lord can name him as such.<a name=76:4></a> In chapter 15, we have lifeless religion based on the traditions of men; but then at the beginning of chapter 16, it says, of the Lord, "And he left them and went away".<a name=76:5></a> That is another thing we have to do: we have to turn away and leave lifeless religion with its traditions and ceremonies.<a name=76:6></a> As we turn away from these things, and the leaven of them, we come into a position where the Father can bring us into the gain of the revelation which He made to Peter.<a name=76:7></a> The Lord Jesus says, "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=76:8></a>" It seems to me, dear brethren, that it is in this that we really become living stones to be built into the spiritual house.<a name=76:9></a> We come to the apprehension that Jesus, the One whom men have cast away as worthless, is no less than the Christ and the Son of the living God; and nobody can confess Jesus as the Christ and the Son of the living God except in the spirit of worship.<a name=76:10></a> Those who have the New Translation will notice that the pronouns Thou and I are emphatic.<a name=76:11></a> Peter says, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=76:12></a> I believe the emphatic "Thou" means that Peter said it in a spirit of worship.<a name=76:13></a> He realised that the Person before Him was God's King, the Christ, the One in whom God is shortly to head up all things, the things in heaven and the things on earth.<a name=76:14></a> God is going to head up all things in the Christ.<a name=76:15></a> Would to God that this great truth might enter all of our hearts, that Jesus is the Person in whom everything in heaven and on earth is about to be headed up!<a name=76:16></a> <i>He</i> is the Christ, and no one else.<a name=76:17></a> What a glorious Person He is!<a name=76:18></a> What a Man, the Man of God's counsels and purposes, the Man in whom God has purposed in

		Having said that about Peter and his education, seeking to indicate how he became a living stone and a living member of the holy priesthood in which we all are called to have our part, I want to say a word about Revelation.<a name=79:4></a> At the beginning of this book John says, He "has made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=79:5></a> That links us on with what we have been having; but I have an impression, dear brethren, that God would in these days bring us into priestly service in a broader way than, perhaps, we have been accustomed to come into it.<a name=79:6></a> He would widen our view.<a name=79:7></a> The side of things connected with the assembly as such, the highest and most blessed way in which we worship God in all the light in which He is revealed in Christ, and share with Him His pleasure in His Son.<a name=79:8></a> Yet there is another side of priesthood open to us, and that is to be able to worship God and vindicate Him, too, in the spirit of worship, in connection with all His ways and public dealings here.<a name=79:9></a> That is what marks the elders and the living creatures throughout the book of Revelation.<a name=79:10></a> You find they are able to ascribe praise and worship to God in whatever character He appears; and we need to remember this, that the elders and the living creatures refer to ourselves, because the saints of the assembly are included undoubtedly in the company represented by the elders and the living creatures.<a name=79:11></a> So that it is well to take account of the features that mark these elders and living creatures, for the features that mark them will help us in priestly service.<a name=79:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will refer particularly to three features: firstly, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=80>[Page 80]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		feature of experience.<a name=80:1></a> The <i>elders</i> suggest that.<a name=80:2></a> I think it has been made clear today that the youngest believer who has received the Spirit is a priest, and can have part in his or her measure in the priestly service on the line on which we have already been speaking.<a name=80:3></a> But there is another side to priesthood which depends on experience, in connection with the ways of God.<a name=80:4></a> He passes us through circumstances here that we might get experience; and I think that you can understand that the worship of God that flows from experience is peculiarly valuable to Him.<a name=80:5></a> So if the elders worship in Revelation, their worship flows from experience with God in the character in which they are worshipping Him.<a name=80:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the living creatures we have first of all the feature of life.<a name=80:7></a> We have already referred to that in connection with the living stone.<a name=80:8></a> These are <i>living</i> creatures.<a name=80:9></a> And then you have the feature of discernment.<a name=80:10></a> It says of these living creatures: "full of eyes, before and behind", and later it says, "round and within they are full of eyes".<a name=80:11></a> One feels that God would encourage our hearts with a view to these features being promoted with us.<a name=80:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we take the feature of experience, God is passing us through experiences which are leading us to value Him in characters to which, perhaps, we have not hitherto paid much attention.<a name=80:13></a> They are to lead us to value Him as <i>Creator</i>.<a name=80:14></a> Surely the last few years have taught us to value God as Creator as never before.<a name=80:15></a> We may have thought of creation as an act of power in the distant past; but we are having to learn that God is operating all the time in creation.<a name=80:16></a> In Him we live and move and have our being.<a name=80:17></a> We have seen His ability to increase the harvest of the fields; we have seen His ability to use the elements to alter the course of the world war.<a name=80:18></a> We have had experience of God in His creation power and goodness.<a name=80:19></a> It is intended, no doubt, to give us confidence in Him

		as Creator, if we are called upon to suffer for the testimony.<a name=81:1></a> Peter speaks of those who suffer according to the will of God committing their souls in well doing "to a faithful Creator".<a name=81:2></a> We must know and be assured of the faithfulness of the Creator to do that.<a name=81:3></a> We might have thought Peter would have said "to a loving Father", which is quite true, but he says, "to a faithful Creator".<a name=81:4></a> Surely we are learning God as the One on whom we can rely as Creator.<a name=81:5></a> So these living creatures are worshipping God as Creator.<a name=81:6></a> If the elders are doing it, they are doing it as the fruit of experience; and I believe that is one of the things which God is bringing about today.<a name=81:7></a> A wonderful ascription of praise comes before us in this passage; and I would like to challenge our hearts as to whether we have ever been as much affected as these elders and living creatures are.<a name=81:8></a> It says of the elders that they "fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages", and they "cast their crowns before the throne".<a name=81:9></a> All this shows that their whole being is affected as they worship God, and they say, "Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God" -- this is the fruit of experience -- "to receive glory and honour and power; for <i>thou</i> hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created".<a name=81:10></a> Surely this gives us a theme for worship, dear brethren.<a name=81:11></a> Have we ever fallen down before God in the spirit of worship?<a name=81:12></a> And notice that their worship is "to Him that sits upon the throne".<a name=81:13></a> Have we paid enough attention to that?<a name=81:14></a> God is on the throne: He is "the blessed and only Ruler".<a name=81:15></a> He is so much the blessed and only Ruler, that in this book even when evil reaches its worst form, everything is controlled.<a name=81:16></a> It says that it was <i>given</i> to the beast to pursue its course 42 months.<a name=81:17></a> It could not do that unless it was given to it.<a name=81:18></a> What we have been passing through recently is intended to establish our hearts in this great fact that God is on the throne and has

		control of everything; and if that lays hold of our hearts, it will lead out our hearts to Him as the blessed and only Ruler.<a name=82:1></a> We shall not acknowledge any other ruler in our worship.<a name=82:2></a> We would give place to rulers as set up under God, but so far as worship is concerned, there is only One, "the blessed and only Ruler", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:15">1 Timothy  6:15</a>.<a name=82:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next chapter, these same companies are portrayed in worship to God as Redeemer, and then to the Lamb.<a name=82:4></a> I think that in what is going on at the present time, God would enlarge our apprehension of Him as Redeemer; because this feature stands out in God's governmental ways, that though they may come in in judicial discipline upon mankind, God uses them to effect His rights in redemption.<a name=82:5></a> We all feel, surely, that at the present time in what God is allowing He has in view to bring to light the elect, as one might say.<a name=82:6></a> When the throne begins to operate in the book of Revelation, after the first six seals, all the elect are brought to light.<a name=82:7></a> It is a wonderful thing to think that in all this upheaval that is going on now, God is securing His rights in redemption.<a name=82:8></a> In chapter 19, we find this same company of elders and living creatures falling down and doing homage to God as Judge; and I believe that God would have us to be worshippers of Him in that relation.<a name=82:9></a> It is said that we have come "to God the Judge of all", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>.<a name=82:10></a> You will find one of the widest ascriptions of praise in the book of Revelation in chapter 19, where God is celebrated as Judge: "True and righteous are his judgments".<a name=82:11></a> There is nothing more stabilising to the soul than to know God as Judge, because it gives the assurance that the right will prevail.<a name=82:12></a> The function of a true judge is to uphold the right; and we can trust God to do it.<a name=82:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, in worshipping God in these characters, if we are to get the experience that He would have us to get from what we pass through, we need discernment.<a name=82:14></a>

		One would desire to raise an exercise with us as to how far we are in accord with these living creatures which are "full of eyes".<a name=83:1></a> One feels that there is peculiar pleasure to God in that feature.<a name=83:2></a> They were full of eyes "before and behind" -- able intelligently to take account of God's ways in the past and His ways in the future.<a name=83:3></a> And they are full of eyes "round and within".<a name=83:4></a> Let us be diligent, dear brethren, to be "full of eyes", not to miss anything in connection with what God is doing and what He would teach us -- full of eyes "round and within".<a name=83:5></a> That is how we are brought into accord with divine judgments.<a name=83:6></a> It says finally in this book: "God has judged <i>your</i> judgment upon her" -- that is, on Babylon.<a name=83:7></a> If this feature is present -- "round and within .<a name=83:8></a>.<a name=83:9></a>.<a name=83:10></a> full of eyes", we shall come to God's own judgment of the great harlot.<a name=83:11></a> We find, sometimes, that people have a difficulty in discerning the principles of separation.<a name=83:12></a> We need, dear brethren, to be full of eyes, and to come to God's judgment, so that He judges <i>our</i> judgment upon her.<a name=83:13></a> Have we come to God's judgment about the great harlot?<a name=83:14></a> What is it?<a name=83:15></a> That she should be burnt with fire; or rather, that is the judgment which God executes; for it says, "God has judged <i>your</i> judgment upon her".<a name=83:16></a> Have we come to that judgment, that the great harlot, the faithless spouse that takes the place of Christ's spouse on earth, in all the principles of her make-up should be burnt with fire?<a name=83:17></a> If we are <i>true priests of God</i>, we shall come to that judgment; we shall have discernment.<a name=83:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, dear brethren, to speak of the glories of Christ, particularly His kingly glories: feeling that this is a day when we need to apprehend His glories, because antichrist is near.<a name=85:2></a> John tells us that "even now there have come many antichrists", but the day when the man of sin himself will appear is near, and his working will be with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in those that perish.<a name=85:3></a> People will be deceived by the fancied glories that mark man, for he will come here in a kingly way, according to man's ideal of a king.<a name=85:4></a> In Daniel it refers to him as "the king": "And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak monstrous things against the God of gods", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#11:36">Daniel  11:36</a>.<a name=85:5></a> We need Christ Himself as the Object of our hearts in order to be fortified against even the beginning of the deceivableness of unrighteousness; we need to be versed in the glories of Christ, not only His personal and moral glories, but also His official glories, His greatness as King.<a name=85:6></a> The title King is not a prominent one in the New Testament; nevertheless Scripture does apply this title to Christ; He is spoken of as King of kings; the title not only conveying that when He comes forth He will be over all, but that of all kings He is THE KING!<a name=85:7></a> All that God values as truly kingly is set forth in Him, the "King of kings, and Lord of lords" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:16">Revelation  19:16</a>.<a name=85:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The titles used normally in the New Testament are Lord and Christ, both of which bear on Kingship,

	<div class="paragraph">
		the title Christ especially so.<a name=86:1></a> The word 'Christ' means the Anointed, and anointing is essential for a king.<a name=86:2></a> Jesus is the anointed One.<a name=86:3></a> The title Christ covers other glories, but one glory is certainly His glory as King.<a name=86:4></a> The New Testament opens with "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ", it tells us who the King is!<a name=86:5></a> He is Jesus Christ -- Jesus, the Anointed.<a name=86:6></a> Peter in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>announces that, "God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ", verse 36.<a name=86:7></a> When a king comes to the throne, the first thing that has to be done is to proclaim the accession.<a name=86:8></a> What a wonderful privilege Peter had at Pentecost in announcing the accession of God's King!<a name=86:9></a> I have no doubt <i>the coronation has also taken place</i>, for when the Lord comes out of heaven it says, "upon his head many diadems", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:12">Revelation  19:12</a>, and in Hebrews it says, "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour", chapter 2: 9.<a name=86:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While lordship, in its bearing on us, is akin to kingship, in itself it is a wider thought, for it implies that Jesus has absolute authority.<a name=86:11></a> It is a wonderful thing to grasp that Jesus is Lord of all!<a name=86:12></a> His authority extends to heavenly, earthly and infernal beings.<a name=86:13></a> Every being in the universe, even the wicked, will have to own that Jesus is Lord.<a name=86:14></a> We need to know Him as Lord in order to have courage here in the presence of what is adverse.<a name=86:15></a> He is Lord of Satan and his angels; He can at any time curtail their power.<a name=86:16></a> Sooner or later they will have to own Him Lord, but we have the privilege of owning Him thus now, and coming under His protection.<a name=86:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The title 'Christ' is in some respects more limited, involving a sphere where He is Head, where everyone owns Him, and is willing-hearted.<a name=86:18></a> It is thus closely allied with kingship; for the idea of a king according to God, is that he is a beloved person, ruling over

		Now I want to speak of the way we grow in the apprehension of Christ's glories; first, as learning to value Him in His authority and support in <i>our</i> circumstances in view of our salvation, then as set free to delight in His glories as with Him in <i>His</i> circumstances which <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>has in mind; and finally to see from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>that the King is the Priest, in view of God having His portion.<a name=87:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure all of us here would desire to know more of Christ in our circumstances.<a name=87:3></a> It is a great thing to apprehend that God has made Jesus, both Lord and Christ in view of our salvation.<a name=87:4></a> Peter reassures their hearts in this respect for he says, "being by the right hand of God exalted .<a name=87:5></a>.<a name=87:6></a>.<a name=87:7></a> he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear".<a name=87:8></a> They had crucified Him and crowned Him with thorns, but He was now exalted at the right hand of God.<a name=87:9></a> What would He do?<a name=87:10></a> Would He take vengeance on His enemies?<a name=87:11></a> Peter says "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this".<a name=87:12></a> Then he announces formally the accession of Christ to the throne, and brings home to them that what He had shed forth was for <i>them</i>, provided that they would own and enthrone Him in the way that God had done.<a name=87:13></a> All hope for man lies in that.<a name=87:14></a> Jesus is there, <i>a Man for men</i>, having received the promise of the Father.<a name=87:15></a> What a wonderful preaching!<a name=87:16></a> Peter says, "Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost", verse 38.<a name=87:17></a> I wonder if everyone of us here has come into practical salvation?<a name=87:18></a> -- it is in that exercise that your link with Christ will be really formed.<a name=87:19></a> As you learn what He can be to you in your soul need, and in practical everyday matters in your pathway, you will find

	<div class="paragraph">
		As Lord He has all power and authority to protect the believer.<a name=88:4></a> Peter says, "whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved", verse 21.<a name=88:5></a> That becomes a daily matter: we learn to call upon Him moment by moment, hour by hour, and He never fails us: "the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:12">Romans  10:12</a>.<a name=88:6></a> He is rich and there is no need that He cannot meet.<a name=88:7></a> Further, as owning His authority, we are brought into the practical salvation of the assembly.<a name=88:8></a> That was in mind in Peter's preaching.<a name=88:9></a> They were to repent and be baptised, and would receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, and thus find their place in <i>the assembly, the sphere of practical salvation down here</i>.<a name=88:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, as the Lord may help, to speak of a feature of Christ's glory in each of the three passages read, which bears on our position as belonging to the assembly.<a name=96:2></a> These chapters portray the greatness of Christ more fully than any other passages of Scripture.<a name=96:3></a> They are each unique; but there are certain features of correspondence about them.<a name=96:4></a> Each of the chapters stress that in Person He is <i>God</i>, none less than God; although each refers to His Deity in a different way.<a name=96:5></a> Each also makes it clear that He is the Person of the Godhead who brought this world into being -- indeed the whole universe.<a name=96:6></a> Each refers to His Sonship as in manhood; and finally each refers to the universal bearing of His vicarious death.<a name=96:7></a> Colossians says "In him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to itself".<a name=96:8></a> John speaks of Him as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=96:9></a> In Hebrews we have "having made by himself purification of sins", not simply our sins, but the whole question of sins.<a name=96:10></a>

		But while the chapters have features in common, I wish to bring before you tonight the particular feature stressed in each passage.<a name=96:11></a> In the first passage we are told "He is the head of the body, the assembly" <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a>.<a name=96:12></a> This glorious Person is the Head of the body, the assembly; and, for a type, we must go back to Adam.<a name=96:13></a> Christ, in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, is presented as One who entirely supersedes Adam, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is "firstborn of all creation", in virtue of His being the Creator, and as such He is presented as Head.<a name=97:1></a> In the second passage, <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, He is presented as the Word, and what is in view as in John's gospel generally, is dwelling conditions for Divine Persons -- home conditions.<a name=97:2></a> So He is introduced as the Word; the One who is the expression of all that is <i>suitable to Divine Persons</i>, the whole mind of God.<a name=97:3></a> For typical teaching we have to turn to Exodus.<a name=97:4></a> All types fall very far short, and a great deal has to be learnt by contrast, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:17">John  1:17</a> "For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ".<a name=97:5></a> Nevertheless Moses secured dwelling conditions for God by bringing in the mind of God -- God's word -- so far as it could be known at that time.<a name=97:6></a> But in Jesus, "<i>the</i> Word", we have the mind of God in a perfect way.<a name=97:7></a> All that came in previously pales into insignificance beside Him, yet it is valuable as a type.<a name=97:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>particularly stresses that He is the Son, "God .<a name=97:9></a>.<a name=97:10></a>.<a name=97:11></a> has spoken to us in the person of the Son".<a name=97:12></a> All the early part of the chapter emphasises that: "For to which of the angels said he ever, Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten Thee?<a name=97:13></a> and again <i>I</i> will be to him for father, and <i>he</i> shall be to me for son?<a name=97:14></a>", verse 5.<a name=97:15></a> What is specially in view in this epistle is to secure the service of praise; what we might speak of as public, priestly service worthy of God, worthy of the One who has spoken "in Son".<a name=97:16></a> So that Hebrews stresses that God's King, and God's Priest is God's Son: Put those three thoughts together, the priestly and kingly offices now held by the Son, and you can be sure that public priestly service will be secured.<a name=97:17></a> For a type we must go to Solomon.<a name=97:18></a>

		conditions for priestly service.<a name=98:1></a> It is a great thing to see, dear brethren, that in securing and establishing the relations between Christ and the church, God secures all He is seeking for Himself.<a name=98:2></a> So that, at the end, when John "saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven, from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>, he heard a loud voice saying "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men".<a name=98:3></a> In that vessel "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", and thus presented as primarily for Christ, God has secured dwelling conditions for Himself.<a name=98:4></a> Then when the city is presented in its glory as "the bride, the Lamb's wife", verse 9, we are told "His [i.<a name=98:5></a>e.<a name=98:6></a> God's] servants shall serve him, and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads", chapter 22: 4.<a name=98:7></a> It refers to priestly service worthy of God's great name.<a name=98:8></a> It shews how important it is that we should understand in some measure the greatness of Christ as Head of the body, the assembly.<a name=98:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God has in mind in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>to bring the greatness of Christ before our hearts in such a way as to exclude every other object.<a name=98:10></a> If we are to know the blessedness of the relationship between Christ and the assembly, He Himself in His greatness must be before our hearts so as to exclude every rival.<a name=98:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:19">Luke  22:19</a>, He says "This is my body which is given for you", a presentation calculated to secure the church wholly for Himself.<a name=98:12></a> If we entered into it we should never look to any other source for wisdom, light, food or for anything we need spiritually.<a name=98:13></a> That is one great point in Colossians, to save christians from looking anywhere else for the satisfaction of their souls, or for the meeting of their spiritual needs.<a name=98:14></a>
