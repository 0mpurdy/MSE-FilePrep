		I would think most of us here, dear brethren, have learned by experience that spiritual conflict is a very severe thing.<a name=45:1></a> We have had experience of warfare among the nations, but in spiritual conflict we are directly up against the universal lords of this darkness, and the spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies, against which mere mortal man has no power to withstand.<a name=45:2></a> The only way anyone can stand is by being strong in the Lord and in the might of <i>His</i> strength.<a name=45:3></a> But it is very encouraging to know that the Lord Jesus Himself has met these powers, He bound the strong man in the wilderness, and met him in the fulness of his power in the garden of Gethsemane when He said, "this is your hour and the power of darkness".<a name=45:4></a> How severe was the conflict!<a name=45:5></a> His sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling on the ground; and then He went on to the great battle of the Cross.<a name=45:6></a> He fought the fight alone.<a name=45:7></a> He faced the powers of darkness in Gethsemane, and overcame them there; there was no turning Him aside from the path of God's will.<a name=45:8></a> He went on steadfastly, enduring all the agony of mind and body which man, energised by Satan, could inflict upon Him; and, finally, that which was by far the most awful suffering of all -- awful beyond creature comprehension -- in being forsaken by God as bearing our sins and as made sin for us, Who knew not sin, that we might become God's righteousness in Him.<a name=45:9></a>

		of this darkness would obscure that light, darkening our minds so that the light might not shine for us, and that we might be entrapped either by legality, on the one side, and thus lose the liberating power of the gospel, or by the weapon of looseness and licence on the other, and thus lose the truth of the church.<a name=47:1></a> We are in the presence of a full scale attack in both ways.<a name=47:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Severe spiritual warfare has gone on throughout the Christian era.<a name=47:3></a> Satan attacked at the beginning with both weapons -- there was the Galatian error and the Corinthian error; the error of legality, and the error of ignoring the Lord's commandment, as though grace made us lawless.<a name=47:4></a> Grace does <i>not</i> make a man lawless.<a name=47:5></a> It is through the reign of grace that the law of God is established in the believer's heart and ways now; and will prevail to the ages of ages.<a name=47:6></a> <i>Lawlessness</i> means misery, chaos; we await a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells <i>righteousness</i>.<a name=47:7></a> Not one feature of lawlessness will ever intrude into that new heavens and new earth.<a name=47:8></a> Our great Leader loved righteousness and hated lawlessness, and if we are true to Him, in our measure, we shall do the same.<a name=47:9></a> We shall <i>love</i> righteousness.<a name=47:10></a> "I delight in the law of God after the inward man" -- "I myself with the mind serve the law of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:22">Romans  7:22</a>, 25; there is no other thought.<a name=47:11></a> That is the language which grace would lead every true Christian to say; even an undelivered man says, I delight in the law of God; he is right inwardly.<a name=47:12></a> Then he learns that by the Spirit, as subject to the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, he has power to carry out the law of God he delights in and which he has resolved in his own mind to serve.<a name=47:13></a> Everything else is subsidiary to that.<a name=47:14></a> God's rights paramount in the soul, loving the Lord thy God with

		But, as I say, the enemy would obscure the true light of God which is shining in Christ, Who is the Image of the invisible God, in order that we might become enslaved either to legality on the one hand, or open principles on the other, to the detriment of our souls and with a view to robbing God.<a name=48:4></a> There is one thing in common between those who fall a victim to these attacks -- and let us be vigilant lest any of us here should become casualties.<a name=48:5></a> Those who become a victim to one or the other have one thing in common, and that is that the Scriptures have little or no weight with them.<a name=48:6></a> I can speak of this from experience in having to do with souls.<a name=48:7></a> To those on the legalist line, obeying the commandments of men, Scripture is superseded; it is a question of the voice of a man which they call 'the voice of the Spirit'.<a name=48:8></a> On the other side, those who want an open path are also not prepared to discuss Scripture, not prepared to stand on Scripture.<a name=48:9></a> They justify such a path by saying that it is in accord with the opinion of many godly men.<a name=48:10></a> From the standpoint of a soldier, you are bound to become a casualty on either line.<a name=48:11></a> If you are not standing on Scripture you will never stand against the universal lords of this darkness, because you are building on sand.<a name=48:12></a> The Lord Jesus said, "He that comes to me" -- which means now coming to the glorified Saviour, in the presence of God, and we should be continually coming to Him -- "Every one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as we know, it has always been Satan's effort to separate the truth of the Gospel from the Church, two things which are inseparable in the mind of God.<a name=49:5></a> In fact there are Scriptures where Paul refers to his ministry as one whole, although in others he distinguishes those two parts of it.<a name=49:6></a> He was minister of the Gospel and he was a minister of the Assembly, and he wrote "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery".<a name=49:7></a> That is, the great matter that was in the mind of God before the ages of time was the mystery, and the Gospel is subservient to the mystery.<a name=49:8></a> God has sent out the Gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ which would remove every other man from our vision and our affections, <i>according</i> to the revelation of the mystery with a view to the secrets of His heart relative to the assembly being carried through.<a name=49:9></a> The great Divine plan is one whole.<a name=49:10></a> And he goes on to say in that passage, "according to the revelation of the mystery as to which silence has been kept in the times of the ages, but which has now been made manifest, and by prophetic scriptures, according to the commandment of the eternal God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a> - 27.<a name=49:11></a>

		If we are to overcome the foe at the present time, the first thing is to see that the Gospel and the

	<div class="paragraph">
		assembly are complementary, that one is according to the other.<a name=50:1></a> Those we have left, alas, have given up the truth of the gospel in practice.<a name=50:2></a> They have turned to another gospel, which is not another, and if you give up the truth of the Gospel, you have got nothing.<a name=50:3></a> If you give up the truth of the Gospel you have lost the Gospel and you have lost the assembly.<a name=50:4></a> All that is left is a pretence of the assembly, a great false pretension.<a name=50:5></a> But on the other hand, in cleaving to the truth of the Church we must not give up the Gospel, we must hold to the Gospel in its purity and entirety.<a name=50:6></a> Nevertheless, if we <i>limit</i> ourselves to the Gospel our loss will be incalculable in losing the truth of the assembly.<a name=50:7></a> While on the legal line you will lose the truth of the Gospel <i>and</i> the assembly, on the open line you may retain part of the Gospel, but you have lost the truth of the assembly.<a name=50:8></a>

		I feel we should understand, dear brethren, what the real issues of the moment are amongst those who, as we say, have come 'out'.<a name=50:9></a> The enemy is bringing out his next form of attack, which we call the Open principle.<a name=50:10></a> Now I am not speaking against any brethren, for we long after all our brethren in the bowels of Christ Jesus, whatever line they may be on.<a name=50:11></a> But I feel we ought to understand what the Open principle involves.<a name=50:12></a> We have been speaking this afternoon of what is corporate.<a name=50:13></a> The ministry of the assembly involves what is corporate, and what is corporate begins with the truth of the one body, and the Open principle militates against the truth of the one body, and thus strikes at the very foundation of the ministry of the assembly.<a name=50:14></a> Compromise with sectarianism, which is incompatible with the truth of the one body, is one aspect of the Open principle.<a name=50:15></a> If we hold, and are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=51>[Page 51]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		governed by, the truth of the one body we cannot allow any compromise with sectarianism, whether Rome, or Protestant sects.<a name=51:1></a> The other aspect of the Open principle is the independence of local companies, each local company being regarded as an independent unit, having its own rules and standards.<a name=51:2></a> That also is incompatible with the truth of the one body.<a name=51:3></a> There is only one body, and there is therefore only one house of God, because the Body of Christ <i>is</i> the House of God.<a name=51:4></a> There is one body and one house, and through God's grace as having the Spirit, we are made members of that one body -- Scripture does not teach that we are members of a local assembly, but that God has made us members of the universal body; for by one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body; and, as having the Spirit, we belong to the one spiritual house.<a name=51:5></a> That being so, then every local gathering governed by the truth of the body and the house will move according to the same principles, because there is only one body, one house of God, and thus only one set of principles.<a name=51:6></a> I am not saying there will not be variety in the expression of life as seen in local companies; I am not pleading for mere uniformity, because in God's world there <i>is great variety in unity</i>.<a name=51:7></a> I am not saying that the work of God, as seen in the Thessalonians was, in its detail, exactly like the work of God in the Corinthians.<a name=51:8></a> Paul has regard for the circumstances in which they were placed, in the ordering of God.<a name=51:9></a> "O Corinthians", he said, and "O Philippians".<a name=51:10></a> He felt for them in the circumstances in which they were set as God's husbandry.<a name=51:11></a> No doubt there would be a variety of spiritual fruit according to the tests and exercises that had to be faced in each locality.<a name=51:12></a> But the law of the

		house is the same everywhere, as are also the principles governing the body.<a name=52:1></a> The body is the foundation of all corporate truth; the foundation of the ministry of the assembly.<a name=52:2></a> And Satan attacks the foundation in order that the whole structure might fall to the ground so far as <i>our</i> apprehension and enjoyment go.<a name=52:3></a> And what is more important than that, he attacks the foundation in order to rob God of His <i>present</i> portion from His people.<a name=52:4></a> The Gospel is what I might speak of as the 'down line'; it is God coming out in blessing to man, blessing flowing freely even to the gift of sonship and the best robe -- that is all included in the Gospel.<a name=52:5></a> From that standpoint there is nothing greater than the Gospel.<a name=52:6></a> We are taken into favour in the Beloved.<a name=52:7></a> But for there to be an adequate response to Christ and to God the assembly is essential; the ministry of the assembly constitutes the upward or response line.<a name=52:8></a> The response of thousands of individuals, merely as individuals, though blessed with the highest blessing, would not bring an adequate response to the heart of Christ, nor adequate worship and glory to God which can only be secured in the collective setting of the saints together in the light of the assembly.<a name=52:9></a> Therefore to be heartless as to the ministry of the assembly means a certain heartlessness as to God Himself and as to Christ.<a name=52:10></a>
