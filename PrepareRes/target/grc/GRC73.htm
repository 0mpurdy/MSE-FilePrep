		G.R.<a name=16:1></a>C.<a name=16:2></a> It is in mind that we should dwell on <i>first love</i>; the <i>language</i> of first love in the first scripture, the <i>proof</i> of love in the second passage and the <i>reward</i> in the third.<a name=16:3></a> The reward being, "I will give him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:7">Revelation  2:7</a> and also <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:14">Revelation  22:14</a>.<a name=16:4></a> In referring to this subject, it is not with any idea of thinking that we have attained to first love; if others feel as I do, they will think that we have got a long way to go before there is real recovery to first love for Christ.<a name=16:5></a> But I believe one purpose for which the book of the Revelation was written was that there might be a <i>recovery</i> to first love.<a name=16:6></a> It is called "The Revelation of Jesus Christ", which means the <i>unveiling</i> of Jesus Christ; and it shows how God's purpose to head up all things in Christ -- the things in heaven and the things on earth -- is brought about.<a name=16:7></a> And in the course of this development, a rich variety of glories of Christ is unveiled right through the book.<a name=16:8></a> While the book gives us details of how Christ is the One alone qualified to do it, and deals with everything that would hinder God's purpose being brought to fruition, yet the main point in the book is the unveiling of Jesus Christ.<a name=16:9></a> It is the unveiling of the glories which are calculated to ravish the hearts of those who love Him; and the climax of that unveiling is, "I Jesus" -- it is the last appeal of the One whose glories have been unveiled through the book.<a name=16:10></a>

		But though one of His glories for instance is "King of kings and the Lord of lords", yet He appeals to the assemblies as "<i>I</i> Jesus".<a name=17:1></a> Only the privileged are allowed to call by the personal name those who are great in this world; so this appeal is remarkable: "I Jesus, have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the assemblies.<a name=17:2></a> <i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star".<a name=17:3></a> It is the final touch, after all the glories have been unfolded, to stir the affections of the saints.<a name=17:4></a> When John wrote this book, the Spirit and bride were saying "Come"; and it has been echoed all through the centuries.<a name=17:5></a> In John's gospel, John the Baptist says, "He that <i>has</i> the bride is the Bridegroom".<a name=17:6></a> He does not say he might have her, or will have her, but he <i>has</i> her; he indicates that all down the ages there have been those, however obscure and unknown in history, who have been in line with the Spirit and using this language: "The Spirit and the bride say Come".<a name=17:7></a> And then while the remaining phrases we have read may rightly be attributed to the Lord Himself, the bride would take on this beautiful language: "Let him that hears say Come, let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=17:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=17:9></a> Do you think that the bride is developed in the sensitiveness proper to this position?<a name=17:10></a> I was thinking too of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>in relation to His glory; the Father has given Him certain glories; are they the Manhood glories which are peculiarly seen in Revelation?<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=17:12></a>C.<a name=17:13></a> I would think that is right.<a name=17:14></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:24">John  17:24</a>, the Lord says "that where I am, they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me".<a name=17:15></a> This is personal to Him in man-

		hood, unique to Himself, but which we are to behold.<a name=18:1></a> And I believe some of those glories are very richly unfolded in the book of the Revelation; we have to look at the book as the unveiling of Jesus Christ.<a name=18:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=18:3></a> May I ask what you meant when you said you had got a long way to go?<a name=18:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=18:5></a>C.<a name=18:6></a> Well, my affection for Christ is so small.<a name=18:7></a> I mean, first love is a wonderful thing; it is an all-consuming thing.<a name=18:8></a> We see this great affection in the Lord Himself in relation to God: "The zeal of thy house has devoured me", it is said of Him.<a name=18:9></a> So that first love is an all-consuming thing; and how much are we consumed, as it were, with our ardent affection for Christ -- which would carry everything before it?<a name=18:10></a> He must have complete sway in our heart's affections.<a name=18:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=18:12></a>H.<a name=18:13></a> Do you think sometimes we suppose that first love is first in point of time, instead of being quality?<a name=18:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=18:15></a>C.<a name=18:16></a> Quite so.<a name=18:17></a> It is first in quality.<a name=18:18></a> It may exist in the beginning, though not fully developed, with a new convert with whom for the moment Christ is everything.<a name=18:19></a> But then that should grow and increase as we know Him better.<a name=18:20></a> But the tendency is, I fear, as it was with Ephesus, for it to decline, even in getting occupied with many good works that the Lord could commend.<a name=18:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.B.<a name=18:22></a>D.<a name=18:23></a> Is the foundation in this matter contained in the first chapter, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood"; is that where we all begin?<a name=18:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=18:25></a>C.<a name=18:26></a> That is where we all begin, and we should not be afraid to mention that in giving thanks for the cup for instance.<a name=18:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I.H.<a name=19:1></a>R.<a name=19:2></a> I was going to ask in connection with that verse, just referred to, as to whether we do well to be constantly in mind and in spirit occupied with Christ and His great love?<a name=19:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=19:4></a>C.<a name=19:5></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=19:6></a> I think we should not overlook Thomas in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=19:7></a> He is said to be one of the twelve -- showing that it is foundational -- and it gives the idea of individual consecration before the Lord.<a name=19:8></a> He says, "My Lord and my God".<a name=19:9></a> These two thoughts are developed in the book of Revelation side by side.<a name=19:10></a> What He is as made Lord in manhood, and what He is as God, are continually presented side by side in the book of the Revelation -- "My Lord and my God".<a name=19:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I.H.<a name=19:12></a>R.<a name=19:13></a> So you would encourage those of us who are younger not only to be committed to the Lord, but to be constantly engaged in His praise and in His service?<a name=19:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=19:15></a>C.<a name=19:16></a> Well, is not that characteristic of a bride in human affairs?<a name=19:17></a> If things are right the bride is continually occupied with her husband-to-be.<a name=19:18></a> He is always in her thoughts from morning till night, and her activities centre towards the time when she will take up fully her responsibilities with him.<a name=19:19></a> And that is what we shall do very soon in the world to come.<a name=19:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=19:21></a> Do you think we might read the whole of the verse just quoted?<a name=19:22></a> It says: "To him who loves us and has washed us from our sins in his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages, Amen".<a name=19:23></a> Does that not prove that service is to be continual, and that priesthood is the portion of the saints?<a name=19:24></a> Why fall down to the level of men's thinking when the dignity of priesthood has been bestowed

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=20:2></a>C.<a name=20:3></a> And you see, if we have this ardent affection for Christ our thought will move in line with His as to the service of God -- that what is dearest to Him will be dearest to us.<a name=20:4></a> So we shall function as a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.<a name=20:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.S.<a name=20:6></a>H.<a name=20:7></a> Would this all stem from what the Lord says to the assembly at Philadelphia, "that I have loved thee"?<a name=20:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=20:9></a>C.<a name=20:10></a> "That I have loved thee".<a name=20:11></a> It flows from His love to us.<a name=20:12></a> But do you not think that first love is an all-consuming love, an all-consuming passion, as the early writers spoke of the Lord's love in going to death as 'the passion'?<a name=20:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=20:14></a>P.<a name=20:15></a> Do you think that <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21:13">Acts  21:13</a> shows us a man who is in the joy of first love?<a name=20:16></a> "But Paul answering, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart?<a name=20:17></a> for <i>I</i> am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus".<a name=20:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=20:19></a>C.<a name=20:20></a> Well, quite so.<a name=20:21></a> Paul was characteristically, as we know, marked by first love.<a name=20:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=20:23></a>R.<a name=20:24></a> Why does the Lord bring this in in connection with Ephesus?<a name=20:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=20:26></a>C.<a name=20:27></a> Go on, please.<a name=20:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=20:29></a>R.<a name=20:30></a> Well, I thought first love was really bridal love; and in the epistle to Ephesus the Apostle opens out the great truth of the assembly and what she is to Christ; and I thought that that is really what is named by the Lord as "first love", which He greatly misses.<a name=20:31></a> Is it not striking that in the eternal state in the early verses of chapter 21 of Revelation the writer says, "I saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband"?<a name=20:32></a> So that we not only

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=21:2></a>C.<a name=21:3></a> So that it will be first love all through eternity.<a name=21:4></a> It will not stop; no break in it.<a name=21:5></a> But you would say that we have to watch it, because it is the first thing that declines.<a name=21:6></a> "Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded", it says "For out of it are the issues of life", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:23">Proverbs  4:23</a>; and we do need to keep our hearts for Christ.<a name=21:7></a> First love to me would be the answer to Paul's prayer in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>"That the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".<a name=21:8></a> Now, if the Christ is <i>dwelling</i> in my heart by faith, there is no room for anything else.<a name=21:9></a> Dwelling suggests that He is restful in my heart; He has full command, there is no rival.<a name=21:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=21:11></a>C.<a name=21:12></a> Would you think that the two references which John the Baptist makes in the first chapter of John's gospel would support what you are saying?<a name=21:13></a> There was a day when Jesus came to him and he says, "Behold the lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=21:14></a> But then there is another day and he continues the expression: "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=21:15></a> I was thinking there were those two occupations with Jesus before he speaks in chapter 3 of the bride and the Bridegroom!<a name=21:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=21:17></a>C.<a name=21:18></a> Quite so; that is good.<a name=21:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=21:20></a>H.<a name=21:21></a> And in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, Paul, in speaking to the elders of Ephesus, is reminding them of the features that are proper to first love.<a name=21:22></a> He warns them of decline and then says, "watch, therefore".<a name=21:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=21:24></a>C.<a name=21:25></a> Quite so.<a name=21:26></a> That puts a responsibility on us all to watch.<a name=21:27></a> First of all to keep on 'sentry duty' as to our own hearts, keeping your heart more than anything that is guarded; and then to watch over one

		J.L.<a name=22:2></a>W.<a name=22:3></a> Is that why he says to the Corinthians that he would abide at Ephesus, "for a great door is opened to me and an effectual one, and the adversaries many", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:9">1 Corinthians  16:9</a>.<a name=22:4></a> Is that a point of attack, do you think?<a name=22:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=22:6></a>C.<a name=22:7></a> I am sure it is.<a name=22:8></a> The adversaries will be concentrated at this point.<a name=22:9></a> If we are content with lower levels we shall not meet the adversary in the same way at all; but if we are on this line we shall get the full force of the enemy's attack, to divert us from it.<a name=22:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=22:11></a>G-l.<a name=22:12></a> Is the guarding from the adversary seen in verse 20, and also the <i>response</i>?<a name=22:13></a> You have referred to the personal way in which the Lord speaks as "I Jesus"; in verse 20 He says, "Yea, I come quickly".<a name=22:14></a> And then, "Amen, come Lord Jesus".<a name=22:15></a> Is that the great safeguard against the adversary?<a name=22:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=22:17></a>C.<a name=22:18></a> Well, I think that verse is most important because it is an individual speaking, and that is what we ought to get down to.<a name=22:19></a> If there is to be some corporate expression of the bride we must come into it individually, and John is the sample man -- he is going to tarry until the Lord comes.<a name=22:20></a> And that sample man says, "Yea, come Lord Jesus", he is the kind of man who, the Lord says, will tarry till He comes.<a name=22:21></a> Are we all going to be in that?<a name=22:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.S.<a name=23:8></a>E.<a name=23:9></a> I was just going to ask whether it is because of the prime importance of the individual that it is the overcomer whom the Lord looks for, "to him that overcomes"?<a name=23:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=23:11></a>C.<a name=23:12></a> I think John himself is the typical overcomer.<a name=23:13></a> In the gospel he knows where to go.<a name=23:14></a> We know an old hymn which says, "Jesu, Lover of my soul, Let me to Thy bosom fly".<a name=23:15></a> I wish there was more of it!<a name=23:16></a> You see, John knew where to go in the time of crisis; he was in the bosom of Jesus.<a name=23:17></a> First love would ever take us there -- to the bosom of our Beloved.<a name=23:18></a> John was leaning on His breast at supper.<a name=23:19></a> The man who is like that can be a true bondman, as he was in the Revelation.<a name=23:20></a> We are to be wholly at the disposal of our Beloved; we are not our own, we have been bought with a price.<a name=23:21></a> So John is <i>the bondman</i> in Revelation; but he is a very much loved bondman, because in the final scene, in chapter 21 -- the eternal scene -- the One who is on the throne says, "Behold I make all things new".<a name=23:22></a> In His great majesty, the Lord Jesus as the King of kings, is sitting on the throne; it says, "And He said to me".<a name=23:23></a> Now, you think of the King of kings, in the greatness of majesty and supremacy, proclaiming the eternal state!<a name=23:24></a> He turns to His bondman, who is close by: "And he says to me, write, for these words are true and faithful".<a name=23:25></a> And then there is another aside, "And he said to me, it is done, I am the Alpha and the Omega".<a name=23:26></a>

		Well, is that not a wonderful thing in a scene of unspeakable majesty?<a name=24:1></a> To think of the King turning aside to His bondman who is there by His side, and saying to John, as it were, 'Here is something'.<a name=24:2></a> It was a word for him, because, after all, the bondman had the right affections -- bridal affections were worked out in that man; but he was in the place of bondman in the scene of majesty.<a name=24:3></a> But the King of kings turns to him, "And he said to me, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end".<a name=24:4></a>
