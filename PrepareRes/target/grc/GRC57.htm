		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> The words we have read are all the Lord's own words, and in each passage He refers to coming to Himself.<a name=1:3></a> I think the most important exercise at the present time is the strengthening of our personal links with Christ upon which all else depends; so that primarily the value of the present conflict lies in that.<a name=1:4></a> Those who have been going through things with God, facing sufferings, in their exercises they should see to it that their links with the Lord are permanently strengthened -- that they acquire the habit of coming to Him.<a name=1:5></a> Because coming to Jesus is not a thing to be done once; it is to be the daily and perhaps the hourly habit of our lives -- to come to Jesus.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passages we have read show how all-sufficient He is.<a name=1:7></a> The first passage is: "Come to me and I will give you rest".<a name=1:8></a> The second, "ye will not come to me that ye might have life"; we need rest, we need life.<a name=1:9></a> The third, "he that comes to me shall never hunger"; it is a question of food.<a name=1:10></a> We all need food; in natural affairs we cannot go along without it -- but "he that comes to me shall never hunger".<a name=1:11></a> And then in the last passage, as coming to Him to drink, it is with a view to a pure stream going out in testimony.<a name=1:12></a> There will never be a pure stream going out in testimony to satisfy the thirst all round, unless we ourselves are continually coming to Jesus and drinking.<a name=1:13></a>

		So that it is really essential that we each learn to appropriate the Lord Jesus in these four ways; only thus can we be contributors to the fellowship, add wealth to the fellowship.<a name=2:1></a> Without this we are more or less passengers being carried by other people.<a name=2:2></a>

		J.D.<a name=2:3></a> So that all the resources are in Him, are they not?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:5></a>C.<a name=2:6></a> Yes, and what a wonderful thing it is that we are to prove this personally -- in our personal history with Christ; a wonderful experience that is open to us, to prove that Christ is all-sufficient for all the prime necessities of our souls.<a name=2:7></a> Every other resource will fail us; but there is one who will never fail.<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I.H.<a name=2:9></a>R.<a name=2:10></a> Would you say that the actual words of the Lord Jesus always have their own appeal to our hearts, to those of us who love Him?<a name=2:11></a> I was thinking that if there is one expression above another that is very touching and affecting is this word, "Come" that He uses -- how inviting it is!<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:13></a>C.<a name=2:14></a> Yes, and how He longs for it!<a name=2:15></a> We can see how blessed it is that the door is open to each one of us, but the Lord is longing for each one of us to take it up; He says, "all that the Father gives me comes to me", as though He is waiting for it, looking out for those who are going to come.<a name=2:16></a> But then, how much have we done it?<a name=2:17></a>

		A.J.<a name=2:18></a>Gl.<a name=2:19></a> Would you say a word as to coming to the Lord where He is?<a name=2:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:21></a>C.<a name=2:22></a> That is what we have to keep in mind in these passages, coming to Him where He is.<a name=2:23></a>

		then that gives strength to go to Him outside the camp, as to position here.<a name=3:1></a> But we come to Jesus glorified.<a name=3:2></a> He is not here, in the days of His flesh now; if we come to Jesus, it is to Jesus glorified.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.C.<a name=3:4></a> As Peter says: "with God, chosen and precious", we come to that One.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:6></a>C.<a name=3:7></a> Yes; in our last scripture, the 7th of John, it makes it quite clear.<a name=3:8></a> He says: "If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink", and then the scripture goes on to say: "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=3:9></a> Showing that what He had in mind was persons coming to Him glorified.<a name=3:10></a> Now, <i>how often do we come to Jesus glorified in the course of one day</i>?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Q.H.<a name=3:12></a>H.<a name=3:13></a> The hymn we sung is in keeping with what you are saying: "Exalted far beyond the skies", and, "Received in glory bright up there", etc.<a name=3:14></a> He is given a place up there by the Father as glorified.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:16></a>C.<a name=3:17></a> So that in the language of Hebrews it means entering the holy of holies where Jesus is.<a name=3:18></a> He is glorified and God's glory is shining forth in Him, and because of the work He accomplished, that place is our home -- where Jesus is it is the very home of our souls.<a name=3:19></a> And we should go home as often as we can in our personal links with Christ.<a name=3:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=3:21></a>R.<a name=3:22></a> This is not only for our need, is it?<a name=3:23></a> The last scripture we read really refers to the eternal day, the great day of the feast, does it not?<a name=3:24></a> and then we shall be always coming to Him -- and that is not when we are in need.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:26></a>C.<a name=3:27></a> So that in coming to Him now we touch what is eternal.<a name=3:28></a> It is the same with the living bread,

		He says, "that which abides to life eternal".<a name=4:1></a> And the rest He brings us into in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>is an eternal rest.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=4:3></a> Would you say what you had in mind in reading the scripture speaking of rest?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:5></a>C.<a name=4:6></a> I think that apart from knowing rest we are not of much use to God or to men.<a name=4:7></a> It is the great thought of the Sabbath which is continued in the next chapter.<a name=4:8></a> The Son of Man is the Lord of it.<a name=4:9></a> The Father is the Lord of heaven and earth, but the Son is the Lord of the Sabbath.<a name=4:10></a> He brings in God's rest in heaven and earth.<a name=4:11></a> He says: "Come to me", and the note says, 'I will bring you to rest'; and that rest involves the liberty in which Christ has set us free from every yoke of bondage, and the only yoke we have is His yoke.<a name=4:12></a> "Take my yoke upon you", that yoke is perfect freedom; but all other yokes are broken if we come to Jesus in this way.<a name=4:13></a> And then we are brought to the rest of God's Sabbath; and that is strictly the beginning of things for us, the beginning of our true spiritual history.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=4:15></a>C.<a name=4:16></a> Would the next chapter -- chapter 12 -- show the kind of liberty that the Lord would bring us into?<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:18></a>C.<a name=4:19></a> That is right.<a name=4:20></a> Man-made rules deprive us of Sabbath, they break in upon God's rest, as it were, in the saints and our rest in God.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=4:22></a> Does the scripture in Matthew link with verse 16 of <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#6">Jeremiah  6</a>?<a name=4:23></a> "Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the ancient paths, which is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls".<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:25></a>C.<a name=4:26></a> That is very interesting; that would be the point, the latter part of the verse, "and ye shall find rest for your souls".<a name=4:27></a> I am glad to get that connection in Jeremiah.<a name=4:28></a> There are two thoughts here: He gives

		us rest, and then we find rest.<a name=5:1></a> And I think that if we come to Him and enter into the rest He gives, we shall be enabled to tread the path, as taking His yoke, where we find rest for our souls -- and that would link with Jeremiah.<a name=5:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=5:3></a> Do you think John is typical of one doing this?<a name=5:4></a> his head was found on the bosom of Jesus.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:6></a>C.<a name=5:7></a> I do; we need to keep in mind that that place is open to each one of us, and the Lord wants us there more than we can ever desire to be there.<a name=5:8></a> We think that if only we are like John and could rest in the bosom of Jesus and lean on His breast, as though it is something that is far away that we could not attain to!<a name=5:9></a> But if we remember that Jesus wants each one of us there.<a name=5:10></a> His desires are far stronger than ours could ever be.<a name=5:11></a> He feels it if we are not there.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I.H.<a name=5:13></a>R.<a name=5:14></a> I was going to ask, in connection with Mr.<a name=5:15></a> R.<a name=5:16></a>'s remark as to our thinking often of our need, whether we should not think more of His need.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:18></a>C.<a name=5:19></a> Well, it helps us to see that His longings to have us in the greatest nearness to Himself are far greater than ours can ever be.<a name=5:20></a> But then it is good to see that in coming to Him all our longings will be satisfied.<a name=5:21></a> And the first thing we need is rest; "Come to me and I will give you rest".<a name=5:22></a> To understand that God has found His rest in Christ and the work that He accomplished so that we rest there; and if our activity does not spring from rest there is little or nothing for God in it.<a name=5:23></a> True Christian activity springs from rest, we are not working up to something, as though by being feverishly active we are going to arrive at something; but we are brought into the blessedness of God's rest and satisfaction in Christ

		so that our works flow from it -- if our works do not flow from Sabbath there is something wrong.<a name=6:1></a> Jesus brings us to rest in the presence of God, to rest in Himself as the One in whom God rests.<a name=6:2></a> We are in perfect acceptance before God, nothing we could do could add to our acceptance; we are there before God to appreciate with God His rest in Christ.<a name=6:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:17></a>C.<a name=6:18></a> That is what the Psalmist says: "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want"; that bears on what we are saying, you won't want anything else.<a name=6:19></a> Then he says, "He makes me to lie down in green pastures"; you cannot imagine anything more restful than to be lying down in green pastures; and you are led, too, beside the still waters; and so the soul is restored.<a name=6:20></a> And then he says, "he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake", and that is, "take my yoke upon you", but it follows the other -- "he leads me in paths of righteousness <i>for his name's sake</i>" -- that yoke is easy.<a name=6:21></a>

		G.R.<a name=7:4></a>C.<a name=7:5></a> So that <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>links on with "No one comes to the Father except by me" -- in coming to Jesus, really, we find ourselves in the presence of the Father.<a name=7:6></a> The little children were to abide in the Son and in the Father -- abide there.<a name=7:7></a> It involves continual coming.<a name=7:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:13></a>C.<a name=8:14></a> One seems to be an absolute thing, 'I will bring you to rest'; that is, we are brought to share God's rest in Christ and in the work that He has completed for God's glory.<a name=8:15></a> It involves rest in the presence of that glory, and there we shall rest eternally -- it is really God's eternal Sabbath, from that standpoint.<a name=8:16></a> We know that the eternal Sabbath will involve everything, the whole universe, in all that is congenial for God, but we touch God's eternal rest.<a name=8:17></a> Well then He says: "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls".<a name=8:18></a> The yoke is the yoke of bondmanship to Christ.<a name=8:19></a> But our souls have longings; we have longings for our brethren, we have longings for the blessing of men, we have longings that the service of God might go on right down here, and we can get feverish about them, and that spoils things.<a name=8:20></a> But having come into the rest, the foretaste of God's eternal rest, then we come out into the sphere of service and testimony, with all the longings that the Spirit of God produces in our souls, in the way that He came into things.<a name=8:21></a> He was meek

		G.R.<a name=9:6></a>C.<a name=9:7></a> Well, there is tremendous amount of labour and burden.<a name=9:8></a> The brethren have been brought under heavy burdens.<a name=9:9></a> The Scribes and Pharisees bound heavy burdens on men, hard and heavy to bear; the Lord was thinking of those kind of things as well as others.<a name=9:10></a> He was thinking, no doubt, of what would have burdened His spirit, if He had not the retreat into the Father's presence; the burden too of the lack of repentance with people in spite of all His grace.<a name=9:11></a> Also that the Pharisees bound burdens hard and heavy to bear, the Lord says; they were bound on people, and He says: "Come to me and I will give you rest".<a name=9:12></a> That is the call at the present time from that standpoint.<a name=9:13></a>
