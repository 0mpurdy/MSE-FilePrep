		It has been felt for some time past that the ministry of our beloved brother G.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> Cowell was particularly intended of the Lord Jesus to meet the increasing need for a deeper acquaintance with Himself and the promotion of an <i>inward state</i> of soul suited for the presence of Divine Persons.<a name=1:3></a>

		In publishing these <i>Memorials</i> our prayerful desire, therefore, is that the Lord may be pleased to richly bless and use this ministry of Himself for the help and edification of His dear people wherever they may be found.<a name=1:4></a>

		G.R.<a name=1:5></a>C.<a name=1:6></a> It is in mind in these readings to consider God's relations with men, including the ideas of promise and covenant.<a name=1:7></a> It is therefore proposed in the early readings to consider Adam, Noah and Abraham.<a name=1:8></a> The word covenant in scripture does not always mean the old or new covenant.<a name=1:9></a> Both the old and the new covenants, in the letter, belong to the house of Israel.<a name=1:10></a> The old covenant was made with Israel, the new covenant will yet be made with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.<a name=1:11></a> But covenant is used in a wider way than that; and so in Hosea we have the expression that they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant, showing that the idea of covenant entered into things at the very beginning.<a name=1:12></a> There was an implied covenant in the relations between God and man at the very beginning.<a name=1:13></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>brings out what is fundamental to this subject.<a name=1:14></a> The name of God that is used bears on it -- "Jehovah Elohim".<a name=1:15></a> "Elohim" refers to the supremacy and majesty of God as Creator to Whom all rights over the creature belong.<a name=1:16></a> The One who breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life and therefore whose right it is that every breath man draws should be for Him.<a name=1:17></a> Man received his breath from Him -- what intimacy is suggested in that -- and man's breath is in His hand and every breath man breathes should stand related to the God who formed him.<a name=1:18></a> The life came from God and was to be for God.<a name=1:19></a> Of course

		But "Jehovah" brings in the personal Name showing God's personal interest in man.<a name=2:5></a> So that man was in mind in all that He was doing in chapter 1.<a name=2:6></a> We see the way He personally had to do with the forming of man, the personal Name being brought in, showing that His affections were peculiarly involved in this.<a name=2:7></a> His affections were centred in man.<a name=2:8></a> Of course the incarnation proved what a place Man has with God and how God would establish eternally the most remarkable personal relations with this particular creature.<a name=2:9></a> With that in view the Word, of whom Adam was but a figure, became flesh.<a name=2:10></a> But still, from the outset these great principles were there.<a name=2:11></a> "Elohim" was operating in creation generally but in the detailed formation of man the personal Name is introduced, showing how the affections of God were centred in this creature whom He was forming.<a name=2:12></a> Then the way He personally had to do with him in breathing into his nostrils.<a name=2:13></a> What intimacy is suggested in that!<a name=2:14></a> God breathed into the nostrils the breath of life so that all that life was to be for God.<a name=2:15></a> It came from God and was to be for God.<a name=2:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the other side what is brought in here is the great principle of obedience.<a name=2:17></a> God being who He is, Jehovah Elohim, everything on man's side must stand related to the great principle of obedience and that remains unalterable.<a name=2:18></a> Adam transgressed the covenant and he disobeyed but God has never altered that principle any more than the others I have just mentioned -- all these principles stand.<a name=2:19></a> Then,

		along side of all that we have the tree of life in the midst of the garden which indicates the promise of life; as Paul says in the beginning of Titus, "In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time".<a name=3:1></a> The witness to that was that the tree in the midst of the garden was the tree of life.<a name=3:2></a> Therefore God was committed to that; it was an unconditional promise and the tree was the evidence of it.<a name=3:3></a> When disobedience and sin came in, and death by sin, it raised the whole question as to God's glory in every way.<a name=3:4></a> But how would God fulfil the promise?<a name=3:5></a> The tree of life was the witness to the promise.<a name=3:6></a> God could not go back on that, if one might so say, for the tree of life was the centre.<a name=3:7></a> Would God be defeated?<a name=3:8></a> Would He be unable to carry out that promise?<a name=3:9></a> So that great principles are involved in this chapter; basic matters in the ways of God with men which I thought we would get help on in commencing this subject.<a name=3:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:16></a>C.<a name=3:17></a> Yes, God was committed to this before the ages of time.<a name=3:18></a> The tree is the witness to it, as far as one sees; and God, if He is to be God, must stand by that.<a name=3:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:6></a>C.<a name=4:7></a> I would think that what was in the mind of God was that the great issue of good and evil would be wrought out in man.<a name=4:8></a> The matter had arisen in the angelic order; evil had been introduced but the issue would be worked out in man, in this creature upon whom God had set His affections; in that order of being the great issue of good and evil would be wrought out, and in the course of it, God would be glorified.<a name=4:9></a> God's affections would come into display, and He would be vindicated as the One who never fails to honour every commitment which He enters into -- here the promise of life.<a name=4:10></a> But then also it was no doubt an essential test because sin had come into the universe.<a name=4:11></a> So this seems to be an essential test for man, and it is therein that the covenant lies.<a name=4:12></a> The word is, "Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die".<a name=4:13></a> So that man's blessing was conditional upon his observing that command.<a name=4:14></a>

		G.R.<a name=8:2></a>C.<a name=8:3></a> Yes.<a name=8:4></a> So that God is not defeated in what He is doing here in forming man and building the woman; because in the full working out of His ways and counsel the man and the woman will be seen eternally in perfection.<a name=8:5></a> But then in the working out of things the principle of obedience remains.<a name=8:6></a> That is why I suggested looking into Romans.<a name=8:7></a> This fundamental principle in the relations between God and men, obedience on the part of man, is never given up.<a name=8:8></a> God is faithful to His promise, the promise of life, but the principle of obedience is never surrendered; it could not be.<a name=8:9></a> So in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>you have the obedience of the one Man.<a name=8:10></a> Adam and Christ are contrasted, ".<a name=8:11></a>.<a name=8:12></a>.<a name=8:13></a> by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.<a name=8:14></a> For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous".<a name=8:15></a> This should draw out our affections to Christ in a remarkable way as we think of what the one Man has done -- so that we have only one Man before us.<a name=8:16></a> "By the obedience of the one".<a name=8:17></a> What that meant for Him!<a name=8:18></a> How He had to meet the flame of the flashing sword, which turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.<a name=8:19></a> How He has met it!<a name=8:20></a> In result, ".<a name=8:21></a>.<a name=8:22></a>.<a name=8:23></a> as sin has reigned in (the power of) death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=8:24></a> His obedience there is regarded as one great act, as He says, "Lo, I come .<a name=8:25></a>.<a name=8:26></a>.<a name=8:27></a> to do, O God, thy will"; and as we know from the scripture the climax of this was that His body was to

		Abraham's history but in chapter 12 we get, "Go out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will shew thee".<a name=38:1></a> God is about to introduce the covenants of promise, which are unconditional in themselves, and yet contingent upon the obedience of faith.<a name=38:2></a> This is never given up -- the principle of obedience is never dispensed with -- it could not be.<a name=38:3></a> "By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed", and because of the organised idolatry all around, the call was for separation, "Go out .<a name=38:4></a>.<a name=38:5></a>.<a name=38:6></a> from thy kindred, and from thy father's house".<a name=38:7></a> Following this, what comes out is the idea of God being God to a person, in the covenant of circumcision.<a name=38:8></a> That is what God is aiming at, that He should be God to persons.<a name=38:9></a> So He says in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:7">Genesis  17:7</a>, "I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, <i>to be a God to thee</i>, and thy seed after thee".<a name=38:10></a> Then in the next verse, "I will be a God <i>to them</i>".<a name=38:11></a> That is really the vital point in personal relations with God, and it bears on what is collective too, God is operating that He should be a God to persons.<a name=38:12></a> He is God but in this world of idolatry He desires to be a God to certain persons.<a name=38:13></a>

		G.R.<a name=56:1></a>C.<a name=56:2></a> The theme this afternoon is the blood of the covenant so that we may get an impression of all that rests upon, and flows from, the precious death of Christ.<a name=56:3></a> It will be noticed that the blood is referred to in every passage we have read, and while in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>the old covenant literally is in mind, we have to treat scriptures relating to the old covenant in two ways -- on the one hand as contrast, and the other, as type.<a name=56:4></a> The remarkable thing is that in giving the old covenant, which could be in itself only a ministry of death and condemnation, God gave in powerful type a setting forth of the great results which would flow from the death of Christ, particularly the heavenly things; not exactly foreshadowing the new covenant with Israel, but foreshadowing the heavenly things, and what God would introduce us into in the power of the blood of Christ in this dispensation.<a name=56:5></a> So in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>we have to look beyond the old covenant to see what is typified in it; that is, that if God was to make a covenant with a people, it could only rest upon the sure foundation of burnt-offerings and sacrifices of peace-offering.<a name=56:6></a> It had to rest typically upon the death of Christ, and in this passage there was the appreciation of that typically in the people, as represented by the youths of the children of Israel.<a name=56:7></a> It says, "They offered up burnt-offerings, and sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offering of bullocks

		In closing I desire to say a brief word on government in this connection, and the Lord's part in it.<a name=141:4></a> We have all learned a little of the history of Europe, but you do not need to learn much from history books.<a name=141:5></a> What is known in the way of general knowledge is quite enough.<a name=141:6></a> But things the Lord says in the addresses to the churches bear on the history of Europe.<a name=141:7></a> He has made way governmentally for this revival, for a Philadelphian revival to take place.<a name=141:8></a> So He says to Thyatira in regard to Jezebel, "Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works".<a name=141:9></a> These activities of the Lord have been specially manifested in the last 400 to 500 years; they largely account for the wars of Europe.<a name=141:10></a> The Lord has cast Jezebel into a bed; if He had not done so we should not be here tonight.<a name=141:11></a> Some of us were hearing last night what conditions are like in Spain, where Jezebel still has a good deal of sway.<a name=141:12></a> We could never be here like this had the Lord not cast Jezebel into a bed.<a name=141:13></a> Have you ever thanked Him for doing it?<a name=141:14></a> Have you ever spoken to Him about it, and asked Him to
