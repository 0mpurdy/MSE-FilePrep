		THE REVELATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE MYSTERY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak especially of the revelation of the mystery and of the administration of the mystery.<a name=3:2></a> In Romans it speaks of the mystery as to which silence has been kept from the times of the ages, and in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:9">Ephesians  3:9</a> it speaks of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God.<a name=3:3></a> We are living in a day when the mystery is revealed and it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:26">Romans  16:26</a> that according to the commandment of the eternal God it is made known for obedience of faith to all nations.<a name=3:4></a> It is a remarkable expression "the commandment of the eternal God".<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is often overlooked that the proclamation of the mystery has the same authority behind it and has the same scope as the glad tidings.<a name=3:6></a> The glad tidings are preached for the obedience of faith to all the nations.<a name=3:7></a> In connection with those God commands all men everywhere to repent.<a name=3:8></a> But the mystery was to be made known just as widely as the gospel, and this by commandment of the eternal God.<a name=3:9></a> In other words, God did not intend that those who receive the gospel should remain ignorant of the mystery.<a name=3:10></a> His intention is that men should obey the gospel and that they should equally obey the truth of the mystery.<a name=3:11></a> Satan's effort is always to separate the two.<a name=3:12></a> Many believers are prepared to go on with the gospel but they ignore the commandment of the eternal God as to the mystery.<a name=3:13></a> The mystery in its fulness was revealed to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul.<a name=4:1></a> Therefore we need to give heed to Paul's ministry.<a name=4:2></a> We were speaking of leadership last night.<a name=4:3></a> A true leader according to God will always draw attention to Paul's ministry.<a name=4:4></a> He will have in mind that the saints should work out the truth of the mystery.<a name=4:5></a> It needs to be the first concern in all our lives.<a name=4:6></a> We shall not help the saints if we make our business or other private matters our first concern.<a name=4:7></a> If the saints are to be brought into the truth of the mystery it requires full committal to the truth, as Paul says to Timothy, "Occupy thyself with these things, be wholly in them", and God would look to us all to be wholly in the truth of the mystery.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to refer to three great branches of the truth.<a name=4:9></a> The first is the declaration of God.<a name=4:10></a> There is only One Declarer of God.<a name=4:11></a> No apostle could declare God.<a name=4:12></a> "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared (him)".<a name=4:13></a> The declaration of God is the work of the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=4:14></a> It stands in all its grandeur.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next great line of truth is the glad tidings, and particularly Paul's glad tidings.<a name=4:16></a> The glad tidings is to bring us into the gain of the declaration of God, that man might know God, and it is to bring us into the blessing which is in the heart of God for us.<a name=4:17></a> So that Paul's glad tidings brings out the truth of sonship and makes it clear that those blessed at the present time are the first of all the families.<a name=4:18></a> They are the assembly of the firstborn.<a name=4:19></a> We have a place in the Father's house more blessed than that of any other family.<a name=4:20></a> We are blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=4:21></a> All that enters into the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ministry of the gospel.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third line of truth is the ministry of the mystery.<a name=5:2></a> The mystery refers to the truth of the assembly which is Christ's body.<a name=5:3></a> The assembly is necessary if there is to be an adequate response to the blessed Person who came out from God, and to the God from whom He came out.<a name=5:4></a> I would like those three lines of the truth to be in our minds: The declaration of God, which was the Lord's own work, the ministry of the gospel to bring us into the blessing which is in the heart of God for us, and the ministry of the mystery to secure a vessel in which there is adequate response to the heart of Christ and in which the worship and praise of God proceeds in a manner worthy of the way God has declared Himself.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we can see how very important the third line of truth is.<a name=5:6></a> Of course, the declaration of God is the greatest thing, but our hearts being so selfish we readily stop at the truth of the gospel, satisfied with our blessings, forgetting the needs and desires of the Blesser.<a name=5:7></a> The third line of truth is essential if the Blesser is to get His portion.<a name=5:8></a> It is essential if Christ is to have His portion, it is essential if God is to get His portion.<a name=5:9></a> Therefore we need leadership in relation to the truth of Paul's ministry.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A man who has the ministry of the mystery before him is not beating the air.<a name=5:11></a> He knows what he is aiming at.<a name=5:12></a> Paul knew what he was aiming at.<a name=5:13></a> He was a wise architect.<a name=5:14></a> He had the whole plan of the assembly before him.<a name=5:15></a> He was the minister of the assembly.<a name=5:16></a> He filled up that which was behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake, which is the

		assembly.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God would have us all understand the truth of the mystery.<a name=6:2></a> It was hidden throughout the ages in God.<a name=6:3></a> You can understand, now God has come out in revelation, that what was hidden in Him should also be revealed.<a name=6:4></a> This mystery hid in God relates to the vessel in which there would be a full answer to the God who has come out.<a name=6:5></a> How wonderful that we should be let into this great secret which was hid in God!<a name=6:6></a> God had in mind from a past eternity that He should secure the assembly.<a name=6:7></a> I would like to leave an impression of the greatness of this vessel.<a name=6:8></a> It is a great vessel of service.<a name=6:9></a> The assembly is the bride of Christ.<a name=6:10></a> What delight Christ has in her!<a name=6:11></a> The assembly is spoken of as the Lamb's wife!<a name=6:12></a> She is His helpmate, His like.<a name=6:13></a> Think of God forming a vessel which would be of such service to Christ.<a name=6:14></a> His helpmate, His like, one He can trust.<a name=6:15></a> One who always acts as He acts, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=6:16></a> He will trust the administration of the world to come to His wife.<a name=6:17></a> But the assembly is also the tabernacle of God, the vessel in which Christ is enshrined.<a name=6:18></a> The ark was enshrined in the tabernacle of old, and so Christ is enshrined in the heart of the assembly.<a name=6:19></a> And the assembly is entirely of Him, even as the tabernacle was made of the same material as the ark and the veil.<a name=6:20></a> And so the assembly is the suitable dwelling place of God.<a name=6:21></a> It is also the city of Christ's God, where God is praised according to the greatness of His Name (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48">Psalm  48</a>), and the city sheds her influence and light over the whole universe.<a name=6:22></a> What a vessel the assembly is!<a name=6:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Paul's ministry is to bring us all vitally into our place in the Assembly.<a name=7:1></a> All who compose it have been blessed through the gospel, so that all are sons.<a name=7:2></a> Sons desire to serve.<a name=7:3></a> Where can we serve?<a name=7:4></a> We serve in the assembly.<a name=7:5></a> God said, "Let my son go that he may serve me".<a name=7:6></a> But where was the son to serve?<a name=7:7></a> The son was to serve in the tabernacle, thus we are to serve in the assembly.<a name=7:8></a> The assembly is a vessel of service.<a name=7:9></a> We have to distinguish between the family and the assembly.<a name=7:10></a> The family is the place of blessing and privilege.<a name=7:11></a> There is no thought of service in the 15th of Luke.<a name=7:12></a> It depicts the joy of the House in which the Father takes the lead.<a name=7:13></a> But the assembly is the place where the sons serve.<a name=7:14></a> Everyone of us is given a place in the assembly which is Christ's body.<a name=7:15></a> We are all members of Christ's body.<a name=7:16></a> There is no thought of a member being inactive.<a name=7:17></a> No member of our human body is inactive.<a name=7:18></a> The idea of a body is that every member has its own function and is acting.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the liberty of sonship we can all accept the place given to us in the body.<a name=7:20></a> As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are sons of God.<a name=7:21></a> That is <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=7:22></a> If we are led by the Spirit of God we shall answer to the truth of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>.<a name=7:23></a> In the liberty of sonship we shall present our bodies a living sacrifice with a view to filling out our place in the assembly.<a name=7:24></a> The first element of God's will is that we should find our place in the assembly and fill it out.<a name=7:25></a> So that after speaking of the good and perfect and acceptable will of God in the 12th of Romans the apostle exhorts the brethren not to be high minded "but to think so as to be wise as God has dealt to each a measure of faith", and he

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		goes on to say, "we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other".<a name=8:1></a> God has dealt a measure of faith to each one of us to enable us to be efficient in our place in the body.<a name=8:2></a> It is a measure of faith given to us to enable us to be active in the body in the place God has given us in it.<a name=8:3></a> And we look round on the brethren and we see that God has dealt to <i>each</i> a measure of faith, and we merge together as one body encouraging each to fill out his place in the body.<a name=8:4></a> What a wonderful living and active thing the body is!<a name=8:5></a> If only we were all acting according to the measure of faith God has given us!<a name=8:6></a> As I said a moment ago the assembly is a vessel of service.<a name=8:7></a> It is a vessel of service to one another, it is a vessel of service to Christ, it is a vessel of service to God.<a name=8:8></a> God has given to each of us a measure of faith that we should be active in service in our place in the body.<a name=8:9></a> And the first thing is to learn to be right in our relationships with each other.<a name=8:10></a> That is how Paul begins this great subject in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>.<a name=8:11></a> We are each one members one of another.<a name=8:12></a> That links up with <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=8:13></a> If we understand it we shall love one another as Christ has loved us, and we shall be at one another's feet seeking always to set one another free to fill our place in the body.<a name=8:14></a> Let us encourage one another, dear brethren.<a name=8:15></a> Let us serve one another in love, so that we all realise our place in the body, and we all function every brother and every sister, whether we are together or whether we are apart; because the body is working all the time not only when we are together in the meeting, but in all our contacts with each other.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1 Corinthians Paul develops the truth further.<a name=9:1></a> He shows that we need to learn to give the Spirit His place in the body.<a name=9:2></a> First we learn to give the other members their place.<a name=9:3></a> We must be right with one another, but then we must be right with the Holy Spirit; and so in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>he says, "To each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit".<a name=9:4></a> And further down in that chapter in verse 11 he says, "But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as He pleases".<a name=9:5></a> If we are right with each other and loving one another according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, what liberty the Spirit will have to distribute as He pleases.<a name=9:6></a> We shall get the gain of the Spirit, we shall experience manifestations of the Spirit, as in verse 7.<a name=9:7></a> That is how we get the gain of the temple of God, there are the manifestations of the Spirit through the members of the body, and so the light of God shines in the temple.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in Colossians the apostle goes a step further.<a name=9:9></a> He tells us who the Head of the body is.<a name=9:10></a> He tells us that the Son of the Father's love, Who is the image of the invisible God, the One by whom and for whom all things were made, is Head of the body the assembly.<a name=9:11></a> The great point in Colossians is that we should hold the Head.<a name=9:12></a> We are to be right with one another, and right with the Holy Spirit, and we are to be right in our relations with our beloved Head.<a name=9:13></a> He is the Son of the Father's love, and He is our Beloved.<a name=9:14></a> How blessed to have such a Head!<a name=9:15></a> He "is the image of the invisible God" and "in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=9:16></a> What a glorious Head!<a name=9:17></a> We are not to listen to anybody who does not hold the Head.<a name=9:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle proceeds further in Ephesians.<a name=10:1></a> Ephesians gives us the climax.<a name=10:2></a> It brings out fully what the assembly is to Christ.<a name=10:3></a> Colossians is <i>what Christ is to the assembly</i>.<a name=10:4></a> He is the Head of the body, the assembly.<a name=10:5></a> But Ephesians is <i>what the assembly is to Christ</i>.<a name=10:6></a> "The assembly which is His body the fullness of Him who fills all in all".<a name=10:7></a> The assembly is so precious to Him that He loved the assembly and delivered Himself up for it.<a name=10:8></a> The assembly is so precious to Him that He leaves father and mother to be united to the assembly.<a name=10:9></a> How great the love of Christ for the assembly!<a name=10:10></a> How precious the assembly is to Christ!<a name=10:11></a> But you see if we have not travelled the road that I am speaking about there will be no such vessel available for Christ, there will be no true assembly features here.<a name=10:12></a> We must begin in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>and be right with one another.<a name=10:13></a> We must learn to give the Spirit His place according to Corinthians.<a name=10:14></a> We must give full place to the greatness and blessedness of our Head, and then the Lord Jesus will have the assembly for His pleasure in its practical features here on earth at the present time.<a name=10:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then Ephesians gives the climax with regard to what the assembly is to God.<a name=10:16></a> In the passage we read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>it speaks of "God who has created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God, according to the purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of Him".<a name=10:17></a> Here we have presented the assembly as the vessel in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which God's all-various wisdom is displayed.<a name=11:1></a> This is the climax.<a name=11:2></a> It refers to the assembly under the headship of Christ, moving under His impulse and influence as a true wife under the influence of her husband, engaged in the service and interests of God.<a name=11:3></a> In verse 8 Paul speaks of "the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ".<a name=11:4></a> He is our Head, He endows the assembly with all these unsearchable riches.<a name=11:5></a> Solomon of old endowed the assembly of Israel with vast riches in order that the service of God might proceed in the assembly of Israel.<a name=11:6></a> Now the Lord Jesus, the true Solomon, endows His assembly as under His influence and direction, so that the service of praise and worship to God proceeds in the present time in the assembly.<a name=11:7></a> The heavenly principalities see wisdom in the assembly administration.<a name=11:8></a> But they see the wisdom of God in the fullest sense in the ordering of the service of praise to God.<a name=11:9></a> Solomon's wisdom was seen in administration but the greatest expression of Solomon's wisdom was in the service of God to which he gave direction.<a name=11:10></a> When the queen of Sheba saw his ascent there was no more spirit left in her, and in the ascent we can move with our living Head, for it says here in verse 12 "In whom we have boldness and access in confidence".<a name=11:11></a> No limit is put upon this access.<a name=11:12></a> There always <i>is</i> a creature limit, but no limit is placed.<a name=11:13></a> It is not said to be access to the Father, it is left open "in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith of Him".<a name=11:14></a> It involves <i>the highest level of the service of God</i>, and we can understand if we know something of such movements under the leading of Christ there

		will be glory to God in the assembly.<a name=12:1></a> It says "To Him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus".<a name=12:2></a> I have said already that the assembly is a vessel of service.<a name=12:3></a> This is the highest service the assembly is called upon to perform.<a name=12:4></a> It is ascribing glory to God, in a manner in which no other creature vessel could offer it.<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable to think of the assembly as a creature vessel but not like any other creature vessel.<a name=12:6></a> In the first creation God spoke and it was done, but the formation of Eve was special.<a name=12:7></a> She was taken out of the man.<a name=12:8></a> What a marvellous vessel the assembly is!<a name=12:9></a> A creature vessel distinct from every other part of creation because she has been taken out of the man, and that Man from whom she is taken is, in His Person, no less than God.<a name=12:10></a> We can understand "To Whom be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus".<a name=12:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, may the Lord help us to have the truth of the mystery before us in our labours.<a name=12:12></a> Paul says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:9">Ephesians  3:9</a> "To enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery".<a name=12:13></a> It is not only a question of knowing the mystery, but knowing the administration of it, that means the practical working out of it.<a name=12:14></a> And I have sought to give tonight a few remarks as to the practical working out of the truth of the assembly.<a name=12:15></a> It is a constructive line.<a name=12:16></a> It takes in Romans, Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=12:17></a> Let us have this truth before us in our labours.<a name=12:18></a> Let us make it our chief concern so that there might be even now an answer in praise to the God Who has declared Himself, for His Name's sake!<a name=12:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish, dear brethren, to speak of one feature in each of the seven churches.<a name=13:8></a> I think each is a salient feature, and I think there is no doubt that what the Lord has in mind in these addresses to the churches is to bring about recovery to first love.<a name=13:9></a> In fact, I would think John's writings have that in view generally, both in the Gospel and in the book of Revelation.<a name=13:10></a> John the Baptist says, He that has the bride is the Bridegroom, and the Gospel shews us from beginning to end, what a marvellous Person the Bridegroom is, with a view to securing affections proper to the bride.<a name=13:11></a> As far as we know, it was the last portion of scripture to be written.<a name=13:12></a> How calculated the Gospel is to bring about that result!<a name=13:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Book of Revelation has the same end in view.<a name=13:14></a> Take these books together and we see really what John's ministry had in view, that there should be first love at the end.<a name=13:15></a> There was first love at the beginning, but it is a question of first love at the end.<a name=13:16></a> There is one thing to notice, that is, that it will never be there unless we are in company with the Spirit.<a name=13:17></a> First love at the end is expressed in that cry "Come".<a name=13:18></a> It is a more testing cry than perhaps we realise.<a name=13:19></a> To really say "Come" to Christ challenges my own heart as to how far, if Christ came now, it would rob

		me of things I am living in.<a name=14:1></a> If I am seeking life and satisfaction in anything here, then I will have some reserve about Jesus coming.<a name=14:2></a> My cry will not be the whole-hearted "Come" that must result if Christ is my life now.<a name=14:3></a> The test of Christianity, and I answer to it very poorly myself, is as to finding all-sufficiency in Christ now.<a name=14:4></a> "For me to live is Christ" Paul says, "and to die, gain".<a name=14:5></a> He was looking for the Lord's coming, but even to die would be gain.<a name=14:6></a> What a thing first love is, therefore!<a name=14:7></a> It means that your whole heart is entwined around the Saviour.<a name=14:8></a> So that, when you think of Him coming, there is not anything that would tend to hold you back, nothing that would cause you to hesitate in the slightest degree in saying "Come" to Jesus.<a name=14:9></a>

		So the first challenge is as to first love as in the word to Ephesus.<a name=14:10></a> "I have against thee" -- think of the Lord having something against us!<a name=14:11></a> Has He something against me?<a name=14:12></a> I could not say I am yet marked by first love.<a name=14:13></a> I would like to be.<a name=14:14></a> You think of the Lord looking at us now, and He may say "I have something against you".<a name=14:15></a> He may say 'you have done well, you have done many things for Me, and I appreciate everything you have done and everything you are doing, but I have one thing against you -- that I am not everything to you'.<a name=14:16></a> I would like Him to be everything to me and I believe one great point in current exercises is that He should become everything to many.<a name=14:17></a> Let us go through with these exercises.<a name=14:18></a> Let our works be complete before His God.<a name=14:19></a> What else could be the end in the way God is leading us and the way the Spirit of God is leading us, but that
