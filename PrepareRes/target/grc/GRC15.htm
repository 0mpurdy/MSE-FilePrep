		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> My impression is that God would help us at this time as to the period called "the times of the nations", an expression used by the Lord Himself in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>; and that He would give us to understand why He has ordered these times, especially in the light of Paul's remark in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, where he says that "blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in".<a name=1:3></a> It is an expression which, read in conjunction with Paul's ministry generally -- the fact that he was the apostle of the nations and a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the nations -- would indicate that the times of the nations were instituted in a primary sense with this dispensation in view.<a name=1:4></a> We know that the Old Testament prophets had not light as to this dispensation, yet it was in the mind of the Spirit of God; indeed, it was in the mind and purpose of God from before time.<a name=1:5></a> So that while the times of the nations have a great bearing on Israelitish hopes and God's dealings with Israel, they undoubtedly have a special bearing upon this dispensation, when the fulness of the nations in its most excellent sense is being brought in.<a name=1:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important, therefore, that we should be intelligent as to what God has set up in the way of Gentile rule and the character of it, and be kept in remembrance of the fact that it is His will that His saints should bear testimony before rulers.<a name=1:7></a> That has been a feature from the beginning of the times of the Gentiles right on.<a name=1:8></a> Paul was to bear Christ's name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel.<a name=1:9></a> These are the things generally in mind in our enquiry.<a name=1:10></a>

		of the character required in those who are to carry through the testimony God has in mind; and there is a peculiar link between these persons and those who seek to be faithful in our day.<a name=2:1></a> It says in verse 2 that part of the vessels of the house of God had been carried into the land of Shinar to the house of Nebuchadnezzar's god.<a name=2:2></a> In our day the vessels are persons.<a name=2:3></a> Captivity came in early in church history, so that the injunction in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>was necessary before Paul left the scene and he speaks of vessels.<a name=2:4></a> The god of this world has acquired part of the vessels of the house of God.<a name=2:5></a> He uses them in his system, but <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>refers to vessels which are sanctified and serviceable to the Master and profitable for every good work.<a name=2:6></a> The whole truth as to the house of God is cherished by such.<a name=2:7></a> In 2 Timothy days the house of God testimonially is submerged, but we rejoice in the fact that, vitally, it remains; the habitation of God in the Spirit subsists on the earth at the present moment.<a name=2:8></a> It cannot be otherwise, because the Spirit of God is here.<a name=2:9></a> It is submerged from a testimonial standpoint but it subsists in all its living reality, and those who would be faithful today hold to the truth of it and are concerned to function relative to it -- to take up every kind of service connected with it.<a name=2:10></a> Now that would be in mind, in the principle of it, in the stand taken by Daniel and his friends.<a name=2:11></a> They would not render themselves unclean, because no unclean person could function relative to the house of God; they were concerned, therefore, to maintain "the law of the house".<a name=2:12></a> This is given in some detail in Leviticus -- see chapters 7: 37, 38; 11: 46, 47; 12: 7; 13: 59; 14: 32, 54 - 57; 15: 32, 33.<a name=2:13></a> Much of it relates to what is unclean and clean; and chapter 11 treats of food in this connection.<a name=2:14></a> If they had not made a stand as to this they would have been disqualified.<a name=2:15></a> So it is of the utmost importance that we should make a stand, and in doing so we may

		have to approach those in authority and make our requests known, because we cannot compromise.<a name=3:1></a> The fact that Daniel purposed in his heart shows that he was determined not to compromise whatever happened.<a name=3:2></a> But he made his <i>request</i> known.<a name=3:3></a> So the idea of an approach to an authority immediately comes in in the book.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:5></a>G.<a name=3:6></a> Have you in mind that the maintenance of the service of God is the great objective to be before us, but in the course of maintaining that it may work out that approach has to be made to authorities, and God uses that for testimony?<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:8></a>C.<a name=3:9></a> That is what I had in mind.<a name=3:10></a> Exodus, Chronicles, and all that is connected with the house of God, precede this; and though in Daniel's day the house of God was physically destroyed, in our day the habitation of God in the Spirit subsists, and we are to hold the abstract view of it and then work out in practice the service connected with it in integrity and completeness with those available.<a name=3:11></a> But then, in order to do so, we must observe the law of the house and a fundamental law relates to making "a difference between the unclean and the clean", <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#11:46">Leviticus  11:46</a>, 47.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:13></a>G.<a name=3:14></a> It is interesting, is it not, that we get the law of the house brought in again in <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43">Ezekiel  43</a>, who was contemporary with Daniel, stressing that it is "Most holy".<a name=3:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:2></a>C.<a name=4:3></a> That is just what I had in mind.<a name=4:4></a> So that while, physically, Daniel and his friends were in captivity, they were acting in such a manner as to be morally free from it, in order that they might be, in New Testament language, vessels "to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work".<a name=4:5></a> "Every good work" would include the most important, that is, the service Godward in His house, and it also includes testimony to men and testimony before kings.<a name=4:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=16:1></a>C.<a name=16:2></a> We are considering "the times of the nations" and this afternoon we have read about the vision given to Nebuchadnezzar and its interpretation.<a name=16:3></a> It brings out what Gentile rule is as ordained of God, and the various characters which mark it in God's ways.<a name=16:4></a> In a later vision given to Daniel himself, chapter 7, the same four empires depicted in this vision are seen as wild beasts, having various features as beasts, and seen arising out of the sea, and also spoken of as arising out of the earth.<a name=16:5></a> They are referred to there according to their natural characteristics; and their propensities are dreadful, especially when energised by Satan.<a name=16:6></a> But the viewpoint here is in keeping with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:1">Romans  13:1</a>, 2 -- that "there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God.<a name=16:7></a> So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who thus resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves".<a name=16:8></a> We have, therefore, to regard this vision from that standpoint.<a name=16:9></a> The head of the image of fine gold, the gold representing what is of God, brings out the great principle that there is no authority except from God.<a name=16:10></a> That is a remarkable statement, but there it is in Scripture.<a name=16:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=16:16></a>C.<a name=16:17></a> I think this vision helps much as to that.<a name=16:18></a> It shows the varied features of rule which God orders during the times of the nations; the overriding
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=17>[Page 17]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		feature is that there is no authority except from God -- that is the gold.<a name=17:1></a> It was particularly manifested in Nebuchadnezzar's empire, but the principle has remained ever since.<a name=17:2></a> Other metals come in historically in the order given here, but, having come in, those features of rule remain, because you will notice that when the stone smote the image, it says in verse 35, "Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors".<a name=17:3></a> That is to say that, although the principle that there is no authority except from God was manifested in its fulness in the Babylonish empire, the principle remains right through the times of the nations.<a name=17:4></a> Paul was writing in the time of the fourth empire, and he says, "there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God".<a name=17:5></a> So that the gold has not ceased to be there; indeed the whole image is still existing, for the stone struck the feet of the image, and then all the features which marked the image were broken in pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors.<a name=17:6></a> In the Medo-Persian kingdom the silver element of rule came into view and while there is the idea of deterioration which is spoken of in verse 39, yet, I believe, there is also another meaning, and that is that in the Persian kingdom God introduced the silver principle into Gentile government; that is, He raised up rulers such as Cyrus who was himself the subject of prophecy in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#45">Isaiah  45</a>, who considered for God's rights over His people, and made way governmentally for His house to be rebuilt and His service re-established.<a name=17:7></a> Then in the Grecian empire the brass came into view, for it was, generally speaking, a persecuting power, and, from the divine standpoint, a disciplinary power.<a name=17:8></a> Therefore the brass indicates that another way in which God uses Gentile rulers is for discipline, when He sees that the state of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His people requires it.<a name=18:1></a> Lastly, the fourth empire, Rome, was especially marked by strength, as suggested in the iron.<a name=18:2></a> In the final phase of iron and clay, we can see the greatest deterioration, yet each phase is ordered by God.<a name=18:3></a> We are thankful for the strength of the iron -- constitutional government such as marks the western world.<a name=18:4></a> But then there is the clay of democracy, a very base principle, yet used of God to afford liberty of conscience to His people.<a name=18:5></a> So I think, if we get a view of these authorities, whatever their character, as being ordered by God, it will lead to worship and prayer, both of which are found in 1 Timothy, worship to the King of the ages and to the blessed and only Ruler, and prayers for all men and kings and all in dignity.<a name=18:6></a> If we pray to the blessed and only Ruler it should be in the light of what Daniel said, "it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings".<a name=18:7></a> The question is whether we are intelligent enough to know when a time or a season ought to be changed.<a name=18:8></a> I am not suggesting a great change like a dispensational change; the Lord says in that connection, the Father reserves times and seasons in His own authority; but as to present detailed changes.<a name=18:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McK.<a name=19:3></a> That is all very instructive.<a name=19:4></a> The title "God of the heavens", and "Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever", would all have in view His wonderful supremacy over all things, and that is where Daniel's confidence lay.<a name=19:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		Now I want to refer to the Son of man Himself, but first of all to the Ancient of days.<a name=42:2></a> He is introduced in verse 9 in connection with a session of judgment.<a name=42:3></a> "I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit".<a name=42:4></a> This is a scene of the utmost splendour!<a name=42:5></a> "His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire.<a name=42:6></a> A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him" -- it is a throne of judgment.<a name=42:7></a> Think of His attendants!<a name=42:8></a> "Thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set".<a name=42:9></a> What a glorious scene of majesty this is -- the times of the nations finished and the day of reckoning come in connection with the final phase of the fourth empire in which the pride of man reaches its height in blasphemy against God.<a name=42:10></a> We shall be with the Lord Jesus then.<a name=42:11></a> You may say, Who is this Ancient of days?<a name=42:12></a> The Ancient of days is God Himself.<a name=42:13></a> Who is the Person who appears?<a name=42:14></a> It is the Lord Jesus.<a name=42:15></a> The Lord Jesus <i>is</i> the Ancient of days.<a name=42:16></a> The passage read in the book of Revelation shows that He is both the Son of man and the Ancient of days -- marvellous truth, the mystery of His Person!<a name=42:17></a> Truly Man, and, as the Son of man, the kingdom is given to Him.<a name=42:18></a> Viewed in this vision as Son of man, He comes up to the Ancient of days.<a name=42:19></a> And yet the truth of the whole matter is that the Son of man <i>is</i> the Ancient of days.<a name=42:20></a> What a glorious thing it will be to be amongst the thousand thousands who minister to Him and the ten thousand times ten thousand that stand before Him!<a name=42:21></a> How we shall rejoice to belong to His train in that day!<a name=42:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		Now what I wish to point out in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>is that we have to do with this very same Person in a judicial way now.<a name=43:7></a> In many ways, the description in Revelation tallies with that in Daniel.<a name=43:8></a> "I saw .<a name=43:9></a>.<a name=43:10></a>.<a name=43:11></a> in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man", and then in verse 14, "his head and hair white like white wool, as snow".<a name=43:12></a> Here we have presented, in the one blessed Person, the Son of man and the Ancient of days, and He is appearing in judicial character; not sitting on a throne of judgment -- it is not a <i>session</i> of judgment -- but as walking in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=43:13></a> It is the present gracious service of the Lord Jesus.<a name=43:14></a> How could we face Him if He were sitting on a throne of judgment in regard to our assembly responsibility?<a name=43:15></a> How could we face Him if a stream of fire issued and came forth from before Him?<a name=43:16></a> But although His eyes are as a flame of fire and His feet like fine brass burning in a furnace, He is walking in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=43:17></a> Think of the grace of Christ, so great a Person, One who is Himself the Ancient of days, though Son of man, walking at the present time in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=43:18></a> Under His all-searching gaze He is taking account of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So He gives His own estimate of what He sees, and in five of the seven assemblies He calls upon them to repent.<a name=44:2></a> How <i>we</i> need to repent in the presence of such a Person as this and the grace that leads Him to walk in the midst of the seven golden lamps, taking account of all that is there, with a view to bringing us, if we are prepared for it, into the current of His own thoughts and His own judgment of matters, so that we might be overcomers in the present situation and in due course <i>sit with Him in His throne</i>.<a name=44:3></a> "He that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my throne".<a name=44:4></a> The overcomer has learnt to judge things as He judges them here, repentance has had its full place, and He says, I will give to such a one "to sit with me in my throne; as I also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne".<a name=44:5></a> It is the Ancient of days speaking; yet to the worst state of the church He says, "as many as I love".<a name=44:6></a> Think of the affections of Christ!<a name=44:7></a> <i>This is our Beloved</i>, this is the Beloved of the assembly, but seen here in the greatness of His Person and in His judicial character, like a Son of man and yet, by the description, the Ancient of days, and; by His own assertion, "the first and the last" -- a most definite title of Deity.<a name=44:8></a> <i>This</i> is the Beloved of the assembly, His eyes as a flame of fire, of whom it says, "Jealousy is cruel as Sheol: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire.<a name=44:9></a> Flames of Jah", <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#8:6">Song of Songs  8:6</a>.<a name=44:10></a> With the jealousy of divine love He is looking at the assembly here in responsibility, yet

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we appreciate Him thus the first thing we shall do is to fall at His feet as dead.<a name=45:4></a> John knew Him, perhaps, more than others as "the Beloved", yet he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=45:5></a> But as seeing Him thus and raised up by Him again, and facing assembly failure in His presence, John's affections for Him would be immensely intensified.<a name=45:6></a> And so with us.<a name=45:7></a> If we face assembly responsibility and failure in His presence, and are brought into accord with His mind and judgment, we shall love Him in a way we have never done before.<a name=45:8></a> This is really the first step in recovery to first love, which this book supposes.<a name=45:9></a> The Lord presents Himself in certain ways throughout the book, and the object in view is recovery to first love, and it is there at the end.<a name=45:10></a> "I am the root and offspring of David", not now the Ancient of days, it is another view -- "the bright and morning star.<a name=45:11></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=45:12></a> That is, at the end of the book, there is recovery to first love proved by the fact that the bride is entirely in accord with the Spirit.<a name=45:13></a> The Spirit is saying, Come, and the bride is saying, Come.<a name=45:14></a> Recovery to first love involves the whole book of Revelation; the book deals with judgments and other things, but the presentations of the Lord, if appreciated, will bring about first love in our souls.<a name=45:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that brings me to what He has in view in acting judicially.<a name=45:16></a> He has in view the bringing in of all that which He died to secure -- all that engages Him as the Root and the Offspring of David.<a name=45:17></a> How attractive that title is to the assembly!<a name=45:18></a> When He

		As thinking over, dear brethren, what has been before us in these meetings, these scriptures have come into my mind in relation to the great matter of intercession which we have been speaking about.<a name=90:1></a> The first scripture refers to intercession for men, for the world, you might say, or rather the men in it, and the other two refer to intercession for God's people.<a name=90:2></a> One is struck with the lowly attitude of Abraham in taking up this service of intercession in regard of Sodom.<a name=90:3></a> He had just had the privilege of providing a repast for three visitors, one of whom was God Himself, and later, at any rate, he acquires the place of the friend of God, indeed we may gather from verses 17 to 19 that he had already acquired it.<a name=90:4></a> But here he is faced with the position that God is about to come in in judgment on Sodom, and, as we were saying together in one of the meetings yesterday, we have, perhaps more than we have done, to face the matter of having to do with the Lord in judicial character, for He is shortly going to judge the world, the very world in which we are, and He is moving, as we know, in judicial character among the assemblies.<a name=90:5></a> So, as has been said, when even John saw Him in that character he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=90:6></a> It may be that we have not sufficiently taken account of that side of things, the seriousness of the Lord having and expressing a judgment as to conditions in the assemblies, and the very great seriousness, the awfulness, of judgment being poured out shortly upon this very world in which we are.<a name=90:7></a> Revelation speaks of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the fury of God -- a most terrible expression, the fury of God.<a name=91:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Abraham is pleading with God for Sodom, that possibly there might be fifty righteous, and when God said if there were fifty He would spare the whole city for their sake, he says it may be that there will lack five of the fifty.<a name=91:2></a> He is imbued with the spirit of intercession but, at the same time, as marked by it, he says, I who am dust and ashes.<a name=91:3></a> A remarkable thing for Abraham to say, "I who am dust and ashes".<a name=91:4></a> Job repented in dust and ashes.<a name=91:5></a> It is not quite clear, perhaps, at what time Job lived but he said it as brought into the presence of God and made to feel that his only outlet was to abhor himself and repent in dust and ashes.<a name=91:6></a> But Abraham says, I who <i>am</i> dust and ashes, as though the full weight of having to do with God as in a world that was marked by evil, though Abraham himself was separate from it, had been made good in his soul.<a name=91:7></a> Well, one only refers to it, dear brethren, as believing that this kind of spirit and the facing things with God will give us greater power with God.<a name=91:8></a> There is no doubt that Abraham acquired great power with God in this remarkable incident of persevering intercession and, at the same time, there is nothing sentimental about his intercession, he knows when to stop.<a name=91:9></a> He goes so far, step by step, saying, perhaps there may be ten found there, and Jehovah says, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.<a name=91:10></a> But Abraham went no further.<a name=91:11></a> That is, he had a suitable sense of what was due to God, and that if the conditions in Sodom were so bad that there were not ten righteous persons there, it was only right that judgment should fall, although, no doubt, he had confidence in God -- that if there was one righteous man -- as there was in the person of Lot -- that man would be spared.<a name=91:12></a> So we read, as the chapter proceeds, that when the time came and the judgment was poured out Abraham went out to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One felt, dear brethren, that this is a matter that we all need help on, really to face the seriousness of conditions all around us which call for judgment, and therefore the suited spirit on our part in which to engage in intercession on behalf of men.<a name=92:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we come to <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15">Jeremiah  15</a>Jehovah is making known to Jeremiah that the position with Judah is irretrievable.<a name=92:3></a> The captivity was just about to take place, Jerusalem was shortly to be destroyed, the position after the reign of Manasseh was apparently irretrievable and so, in order to bring home to Jeremiah, how serious it was, God says, "Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, my soul would not turn toward this people".<a name=92:4></a> That is, He is pointing out Moses and Samuel as men who had had remarkable power with Him in intercession.<a name=92:5></a> We might enquire what was it about Moses and Samuel that made them such effective intercessors.<a name=92:6></a> We know that Moses was very effective in his intercession, especially at the time of the golden calf; we know that Samuel was very effective in his intercession.<a name=92:7></a> What made them so effective?<a name=92:8></a> The Lord would surely call our attention to those who are effective intercessors in order that we may learn to take on similar features.<a name=92:9></a> Now Moses is presented to us as one who felt the state of God's people from the start.<a name=92:10></a> He was born of good levitical lineage and the first time he is mentioned, it says, that the child wept.<a name=92:11></a> He is presented to us in that way as one who is marked by feeling the state of things in which God's people were involved.<a name=92:12></a> And then we know that later on, much discipline of course had to be faced before he was fit to be used as the deliverer of God's people -- when he went to Pharaoh to bring out God's people, having had a command to do so, he was very definite.<a name=92:13></a> He had to become strong gradually, he developed

	<div class="paragraph">
		strength as he moved in obedience to God's word, but there comes a time when Moses says, we will go with our young and with our old, with our flocks and with our herds, there shall not a hoof be left behind; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#10:9">Exodus  10:9</a>, 26.<a name=93:1></a> Nothing could be more definite than the judgment that Moses had and expressed about the world which was holding God's people in captivity, and he would bring them out.<a name=93:2></a> There was no doubt whatever in the way he spoke to Pharaoh as to his attitude with regard to Egypt.<a name=93:3></a> Now, what attitude have we, dear brethren, in regard of Egypt?<a name=93:4></a> If it were the Sodom world, we should doubtless condemn it, repudiate it, reprobate it, but what about the Egypt world?<a name=93:5></a> The Egypt world is, perhaps, the most dangerous of all from one point of view.<a name=93:6></a> It represents the world as a system that lives in independence of God, having its resources in itself.<a name=93:7></a> The very principle of it is in all our hearts, and yet God would have the saints completely delivered from it.<a name=93:8></a> Indeed one has asked oneself lately how much we are really in the good of redemption, because there is something <i>so</i> absolute about redemption.<a name=93:9></a> It says that the Lord gave Himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to Himself a peculiar people, zealous for good works.<a name=93:10></a> Redemption means that the rights of God over us are absolute, and that He has delivered us from one order of things, or intends to, in order that we might be wholly for Himself and the system in which He is known and served.<a name=93:11></a> One sometimes fears, dear brethren, that we, to a certain extent, have links with both systems; with the world on the one hand and with God's system on the other.<a name=93:12></a> But that is not the recognition of God's rights in redemption.<a name=93:13></a> God's rights in redemption are absolute, and it says that the Lord has washed us from our sins in His blood -- that is we are never to go back to what marked us previously -- and has made us a kingdom,

		priests to His God and Father.<a name=94:1></a> That is the position we are in -- made us a kingdom; all His power and support available for our protection but, at the same time, it is in order that God might have priests in this evil world; priests who minister to His pleasure on the one hand, and, as we have been hearing, to represent Him in prayer and intercession for all men, for kings and those who are in dignity, and so on.<a name=94:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, we shall indeed have no power with God if we are not definite in our repudiation of the world and in our recognition of the claims which He has established over us in redemption.<a name=94:3></a> Moses says, we will go with our young and with our old, with our flocks and with our herds, there shall not a hoof be left behind, and in chapter 11 of the book of Exodus we find that he went out from Pharaoh's presence in a glowing anger.<a name=94:4></a> That is, he really represented God's own feelings in regard of the system which, up to that moment, had kept His people in bondage.<a name=94:5></a> And how many of God's people are in bondage still.<a name=94:6></a> They belong to God, they belong to Christ, and yet are in bondage.<a name=94:7></a> And one challenges oneself as to how far <i>we</i> really feel it; how far there is godly indignation in our hearts in regard of the position.<a name=94:8></a> The Lord lays, "Woe to the world because of offences!<a name=94:9></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:7">Matthew  18:7</a>; as though He would say that system has provided stumbling blocks for thousands of My people, and woe to it -- Woe to the world, He says, because of offences.<a name=94:10></a> We might say much more as to Moses but one does not want to monopolise the time, but then Samuel, too, he was the product of deep feeling.<a name=94:11></a> We know how Hannah felt things, we know how she was determined that from the very outset Samuel should be one who served God suitably, so that even as a boy he ministered to Jehovah clothed in a linen ephod.<a name=94:12></a> Think of that, starting as a young boy with the idea of ministering to God in suited moral conditions; no doubt the effect of his mother's influence.<a name=94:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=95>[Page 95]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Samuel grows up in that setting, as one who from the very outset is to be a priest, though not one officially, and one who was marked by feeling in regard to the conditions in which God's people were.<a name=95:1></a> Well now he intercedes in power.<a name=95:2></a> He calls upon God's name, as it says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99">Psalm  99</a>, "Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name", verse 6, and he was answered.<a name=95:3></a> But he particularly shines near the end of his history.<a name=95:4></a> Not that he was not in power before for he certainly was, but at the end of his history he is rejected by the people, and he says, "Far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#12:23">1 Samuel  12:23</a>.<a name=95:5></a> He was not embittered by the fact that he was rejected by the people whom he had served so long.<a name=95:6></a> He says, I will teach you the good and right way.<a name=95:7></a> And there is another thing in which he shone, and which I have no doubt gave him great power with God, and that was the unsparing way in which he dealt with Agag after Saul had spared him.<a name=95:8></a> All these things, dear brethren, I have no doubt, enter into our acquiring power with God.<a name=95:9></a> If we are to intercede -- intercessions, prayers, supplications, thanksgivings for all men and especially too for all saints as we have in the end of Ephesians -- if we are to have power with God, it is a question of taking on, I believe, these features which are particularly seen in Moses and Samuel.<a name=95:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now when we come to Amos, he is not, in one sense, someone distinctive like Moses and Samuel, nevertheless he acquires power, but he tells one who was opposed to him, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit".<a name=95:11></a> He was just engaged in ordinary lowly occupation, engaged with what was living and concerned with fruit -- "I was a herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit".<a name=95:12></a> It is a good thing to be occupied with what is living and what can be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sacrificed to God, what can be presented to God, and with the idea of fruit for God, too.<a name=96:1></a> And Amos was marked by that.<a name=96:2></a> Just, you might say, an ordinary person, but at the same time having the good of the saints at heart, for he says, "And Jehovah took me as I followed the flock", that is he would be watching their movements, seeing, we might say, how they were getting on.<a name=96:3></a> Timothy cared with genuine feeling how the saints were getting on, and that was the kind of man that Amos was, and it is open to anyone of us.<a name=96:4></a> It is open to anyone of us, the youngest of us, that we should be genuinely concerned how the saints are getting on, following the flock and seeing their movements and, of course, if we are thus exercised, we shall be concerned as to our own movements.<a name=96:5></a> And as he was following the flock it says, "Jehovah took me, as I followed the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel".<a name=96:6></a> But now there is another thing comes to light with Amos, and that is that if anyone has the mind of God, so that he can communicate it to His people, he should also be an intercessor.<a name=96:7></a> We have in chapter 3 of this very book what I believe was referred to during the meetings, that the Lord Jehovah will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets, and Amos was one to whom God showed things.<a name=96:8></a> If God shows us things it is intended that we should not only convey God's mind but that we should glorify Him by taking up the attitude of intercession.<a name=96:9></a> And, therefore, Amos is given to witness certain governmental dealings of God, locusts that were eating up all the latter growth and so on, and as he took account of this, he said, "O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee!<a name=96:10></a>" What feeling there was, "O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee!<a name=96:11></a> How shall Jacob arise?<a name=96:12></a> for he is small".<a name=96:13></a> His intercession was effective: "Jehovah repented for this; it shall not be".<a name=96:14></a> And then in the next paragraph

		there is another governmental intervention on God's part in great severity and again he says, "O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee!<a name=97:1></a> How shall Jacob arise?<a name=97:2></a> for he is small.<a name=97:3></a> Jehovah repented for this".<a name=97:4></a> Then as things continue the position becomes irretrievable but I need not say any more as to that.<a name=97:5></a> All I had in mind was to point out that whereas with Moses and Samuel we have outstanding persons, with Amos we get what we might call an ordinary person, who is just following the flock and going on with a humble occupation, but available to God, to be taken up to convey His mind, but that if we have God's mind He intends that we should feel what it involves for His people and that we should take up the service of intercession.<a name=97:6></a> Amos was an intercessor who was effective, with what feeling he pleaded with God!<a name=97:7></a> Twice over his intercession was heard, and he becomes in that way a model for us.<a name=97:8></a>

		Well, dear brethren, that is all that was in one's mind, hoping that the Lord might use the word just to help us all in what I am sure has been a challenging time at these meetings to us all; in the little time that is left I have no doubt the Lord would have us take up with greater definiteness and earnestness than ever before this service of praying in God's house suitably; having intelligence as to what is due to Him and at the same time having divine feelings both in regard of men and in regard of His people.<a name=97:9></a>

		with us all.<a name=98:1></a> I believe the Lord has spoken; He often speaks, but I believe He has spoken very distinctly during the past two days, and the general effect upon us must be that it is time we really took stock of our position and came to a revaluation of all things which are available to us, whether individually, household wise or in the assembly.<a name=98:2></a> I think I can say freely that I have been impressed with the need to come freshly into the occasions of prayer in a new kind of way as becomes God's house.<a name=98:3></a> One feels rebuked at the amount of formality that has characterised and may still characterise our meetings for prayer; and one of the outstanding impressions left upon one's spirit during these occasions is the importance of this priestly intercession.<a name=98:4></a> Then, too, I would remark that in the epistle to Timothy the instruction as to intercession is given to a young man.<a name=98:5></a> All these instructions for the house of God are given to a young man, and I would urge our young brethren here tonight to come early to a proper valuation of the truth and their place in the fellowship with the privileges available.<a name=98:6></a> In the book of Proverbs the young man is brought into a sphere of values, values according to God.<a name=98:7></a> He is taught of his father to value things; it says, "and he taught me, and said unto me .<a name=98:8></a>.<a name=98:9></a>.<a name=98:10></a> Get wisdom", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:4">Proverbs  4:4</a>, 5.<a name=98:11></a> So that right from the outset we can say, and we trust all our young brethren here tonight agree, that we are in the presence of valuations according to assembly standards, according to the standards of God's house and according to the standards of the sanctuary.<a name=98:12></a> How I would urge that there might be a yielding to the powerful exhortation in the ministry!<a name=98:13></a> The place the young have had in our considerations has been most pronounced.<a name=98:14></a> The exercises of the young in France have had certain repercussions in this season together and we have all been happily carried.<a name=98:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		view to basing a word of exhortation on them.<a name=99:1></a> The first passage would help the young to be assured of the divine system in powerful operation.<a name=99:2></a> I know of nothing more comforting, in a sense, than that the system is here.<a name=99:3></a> God is equal to every emergency, and He is going to carry things through according to His own mind; and the point is whether we are in the gain of these things.<a name=99:4></a> When Elijah was taken up into heaven, the words of Elisha were, "My father, my father!<a name=99:5></a> the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof".<a name=99:6></a> That surely would have reference to what was available to God's people in power upon the earth, consequent upon Elijah's going into heaven.<a name=99:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In our chapter, the attendant of the man of God took account of things outwardly and said, "Alas, my master!<a name=99:8></a> how shall we do?<a name=99:9></a>" God has great patience with the attendants of the men of God; Joshua was such and God took him on; Elisha was such and God took him on; Mark was such, an attendant, breaking down, but God took him on.<a name=99:10></a> I would say, dear young brethren, attend on the truth, attend upon those who minister the truth.<a name=99:11></a> So the word here from Elijah is, "Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes".<a name=99:12></a> We would wish that everyone's eyes should be fully opened.<a name=99:13></a> Mark's gospel would help the young to see the energy and power in which things are to be carried through, and it is in that gospel that the Lord, in healing the blind man, gives him a second touch that he might see all things clearly.<a name=99:14></a> I trust that many have had a second touch here these two days; something that might determine and give character to your future walk; something that will help you in the re-assessment of values in the realm of the truth, for you will never gain Christ unless you learn how to value Him.<a name=99:15></a> The word in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, as to your "intelligent service", means that the believer is beginning to be able to reckon and to value.<a name=99:16></a> So in this passage in Kings the young

		man needs to have his eyes open.<a name=100:1></a> What a host there was round about Elisha!<a name=100:2></a> It would speak of God for us and of the whole system as available to us, "full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha".<a name=100:3></a> Well, what more, dear young brother and sister, could you need in the way of confirmation?<a name=100:4></a> Commit yourself to the Lord unreservedly, not merely to break bread but from henceforth to be available to the Lord and wholly committed to Him.<a name=100:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in Mark's gospel we have a man whose sense of values was altogether disproportionate.<a name=100:6></a> He had come readily into things; he came running into the way and kneeling down to the Lord said, "What shall I do?<a name=100:7></a>" The Lord, looking on him, loved him; but immediately He tested him on the line of what value he placed on things.<a name=100:8></a> He says, "One thing lackest thou; go, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross".<a name=100:9></a> That is the word, dear young brother!<a name=100:10></a> You might be clear of the world in many respects, but then there is your own sphere and the value you set upon it.<a name=100:11></a> This man went away sorrowful for he had great possessions.<a name=100:12></a> The greater your portion in the world the more difficult it will be.<a name=100:13></a> I would say, keep simple, never get involved: always be simple in your relations in this world, before God in piety and in salvation.<a name=100:14></a> It says, he went away grieved.<a name=100:15></a> "Jesus looking around says to his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<a name=100:16></a>" I would say, dear brethren, learn to change your values; sell what you have and you will get an increased value for it, you will have something of your own which will go through with you into God's day; but do not build up anything that will tend to establish you in independence of God, neglectful of the testimony and unable to carry the cross.<a name=100:17></a> The word here is, "follow me, taking up the cross".<a name=100:18></a>

		Now as to Mark himself.<a name=101:1></a> He is often in our minds.<a name=101:2></a> As arriving at a revaluation Paul says he is "serviceable to me for the ministry".<a name=101:3></a> Think of the company, think of Paul himself, and the Lord committed to him, think of Luke being with him, think of Timothy going also to Rome and taking Mark with him!<a name=101:4></a> What company there would be in those brethren at Rome!<a name=101:5></a> Would it not be worth while to be wholly committed to be in the best of company, to be in the very centre of what God is doing with regard to His assembly and to the saints; and, indeed, to all that His counsel involves in connection with the universe?<a name=101:6></a> So the word to Timothy is a charge.<a name=101:7></a> It is a solemn matter to receive a charge; and Paul, though he knew Timothy so well and could speak to him as his child, says, "I testify before God and Christ Jesus".<a name=101:8></a> Is that not a solemn matter that things are presented to us on the line of a charge?<a name=101:9></a> The whole of the two books of Timothy constitute the charge of the man of God; and the word here is that it is laid upon him as in the presence of God and "Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and dead".<a name=101:10></a> Paul is urgent with this young man; everything is in the nature of command in these epistles.<a name=101:11></a> There was to be no option but a man completely at the word of the apostle.<a name=101:12></a> Then he is to "take Mark and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me".<a name=101:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, dear brethren, how much there is in these epistles to Timothy, so much that we need to keep the truth in them currently in our hearts day by day, for that is where, so to speak, the Lord has His rights.<a name=101:14></a> The reference to the Lord in this book is most touching, the Lord Himself!<a name=101:15></a> "The Lord stood with me and gave me power".<a name=101:16></a> So that we might say this is not simply the divine system objectively, it is not a matter now of the horses and chariots round about Elisha, but it is a matter of persons who can

		be relied upon, persons, indeed, who are part themselves of the divine system and are here in relation to the will of God.<a name=102:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust my young brethren will suffer the word of exhortation and be attentive to the truth; never be satisfied with an objective knowledge such as we might acquire in meetings together, but rather be diligent in following up the truth in exercise, and working it out consistently in our daily path and in the assembly.<a name=102:2></a> May the Lord graciously bless the ministry that we have received.<a name=102:3></a> In a sense it is simple to refer to what we have had and to exhort one another to pay attention to it and to keep the entrusted deposit, for His name's sake!<a name=102:4></a>

		As you know, dear brethren, I am only able to speak a very simple word, but I said, after the afternoon reading, to Mr.<a name=102:5></a> G.<a name=102:6></a>, "I feel greatly humbled", and he said he felt the same.<a name=102:7></a> So there are two of us, anyway; we may find more, if we canvass the brethren, that are greatly humbled.<a name=102:8></a> I feel as though the past fifty or sixty years have been largely lost, and I would encourage the younger brethren, and the older brethren too, to seek enlargement.<a name=102:9></a> As an old man, I can look back for a long time.<a name=102:10></a> We have lived in a remarkable era.<a name=102:11></a> We have seen the truth of eternal life more clearly recovered; we have seen the truth as to the Sonship of Christ recovered; we have seen the worship of the Spirit recovered; we have seen the worship of God Himself recovered.<a name=102:12></a> What a list of blessed truths we can enjoy, and are enjoying!<a name=102:13></a> But every recovery has meant a conflict and loss.<a name=102:14></a> I can remember in early days the conflict about

	<div class="paragraph">
		So I wanted to speak a word, briefly, about enlargement.<a name=103:4></a> I feel we need enlargement.<a name=103:5></a> We have it, in a measure, in regard to the service of God.<a name=103:6></a> We all enjoy it much more than we used to; but I feel that we need enlargement as to the great place that God has given us in His house and in the testimony.<a name=103:7></a>

		So Jabez came before me.<a name=103:8></a> There is something prior to his prayer.<a name=103:9></a> His mother bore him with pain.<a name=103:10></a> Enlargement always brings pain, the pain of a mother.<a name=103:11></a> It would mean exercises carried a long time.<a name=103:12></a> We do not get enlargement suddenly in the meeting; it may begin there, but it means carrying until the child is born and it brings pain.<a name=103:13></a> What a child Jabez was!<a name=103:14></a> He turns to God and says, "Oh that thou wouldest richly bless me, and enlarge my border, and that thy hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil".<a name=103:15></a> What a prayer!<a name=103:16></a> I feel we need enlargement in regard of our place in the testimony.<a name=103:17></a> We have been so narrow, so insular, never looking much beyond our own meeting; but the thought of God is to have His saints before Him in all the glorious viewpoint of the prophetic testimony.<a name=103:18></a> What a sphere it is!<a name=103:19></a> We can look round in the world; it is seething and troublous.<a name=103:20></a> Politicians do not know what to do; but we, as Christians, know what will be the end of it.<a name=103:21></a> We cannot tell when, but we know the end, and we have to pray about these great events.<a name=103:22></a> Bodies of men are arising on every hand claiming the world for themselves without regard to others.<a name=103:23></a> We have rights in the world, God has given us rights down here; we are here according to the will of God, and He hears us, our prayers

		So we are to pray for enlargement in every respect in the prophetic testimony of the Lord.<a name=104:4></a> So Jabez sought to be kept from evil; because it might grieve God?<a name=104:5></a> No, because it might grieve him.<a name=104:6></a> So God would take notice of a man like Jabez.<a name=104:7></a> He loves to hear His people pray, whether in the home or in private or in the meeting; He is always listening to what His people say.<a name=104:8></a> He knows all about what to do from His own side, but He loves to listen to His people and His people's prayers move Him.<a name=104:9></a> Think of the mighty power of God moving to bring to pass the prayers of His people!<a name=104:10></a>
