		G.R.<a name=41:2></a>C.<a name=41:3></a> I have suggested these scriptures having in mind the verse in Isaiah "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee, because he trusteth in Thee", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#26:3">Isaiah  26:3</a>.<a name=41:4></a> If there is one thing that is needed at the moment it is peace of mind.<a name=41:5></a> Scripture shows that we can have perfect peace.<a name=41:6></a> Another remark I would like to make at the outset is that in scripture the mind does not mean merely the intellect.<a name=41:7></a> We use our minds in the sense of the intellect when we study geography, mathematics, etc.<a name=41:8></a> Men use the intellect even in the study of theology.<a name=41:9></a> But that is not the way the mind is presented in scripture as applied to the things of God.<a name=41:10></a> According to scripture the mind and the heart are inseparably connected, so that the first reference to thoughts in scripture is that "every imagination of the thoughts of his (man's) heart was only evil continually", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:5">Genesis  6:5</a>.<a name=41:11></a> It does not say the thoughts of his mind, but the thoughts of his <i>heart</i>.<a name=41:12></a> Also, "as he thinketh in his heart, so is he", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#23:7">Proverbs  23:7</a>.<a name=41:13></a> In pure study we use the intellect by itself and the heart is not affected, but a believer is characteristically not a student, but a <i>heart</i> man.<a name=41:14></a> So according to scripture he thinks with his heart; thinking means your mind is at work, but as governed by your heart.<a name=41:15></a> Even as regards evil things, men think in their hearts.<a name=41:16></a> The Lord says "Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts".<a name=41:17></a> The heart is the very centre of a man's being; and the mind therefore is an exceedingly important faculty.<a name=41:18></a> Scripture speaks a great deal about it.<a name=41:19></a>

		issues of life", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:23">Proverbs  4:23</a>, in a practical way it means keeping your mind.<a name=42:1></a> Only it is the mind as inseparably connected with the heart.<a name=42:2></a> And so you can understand in the gospel epistle -- Romans -- Paul speaks a good deal of the mind.<a name=42:3></a> Another thing to consider is this, the conflict is wrought out in the minds of believers.<a name=42:4></a> If the enemy attacks he attacks through the mind although he may use external things to affect the mind.<a name=42:5></a> For instance, if something is presented that calls out the lusts of the flesh, the danger lies in letting the mind dwell upon it.<a name=42:6></a> Particularly in matters of doctrine and of the truth, the enemy attacks through our minds.<a name=42:7></a> It is in the minds of men that the battle is fought out, and that is why the divinely given weapon is the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.<a name=42:8></a> If the word of God controlled all minds, the battle would be over.<a name=42:9></a> When the Lord comes forth the sharp two-edged sword proceeding out of His mouth is the only weapon He uses, as far as we know, because once the word of God has prevailed with all its sharpness over the minds of men and of nations, the battle will be won.<a name=42:10></a> The battle will not be won by armies and navies and air forces; they do not, in a moral sense, effect anything; they only effect circumstantial things, although they may be used to deal with persons who are corrupting men's minds, and are useful that way.<a name=42:11></a> But the real battle is not fought out by them.<a name=42:12></a> The spiritual conflict has got to be fought out finally in our minds, and the final result will be that every mind, every intelligence in the universe of God will be subject to the word of God; then the battle will be won.<a name=42:13></a> We are, as it were, in a beleaguered city, the enemy is all around us, the universal lords of this darkness are attacking us all the time, watching for any opening to get an entrance into our minds, and to corrupt our minds from simplicity as to the Christ.<a name=42:14></a> So we need to get the gain of the gospel

		epistle (Romans) with reference to our minds to begin with, because what I said indicates that in the recovery of the man for God the mind is a most important thing.<a name=43:1></a> A man will never be right unless what he thinks in his heart is right, "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he".<a name=43:2></a> Another reason one has suggested this subject is because one feels the need of it so much oneself.<a name=43:3></a> I am feeling the need of peace of mind, so it is as a needy soul I am bringing this forward to see if we cannot help each other.<a name=43:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=43:7></a>C.<a name=43:8></a> Philippians deals a good bit with being 'minded'.<a name=43:9></a> For instance Paul says "if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you".<a name=43:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=43:11></a> I was wondering in that way if you were linking it up with the heart?<a name=43:12></a> Solomon asks for an understanding heart, and it is said that God gave him a heart to hear, so that from his heart his mouth might be controlled.<a name=43:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=43:14></a>C.<a name=43:15></a> That is very good.<a name=43:16></a> It is from the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks, and when a man speaks he is expressing aloud his thoughts.<a name=43:17></a> So that really when the mind is working in the normal sense the whole man is involved.<a name=43:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=43:22></a>C.<a name=43:23></a> The first thing I think we need to understand is that we cannot think a single right thought without the Spirit, not one.<a name=43:24></a> Unless a man be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God, so that we cannot grasp one divine thought, or have one right thought about ourselves without the Spirit.<a name=43:25></a> That is how I understand it.<a name=43:26></a> The mind of the flesh, it says, is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither indeed can it be.<a name=43:27></a> I cannot imagine a stronger statement.<a name=43:28></a> So that those that are in the flesh

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.J.<a name=44:10></a>W.<a name=44:11></a> Did Paul come to it at the end of Romans chapter 7, "I myself with the mind serve God's law"?<a name=44:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=44:13></a>C.<a name=44:14></a> I think so, and chapter 8 shows that while he has come to that resolve and decision, the working of it out can only be by the Spirit, because otherwise the mind of the flesh will always get the better of us.<a name=44:15></a> The mind of the flesh is always springing up like a foul spring.<a name=44:16></a> The Holy Spirit is the spring of living water.<a name=44:17></a> But the foul spring is always springing up unless it is checked.<a name=44:18></a> So it says, "They that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh", that is the foul spring.<a name=44:19></a> "They that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit" -- another spring, a fountain of living water.<a name=44:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=44:21></a>B.<a name=44:22></a> The first reference to the mind in Romans, is to a reprobate mind, a mind void of moral discernment, and it says God gave them up to that, men away from God.<a name=44:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=45:11></a>C.<a name=45:12></a> Yes, indeed.<a name=45:13></a> No wonder the Lord, according to <i>John</i>, calls Him the Comforter.<a name=45:14></a> This is an initial thing in which we need comfort, that we are not left a prey to the mind of the flesh, we can have the mind of the Spirit, the Spirit being the source of our thoughts.<a name=45:15></a> Now what is a wonderful thing to me is this, that the Spirit will give me right thoughts on everything, and if I have right thoughts on everything I shall be able to say right words and do right actions.<a name=45:16></a> The thoughts are basic, so you can understand the importance of this from the standpoint of deliverance.<a name=45:17></a> It is a most marvellous thing to me, it has only come to me the last few days, the wonder of it that it is possible for me to have a right thought about everything, and once a man's thoughts are right, God has got the man, because his feelings will be right and his actions will be right.<a name=45:18></a> "As he thinks in his heart, so is he".<a name=45:19></a>
