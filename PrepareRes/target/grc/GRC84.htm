		"They that wait upon Jehovah shall renew their strength .<a name=87:5></a>.<a name=87:6></a>.<a name=87:7></a> they shall run, and not tire; they shall walk, and not faint", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40:31">Isaiah  40:31</a>.<a name=87:8></a> The normal Christian path involves running without weariness, and walking without faintness.<a name=87:9></a> God is the source of strength to do both, but the enemy is always attacking; and in that connection we have to stand fast in the Lord and in the faith, and having done all to stand.<a name=87:10></a> What is fundamental is running the race, the race of soul history with God in the apprehension of His will and purpose.<a name=87:11></a> We grow in the knowledge of Himself, and alongside that we grow in the appreciation and apprehension of the death of Christ.<a name=87:12></a> So it is a wonderful course we have been set upon, and we should each of us have <i>nothing less before us than to</i>

		Paul speaks of his own energy in the race in Philippians.<a name=88:15></a> The race supposes we are always increasing in our knowledge and apprehension of our calling on high, so that from another standpoint growth is connected with the race, you are stretching out more and more.<a name=88:16></a> When he came to the second epistle to Timothy, he said he had finished the race, but to the Philippians he says, "Not that I have already obtained the prize, but I pursue", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:12">Philippians  3:12</a>.<a name=88:17></a> His eye was on the goal, and the prize for the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=88:18></a> Nothing else in life compared with it.<a name=88:19></a> It is not always on the surface, but it is a question of our inward energies, letting nothing stop us.<a name=88:20></a> They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; so that if we feel that weariness is coming in, the thing is to wait on God.<a name=88:21></a> What a

		God we have!<a name=89:1></a> He will strengthen us for the race to which He has called us.<a name=89:2></a> There is the goal and there is the prize, no idea of competition or emulation in Christianity, we want <i>all</i> the brethren to come in at the finish.<a name=89:3></a> Let us run with endurance, so that we <i>all</i> come in at the finish.<a name=89:4></a> The gift of God is eternal life, but our side is to lay hold of it, and of the whole range of Christian blessing -- true athletes -- our eyes on the goal, forgetting the things behind and stretching out to the things before.<a name=89:5></a> The bane of a Christian is a distracted mind, half an eye on something here, and half an eye on heavenly things.<a name=89:6></a>

		The Apostle brings in the link between running and walking.<a name=89:7></a> Your walk is your communion with God, and your behaviour before men which goes with it.<a name=89:8></a> Enoch's walk before men was exemplary; we walk according to the part we have reached in the race.<a name=89:9></a> You take a family: all are of different ages, but they can walk together and tread the same path, but they have different apprehensions of God and His purpose, so that while they can all walk together their measure is different.<a name=89:10></a> They are all in the same path.<a name=89:11></a> Wherever we have got to, let us walk in the same steps, all the same calling and the same steps; but the measure of our communion with one another depends upon the place we have got to in the race.<a name=89:12></a> It is good to be with those who are farther on in the race.<a name=89:13></a> Be ye imitators of me, the Apostle could say, 'keep in my steps, and it is the best way of promoting your own movements'.<a name=89:14></a> We walk together and as we are each pressing on, it gets more and more precious.<a name=89:15></a>

		Ephesians develops the walk a great deal, but says nothing about the race.<a name=89:16></a> This is an urgent matter; we should lay all thought of self aside.<a name=89:17></a> We walk in keeping
