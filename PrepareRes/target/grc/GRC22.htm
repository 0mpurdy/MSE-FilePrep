		ground", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:2">Isaiah  53:2</a>), and now in the full vigour of Manhood, God could say to Him, "In thee I have found my delight".<a name=5:1></a> Think of Him further, that He could say, "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again .<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a>.<a name=5:4></a> I have received this commandment of my Father".<a name=5:5></a> What Object He was of the Father's love as He moved on to lay down His life, saying, "the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=5:6></a>" And then think of His coming forth from death -- "raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=5:7></a> Think of the joy then between the Father and the Son!<a name=5:8></a> All the work of suffering now behind -- the atoning sufferings -- that cup of bitterest woe.<a name=5:9></a> It was all over.<a name=5:10></a> Love had sustained it all.<a name=5:11></a> And the triumph too in His being raised from the dead by the Father's glory.<a name=5:12></a> "He hath put a new song in my mouth" He says (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:3">Psalm  40:3</a>).<a name=5:13></a> The Lord Jesus rose from the grave with a song in His mouth which, speaking with all reverence, could not have been sung had He not become incarnate.<a name=5:14></a>

		It is wonderful to think of the One by whom all things began to be, by whom all things subsist, coming into a position where He could have experiences which were not possible in the glory of Deity; His coming into a condition where He learned obedience from the things which He suffered, and was able to have experiences of the deepest sorrow; it says, of one momentous hour, that He began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed; and exclaimed, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death".<a name=5:15></a> Think of Jesus -- God over all blessed for ever, One with the Father and the Spirit in Deity -- coming into a condition where He would have such experiences,

		and going through them all, even the atoning sufferings, when deep called unto deep at the noise of God's cataracts!<a name=6:1></a> Think of Him coming through all that, and the joy of coming forth, and, we might say, the relief of all being over!<a name=6:2></a> "He hath put a new song in my mouth".<a name=6:3></a> J.<a name=6:4></a>N.<a name=6:5></a>D.<a name=6:6></a> asks whether we can join in the stirring song that He sings when in resurrection He comes forth from all the sufferings?<a name=6:7></a>

		Think of the Father's joy too, now that all is over, for who can know what the Father suffered to see the Son suffer?<a name=6:8></a> We cannot measure that at all.<a name=6:9></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>is just a type, "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest".<a name=6:10></a> Think of the Father's joy that it was all over.<a name=6:11></a> What joyful exultation!<a name=6:12></a> We might say, it goes on, it never ceases; and we are to be brought into it.<a name=6:13></a> Similarly, think of the joy of the Holy Spirit!<a name=6:14></a> Think of the Holy Spirit's part in the whole matter from the time when it was said to Mary, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of the Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God".<a name=6:15></a> How the Holy Spirit had moved throughout, coming upon the Lord at His baptism, leading Him in (Matthew says carrying Him, and Mark driving Him, into) the wilderness; how right through His pathway the blessed Spirit was with Him, and then by the Eternal Spirit He offered Himself without spot to God (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:14">Hebrews  9:14</a>).<a name=6:16></a> Can you fathom what all that meant to the Holy Spirit?<a name=6:17></a> Scripture speaks a great deal of the Holy Spirit's feelings, even from the outset of creation according to Genesis.<a name=6:18></a> But think of what it meant to the Holy Spirit when Jesus offered Himself by the Eternal Spirit without spot to God!<a name=6:19></a> So we can now think of

		In all these matters we can see how Jesus is the Beloved.<a name=7:5></a> And really Matthew is a gospel of the Beloved.<a name=7:6></a> It opens as the book of the generations of Jesus Christ, Son of David, and David means 'beloved', and Solomon, David's Son was, too, "beloved" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:25">2 Samuel  12:25</a>).<a name=7:7></a> So Matthew's gospel is the gospel of the Beloved, the One who is the Root and the Offspring of David.<a name=7:8></a> Solomon was in the type son from birth, God said, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son".<a name=7:9></a> So he was a son from birth, as it were, and beloved on that account.<a name=7:10></a> That is one view of Christ.<a name=7:11></a> Another view is the David view, and David became beloved because of his moral worth.<a name=7:12></a> Both these views centre in Christ, and Matthew has specially that latter side in mind in the passage I read.<a name=7:13></a> God says, "Behold my servant".<a name=7:14></a> He tells us to look at Him; we need to take account of this word "Behold".<a name=7:15></a> Fix your whole vision on Him.<a name=7:16></a> "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen", that is the David view of it.<a name=7:17></a> David had been "chosen out of the people", chosen because of his moral worth.<a name=7:18></a> God says, "I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth".<a name=7:19></a> We need to keep both views of Christ in our minds, to know Him as the Only-begotten, the only Son of the Father, but then as loved because of His moral excellency.<a name=7:20></a> Everything about

		He has put His Spirit upon Him, but in the greatness of the Father's grace He has put His Spirit upon us too that we might be in communion with Him in His thoughts of the Son.<a name=8:20></a> In what is said about the Son here there is no suggestion -- nor could there be -- of publicity.<a name=8:21></a> "He shall not strive or cry out".<a name=8:22></a> He was here to glorify God Himself.<a name=8:23></a> "A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench".<a name=8:24></a> (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:3">Isaiah  42:3</a>).<a name=8:25></a> How tenderly He regarded the work of God!<a name=8:26></a> "Destroy not him with thy meat", the apostle says, "for whom Christ has died".<a name=8:27></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:15">Romans  14:15</a>).<a name=8:28></a>

		Now I pass on to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=10:1></a> It is "An instruction".<a name=10:2></a> God would instruct each one of us as to making a song of the Beloved, and this song would help us.<a name=10:3></a> It is a Psalm; it is as the result of beholding God's King, that the pure heart and mind begins to make a song of the Beloved.<a name=10:4></a> It is a delight to God to hear songs of the Beloved going up.<a name=10:5></a> The heading of the psalm says.<a name=10:6></a> "Upon Shoshannim" which means Lilies.<a name=10:7></a> That is how saints become lilies, by being occupied with the Beloved.<a name=10:8></a> There is not much of the lily character about those who get occupied with the wrong man.<a name=10:9></a> They put on other features.<a name=10:10></a> But if you get occupied with God's Beloved, 'so spotless, pure in all His ways', you become like that.<a name=10:11></a> The lily suggests purity, chasteness, fragrance.<a name=10:12></a> Let us give our whole attention to this One whom God calls attention to, and we shall become lilies.<a name=10:13></a> It says in the Song of Songs, "He feeds his flock among the lilies".<a name=10:14></a> What environment for the feeding of the flock, so that they are found nourished in features so pure and chaste, their affections bound up with and taking character from Himself!<a name=10:15></a> So in this song, which one might call an objective view, the heart wells forth with a good matter and ranges over the glories of the King, the Beloved.<a name=10:16></a> God's thought of a king is that he is the beloved of His people, and that he reigns in love, not by fear.<a name=10:17></a> He has the willing allegiance of the hearts of all His people.<a name=10:18></a> So this Psalm of the Beloved goes over the glories of the King, His moral glories, His glories as the warrior King who overthrows every enemy, His glories on the throne and as wielding the sceptre, and His glories as in His palace -- it is a wonderful thing to be in the palace for that is where the queen is.<a name=10:19></a> And

		But in the Song of Songs the spouse takes the matter to herself; it is not now <i>the</i> Beloved but <i>my</i> Beloved.<a name=11:4></a> What an amazing thing it is when the heart realizes that the One who is God's Beloved and the Beloved can be my Beloved; so that each one of us can say, "My Beloved is mine" and then "and I am his".<a name=11:5></a> You may say, 'that is really the assembly speaking', and I do not deny that in the fulness of it, it is the assembly.<a name=11:6></a> But I believe we need to come individually also into the relationship of the wife, the spouse.<a name=11:7></a> It should be something that is real to us every day, "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit".<a name=11:8></a> According to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>we are to be married to Another, who has been raised up from among the dead; so that we are to be able to say individually, "My Beloved is mine and I am his".<a name=11:9></a> This is the secret side of the intense affections which exist between the spouse and the Beloved.<a name=11:10></a> How our hearts enter feelingly into this passage as not only knowing, but possessing, Him as our own.<a name=11:11></a> "My Beloved is mine and I am his".<a name=11:12></a> What rapture!<a name=11:13></a> "In his shadow have I rapture and sit down; and his fruit is sweet to my taste".<a name=11:14></a> Then she can describe him.<a name=11:15></a> She says, "My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand".<a name=11:16></a> He is Chief to God, He is Chief to the Father.<a name=11:17></a> The Father has made Him Chief and so that is what He is to me, "the chiefest among ten thousand".<a name=11:18></a> "His bearing

		I wish, dear brethren, to speak of beginnings, and then of Jesus as the Beginning, and of the One who speaks of Himself as the Beginning and the End.<a name=16:2></a> The One who speaks of Himself as the Beginning and the End is before all beginnings.<a name=16:3></a> John the Baptist said of the Lord Jesus that He was before John himself, but it says in Colossians, "He is before all"; and the One who is before all beginnings, must be the Source of every beginning.<a name=16:4></a> So the Scriptures commence, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=16:5></a> Every beginning involves fresh acts on the part of God and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>says, "Praise him in his mighty acts".<a name=16:6></a> There has been praise to God relative to all His operations, and that praise will grow in volume and go on to eternity.<a name=16:7></a> God said to Job, "Where wast thou when I founded the earth .<a name=16:8></a>.<a name=16:9></a>.<a name=16:10></a> when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?<a name=16:11></a>" That is not recorded in Genesis chapter 1 but actually that is what was then happening, the morning stars were singing together and all the sons of God were shouting for joy to see the earth founded.<a name=16:12></a>

		stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy.<a name=17:1></a> Another thought about the acts of God is that they are always marked by perfect wisdom.<a name=17:2></a> It says in Proverbs, in chapter 8, where Wisdom is speaking, "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old"; so that, whereas man may tell us that the creation happened by chance, and has moved on in an automatic kind of way; Scripture denies that.<a name=17:3></a> It tells us that God possessed wisdom "in the <i>beginning</i> of his way, <i>before</i> his works of old"; that means that everything was according to plan.<a name=17:4></a> Everything that God has done has been according to plan; and from Proverbs we learn that, from the very outset, wisdom's delights were with the sons of men; that is, so far as this present creation is concerned, man was in view from the beginning, before the "works of old".<a name=17:5></a> And, of course, Colossians confirms that, because it says all things were created by Christ and for Christ.<a name=17:6></a> Primarily, Christ was the Man that was in view before the works began.<a name=17:7></a> Paul's doxologies enter into all this; in his doxology to God as Creator he says, the Creator is "blessed for ever".<a name=17:8></a> Who can say that now but a Christian?<a name=17:9></a> Speaking of God as Creator "who is blessed for ever" -- not only because of His <i>goodness</i> expressed in creation; but as Christians we know the meaning of the creation; "All things were created by him and <i>for him</i>".<a name=17:10></a> This world was not created as a stage for display of man's glory and power; men are using it that way at the moment.<a name=17:11></a> They strut feverishly across the world's stage for a little while for the display of themselves, but they soon perish for ever and their name with them.<a name=17:12></a> But the Christian knows that all things were created by

		Christ and for Christ -- every mountain and hill and river and valley and island, all things visible and invisible, were created by Christ and for Him.<a name=18:1></a> And He is soon going to be manifested, the One who is "before all things", and we shall see then fully that all things created by Him were for Him.<a name=18:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we are told in Ephesians that God "created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God according to the purpose of the ages".<a name=18:3></a> If we know that now as a reason for the creation, it ought to put us all on our mettle, on the alert.<a name=18:4></a> Think of God creating "all things in order that <i>now</i> .<a name=18:5></a>.<a name=18:6></a>".<a name=18:7></a>we think of Christ filling all things in a future day, but what about now?<a name=18:8></a> You may say that creation is not serving any purpose now; but that is not so at all.<a name=18:9></a> Everything is working out according to God's will, the counsel of His will.<a name=18:10></a> And so, "God .<a name=18:11></a>.<a name=18:12></a>.<a name=18:13></a> created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God".<a name=18:14></a> Wisdom is seen in creation; but God's all-various wisdom is seen in the assembly.<a name=18:15></a> And that being so, there is no need of regimentation and sameness in the assembly.<a name=18:16></a> God's great thought is unity in variety, "all-various wisdom".<a name=18:17></a> Even as to the gifts, there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit, that is diversity in unity; "Each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to one another, as good stewards of the various grace of God;" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:10">1 Peter  4:10</a>).<a name=18:18></a> There is a great service for each believer which is inimitable and has its own uniqueness, and we are to minister

		to one another the various grace of God.<a name=19:1></a> There is great variety, and there are great things going on at the moment; creation is not in any way in vain at the moment; all things are working together for good to those who love God; and all things are working together in relation to those who form the assembly, so that even now the all-various wisdom of God might come into display before principalities and authorities in the heavenlies, even though the earthly authorities take no notice of it.<a name=19:2></a> All this should magnify the Creator in our minds and, as I say, help us as to the doxologies, because the fact that God possessed Wisdom in the beginning of His way enters into the doxologies in Romans.<a name=19:3></a> His purposes were conceived before the work began, His purpose as to Christ and the assembly.<a name=19:4></a> So Paul in those doxologies speaks of the Creator, and of Christ; and the riches of wisdom of God's judgments and ways in chapter 11 saying, "For of him and through him and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever".<a name=19:5></a> Then at the end of the epistle he speaks of "the only wise God .<a name=19:6></a>.<a name=19:7></a>.<a name=19:8></a> to whom be glory for ever".<a name=19:9></a> So that our hearts should be full of praise.<a name=19:10></a> The separate doxologies all merge into one another.<a name=19:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then if we think of that great beginning, the Incarnation -- Creation was in view of the incarnation -- again there is a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God, and they say "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=19:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>).<a name=19:13></a> It is wonderful to think that each step in God's ways has brought forth praise.<a name=19:14></a> Praise has not failed at all.<a name=19:15></a> The enemy would rob God of His praise but the praise has been there.<a name=19:16></a> What praise there was in the beginning of Luke -- what utterances!<a name=19:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And all this is to culminate in the great Hallelujahs of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>.<a name=20:9></a> We read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>in the light of Christianity; that is to say, not only in the light of the world to come -- although we love the world to come and speak of it -- but we read the Psalm too in the light of the notes of universal praise that will continue all through eternity.<a name=20:10></a> We know that what will give the lead to this universal ascription of praise will be the glory accruing to God from the assembly in Christ Jesus, the assembly giving the lead.<a name=20:11></a> In the assembly there will be ascribed glory to God in the highest, and the whole universe will become responsive in praise to God, every other family taking its cue as it were from the assembly.<a name=20:12></a> So the Psalm says, "Hallelujah!<a name=20:13></a> Praise God in his sanctuary".<a name=20:14></a> We may regard the sanctuary as His own supreme dwelling-place, but, so far as regards the created sphere, His sanctuary in that eternal day will be the assembly.<a name=20:15></a> "Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power".<a name=20:16></a> In the expanse of God's power there will be the features of light and rule corresponding to the great light, the small light and the stars of Genesis chapter 1: seen in Christ and the

		It is therefore good to take account of what this living stone, Peter, is telling us.<a name=38:8></a> Nothing could overthrow him now; he had made ever so many mistakes.<a name=38:9></a> There is not a man who ever lived who has not made mistakes, except the Lord Jesus.<a name=38:10></a> The idea of sinless walk is just nonsense in that respect; for anybody to claim, or to make a claim for other people, that they have not sinned since they received the Spirit is just nonsense.<a name=38:11></a> There is no excuse for sin  --  but we have not an example in scripture of a man who got through without sin.<a name=38:12></a> James says, "for we all often offend" (chapter 3: 2).<a name=38:13></a> He put himself among them; any person who has any sober estimate of things would put himself among the offenders.<a name=38:14></a> Peter did not need to say that; everybody knew Peter had gone wrong more than once.<a name=38:15></a> But he <i>remained a living stone</i>  --  a living stone like Peter could get right; he could write an epistle like this to the strangers scattered abroad.<a name=38:16></a>

		Peter has especially the priesthood in mind: "Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of blood of Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 2).<a name=38:17></a> There you have the priesthood; elect according to

		the foreknowledge of God, sanctified by the Spirit  --  as it says in Exodus, "The anointing shall be to you an everlasting priesthood".<a name=39:1></a> The obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is the ram of consecration; the blood of the ram of consecration.<a name=39:2></a> There is the priesthood.<a name=39:3></a> He says: "Wherefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, be sober and hope with perfect steadfastness".<a name=39:4></a> Girding up the loins of the mind, is like the girdle of the priests of Aaron's sons.<a name=39:5></a> Nothing troubles us like our minds; they wander about all over the place, instead of getting light from God.<a name=39:6></a> People even look for light, putting their problems to a human being for them to settle, instead of going to the Holiest to get the light of the Urim.<a name=39:7></a> Gird up the loins of your mind and be sober; that is like the linen vest  --  no natural excitement; and hope with perfect steadfastness.<a name=39:8></a> That is like the high caps; and lift up the head with hope, a living hope.<a name=39:9></a> That is a living burning hope  --  that is a great power in testimony.<a name=39:10></a> "Let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering, for he is faithful who has promised" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:23">Hebrews  10:23</a>).<a name=39:11></a> So in chapter two, Peter speaks of the functioning of the priest; and no wonder that this is going on today, in numerical weakness in so many localities; thank God that in some measure the holy priesthood is functioning with spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.<a name=39:12></a>

		Do we feel isolated?<a name=39:13></a> However small we may be, we belong to the <i>spiritual house</i> and the <i>holy priesthood</i>  --  a strong collective word, the priesthood, and the brotherhood which is in the world.<a name=39:14></a> And there is nothing like suffering to prove the brotherhood; the brotherhood becomes a great reality in links formed in suffering.<a name=39:15></a> And so that is how he finishes his first letter: "Knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which is in the world".<a name=39:16></a> The present sufferings are drawing together those who have come out <i>to the Lord</i>, in all parts

		And then, before I close, as for the brotherhood, the 13th verse is interesting: "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you".<a name=40:10></a> Peter is no doubt referring to the local assembly in Babylon; but he keeps to his own line, and the 'she' refers to the brotherhood.<a name=40:11></a> And so the brotherhood in Babylon salutes the brotherhood in these places where the strangers were scattered abroad.<a name=40:12></a> It is so remarkable that in the original 'brotherhood' is a feminine word.<a name=40:13></a> So it shows the sisters are not excluded.<a name=40:14></a> And finally, I want to show in a further way how Peter and Paul were linked together.<a name=40:15></a> In chapter one and verse 8, he says: "whom having not seen, ye love;".<a name=40:16></a> Now we were speaking this afternoon of 'The Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith'  --  (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:17">Ephesians  3:17</a>).<a name=40:17></a> By faith means that we have not seen Him; we walk by faith and not by sight.<a name=40:18></a> But Peter says, whom having not seen ye love; so that these strangers scattered abroad were marked by 'first love'.<a name=40:19></a> Christ was dwelling in their hearts by faith  --  not having seen Him they loved Him.<a name=40:20></a> And not only so, but "on whom, though not now looking, but believing, ye

		exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory".<a name=41:1></a> Now, you see, what Peter is speaking of these scattered souls, is as though they are in the full gain of Paul's prayer in the third of Ephesians.<a name=41:2></a> The Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith  --  though having not seen they loved  --  and exulting and filled with the glory.<a name=41:3></a> This shows that the ministry of the Apostles was <i>all one</i>, no diversion but was one.<a name=41:4></a> It shows that the scattering has in view providing conditions which are suited for the answering of Paul's prayer, that the Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith, being rooted and founded in love, we might be filled even to all the fulness of God.<a name=41:5></a>
