		This meeting, dear friends, has been convened with a view to God being pleased to help those of us who profess to be christians to understand better the ground of our profession.<a name=1:2></a> I trust that there will also be sufficient in what comes before us to make the way of salvation perfectly clear to anyone here who may not yet profess to be a christian, -- may not yet believe in the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:3></a> I trust there will be sufficient to be used of God to bring that soul to Christ so that we may all leave this room as professing christians and true believers, and, in some measure, established in the faith.<a name=1:4></a>

		I would say at the beginning that there is nothing more important for any of us to consider than our personal relationship with God.<a name=1:5></a> Compared with that, other things fade into insignificance.<a name=1:6></a> Satan, the enemy of our souls, would endeavour to make you and me put that last, to make it the last thing that we should think about.<a name=1:7></a> Whereas if we face the matter soberly and sensibly, as I may say, we shall each one surely admit that it is a matter of the very

	<div class="paragraph">
		You profess to be a christian, you have some respect for the name of the Lord and for the Scriptures, but I would like to ask you if you have certainty and assurance in your relations with God.<a name=3:3></a> God Himself is the Rock of Ages, and here in this book we have something that is abiding.<a name=3:4></a> The Lord Jesus says, "the heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:35">Matthew  24:35</a>) -- they are in this book, the Bible.<a name=3:5></a> This book has been more attacked than any book, but it still stands: the truth of it shines with greater clarity than ever before.<a name=3:6></a> The oppositions of science, falsely so-called, at the beginning of this century, have faded away; men have found out more about the creation and those cavillings have come to nothing.<a name=3:7></a> The more the truth as to the creation is discovered, the more it proves the truth of this book.<a name=3:8></a> It is a great thing that we have this book, these living oracles of God.<a name=3:9></a> This book is the most precious thing and in it is the truth.<a name=3:10></a> It is the most precious book there is.<a name=3:11></a> I trust everybody here respects it.<a name=3:12></a> I can tell you this, the more you read it and experience what it says, the more you will respect it and be assured of the truth of it.<a name=3:13></a>

		have in your relations with God.<a name=4:1></a> You are a believer, but perhaps you have not much certainty.<a name=4:2></a> It is not God's thought that you should be in doubt or uncertainty.<a name=4:3></a> God has nothing else in His mind but that you should be in certainty about the truth, more certain than of anything in this life.<a name=4:4></a> There is no reason why you should not be sure and certain, because your salvation does not rest upon anything that you have done, or could do.<a name=4:5></a> If my salvation rested in any degree upon my doings, I should be lost for ever.<a name=4:6></a> I might well be uncertain if I even had to do a part of it.<a name=4:7></a> If the Lord Jesus had done something and I had to do the rest, I might well be full of uncertainty, and the truth is it would all fail.<a name=4:8></a> If anything was left to me it would fail.<a name=4:9></a> But the great truth of the glad tidings of God -- these <i>glad tidings</i> that are meant to make you <i>glad</i>, and to be told you had to do something would never give you gladness or certainty -- these glad tidings of God rest upon a Person who can never fail.<a name=4:10></a> They all rest on the solid foundation of the Person and the redemptive work of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=4:11></a> The old hymn writer says,

		We want to get you off that shifting sand.<a name=4:13></a> You may have had mixed ideas about the ground of your salvation, but we want to bring you on to the solid Rock, and the solid Rock is Christ and His finished work upon the cross; that is the Rock I am standing

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to say a few words about that wonderful work of Jesus on the cross.<a name=6:4></a> It is referred to in the passages we have read.<a name=6:5></a> We need to understand these passages to get the assurance and certainty I have been speaking of.<a name=6:6></a> The first says, "having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God".<a name=6:7></a> That is the first thing.<a name=6:8></a> Have you peace towards God?<a name=6:9></a> It speaks in Hebrews, in the chapter out of which we read, about the worshippers once purged having no longer any conscience of sins.<a name=6:10></a> If you have once known the purging power of the precious blood of Christ, your conscience will never trouble you again in this particular way in relation to God.<a name=6:11></a> If you go on carelessly you will lose communion and your conscience will trouble you in that sense, because you will feel you have grieved the One who died for you, but you will never be afraid of the wrath to come.<a name=6:12></a> If your conscience is once purged of that fear, it is a completed matter.<a name=6:13></a> You have no more conscience of sins in the sense of being afraid of their final consequences -- "justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God".<a name=6:14></a> The word "<i>justified</i>" comes from the same root as the word "<i>righteous</i>".<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"<i>Just</i>" and "<i>righteous</i>" mean the same thing.<a name=7:1></a> "Having been justified on the principle of faith" means that having been set up in judicial righteousness before God, on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God.<a name=7:2></a> There could never be any assurance of our eternal salvation if it was not based on righteousness.<a name=7:3></a> If it was not on a righteous basis, which nobody could ever challenge, we should never be safe.<a name=7:4></a> It is a most important thing to understand that we are set up in judicial righteousness before God.<a name=7:5></a>

		The need for justification appeals to <i>guilty</i> people.<a name=7:6></a> "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:23">Romans  3:23</a>).<a name=7:7></a> Then immediately it says, "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood" (verses 24, 25).<a name=7:8></a> We are all guilty.<a name=7:9></a> We deserve the wrath of God.<a name=7:10></a> Our sins deserve eternal judgment.<a name=7:11></a> What has God done to meet that position?<a name=7:12></a> He has not overlooked our sins.<a name=7:13></a> God sent His Son, and Peter says of the Lord Jesus, "who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>).<a name=7:14></a> Jesus died as the Sin-bearer.<a name=7:15></a> He bore the judgment, He bore the wrath, He cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=7:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:1">Psalm  22:1</a>).<a name=7:17></a> He was bearing what was due to you and to me before God.<a name=7:18></a> If we had had to stand before God in our sins (and may God grant that none of us here may do so), it would mean eternal banishment from His presence.<a name=7:19></a> Not a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is the positive blessing that was in the heart of God, over and above those blessings which remove the consequences of sin.<a name=20:1></a> God's love is so great that it would not satisfy Him simply to remove the consequences of sin.<a name=20:2></a> He purposed blessing for man before the world began.<a name=20:3></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>that He marked us out beforehand -- that means before the world began -- for sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself.<a name=20:4></a> That is the greatest blessing -- <i>the blessing of sonship</i>.<a name=20:5></a>

		Sinners need forgiveness, the lost need to be found, enemies need to be reconciled: but who would have thought that those thus brought to God and cleared from all the consequences of their sins through the precious Person and work of Christ, would be given the place of sons.<a name=20:6></a> It is blessing beyond anything that could have entered into the heart of man.<a name=20:7></a> As the scripture says "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>, 10).<a name=20:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see, <i>the saved sinner was a son in purpose</i> even before he was a sinner in practice.<a name=21:2></a> God had this blessing in mind before the world began.<a name=21:3></a> Everything was prepared.<a name=21:4></a> He says, "Bring out the best robe and clothe him in it".<a name=21:5></a> He would make that returning one entirely at home in His presence, in His house.<a name=21:6></a> Who could be more at home than one who is clothed in the best robe?<a name=21:7></a> How thoroughly fitted for his place in his father's house -- a ring on his hand, sandals on his feet; it gives us an idea of the wealth of the blessing God bestows upon us.<a name=21:8></a>

		And then, if we are sons, we are also heirs, as it says in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:7">Galatians  4:7</a>, "So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God".<a name=21:9></a> I can conceive of nothing more blessed, dear friends.<a name=21:10></a> What could be greater than to be before God as His sons and heirs?<a name=21:11></a> How rich we are!<a name=21:12></a> So the blessing of God is sonship and inheritance, because God would give His sons the portion proper to sons: the inheritance.<a name=21:13></a>

		I want to say a brief word as to what this has cost.<a name=22:12></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:13">Galatians  3:13</a>, 14, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree,) that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith".<a name=22:13></a> The curse is the very opposite of the blessing.<a name=22:14></a> They are opposites just as life and death are opposites.<a name=22:15></a> Jesus died for us that we might live.<a name=22:16></a> He bore the wrath of God that we might be justified.<a name=22:17></a> But there is nothing that can be more touching than this, that Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us.<a name=22:18></a> Have you thought of that?<a name=22:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is written "Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree", and Jesus was hanged upon a tree for you and for me.<a name=23:1></a> He bore the shame of public execution, and in being hanged upon the tree He became a curse for us; the curse that the law pronounced upon us fell upon Him.<a name=23:2></a> The law was given that man might earn blessing if he could, but it proved that man could only earn the curse.<a name=23:3></a> All the law could do was to pronounce curse upon us, because we are all law-breakers, and the Lord Jesus became a curse for us in order that the blessing might come to us.<a name=23:4></a> The love of God was behind it because "when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship".<a name=23:5></a> The love of God was in this matter -- the blessed God who would not only have forgiven sinners in His presence, but sons.<a name=23:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wonder whether we have all appreciated this great blessing.<a name=23:7></a> I am assuming we are all believers here, but have we laid hold of this blessing?<a name=23:8></a> "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a>).<a name=23:9></a> Have we laid hold of that?<a name=23:10></a> You may say, I am a believer and know my sins are forgiven and I am justified.<a name=23:11></a> But have you grasped the fact that if you are a believer you are one of the sons of God?<a name=23:12></a> It says so "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", and then it says in chapter 4: 6 "But <i>because ye are sons, God</i> has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=23:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The blessing is marvellous.<a name=24:1></a> Love has abounded beyond all our need.<a name=24:2></a> It is a love which not only forgives and reconciles, but also bestows the gift of sonship upon us.<a name=24:3></a> Think of the magnitude of it -- that we might receive sonship.<a name=24:4></a> We receive it as a gift, and how?<a name=24:5></a> By faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=24:6></a> Marvellous gift of God -- sonship.<a name=24:7></a> Much less would have satisfied me: like the younger son in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>-- "make me as one of thy hired servants".<a name=24:8></a> But it would not have satisfied God.<a name=24:9></a> That is the point.<a name=24:10></a> It would not satisfy God to have us in His presence on any level less than this -- sonship.<a name=24:11></a> It is to satisfy the love of God.<a name=24:12></a> What a God He is, that we are brought into His presence in the blessed relationship of sons clothed with the best robe.<a name=24:13></a> You cannot get anything better than the best.<a name=24:14></a> How miserable are the efforts of our hearts to work out our own righteousness!<a name=24:15></a> "Our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#64:6">Isaiah  64:6</a>).<a name=24:16></a> Our efforts to merit salvation -- how wretched and miserable and doomed to failure!<a name=24:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it says "because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=25:3></a> This is a wonderful thing because God intends the relationship to be real.<a name=25:4></a> God has blessed us.<a name=25:5></a> He has made us His sons and heirs.<a name=25:6></a> All things are ours, but we have not come into the inheritance yet.<a name=25:7></a> In the meantime He has given us the Spirit so that the things that are actually future might be real and present to us.<a name=25:8></a> The moment we realise that the Spirit of God is given to us we can never doubt the reality of christianity, because we cannot limit the Spirit of God.<a name=25:9></a> God Himself, in the Person of the Spirit, has come to dwell in the believer that we might enjoy the blessing <i>now</i>.<a name=25:10></a> The Holy Spirit is the Earnest of our inheritance, and brings home to us the present reality both of the relationship and of the wealth proper to it.<a name=25:11></a>

		Now I want to touch briefly on <i>our</i> side of the matter -- as to our coming to the foundation of the blessing, and coming in <i>our movements foundationally</i> to the house of God.<a name=87:5></a> I think we see this in the scriptures in Exodus and Romans.<a name=87:6></a> They bring in our side.<a name=87:7></a> The first point in Exodus is that they shall each take a lamb.<a name=87:8></a> In Genesis, Abraham says, "God will provide himself with the sheep".<a name=87:9></a> The Father and the Son moved on together to lay that foundation in His death and resurrection.<a name=87:10></a> Then we have to come to that -- for me to come to that foundation, I have to take up the word in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>-- let each take a lamb.<a name=87:11></a> If I am to come into blessing, I must take Christ for myself as my own personal Saviour.<a name=87:12></a> Nobody comes into this blessing unless they can say, "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=87:13></a> I can see this beautiful picture presented, but unless I can say, "The Son of God, who has loved me", I am still outside of it.<a name=87:14></a> I wonder if everybody here has done that.<a name=87:15></a> I come to this, that there is no hope of my being saved or of my securing blessing by anything that I can do or anything that I am.<a name=87:16></a> <i>That is coming to foundations</i>.<a name=87:17></a> Do you think that if there was any way in which I

		Now, having reached the foundation in that way and the blessing connected with it, he touches on details connected with it from our standpoint.<a name=91:5></a> It is wonderful blessing, but can I be sure of it?<a name=91:6></a> What if someone accuses me of some sin which appears too great to be overcome?<a name=91:7></a> Paul says, "Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect?<a name=91:8></a> It is God who justifies".<a name=91:9></a> What a foundation to come to -- the Father and the Son moved together to that altar of sacrifice, and God has taken it in hand to justify us.<a name=91:10></a> If the One we have all wronged has moved to clear us, who else can make an accusation?<a name=91:11></a> "Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect?<a name=91:12></a>" That brings us to the altar -- "Who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>).<a name=91:13></a>

		"Who is he that condemns?<a name=91:14></a>" This is another point, and a deeper point.<a name=91:15></a> I may be quite clear that the death of Christ has met the question of my sins, and that I am forgiven, and I know what a christian ought to do, but I have no strength to live up to it, and am in a sense of condemnation.<a name=91:16></a> Instead of being joyful, I go about in a sense of condemnation.<a name=91:17></a> The great condemning principle was the law.<a name=91:18></a> The law tells me what I ought to do, but it does not give
