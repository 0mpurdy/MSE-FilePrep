		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak mainly upon <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#27">Leviticus  27</a>, touching on the thought of devoting and valuing as to persons, and of hallowing and redeeming as to our houses, but I want to show how these principles related to the house of God.<a name=3:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter comes at the close of a book which begins with Jehovah dwelling among His people and calling to Moses and speaking to him out of the tent of meeting.<a name=3:3></a> God had come down to dwell among His people in marvellous grace and love.<a name=3:4></a> He had come to dwell because He loved the people.<a name=3:5></a> A man dwells with those he loves, and that is how God dwells.<a name=3:6></a> As thus dwelling He called Moses out of the tent of meeting with a view to persons being free to approach Him, for God loves us to approach.<a name=3:7></a> So how fitting it is that the book should close with the kind of response on our part which would lead us to devote ourselves and hallow what we have to Him.<a name=3:8></a> What more fit answer could there be to a God who loves us so much that He does not postpone His dwelling till a future day, but comes to dwell among us here and now while we are still in mixed conditions, in the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=3:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the passage in Leviticus opens with the thought

		of a vow, "When any one devoteth anything by a vow".<a name=4:1></a> The principle of a vow is of great importance.<a name=4:2></a> In the Old Testament God secured His house on that principle.<a name=4:3></a> The light of the house of God was first vouchsafed to Jacob, and Jacob made a vow.<a name=4:4></a> He said, "If God will be with me, and keep me on this road that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and a garment to put on, and I come again to my father's house in peace  --  then shall Jehovah be my God.<a name=4:5></a> And this stone which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou wilt give me I will without fail give the tenth to thee".<a name=4:6></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:20">Genesis  28:20</a> - 22.<a name=4:7></a> That was Jacob's vow and God accepted it; it pleased God.<a name=4:8></a> The tithes were based upon it: He never forgot it.<a name=4:9></a> The tithes are referred to in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#27">Leviticus  27</a>verses 30 onwards, and as you go right through the Old Testament to Malachi God is still thinking about them, "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house", <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:10">Malachi  3:10</a>.<a name=4:10></a> God never forgot Jacob's vow, and the whole economy was based upon it, for the tithes supported the Levites, and the Levites' tithes supported the priests; so that the whole economy of Israel was made to hinge upon Jacob's vow being carried out from generation to generation.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then later, David vows.<a name=4:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>he says, "Jehovah, remember for David all his afflictions; how he swore unto Jehovah, vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob": David never forgot Jacob's vow; he went back to it.<a name=4:13></a> God was to him the Mighty One of Jacob, the One who was faithful to Jacob and brought him through and brought him to what He intended to work out in him.<a name=4:14></a> And David, like his great predecessor,

		made a vow in relation to God's house.<a name=5:1></a> He said, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob .<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a>.<a name=5:4></a>".<a name=5:5></a> He went back to Jacob in his thoughts, but how completely David devoted himself!<a name=5:6></a> We get the thought of devoting in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#27">Leviticus  27</a>in connection with the vow, and how completely David devoted himself to Jehovah the Mighty One of Jacob!<a name=5:7></a> He would not look after his own interests or his own comfort until he had found a place for Jehovah.<a name=5:8></a> And what is encouraging in these vows is that God takes account of them and appreciates them, and gives the person strength to carry them out.<a name=5:9></a> We could not do anything in our own strength; any kind of vow based on self-confidence would utterly fail, but God looks for definite committal on our part in the full light of the outshining of His love, His grace and His power.<a name=5:10></a> Power belongs to God, not to the creature.<a name=5:11></a> The creature has only strength in so far as God is prepared to give strength.<a name=5:12></a> Whether you think of the animate or inanimate creation, all strength comes from God.<a name=5:13></a> Lawless man does not admit it, but he has to come to it in the end.<a name=5:14></a> Death overtakes him and he has to feel his weakness.<a name=5:15></a> Strength belongs to God.<a name=5:16></a> But in the light of God as disclosing Himself to us, the normal response is committal to Him and reliance upon Him for grace and power to carry out what we desire.<a name=5:17></a> "We love because he has first loved us".<a name=5:18></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:19">1 John  4:19</a>, and if we love, then we want to be for Him, and He loves to see this definite response.<a name=5:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am referring to a vow in the sense of our being definite in our committal, and we can afford to be definite in the light of the way God is shining out upon us.<a name=6:1></a> He loves to see such a movement, and He will support it.<a name=6:2></a> He may have to pass us through many exercises, many things that humble us, but if it is a real vow made before Him, He will hold us to it and give us grace to carry it through, and the joy of being able to carry it through without any credit to ourselves but all to Him.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what He did with David.<a name=6:4></a> David was young when he vowed, perhaps a boy in his teens.<a name=6:5></a> He was only a youth when he slew Goliath.<a name=6:6></a> Think of what that young man did!<a name=6:7></a> So I would encourage young brothers and sisters to think of David and what he did.<a name=6:8></a> And how did he do it?<a name=6:9></a> By the Mighty God of Jacob  --  not in his own strength.<a name=6:10></a> His point of view was that Goliath had defied the armies of the living God and he relied upon the living God to be with him in going forth against that great enemy!<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I suppose it was in the early part of his life that he made this vow that he would not give sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids until he had found a place for Jehovah.<a name=6:12></a> If God has a habitation here, in a practical way, suited to Him, it is because persons have devoted themselves on the principle of a vow to God.<a name=6:13></a> If you feel that in your locality there are, at any rate to some extent, conditions suitable to God, you can be sure that one or more persons in that locality have made a definite committal of themselves to God, and you are getting the benefit, and we may say, God is getting the benefit too.<a name=6:14></a>

		So David went forward and God enabled him to carry out what he desired.<a name=7:1></a> Though he was not permitted to build the house, yet he was permitted to procure the site of it and the material for it.<a name=7:2></a> Prior to that he had put up a tent and brought the ark to Jerusalem.<a name=7:3></a> So you see what God will do for us if we are on this line!<a name=7:4></a>

		At the outset as to the tabernacle, according to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:1">Exodus  25:1</a>, it says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me a heave-offering: of every one whose heart prompteth him", How could God dwell in love amongst His people unless on the ground of their hearts prompting them?<a name=7:5></a> There is no compulsion in love.<a name=7:6></a> God could not dwell in love amongst His people if they were doing things from a sense of legal duty; "We love because he has first loved us", and our hearts prompt us.<a name=7:7></a> We are greatly touched by the thought that God desires to dwell among us.<a name=7:8></a> So it is the willing-hearted, those whose hearts prompt them, who bring the material.<a name=7:9></a> And He says, "And they shall make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them".<a name=7:10></a> What could we desire more?<a name=7:11></a> Let us all, dear brethren, be on this line!<a name=7:12></a> Let us think of the Lord Jesus, how fully committed He was, no one like Him.<a name=7:13></a> Coming into the world He said, "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body .<a name=7:14></a>.<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a> Lo, I come .<a name=7:17></a>.<a name=7:18></a>.<a name=7:19></a> to do, O God, thy will".<a name=7:20></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:5">Hebrews  10:5</a> - 9.<a name=7:21></a>

		I read the passage in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29">1 Chronicles  29</a>bearing on this idea of devotion because in connection with the tabernacle there are the willing-hearted!<a name=8:11></a> Then at the end of David's life it says of the people, "And the people rejoiced because they offered willingly, for with perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy".<a name=8:12></a> How we would desire to make David the king's heart rejoice!<a name=8:13></a> How it makes the heart of Christ rejoice when there are those on earth at the present time who

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think what we are saying shows how important <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#27">Leviticus  27</a>is, because God's house has been founded on this principle and it is to be maintained on it.<a name=9:2></a> So it says in verse 3, "When any one devoteth anything by a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah according to thy valuation".<a name=9:3></a> There are a good many persons in this room.<a name=9:4></a> According to this chapter the idea is that persons should be devoted.<a name=9:5></a> I am not speaking of devotion now in the ordinary way in which we use it, but as <i>meaning wholly given up</i>.<a name=9:6></a> When a thing is devoted it means that it is wholly given up for a certain purpose, and that is the meaning of it in this chapter.<a name=9:7></a> So God would have each one of us here fully surrendered to His will.<a name=9:8></a> The Lord Jesus was fully surrendered from the outset; "Thou hast prepared me a body .<a name=9:9></a>.<a name=9:10></a>.<a name=9:11></a> Lo, I come .<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a>.<a name=9:14></a> to do, O God, thy will".<a name=9:15></a> And now God, as having come down to dwell amongst us, is looking for this kind of response in our hearts, that we should devote <i>our</i> bodies; give them up beyond recall.<a name=9:16></a> "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:1">Romans  12:1</a>.<a name=9:17></a> This principle is at the groundwork of christianity.<a name=9:18></a> It is a Romans idea.<a name=9:19></a> Chapter 6  --  "yield yourselves to God as alive from among the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God", and chapter 12  --  "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies .<a name=9:20></a>.<a name=9:21></a>.<a name=9:22></a>".<a name=9:23></a> We have already yielded ourselves and our members, and in result, as having learnt to value

		the Spirit, we have bodies to present.<a name=10:1></a> How valuable believers' bodies are as thus presented, and it is <i>as presented they are valued</i>!<a name=10:2></a> The persons shall be for Jehovah according to "thy valuation".<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the idea of valuation comes in here, which is very important, and the valuation is according to the shekel of the sanctuary.<a name=10:4></a> It is all a question of how the matter stands relating to God and His house.<a name=10:5></a> It is the value from that angle.<a name=10:6></a> We look round among our brethren and may say, That brother is a most capable business man!<a name=10:7></a> That is good so far, but that is not the valuation here!<a name=10:8></a> What is his value relative to God and His house?<a name=10:9></a> How does he stand as weighed according to the shekel of the sanctuary?<a name=10:10></a> So you have the perfect valuation at the different ages set out here  --  Moses' valuation  --  "thy valuation".<a name=10:11></a> The perfect standard is seen fully in Christ; seen in large measure in David; seen in greater measure in Paul.<a name=10:12></a> If any man of like passions with ourselves has come up to the divine valuation, Moses' valuation, that is surely Paul.<a name=10:13></a> We would surely say of him, There is a fifty shekel man!<a name=10:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then it says in verse 8, "And if he be poorer than thy valuation, he shall present himself before the priest".<a name=10:15></a> That is very encouraging.<a name=10:16></a> Let no one here hold back because you think you are not equal to things.<a name=10:17></a> Who is equal to the full valuation?<a name=10:18></a> Who could put himself alongside Paul?<a name=10:19></a> And you could not even put Paul alongside Christ!<a name=10:20></a> Yet there is a certain valuation of <i>every</i> committed person.<a name=10:21></a> You cannot be valued until you are committed.<a name=10:22></a> You are of no specific value that could be estimated in relation

	<div class="paragraph">
		to the divine system until you have committed yourself, devoted yourself, presented your body, never to be taken back.<a name=11:1></a> Now you can begin to be valued.<a name=11:2></a> Do not think you are not worth anything and hold back on that account.<a name=11:3></a> Every one is worth <i>something</i>.<a name=11:4></a> This is not a critical valuation.<a name=11:5></a> Do not let us look round upon the brethren in a critical way to see how short each one comes.<a name=11:6></a> That is not the point here.<a name=11:7></a> The priest does not look at things that way.<a name=11:8></a> He makes the very best of everyone.<a name=11:9></a> We all feel we do not come up to the divine standard, but we can present ourselves to the priest.<a name=11:10></a> How tender the Lord is as Priest!<a name=11:11></a> He would tell us what the divine standard is.<a name=11:12></a> He has set it out in Himself  --  Moses' valuation.<a name=11:13></a> How tender Jesus is as the Priest, and we can present ourselves to Him, "Just as I am" as we sing sometimes.<a name=11:14></a> Let us present ourselves to the Lord just as we are.<a name=11:15></a> He will put a right valuation upon us, and then we would learn to put a right valuation on one another.<a name=11:16></a> There should be the priestly element in every locality, <i>and let us see that it is there</i> and that it puts a sympathetic and right valuation upon every one.<a name=11:17></a> There is no under-valuing: no criticising because of what is not there, but valuing what <i>is</i> there.<a name=11:18></a> That is the thing.<a name=11:19></a> Everyone committed to Christ is worth something, and the "poorer than thy valuation" (that is Moses') "shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his means that vowed shall the priest value him".<a name=11:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16">Romans  16</a>you see how Paul values everyone.<a name=11:21></a> What a valuation he put upon Phoebe!<a name=11:22></a> what a valuation upon Priscilla!<a name=11:23></a> what a valuation upon Aquila!<a name=11:24></a>

		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He put Priscilla first, but he valued them both, and so all the way down the chapter Paul puts his valuation on all the brethren.<a name=12:1></a> And that is how we are to look on one another; everyone who is committed is of value; the point is <i>to be committed</i>.<a name=12:2></a> Unless you are committed you are simply <i>an anxiety</i>, but the moment you are really committed to divine things on this principle of a vow and devoting yourself, you come under the priestly eye for valuation.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The value can increase: young people grow spiritually.<a name=12:4></a> "five years .<a name=12:5></a>.<a name=12:6></a>.<a name=12:7></a> unto twenty"; then when you get over twenty how greatly the value increases!<a name=12:8></a> And no one need get over "sixty" on this line of things!<a name=12:9></a> We have to see that we do not get over sixty -- that is decline.<a name=12:10></a> The idea in christianity is that however old the body gets the inward man is renewed day by day.<a name=12:11></a> Paul never got beyond sixty in this sense: he was always at the top of the valuation.<a name=12:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the house.<a name=12:13></a> "And when any one halloweth his house, that it may be holy to Jehovah".<a name=12:14></a> You will notice the word is changed.<a name=12:15></a> It does not say 'devoted' here, but "halloweth".<a name=12:16></a> A devoted thing is something entirely given over; the word hallowing means 'set apart', something that is set apart for God.<a name=12:17></a> We are all privileged to set our houses apart for God, and <i>all</i> that comes under our hand here.<a name=12:18></a> Only a person who has <i>devoted himself</i> can properly <i>hallow his house</i>.<a name=12:19></a> We must begin with ourselves, "they gave <i>themselves</i> first to the Lord", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:5">2 Corinthians  8:5</a>.<a name=12:20></a> But if we have committed ourselves on the principle of the vow, now it is our privilege to hallow what we have, set it apart for God.<a name=12:21></a> There have been times when saints have been

		called upon to devote what they had.<a name=13:1></a> In the early part of Acts it says, "for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold and laid it at the feet of the apostles"; That illustrates the meaning of devoting a thing.<a name=13:2></a> It means that it passes out of your possession.<a name=13:3></a> You sell your house, you sell your lands and you hand the whole thing over.<a name=13:4></a> There are times in the testimony when we may be called upon to devote what we have; indeed, what we put in the box on the Lord's Day is devoted; it passes out of our control.<a name=13:5></a> This meaning to the word 'devote', the word used in this chapter, is very testing.<a name=13:6></a> In what I have already been saying as applied to ourselves, it means that our bodies are devoted, they are handed over: we never again claim to be our own but are entirely at the Lord's disposal.<a name=13:7></a> That is what is involved, and it is a very testing thing, but who would want anything less?<a name=13:8></a> We are not our own: we are bought with a price.<a name=13:9></a> Then as to what we have, while under the administration of the twelve at the beginning, space was given for devoting and selling the houses and lands, and placing the proceeds at the apostles' feet.<a name=13:10></a> But, generally speaking, under Paul's ministry the idea is hallowing; setting apart what you have for God, but redeeming it.<a name=13:11></a> So it says here, "And when any one halloweth his house, that it may be holy to Jehovah, the priest shall value it, judging between good and bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.<a name=13:12></a> And if he that halloweth it will redeem his house, he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it, and it shall be his".<a name=13:13></a>
