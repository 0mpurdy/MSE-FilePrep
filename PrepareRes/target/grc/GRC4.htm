		G.R.<a name=1:2></a>C.<a name=1:3></a> It is thought that in these meetings we might pursue the subject of the rest of God -- the Sabbath.<a name=1:4></a> The 1st and 2nd chapters of Genesis have been read, so that we might get the general idea of what the Sabbath is.<a name=1:5></a> This inquiry is of importance, for the children of Israel were carried into captivity through not keeping sabbath; and a great percentage of Christians today are in captivity, the reason being that sabbath has not been kept.<a name=1:6></a> I do not think there is any alternative; we either keep sabbath, or we go into captivity.<a name=1:7></a> We might be overtaken by a different kind of captivity from others around us, and yet we have to take account of the possibility of being brought into captivity and bondage.<a name=1:8></a> I suggested reading the passage relating to Noah because it says according to the footnote that God smelled a sweet odour of rest: the idea of rest comes in there, in spite of sin having come in and judgment having fallen upon the world which then was.<a name=1:9></a> It is not called sabbath, nevertheless the idea of rest is brought in, which I think we need to understand in order to have a right present outlook on the earth and the world -- that is, the earth as bringing forth its fruit, and the world as governed by magisterial government.<a name=1:10></a> Then the word in Mark provides to some extent a key in our inquiry, namely that, "The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on

		account of the sabbath; so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath".<a name=2:1></a> I think we might well have that in mind as we look at <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and 2.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:3></a> What have you in mind in regard of the importance of keeping sabbath?<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:5></a>C.<a name=2:6></a> The idea of keeping sabbath is introduced in Exodus.<a name=2:7></a> The first formal mention of it is in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16">Exodus  16</a>, where it says, "Tomorrow is the rest, the holy Sabbath, of Jehovah" (verse 23).<a name=2:8></a> And then, when the commandments were given, they were told to hallow the sabbath day.<a name=2:9></a> They were told also (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31">Exodus  31</a>) to keep it as an everlasting covenant, and as a sign between Jehovah and the children of Israel for ever.<a name=2:10></a> But I think if we keep in mind the fact that there seems to be no alternative between keeping sabbath and going into captivity, it will help us.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:12></a> Is not the seventy years at the end of 2 Chronicles directly related to that?<a name=2:13></a> "And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; and they became servants to him and his sons, until the reign of the kingdom of Persia; to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths.<a name=2:14></a> All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years" <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#36:20">2 Chronicles  36:20</a>, 21.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:16></a> Would you say for us what going into captivity involves today?<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:18></a>C.<a name=2:19></a> I think going into captivity includes coming under bondage to feverish human activity, which centres round the glorification of man -- the Babylonish system.<a name=2:20></a> All around us there is feverish activity, and men are in bondage to it; and the only way to keep free from that is to learn to keep sabbath <i>with God</i>, which means that we appreciate what God
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		has done by Himself and for Himself and in which creature hand could have no part.<a name=3:1></a> Any activity of ours, which does not flow from an appreciation of God's rest in Christ and His completed work, is dead works; and we can soon come into bondage to dead works.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:3></a> Would you get the work of God in the six days before the sabbath is arrived at?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:5></a>C.<a name=3:6></a> It is wonderful that we have the six days of divine workmanship.<a name=3:7></a> God says to His people later, "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20:9">Exodus  20:9</a>; but first there is set out the six days of God's work, and then His rest.<a name=3:8></a> Into this work no creature hand intruded.<a name=3:9></a> So far as we know, the angels were created before the six days; they would be included in verse 1, 1 suppose; "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although the angels were there when God began working in verse 3, angels appear to have had no hand in the matter -- we are not told that any creature had a hand in the matter; God was working by Himself and for Himself.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:12></a> Would it be right to say that keeping sabbath means that the soul comes into the gain of what God has wrought for His own blessed rest?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:14></a>C.<a name=3:15></a> Just so.<a name=3:16></a> We rest with God in what He has done by Himself and for Himself.<a name=3:17></a> Man's glory is shut out of the picture.<a name=3:18></a> It is God; so that we are before God, the great Author and Finisher of everything which is for His pleasure.<a name=3:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:6></a> Does the sabbath provide for fulness, each day having its own particular glory, but all those glories brought forward into suited conditions of rest, so that the day shall be full, and fulness characterise it?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:8></a>C.<a name=4:9></a> So that, as to the sixth day, it says that, "God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good".<a name=4:10></a> It becomes superlative, does it not?<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:12></a> Yes.<a name=4:13></a> I was thinking that the glory of the work of each day would shine in its perfection in conditions of sabbath.<a name=4:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:15></a>C.<a name=4:16></a> It is wonderful to think of that.<a name=4:17></a> What was formed on each day is there in completeness at the close; and the whole is cumulative, headed up in men.<a name=4:18></a> The sabbath was made on account of man.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:20></a> Would it help us objectively to get a view of the perfection and glory of the sabbath, before we think of it in its application?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:22></a>C.<a name=4:23></a> That is exactly what is in mind; and to see that the sabbath was made on account of man.<a name=4:24></a> You could not conceive of God resting on the fifth day.<a name=4:25></a> You could not conceive of God resting until man was there.<a name=4:26></a>

		Rem.<a name=4:27></a> So that blessing is connected both with the sabbath and with man.<a name=4:28></a> God blessed man and God blessed the sabbath.<a name=4:29></a>

		G.R.<a name=4:30></a>C.<a name=4:31></a> And I think we should note that God was preparing, in those six days of operation, a setting for man.<a name=4:32></a> The sabbath was made on account of man.<a name=4:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no thought of resting until man was there.<a name=5:1></a> "Let us make man" -- a very distinctive idea as compared with the other days; the "Let us" coming in -- a matter of Divine counsel.<a name=5:2></a> "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion"; and then, in verse 27 it says, "And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them".<a name=5:3></a> So that God was working to provide conditions of life for man, and conditions in which the intelligence of man as head would find scope -- a world in which He Himself would be known through the creature who is His image; and thus He would retain His own place as Head, as Supreme.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:5></a> Is dominion important as contributing to the thought of rest -- that there should be rule and not lawlessness?<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:7></a>C.<a name=5:8></a> Yes, rule becomes prominent.<a name=5:9></a> There is the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, -- that is, there is heavenly rule.<a name=5:10></a> And then we have rule in the man and the woman -- "Let them have dominion", rule in the one who was the image of God, and in his counterpart.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:12></a> So that the thought of man includes Christ and the assembly?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:14></a>C.<a name=5:15></a> Just so.<a name=5:16></a> And here it says, "God created man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them".<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:18></a> Would you say that while Christ is the great end in view, the assembly is essential?<a name=5:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:20></a>C.<a name=5:21></a> Quite so.<a name=5:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:14">Romans  5:14</a> Christ is brought before us in the one who was the figure of Him who was to come.<a name=5:23></a> It is a wonderful thing to think of Christ thus, because the great Operator in this

		chapter was the Son; it was by Him God made the worlds; so that we hear, I suppose, His words in this chapter.<a name=6:1></a> And Hebrews tells us not only that by Him God made the worlds, but that He upholds all things by the word of His power.<a name=6:2></a> It is a marvellous thing that the One who was active in bringing everything into being, and who, ever since, has been upholding all things by the word of His power, has Himself come into manhood.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:4></a> Would you mind saying a few words as to the two words in these verses -- man earthy, and man as a race, in verses 26 and 27?<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:6></a>C.<a name=6:7></a> In each case the word is apparently 'Adam', but the first time without the article, and the second time with it.<a name=6:8></a> "Let us make man" is mankind; but the second is really that He created <i>the man</i>.<a name=6:9></a> He was the figure of the One to come.<a name=6:10></a> It would produce worship in our souls if we kept in mind that the One who is the Author and Upholder of all things has come into manhood as Firstborn of all creation, and the Image of the invisible God.<a name=6:11></a> And the assembly, as we know, is His counterpart.<a name=6:12></a> That is what God, in the figure, was working up to.<a name=6:13></a> God does not rest short of that.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:15></a> As well as the thought of rest in connection with the sabbath, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#31">Exodus  31</a>we have the added feature of refreshment.<a name=6:16></a> Are we also to take on that feature?<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:18></a>C.<a name=6:19></a> That is after the instruction as to the tabernacle is given.<a name=6:20></a> At the completion of all the instruction as to the tabernacle, typical of the great system of fragrance in which God dwells, it says, as to the sabbath, that God rested and was refreshed.<a name=6:21></a>

		G.R.<a name=7:4></a>C.<a name=7:5></a> I think it has.<a name=7:6></a> Even in our history things are not done all at once.<a name=7:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:8></a> Do you think that in the ways of God the glory of each day is yet to be arrived at, so that what is sabbatical should be introduced in its completeness?<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:10></a>C.<a name=7:11></a> Perhaps you would say a word as to your thought about the glory of each day.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=7:13></a> It is beautiful to consider that God gives each day, and the work of each day, a day to itself; for instance, "Let there be light.<a name=7:14></a> And there was light".<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God gives that a whole day, so to speak.<a name=7:16></a> Would it not refer to the glory of all that has appeared in Christ personally, and all that is to be known and to shine in its lustre in conditions of rest?<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:18></a>C.<a name=7:19></a> You would link that with the gospel of John, I suppose.<a name=7:20></a> "In him was life, and the life was the light of men.<a name=7:21></a> And the light appears in darkness".<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:23></a> Is it not interesting in that gospel that in the first day Christ is alone; God has Christ all to Himself?<a name=7:24></a> It is the second and third day when what is operational comes in.<a name=7:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:26></a>C.<a name=7:27></a> The first thing is that we should appreciate Christ in His own distinctiveness, as the One in whom was life, and the life was the light of men; and we should never do that but for the Spirit of God operating.<a name=7:28></a> We should not have eyes to see but for the operations of the Spirit, of whom the Lord says, "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit".<a name=7:29></a>

		<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:8">John  3:8</a>. Would not that link, in spiritual application, with the Spirit of God hovering over the face of the waters?<a name=8:1></a> The Spirit is operating with deep feeling, with a view to bringing to pass conditions in men's souls whereby there is power to perceive the light.<a name=8:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=8:3></a> In chapter 1 God says, "Let us make man in our image".<a name=8:4></a> In chapter 2 Jehovah Elohim says, "It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate his like".<a name=8:5></a> What is the distinction between, "Let us" and "I will make"?<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:7></a>C.<a name=8:8></a> We should note that; even in chapter 1 verses 26 and 27 the plural gives way to the singular: "God created Man in <i>his</i> image, in the image of God created <i>he</i> him; male and female created <i>he</i> them".<a name=8:9></a> Elohim is plural, but the singular pronoun is used; and that is the way God usually speaks.<a name=8:10></a> God is one; so that while there are three Persons, God normally speaks in the singular.<a name=8:11></a> But when He says, "Let us", it may be that it has reference to Divine counsel over this great matter of the making of man.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The plural of majesty would also enter into it; but I think we may be justified in seeing in it a foreshadowing of the Holy Trinity.<a name=8:13></a>

		G.R.<a name=8:16></a>C.<a name=8:17></a> I was thinking of the contrast between, "Let us", and that which precedes the operation on earlier days, where it is just, "Let there be", "Let the waters", and so on.<a name=8:18></a> This stands by itself: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness".<a name=8:19></a>

		The passage in Corinthians gives light as to how that final state is brought in -- "then the end".<a name=82:2></a> It is the eternal state -- the eighth, the last, the great day of the feast.<a name=82:3></a> And then we have the affecting verse, "then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all".<a name=82:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=85:10></a>C.<a name=85:11></a> Quite so.<a name=85:12></a> I suppose we should include the whole service the Lord did on the earth, leading up to the great sacrifice.<a name=85:13></a> But from the outset His death was in mind: He came for that purpose.<a name=85:14></a> I think we have to keep before us the main thing.<a name=85:15></a> Other things were involved in His service, and He completed everything that the Father had given Him to do.<a name=85:16></a> But His committal, "Lo, I come .<a name=85:17></a>.<a name=85:18></a>.<a name=85:19></a> to do, O God, thy will", stood related to sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin; and without that basic work, nothing else could have stood.<a name=85:20></a> And all He did in the way of helping and securing men, had in view the fact that He was going to undertake this primary mission for which He had come.<a name=85:21></a>

		G.R.<a name=99:6></a>C.<a name=99:7></a> I would say it is the way a Christian views the day of the Lord.<a name=99:8></a> He views it as knowing the Person, and having Him in supreme affection in his heart.<a name=99:9></a> And the fact that it says that the spirit of the one who had sinned might be saved in that day shows that the day of the Lord Jesus includes the judicial idea.<a name=99:10></a> Even we have to appear before the judgment seat of the Christ, and Paul says, "the <i>Lord</i>, the righteous Judge" will give him a crown of righteousness in that day.<a name=99:11></a> But then the judicial activities of the Lord usher in the day of Christ, the reign of peace, when all Christ's official glories as Man, vast as they are, will be in full display; all that He is, as the Christ, the Son of man, the Priest of the Most High God, the Son of David -- all the great offices which He fills will be displayed in resplendent glory.<a name=99:12></a> But then the time comes when He gives up the mediatorial kingdom to Him who is God and Father -- the One who gave it to Him; and it says further down, "when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him".<a name=99:13></a> That is to say, as I understand it, the Son is no longer prominent <i>as filling those great offices.<a name=99:14></a> He remains the great Mediator</i>, the One in whom God is expressed, but the mediatorial kingdom is no longer needed.<a name=99:15></a> The great offices have fulfilled their function; and so His robes of office, as it were, are no longer occupying the gaze of the universe.<a name=99:16></a> All now gives way to what He is as representing God.<a name=99:17></a>

		And now as to the question of growth: it is evident that although babyhood is a normal stage in growth, God does not intend us to remain in that stage.<a name=119:4></a> And in the writing to the little children, John writes in a very encouraging way: he says they had an unction from the Holy One and they knew all things.<a name=119:5></a> Now, that is the first great aid God has given us with regard to growth: we must all begin as babes, but even babes in the family of God have received an unction from the Holy One.<a name=119:6></a> We all have the anointing from the Holy Spirit; the word unction means anointing, but John is speaking of the inwardness of the anointing.<a name=119:7></a> Other writers usually speak of the public side of it; the priests were anointed of old -- it says "your anointing shall be to you an everlasting priesthood".<a name=119:8></a> God had anointed His priests so that all they did might be marked by holy fragrance, the holy anointing oil, the perfume after the work of the perfumer; so that they might be worthy of Him as His priests.<a name=119:9></a> That is only typical, of course, but the Holy Spirit affords the holy anointing to us so that as we move, act and speak in the power of the Holy Spirit, there is fragrance and a dignity marking the movements, the actions and the words which prove to those who hear and see that they are in the presence of those who represent God; there is the fragrance and the dignity of the anointing.<a name=119:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The special gifts are very essential for our development, our growth; that is what the babes in John's Epistle need; they have the unction and they need the gifts now to build them up so that they "may be no longer babes", as it says in this passage in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:14">Ephesians  4:14</a>.<a name=123:10></a> So we need the ministry; and as having the unction we can tell what is really ministry and what is not; and then not only shall we have milk according to Hebrews, as helped in ministry, but we shall be ready for solid food.<a name=123:11></a> The Hebrews were hindering the minister, for he wanted to give them solid food

		and they were only ready for milk; but the ministry includes the whole thing.<a name=124:1></a> It is wonderful where the gifts come from; it says: "He that descended is he that has also ascended up above all heavens", verse 10.<a name=124:2></a> That is where the gifts come from.<a name=124:3></a> We can never go there, but the One Who went there has given the gifts from that altitude.<a name=124:4></a> "He has ascended up above all the heavens that he might fill all things"; and the way He is filling the assembly at the present moment in one way is through the gifts.<a name=124:5></a> He is going to fill all things, but <i>He is already filling the assembly</i>, that the assembly may be filled with fulness -- good food as we may say -- and that it may develop full stature.<a name=124:6></a> And so it says, "<i>He</i> has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints".<a name=124:7></a> That is the whole matter; that completes the picture in its overall view -- for the perfecting of the saints.<a name=124:8></a> The perfecting of the saints covers everything; it covers my individual development, my body development, my place in the body and in the assembly; it is the whole thing -- the perfecting of the saints -- "with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full grown man".<a name=124:9></a> This scripture makes it perfectly clear why the gifts are given in connection with growth -- until we all arrive; things cannot be completed until we all arrive; because the assembly is one whole and if certain ones are defective matters cannot be complete.<a name=124:10></a> Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ.<a name=124:11></a> I take that to mean that

		they always remain babes; they always want spoon-feeding.<a name=126:1></a> Whereas the idea of the body is that it is self-supporting; gift is needed to build up the body, but the measure in which the gift is successful lies in the fact that those that are being ministered to through body-formation are self-supporting.<a name=126:2></a> They can go on without the gift; naturally nobody likes people to get on without them; they like to feel that other people are dependent on them, but that is not the service of the ministry.<a name=126:3></a> The service of the ministry, if it is successful, makes people independent of the minister, because they have grown up to Him in all things Who is the Head.<a name=126:4></a> And that is why the Epistle that brings out the headship of Christ with such distinction (Colossians) does not mention gifts at all; it shows what is available for a local company in the Head if they are set together body-wise, if they have learnt to function together body-wise, if they have been edified and built up body-wise.<a name=126:5></a> Of course those who are set together body-wise will always be glad of gifts; It has been said, in that connection, that if there is body formation the gift comes in as excess.<a name=126:6></a> Everybody is glad of some excess; but we need to keep in mind that the end in view in gifts in ministry is to build up the body of Christ.<a name=126:7></a> The portion of Divine Persons depends upon the body; Christ's portion in the assembly, God's portion in it depend on that.<a name=126:8></a> Well, I have spoken of the way we need to keep that before us; so that the gift is always used for the end for which it is given.<a name=126:9></a> I am speaking of it as a means of growth, and on that line we need to encourage one another all we can with what is coming from the Man Who has ascended up above all the heavens.<a name=126:10></a> What comes from Him is irresistible,

		Ordained ministry is just of men in itself; an ordained man may have a certain amount of gift from God, I am not saying anything against that, but <i>ordination</i> in itself is just the idea of something from <i>man</i>.<a name=127:7></a> True ministry is from heaven, and not only from heaven but from "above all the heavens"; according to the Psalm from which it is quoted it is "for the rebellious also".<a name=127:8></a> You see it has subduing power, it subdues the mind of men, and we all need our minds subdued by the word of God brought home in power; everything depends upon our minds being regulated by God's word -- the living word of God -- so that all darkening thoughts are dispersed and our minds are in the full light of God and of His mind and will.<a name=127:9></a> So that the gifts are even used to subdue the rebellious, and as it says "for the rebellious also for the dwelling there of Jah Elohim".<a name=127:10></a> Now that shows, you see, that chapter 4 of Ephesians is essential if you are to have chapter 3.<a name=127:11></a> Chapter 3 is a parenthesis; the Apostle shows what the great objective is, the assembly as the great vessel of Divine wisdom functioning and rendering glory to God -- "To Him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus".<a name=127:12></a> But if that end is to be reached, you must have the gifts, you must have the body edified so that we are set together in
