		God will maintain leadership under Himself and leadership in the ministry of the word is connected with "thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive".<a name=5:1></a> It is a touching thing that, even in this connection, according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, deity is emphasised.<a name=5:2></a> "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:10">Ephesians  4:10</a>.<a name=5:3></a> What is stressed there is that this blessed Man who descended into the lower parts of the earth has now ascended above the heavens, which implies His deity, and it is remarkable that the gifts are shown as coming from that altitude, which stresses that it is God who goes before us.<a name=5:4></a> It is from the ascended Man the gifts come.<a name=5:5></a> He ever retains His manhood.<a name=5:6></a> But we have to remember that the condition which the Lord took when here no longer remains.<a name=5:7></a> He said, "Now glorify me, thou father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>.<a name=5:8></a> Why should He say that in the presence of the disciples?<a name=5:9></a> To bring home to us that, as a glorified Man, He is <i>also</i> glorified with the glory which He had along with the Father before the world was.<a name=5:10></a> We have to distinguish between these two glories.<a name=5:11></a> He has thus ascended above all heavens and He is the One from whom all the gifts come.<a name=5:12></a> So that He is; still, in that sense, the great Leader on ministerial lines.<a name=5:13></a> "He has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds, and teachers, with a view to the work of the ministry".<a name=5:14></a> We may say that there are no apostles today, and that is true; although we have their writings.<a name=5:15></a> But Mr.<a name=5:16></a> Darby says clearly that in a lower sense apostolic gift can be said to remain, because right down the ages the Lord has reserved the right to give to certain persons specific authority.<a name=5:17></a> He quotes Luther as an example, and there are others since his day.<a name=5:18></a> While what such a person said and wrote could not be put

		Then there are not only apostles but also prophets and evangelists and shepherds and teachers.<a name=6:5></a> In all these gifts the One who has ascended above the heavens, the glorious Man, expresses Himself.<a name=6:6></a> They involve that He is leading.<a name=6:7></a> He is going before His people.<a name=6:8></a> He is really the Apostle, so that apostolic gift is but the expression of Himself.<a name=6:9></a> It comes from Himself and expresses Himself in some little measure.<a name=6:10></a> He is the Apostle, the Prophet and the Evangelist.<a name=6:11></a> He says "the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor".<a name=6:12></a> Christ was <i>the</i> Preacher; and He is still <i>the</i> Apostle and <i>the</i> Prophet and <i>the</i> Preacher, and He is still <i>the</i> Shepherd and Teacher.<a name=6:13></a> Only He delegates the work to persons He equips down here.<a name=6:14></a> "He has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists".<a name=6:15></a> <i>He</i> has given them.<a name=6:16></a> He is in charge; we cannot tell Him what to do, nor question His sovereign rights.<a name=6:17></a> The One who has gone above all the heavens is acting in sovereign grace.<a name=6:18></a> <i>He</i> is the Adonai (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68:17">Psalm  68:17</a>, 18).<a name=6:19></a> "<i>He</i> has given some apostles, some prophets .<a name=6:20></a>.<a name=6:21></a>".<a name=6:22></a>.<a name=6:23></a> Let us never forget where the gifts come from.<a name=6:24></a> If we do, we leave the faith system in a practical sense and see men as trees walking instead of seeing the Man above the heavens.<a name=6:25></a> The gifts are given for the work of the ministry, "with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man,

		If ministry is to be effective, the person must be in accord with what he ministers.<a name=7:3></a> Personal influence enters into all leadership and thus there must be moral qualifications.<a name=7:4></a> But while moral qualities must characterise those who do the work of the ministry, I would just add that all of us can have <i>some</i> part in ministry because it is said, "but to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>.<a name=7:5></a> Ministry in its widest meaning is not limited to the ministry of the word.<a name=7:6></a> The ministry of the word is in mind in the gifts -- the apostles and prophets and evangelists and shepherds and teachers -- but then there is a range of ministry in practical ways.<a name=7:7></a> The Lord says, "the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister".<a name=7:8></a> He washed their feet; He fed the five thousand.<a name=7:9></a> Phoebe was a minister of the assembly in Cenchrea.<a name=7:10></a> We can all come into this, for to each one of us has been given grace.<a name=7:11></a> We can all minister to the saints in <i>some</i> way.<a name=7:12></a> We can wash their feet.<a name=7:13></a> We can do a thousand things to express Christ and thus edify them.<a name=7:14></a> There is thus "the working in its measure of each one part".<a name=7:15></a> There is no part left out in the operations of the body.<a name=7:16></a> Some of the things we call the simplest things are the hardest things -- visiting the sick, going after those who are getting cold.<a name=7:17></a> There are thousands of brethren who can do these things better than I can.<a name=7:18></a> It is skilled work.<a name=7:19></a> One is deeply thankful to find some sister who is skilled enough to do effectively things like that.<a name=7:20></a>
