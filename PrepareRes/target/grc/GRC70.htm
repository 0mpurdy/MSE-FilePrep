		I wish to say a word, dear brethren, on the verse, "We know that the Son of God has come".<a name=1:1></a> I am sure that it is a verse that rings a note of exultation in every one of our hearts.<a name=1:2></a> We can lift up our heads in face of every foe.<a name=1:3></a> "We know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true".<a name=1:4></a> Earlier in the epistle John tells us that the Son of God has been manifested to undo the works of the devil.<a name=1:5></a> What a tremendous thing that is!<a name=1:6></a> What a colossal task to undo the works of the devil!<a name=1:7></a> But we know that He is going to do it, for He has done it for us.<a name=1:8></a> He has taken away our sins; our sins are forgiven for His Name's sake.<a name=1:9></a> He is going to take away the sin of the world.<a name=1:10></a> The sin of the world is not yet taken away in actuality, but the sacrifice necessary to remove it from before God's eye has been made by the Lamb of God of whom John the Baptist said, "that this is the Son of God".<a name=1:11></a> Had He not laid that basis in sacrifice, then the taking away of the sin of the world in power could only have been in judgment.<a name=1:12></a> But because of His sacrifice the world to come is spoken of as the habitable world.<a name=1:13></a> That is, it will be inhabited with redeemed people, but with sin taken away.<a name=1:14></a> At the present time He is operative in freeing us from the law of sin in our members, in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=1:15></a> Not that we will ever be able to say that we are without sin.<a name=1:16></a> He

		has taken away our sins, but He is operative to deliver us from the power of sin.<a name=2:1></a> All this is involved in undoing the works of the devil.<a name=2:2></a> How will He take away in power the sin of the world?<a name=2:3></a> By making <i>God the Centre</i>.<a name=2:4></a> The very principle of sin is that man has made himself the centre.<a name=2:5></a> "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower .<a name=2:6></a>.<a name=2:7></a>.<a name=2:8></a> and make ourselves a name".<a name=2:9></a> Man has made himself the centre, and the Lamb of God has come so that, eventually, self will be displaced as the centre of man's life and activities, and God placed in the centre; God known in Christ.<a name=2:10></a> 'Our God the centre is'.<a name=2:11></a> In a world where our God is the centre there will be righteousness instead of sin.<a name=2:12></a> Everything will revolve around God made known in the Person of His Son.<a name=2:13></a> The divine thought is that that should be true of Christians now, as well as true finally in a universe of bliss, and true for ever, beyond the possibility of corruption, in the eternal state.<a name=2:14></a> But the Son of God is operative that it might be true of us now, that self, whether religious self or any other kind of self, might be taken away as the centre and spring of our lives, and God known in Christ become the very centre of everything for us, as the operative spring of all our actions.<a name=2:15></a> That is the taking away of sin in power, and we have been given the Holy Spirit, almighty as He is, to dwell in us that God may now be supreme in us, that we may think God's thoughts and have God's feelings instead of the thoughts and feelings of the flesh, which are sin.<a name=2:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a colossal task then is the complete taking away of sin, and therefore the undoing of the works of the devil in every sphere including the religious sphere where, alas, we have increasingly witnessed the

		works of the devil!<a name=3:1></a> The power of the Son of God and of the Spirit of God can meet all these.<a name=3:2></a> The Son of God has wrought redemption that we might be set free, not only from our sins, but from this terrible principle of sin, so that with triumphant note we can say that the Son of God has come.<a name=3:3></a> You may ask, how can we be in the good of this?<a name=3:4></a> Well, by living by the faith of the Son of God.<a name=3:5></a> Paul tells us in Galatians chapter 2 how he was free of it all.<a name=3:6></a> "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next chapter he shows that living by the faith of the Son of God is synonymous with walking in the Spirit, because when he applies it to the Galatians he says, "having begun in Spirit are ye going to be made perfect in flesh?<a name=3:8></a>" He showed them how he was walking in the Spirit, that is, living by the faith of the Son of God; that is how you walk in the Spirit.<a name=3:9></a> We receive the Spirit on the principle of faith and we get the benefit of Him on the principle of faith.<a name=3:10></a> You may say, what is the faith of the Son of God?<a name=3:11></a> Well, it means that self has gone from before your vision and the Son of God controls you, God made known in His Son.<a name=3:12></a> It means in a practical way that we are freed from the dominion of sin, that though the sin of the world is not taken away yet, it is not operative in regard to you.<a name=3:13></a> So you are living by the faith of the Son of God.<a name=3:14></a> Mr.<a name=3:15></a> Raven said that one of the great weaknesses in Christians is that they recognise that they must be justified on the principle of faith but they do not accept the fact that they can <i>only live</i> on the same principle.<a name=3:16></a> Living by faith means that I am living on that principle

		The Son of God came to undo the works of the devil, and Paul preached the Son of God as soon as he was converted, and you see the works of the devil undone in Saul of Tarsus as an example for us all; a man from whose vision self had gone.<a name=4:8></a> Up to a certain point in his life he did not know a better man on earth than Saul of Tarsus.<a name=4:9></a> He had never met one; in his own estimation, Saul of Tarsus was the very best man living.<a name=4:10></a> You know, if you analyse your own heart by nature, if you get to the bottom of it, you will find that is true of you.<a name=4:11></a> You may not be able to say that you are the cleverest man on earth, but you would not change with the cleverest man.<a name=4:12></a> You would not change your personality.<a name=4:13></a> You love yourself a bit more than the cleverest man.<a name=4:14></a> You may think you would like to be the king but that does not mean that you would change your personality with the king.<a name=4:15></a> You are much too good a man for that.<a name=4:16></a> You would like to be in his job, that is all.<a name=4:17></a> You would think you could do it a lot better than he did.<a name=4:18></a> If we analyse our hearts we are all more or less like Saul of Tarsus in that we have never met a better man than ourselves.<a name=4:19></a> But God's grace operates; and it operated in Saul of Tarsus till he came to it that he had never met a worse man than himself.<a name=4:20></a> That is a great triumph of grace.<a name=4:21></a> He

		for God; and you leave them all in His hand.<a name=7:1></a> All this and much more is involved in the Son of God having come, and His having come to undo the works of the devil.<a name=7:2></a> We know He has come because in some measure at any rate the devil's works have been undone in us and we are living in relation to God's eternal system of glory, and affections which will go on through all eternity are flowing into our souls, the love of the Father and the Son, and the love of the Spirit known to us, sustaining us.<a name=7:3></a> All this is very wonderful.<a name=7:4></a> So one would desire that we might be in victory.<a name=7:5></a> "Who is he that gets the victory over the world?<a name=7:6></a>" You see, if we know something of what I have been saying, the next way Satan would entrap you is by the world, and he will use that also all along the line.<a name=7:7></a> When he cannot ensnare you any more on the line of self and pride, because the Spirit of God is bringing it about that Christ is your Object as a permanent matter, then he will try to lead you away by idolatry.<a name=7:8></a> "Love not the world nor the things in the world".<a name=7:9></a> "Children, keep yourselves from idols", John says at the end of his epistle.<a name=7:10></a> What will give us the victory over the world is <i>living faith in the Son of God</i>; and that is what we need, victory in every way.<a name=7:11></a> Victory over Satan; victory over the power of sin; and then victory over the things of the world, which is perhaps the last matter we get victory over.<a name=7:12></a> The way of it is believing, livingly, on the Son of God as the One, as we each can say, "who loved me and gave himself for me".<a name=7:13></a> What therefore can I do but live for Him and to Him?<a name=7:14></a> Now Hebrews develops this, and of course it involves the great theme of the incarnation.<a name=7:15></a> You cannot conceive anything greater than the incarnation.<a name=7:16></a> I am not suggesting it is greater

		than the death of Christ or His resurrection; but it is inconceivably great.<a name=8:1></a> "We know that the Son of God has come".<a name=8:2></a> Ages and generations awaited that event; and when the fulness of the time was come God sent forth His Son.<a name=8:3></a> All God's operations looked on to this great event, the incarnation.<a name=8:4></a> Knowing that the Son of God has come means that we know that a Person of the Godhead has become flesh and that in so doing He chose to enter into the relation of Son.<a name=8:5></a> So that the epistle ends, "he is the true God"; the One who in manhood is known as the Son of God is Himself no other than "the true God" and we worship Him thus.<a name=8:6></a> I hope we all know what it is, in prostration of soul, to say what Thomas worshipfully said, "My Lord and my God".<a name=8:7></a> That Jesus is "the true God" is what the incarnation means; the true God, co-equal with the Father and with the Spirit in eternal Godhead; but He is also, in coming into manhood, the "eternal life" in the very expression of God's thought of life for men.<a name=8:8></a> That is, God's thought of life for us was that we should live for ever in relationships and affections which are eternal and incorruptible.<a name=8:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Hebrews deals, among other things, with the incarnation; and one thing that is very wonderful is that we are allowed to be brought into the secret of what passed between Divine Persons in their communications in relation to One coming into the world.<a name=8:10></a> I would advise everyone here to read what Mr.<a name=8:11></a> Darby says in the Synopsis on Hebrews chapter 10 and what Jesus says as "coming into the world".<a name=8:12></a> We are privileged to have this disclosed to us.<a name=8:13></a> "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared, me a body".<a name=8:14></a> His language is that of a Person of the Godhead making this great move.<a name=8:15></a> As J.<a name=8:16></a>N.<a name=8:17></a>D.<a name=8:18></a> says,

		He was perfect in it, but being perfected means that He had to go through experiences as Man which He could not have had in Godhead, in order to be

		And then may we move on to other expressions which are disclosed to us -- I am not referring to them all.<a name=10:9></a> At the end of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>it says, "And, thou, in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.<a name=10:10></a> They shall perish, but thou continuest still".<a name=10:11></a> That is quoted from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>.<a name=10:12></a> It is the answer from God to what
