		I desire to say a word about <i>God Himself</i>.<a name=1:1></a> The expression comes into the last passage we have read, "God himself shall be with them, their God", and in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>Jehovah says to the children of Israel, "I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to <i>myself</i>".<a name=1:2></a> There can be no greater blessedness than to know God Himself.<a name=1:3></a> He has redeemed a people, of which Israel was but a type, that we, in our day, might know God Himself.<a name=1:4></a>

		Redemption has involved the outshining of the glory of God in its radiance.<a name=1:5></a> God's glory was seen in creation; the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows His handiwork, but the radiancy, the full radiancy of God's glory is now shining in the face of a Man.<a name=1:6></a> The face of a man (I am speaking now of man as a creature) is a wonderful creation.<a name=1:7></a> The face of a man is capable of reflecting the attributes of God; that is not true in the same sense of any creature other than man.<a name=1:8></a> A man's face can express love, pity, compassion, mercy, joy, anger and God made man in His image and glory that man's face might be expressive of these things.<a name=1:9></a> Man sinned and comes short of the glory of God; but God has displayed His glory in a surpassing way in effecting redemption.<a name=1:10></a> Paul speaks of subsisting glory, abounding glory and surpassing glory in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>.<a name=1:11></a> The ministry of righteousness abounds in glory; it is God's righteousness with glory bright that is ministered in the gospel.<a name=1:12></a> The way God has wrought in redemption is so glorious that it has brought all that He is in His nature and attributes into display.<a name=1:13></a> And all is shining in the face of Jesus Christ, the Man who effected redemption, the Man who glorified

		The value of being in it, the only reason we want to stay in it, is because of the opportunity to learn God.<a name=5:10></a> God is with us in it, so we are not asking to be taken out of it.<a name=5:11></a> The Lord did not ask for His own to be taken out of it.<a name=5:12></a> He said, "I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil".<a name=5:13></a> "Sanctify them by the truth.<a name=5:14></a> Thy word is truth".<a name=5:15></a> So the wilderness is a most valuable place, because we have the companionship, if I might use such a word, of God Himself.<a name=5:16></a> We are brought to God.<a name=5:17></a> The Lord has suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God.<a name=5:18></a> Far be it from us, dear brethren, to look upon this world as anything but a wilderness from now onwards, however we may have regarded it hitherto.<a name=5:19></a> It was when the children of Israel accepted the wilderness, that the glory of Jehovah appeared.<a name=5:20></a> They had passed through the Red Sea, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, the apostle speaks of our being to another, to the Christ.<a name=8:10></a> We "have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ", speaking to us of the love of the Christ.<a name=8:11></a> When His body is mentioned, His love is especially in mind.<a name=8:12></a> Think of the love of that blessed Man, the One of whom, when Paul speaks of His coming after the flesh, He says immediately, "Who is over all, God blessed for ever", yet truly Man.<a name=8:13></a> We are dead to the law by His body.<a name=8:14></a> The law condemned us to death, the death of a curse, and He has taken that upon Himself, in His body, so that the bond of law, which could only bring condemnation and death, might be broken, and that we might be to Him.<a name=8:15></a>

		Then in chapter 8, where it is a question of sin in the flesh, we find that our wants and woes bring suited grace.<a name=9:7></a> There is the grace and love of the Father in chapter 6, the grace and love of the Lord Jesus who has delivered us from the power of law and the curse in chapter 7, the grace and power of the Spirit delivering us from the law of sin and death in chapter 8.<a name=9:8></a> "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus", Paul says, "has set me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=9:9></a> So in these chapters we come to know, in an experimental way, the God who has borne us on eagles' wings and brought us to Himself.<a name=9:10></a> We begin to learn what the word 'Himself' means; we begin to have experimental knowledge of the love and grace of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:11></a> And it is well to note how much is said about the Holy Spirit in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, because in the wilderness we so specially need the Spirit and all that He would be to us in our life of responsibility and testimony, our wilderness life of suffering here.<a name=9:12></a> Let us explore more and more what the Spirit would be to us.<a name=9:13></a> He dwells in us, sets us free from the law of sin and death, is life in us, giving us power to put to

		As we enter the realm of purpose, we discover the <i>riches</i> of the Father's glory as coming into a realm where every family is named of Him in heaven and on earth.<a name=12:1></a> We enter into the wealth of the Father's love in a way that we could not do in the wilderness.<a name=12:2></a> The wilderness is unique and will never be repeated, but it is in view of our reaching, even now in our spirits, the realm of purpose, where as having known the glory of the Father in the wilderness we now can apprehend the riches of His glory.<a name=12:3></a> Also we have known the love of the Christ in the wilderness, but according to this prayer, we are to know the love of the Christ <i>which surpasses knowledge</i>.<a name=12:4></a> It is fulness here.<a name=12:5></a> In Romans it is, "Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ"; that is in the wilderness, but when we come to the realm of purpose, and know love in its own sphere, it is the love of the Christ <i>which surpasses knowledge</i>.<a name=12:6></a> Similarly, as to the Spirit, Paul prays that He would <i>strengthen</i> us with <i>power</i> by His Spirit in the inner man.<a name=12:7></a> We have the idea of the power of the Spirit in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, but here there is a double thought, "that he would give you to be <i>strengthened</i> with <i>power</i> by his Spirit".<a name=12:8></a> Everything here is superlative, and so it is said that we might be "filled even to all the fulness of God".<a name=12:9></a> It is God Himself in His fulness.<a name=12:10></a> We begin with being baptised to the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and we end with being filled to "all the fulness of God".<a name=12:11></a> It is the same preposition meaning "to" or "into".<a name=12:12></a>

		The verses in Revelation go on to finality, in the new heavens and the new earth, and we have this final word, "the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and <i>God Himself</i> shall be with them, their God".<a name=12:13></a> The men that God Himself is with includes the assembly, and no doubt includes the other saved families of men.<a name=12:14></a> But the assembly forms the tabernacle
