		G.R.<a name=4:1></a>C.<a name=4:2></a> We may say Jacob's vow was not on a very high level, but I think he said what was right.<a name=4:3></a> The "if" is not from the standpoint of doubt.<a name=4:4></a> In the sense of our own weakness, we can only make a vow as contingent upon what God has committed Himself to.<a name=4:5></a> I do not think the "if" meant to imply doubt as to whether God would do it, but to indicate the basis on which Jacob could commit himself.<a name=4:6></a> There is no other basis on which we can commit ourselves to God.<a name=4:7></a> The flesh profits nothing.<a name=4:8></a> It is in the light of God's committal to us, and contingent upon His faithfulness which we know will ever be true, that we can commit ourselves to Him.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:10></a> In that sense is the vow made with the greatness of the whole divine system in mind?<a name=4:11></a> There may be guidance from the Spirit as to the way in which the vow works out practically in detail, but do we begin with the glory of the whole system -- the heavens and the earth as Jacob viewed them?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:13></a>C.<a name=4:14></a> It is true that Jacob was not yet at home with God; there were things to be settled, as there are with all of us.<a name=4:15></a> We need not wait for everything to be settled before we make our vow; God will see to the settlement.<a name=4:16></a> So that Jacob was not happy in this place; he says, "How dreadful is this place!<a name=4:17></a> this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven".<a name=4:18></a> But, nevertheless, wonderful light comes into his soul as to the whole system: "And behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to the heavens.<a name=4:19></a> And behold, angels of God ascended and descended upon it.<a name=4:20></a> And behold, Jehovah stood above it".<a name=4:21></a> There is, no doubt, much to learn in those statements.<a name=4:22></a>

		with angels.<a name=5:1></a> God purposes to dwell with men, and He has a supreme interest in the men whom He has foreknown.<a name=5:2></a> He has set His love upon them, and nothing will ever turn Him aside -- "Jacob have I loved".<a name=5:3></a> Of course Jacob early began to justify the Divine choice, no doubt because of the operation of the Spirit in him.<a name=5:4></a> The Spirit often begins to work early in those foreknown of God.<a name=5:5></a> With John the Baptist the work appeared before natural birth, and Paul said he was separated from his mother's womb; so that God's sovereign choice early begins to justify itself.<a name=5:6></a> It says of Jacob that he was a homely man, and God loves a homely man.<a name=5:7></a> Jacob was a homely man dwelling in tents, and Esau a man of the field, a man of the world; and you can understand that if God is going to have a house, and dwell with men, He would dwell with homely people.<a name=5:8></a> Homely people are easy to live with; a man of the world is not at all easy to live with.<a name=5:9></a> A man of the world does not shine at all at home, but the features proper to home life appeared early in Jacob, with a view to God's house.<a name=5:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:11></a> Do you see something significant in the expression, "And behold, Jehovah stood above it"?<a name=5:12></a> The word "stood" here signifies 'stationing Himself'.<a name=5:13></a> Does that mean that for the moment all operations proceed from God, and again lead back to God, God taking the chief place there?<a name=5:14></a>

		G.R.<a name=6:16></a>C.<a name=6:17></a> I should like more help as to the ladder.<a name=6:18></a> When moral questions are settled, and Jacob returns to Bethel, there is not a ladder.<a name=6:19></a> Chapter 35: 13 implies that God is down alongside him, because it says, "And God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him".<a name=6:20></a> So that God was there in His house, and Jacob was on happy terms with God.<a name=6:21></a> It was no longer a dreadful place to Jacob; it was a delightful place, a place where God talked with him.<a name=6:22></a> In our early history we are apt to think of God as far off; we think of Him in heaven, which is, of course always true.<a name=6:23></a> But it dawns on us as time proceeds that God is dwelling in His house down here, a wonderful thing.<a name=6:24></a> So even in our first impression of the house of God it may be that we are still thinking of God as at a distance.<a name=6:25></a> A young believer thinks of God in heaven; in prayer he prays to God in heaven; but it is another thing to pray in the consciousness that God is dwelling among us, and walking among us,
