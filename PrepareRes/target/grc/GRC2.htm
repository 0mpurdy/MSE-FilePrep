		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> In looking into this epistle we may consider, in the five readings, the greatness of the Person of Christ, the greatness of His priesthood, the greatness of His high priestly work in the offering of Himself, and then the greatness of the Christian approach and service.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering these things we shall also be impressed with the greatness of God.<a name=1:4></a> The expression "the greatness" is used in verse three, "set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high".<a name=1:5></a> Again in chapter 8: 1 - 2, it says, "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places", showing that the service of God as established in Christianity proceeds in the presence of the greatness, the Minister of the holy places having sat down there.<a name=1:6></a> We need to accustom ourselves to what is great; and indeed to become more accustomed to what is spoken of as "the greatness".<a name=1:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 the greatness of the Son is stressed.<a name=1:8></a> It is a stabilizing thing for our souls to apprehend the greatness of Christ.<a name=1:9></a> If understood, this would free us from the vauntings of men.<a name=1:10></a> We are living in days when the pride of man is very much in evidence, especially in his achievements.<a name=1:11></a> But man and his glory fade into complete insignificance in the light of the greatness of the Son.<a name=1:12></a> In chapter 2: 9 He is called <i>Jesus</i>.<a name=1:13></a> Think of how great <i>Jesus</i> is!<a name=1:14></a> In chapter 1, amongst other things, it says, "by whom also he made the
