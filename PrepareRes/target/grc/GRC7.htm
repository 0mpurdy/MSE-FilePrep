		G.R.<a name=1:2></a>C.<a name=1:3></a> It is in mind in these readings to consider PROGRESS IN RECOVERY, noting that the progress was mainly in three stages; first, the building of the altar and its functioning, then the building of the house and the establishment in a definite way of the priesthood as indicated in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>, and then, under Nehemiah, the building of the wall and its dedication; having in view that we should see an analogy in our own times in the history of the recovery in which we have part.<a name=1:4></a> We would bear in mind that, while these things were consecutive relative to the material altar and the material house, they run concurrently in our case, although they were somewhat consecutive in their initiation.<a name=1:5></a> So that we are still getting help as to the altar; and it is manifest that the building of the house has to continue, because, apart from anything else, fresh generations come along, and we "are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit".<a name=1:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:22">Ephesians  2:22</a>).<a name=1:7></a> And it is similar with the wall.<a name=1:8></a> But the exercise as to the building of the wall has become more prominent in this later stage of the recovery.<a name=1:9></a> Thus the three things run on concurrently with us, although, as I say, there is a certain moral order, and, to some extent, an historical order in the history of the present revival.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we consider the altar, I thought we might seek help as to the relations of the returned captives with the authorities.<a name=1:11></a> In the return from the captivity the relationship between the authorities and the people of God assumed great importance.<a name=1:12></a> So this book opens with "And in the first year of Cyrus

		king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia".<a name=2:1></a> And then verse 5 brings out another principle, namely, that God co-ordinates what He does in government with what He is doing in grace; and so it says, "the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin rose up, and the priests, and the Levites, even all those whose spirit God had stirred, to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem".<a name=2:2></a> Thus God was operating in stirring up the spirit of Cyrus and at the same time He was operating in stirring up the spirit of the chief fathers, and the priests, and the Levites, and of others; and that is a very important and comforting principle.<a name=2:3></a> God is "the blessed and only Ruler .<a name=2:4></a>.<a name=2:5></a>.<a name=2:6></a> , the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship".<a name=2:7></a> (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:15">1 Timothy  6:15</a>).<a name=2:8></a> He has never abdicated; He is on the throne, although He rules, as it were, behind the scenes.<a name=2:9></a> And all that He does in government, if we have eyes to see it, co-ordinates with what He is doing in grace and recovery.<a name=2:10></a>

		And the Lord Jesus Himself has part in this in our day.<a name=2:11></a> He enters into the matter of government where it affects the testimony and the church.<a name=2:12></a> He has sat down with His Father in His throne.<a name=2:13></a> So, when things affect the testimony, He says as to Jezebel, "I cast her into a bed" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:22">Revelation  2:22</a>).<a name=2:14></a> He does not say that the Father would do that, but <i>He</i> would do it, and that has involved great governmental movements in Europe, as well as spiritual movements amongst His people.<a name=2:15></a> Then He says, "I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>).<a name=2:16></a> That applies, not only to the spiritual door that is opened, but also to the governmental door: the Lord has done it relative to divine operations in grace.<a name=2:17></a> He says, "because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my

		Rem.<a name=3:5></a> And so we see God in His overruling power and sovereign movements, taking up heads of governments and making them favourable to His people.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> Yes, and I think that would show the need of being up to date in the matter: that is, to understand the present position relative to government.<a name=3:9></a> What would you say to that?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:11></a> I am sure that is right.<a name=3:12></a> We need to move with God in what He is doing in providing conditions and moving heads of government to make them favourable to His people even now.<a name=3:13></a> So that what you say, one feels, is important.<a name=3:14></a> We should be conscious of what God is doing and take advantage of what He is doing, would you say?<a name=3:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:23></a>C.<a name=3:24></a> There are the words of Jeremiah as to the seventy years (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#25:11">Jeremiah  25:11</a>, 12; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#29:10">Jeremiah  29:10</a>), and then Isaiah, years before, had prophesied concerning Cyrus.<a name=3:25></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#44:28">Isaiah  44:28</a>, Jehovah said of Cyrus, "He is my shepherd, and he shall perform all my pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundations shall be laid".<a name=3:26></a> Then in chapter 45 Jehovah calls him "his anointed .<a name=3:27></a>.<a name=3:28></a>.<a name=3:29></a> , whose right hand I have holden", and God would "break in pieces the brazen doors, and cut asunder the bars of iron" (verse 2).<a name=3:30></a> And in verse 4, Jehovah says, "I surnamed thee, though thou didst not know

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:7></a>C.<a name=4:8></a> I think we are living in a day which is different from that at the beginning of the revival.<a name=4:9></a> According to <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#1">Ezra  1</a>"Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus" and it is remarkable that, concurrently with the raising up of J.<a name=4:10></a>N.<a name=4:11></a>D.<a name=4:12></a>, many ruling powers of the western world became particularly favourable to all Christian work and endeavour, as freed from the influence of Jezebel, so that there was great liberty to go forward during last century.<a name=4:13></a> But it does not say in <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#1">Ezra  1</a>that they made any request to Cyrus.<a name=4:14></a> But sixty-nine years after, when Ezra came up, in the reign of Artaxerxes, it says in chapter 7, verse 6, the latter part, "And the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him".<a name=4:15></a> Then thirteen years after that, in chapter 1 of Nehemiah, we find the same king on the throne, and in chapter 2 of Nehemiah, verse 4, "the king said to me, For what does thou make request?<a name=4:16></a>".<a name=4:17></a> The king was inviting him to make request.<a name=4:18></a> I believe that is the kind of day we are living in.<a name=4:19></a> God has determined that the dispensation should end in glory, and, in order that nothing should hinder His people, He has brought about an unexampled state of affairs, where rulers in the western world are willing to listen to requests relative to Christian conscience.<a name=4:20></a>

		G.R.<a name=5:1></a>C.<a name=5:2></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>is a very interesting passage as to God ruling, because the Lord is introduced in that gospel as "Son of the Highest" (i.<a name=5:3></a>e.<a name=5:4></a> Most High) (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a>).<a name=5:5></a> And Zacharias, in his praise, appears to call the Lord Himself the Most High, for he says of John the baptist, "And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:76">Luke  1:76</a>).<a name=5:6></a> Thus the title "Most High" comes into Luke, the Lord even saying to His own, "ye shall be sons of the Highest" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#6:35">Luke  6:35</a>).<a name=5:7></a> That title is prominent in Daniel (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#4:17">Daniel  4:17</a>, 25).<a name=5:8></a> "The Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will".<a name=5:9></a> Then in verse 35 "and he doeth according to his will in the army of the heavens, and among the inhabitants of the earth".<a name=5:10></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>shows how much God used rulers at the time of the incoming of the One who is called the "Son of the Most High", and the faith that marked the saints at that time was wonderful.<a name=5:11></a> Had faith not been active, unbelief would have reasoned that everything was going wrong  --  the journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem at such a time, and then the crowning trial that, when they got there, there was no room for them in the inn!<a name=5:12></a> It looked as though the Most High was not ruling at all!<a name=5:13></a> Yet he was ordering everything, because it was essential that, when the Son of the Most High came, He should be born in the most low circumstances; not only in Bethlehem, but in a manger.<a name=5:14></a> The Most High orders everything, but faith alone apprehends it.<a name=5:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:16></a> You would see a kind of parallel, too, with Aquila and Priscilla.<a name=5:17></a> All the Jews had been ordered to leave Rome and it was a long way from Rome to Corinth and transport would not have been easy; but in the governmental ways of God they were put in touch with Paul, and assembly truth was developed in them and through them.<a name=5:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:9></a>C.<a name=6:10></a> God has, in many instances, ordered such things relative to the testimony.<a name=6:11></a> For instance, the Grecian empire, while it was hostile to God's people and used as a disciplinary agent yet, God developed in that empire a language He intended to use for the New Testament Scriptures, a language in which divine thoughts could be expressed accurately.<a name=6:12></a> We see similar overruling in current time, in that large areas of the world are acquainted with the English language.<a name=6:13></a> Every one in India for instance, who is educated, knows English and speaks and reads it excellently.<a name=6:14></a> God is over these things.<a name=6:15></a> Then, as regards the Roman empire, the commission was "Go, walk to and fro through the earth", according to <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:7">Zechariah  6:7</a>; and that Roman empire, under God's ordering, opened up the roads for the early evangelists.<a name=6:16></a> Since then the extension of it, in the western world, has opened up vast means of communication and transport, including air travel, the primary purpose for which, under God, is the testimony.<a name=6:17></a>

		G.R.<a name=6:21></a>C.<a name=6:22></a> The silver, I think, would be just that.<a name=6:23></a> The Persian empire recognised God's rights over His people, and there are governments of this character today; whereas the brass of the Grecian empire indicated that God can, and does, use government as

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:8></a>C.<a name=7:9></a> I believe it is a feature of the present time which we should take account of and, in a right sense, take advantage of.<a name=7:10></a> It has been founded on the blood of martyrs.<a name=7:11></a> The background of Cyrus's attitude and activities would, no doubt, be the faithful stand of Daniel and his companions.<a name=7:12></a> Daniel was put into the den of lions by Darius the Mede, who was linked with Cyrus in the conquest of Babylon.<a name=7:13></a> He continued, it says, to the first year of Cyrus.<a name=7:14></a> So that there was the background of faithfulness, even to death.<a name=7:15></a> And then the king, Artaxerxes, who listened to the requests of Ezra and of Nehemiah, was the son of Esther's husband, so that he would be well acquainted with the suffering testimony of Esther and Mordecai, as well as having knowledge of Daniel's history.<a name=7:16></a> Artaxerxes was the son of Ahasuerus.<a name=7:17></a> These things are the background underlying the state of affairs whereby the authorities were amenable to request in respect of conscience before God, and the position is similar today.<a name=7:18></a> We look back to the Reformation and the blood of the martyrs; we look back to the sufferings of saints during the centuries that followed.<a name=7:19></a> All these sufferings have been borne, and, in result, we now have a condition of things in the western world where the authorities are prepared to listen to request in connection with the rights of God over His people relative to His house; and I do not think those who suffered and died, would be at all pleased with us if we did not avail ourselves of

		Ques.<a name=8:3></a> Does it appear that the prime thought in God's mind in handling government is in view of His own thoughts spiritually in connection with His people, that these should have place and development amongst His own, leading to His outstanding thoughts in the assembly?<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:5></a>C.<a name=8:6></a> That is just what I think.<a name=8:7></a> So that what He is doing in government is co-ordinated with what He is doing in grace.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=8:9></a> As to the reference to the purpose of God in Ephesians, we have reference to "the good pleasure of his will" (chapter 1 verse 5) and to "the mystery of his will" (verse 9), and then He is spoken of as "him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will" (verse 11).<a name=8:10></a> Does that fit in with the thought before us?<a name=8:11></a>

		of Christ, borne by those who render testimony now.<a name=9:1></a> "Martyr" means "witness".<a name=9:2></a> But, since conditions have been brought to pass where we are at liberty to make request, it is not only that we desire to have freedom to be here for the will of God without hindrance, but it affords an opportunity to keep the testimony of God before those in authority, which is a very great thing.<a name=9:3></a> The testimony has been impressed upon them in the past, through the sufferings of the saints, and it is now to be kept before them in a right way, one would judge.<a name=9:4></a> We do not know how far-reaching the effect of such testimony will be in influencing them in their general outlook and policies.<a name=9:5></a> It is impossible to measure the effect of a true testimony as to God, His grace, and His rights.<a name=9:6></a> I believe it is in that way that the Spirit restrains.<a name=9:7></a> "There is he who restrains" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:7">2 Thessalonians  2:7</a>).<a name=9:8></a> I do not think the Spirit of God acts directly on these men unless they have some measure of faith themselves  --  of course, Nebuchadnezzar had and, no doubt, Cyrus had faith as time went on.<a name=9:9></a> But I would think the primary way in which the Spirit restrains is through the influence and testimony of the saints.<a name=9:10></a> Additionally, of course, there is angelic restraint.<a name=9:11></a>
