		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a> - 20; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:1">Revelation  2:1</a> - 4.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=1:2></a>C.<a name=1:3></a> The thought in mind in these readings is to consider the ways in which John saw the Lord Jesus in the book of Revelation.<a name=1:4></a> It says in chapter 1:7, "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him"; but, meantime, John saw Him in varied glories, and he put on record, "all things that he saw" (verse 2), in order that we might be affected by these presentations of the Lord with a view to our recovery to first love.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an impressive fact that the whole book is addressed to the assemblies.<a name=1:6></a> The Lord Himself says.<a name=1:7></a> "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", chapter 22:16.<a name=1:8></a> That does not refer only to the first three chapters, but to the whole of the book; and one's impression is that the distinctive ways in which the Lord is seen are all needed if our souls are to be so affected that we are recovered to first love.<a name=1:9></a> The book closes with recovery to first love, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=1:10></a> The bride is there in line with the Spirit as having apprehended the various ways in which her Beloved has presented Himself.<a name=1:11></a> And then the book closes with a word from the bondman.<a name=1:12></a> It is essential that we should be individually recovered to bondmanship if there is to be corporately the true bridal response to Christ.<a name=1:13></a> Thus the book closes with the bondman saying, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".<a name=1:14></a> Nothing he could desire could compare with the coming of his Lord.<a name=1:15></a>

		In chapter 1 the great presentation of Christ is in verses 13 - 16; but then He is also presented in verse 1 as Jesus Christ, the recipient of the revelation which God gave to Him; in verse 5 as, "the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth .<a name=2:1></a>.<a name=2:2></a>.<a name=2:3></a> who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father"; in verse 7 as coming, "with the clouds, and every eye shall see him"; and in verse 8 we read, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty".<a name=2:4></a> It is God speaking, yet there seems to be no doubt that the actual Speaker is the Son.<a name=2:5></a> That verse is an example of the way John indefinably blends God and Christ in some of his statements.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:7></a> Is that to preserve us as to the oneness of the Deity?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:9></a>C.<a name=2:10></a> I think so.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:12></a> Would you say that there is any significance in that Paul's first church letter deals with bondman service -- "to serve a living and true God", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:9">1 Thessalonians  1:9</a>?<a name=2:13></a> That word 'serve' is bondman service.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:15></a>C.<a name=2:16></a> So we have to take account of verse 1, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his <i>bondman</i> John".<a name=2:17></a> It is a fundamental matter that we should gladly accept the place of bondmanship; in fact, one would judge that there is no overcoming apart from it, for at the close of each of the addresses to the assemblies, He says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=2:18></a> The great feature of the Hebrew bondman was that he had
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		an ear, and his ear was bored to the doorpost; and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>it says, "Ears hast thou prepared" (or 'digged') "me".<a name=3:1></a> So I do not think that an overcomer exists apart from one who recognises himself as the slave of Jesus Christ.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:3></a> Has it to do with the ability to receive divine communications and spiritual impressions?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:5></a>C.<a name=3:6></a> I think so.<a name=3:7></a> The Hebrew bondman's ear would carry the mark of his bondmanship, and would indicate what he had committed himself to in love.<a name=3:8></a> Applying this to ourselves, we should be marked off in this world as those entirely available for the command of our Lord and Master.<a name=3:9></a> Of course the relationship of sonship is always there.<a name=3:10></a> The Lord Himself says, ".<a name=3:11></a>.<a name=3:12></a>.<a name=3:13></a> that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has commanded me, thus I do", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:31">John  14:31</a>.<a name=3:14></a> The proof of His love for the Father was in His bondmanship, for as the Father commanded Him so He did: His ear was bored in that sense.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:16></a> Is an example seen in Simeon in Luke's gospel?<a name=3:17></a> Simeon means hearing, and he says, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:29">Luke  2:29</a>.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:19></a>C.<a name=3:20></a> That is an interesting allusion.<a name=3:21></a> The man who has the ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies is the man who is committed in bondmanship to the Lord.<a name=3:22></a> His ear, in principle, has been bored, and that would be a public witness to his bondmanship.<a name=3:23></a> The Lord says as to Himself, ".<a name=3:24></a>.<a name=3:25></a>.<a name=3:26></a> that the world may know that I love the Father".<a name=3:27></a> How was the world to know, except by the path of devotion the Lord was on?<a name=3:28></a> The first reference to <i>responsive</i> love in scripture is the love of the Hebrew bondman.<a name=3:29></a>

		You have a father's love to a son in Abraham, and Isaac's love to Rebecca; but on the line of response, you have in the Hebrew bondman, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free".<a name=4:1></a> The Lord was here as the perfect expression of that, but the ear bored means that the world knows something about it.<a name=4:2></a> The Lord was here in the path of bondmanship, though He were Son.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#15:16">Deuteronomy  15:16</a>, where the language is a little different, it says, "because he loveth thee and thy house".<a name=4:5></a> This also leaves the door open for the handmaid (verse 17).<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:7></a>C.<a name=4:8></a> Deuteronomy shows more especially the way we come into it.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:10></a> Does not the understanding of the book depend upon bondmanship?<a name=4:11></a> The revelation is specifically to, "his bondman", so that the difficulty in understanding has to be traced to failure to take up bondmanship?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:13></a>C.<a name=4:14></a> The bondman is the only trustworthy person, and is therefore the only person to whom God will commit His secrets.<a name=4:15></a> Jesus Christ is the great pattern for us; it is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him" -- given to Him as a glorified Man, the One proved to be so worthy of divine confidence.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:17></a> The Lord says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>.<a name=4:18></a> He manifests Himself to such.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:20></a> Does the idea of purchase come into bondmanship?<a name=4:21></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>it says, "If thou buy a Hebrew bondman".<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:23></a>C.<a name=4:24></a> It does as regards ourselves.<a name=4:25></a> We could not apply that part of the type to the Lord Jesus; but, as

		to ourselves, it says twice over, "Ye have been bought with a price".<a name=5:1></a> Paul closes <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6">1 Corinthians  6</a>by saying, "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?<a name=5:2></a> for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body"; and in chapter 7:23 he says, "Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of men".<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:4></a> Is not Joseph the first person to be called a Hebrew bondman?<a name=5:5></a> And did he not stand before Pharaoh as a bondman?<a name=5:6></a> And did not Pharaoh say, "Since God has made all this known to thee, there is none so discreet and wise as thou.<a name=5:7></a> Thou shalt be over my house", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:39">Genesis  41:39</a> - 40?<a name=5:8></a> He had been an initiated person, even in the prison.<a name=5:9></a> He had made known the dreams to the cupbearer and the baker, and comes forward as such a person; and he is given a responsible place in the administration of affairs.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:11></a>C.<a name=5:12></a> So John, in captivity as a true bondman, is let into divine secrets which run on to our day and on to the end, and he is to pass these things on.<a name=5:13></a> They are for all the bondmen.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:15></a> In the beginning and the end of the book the Lord says, "the time is near".<a name=5:16></a> The saints should have minds and hearts open to the glories of Christ in view of the urgency of the moment.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:18></a>C.<a name=5:19></a> We need to understand these presentations of Christ in order to be true bondmen, and in order to be marked corporately by the features of the bride.<a name=5:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:21></a>C.<a name=6:22></a> That is the point in the verse, "Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:14">John  15:14</a>.<a name=6:23></a> The bondman is one who does whatever he is commanded, and he is elevated to the place of friend; he is trustworthy -- one to whom the Lord would delight to disclose every secret.<a name=6:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:25></a> Do you think that in view of the urgency of the things spoken of, and the knowledge that the Spirit is intent upon affecting the assembly in the closing moments, the full acceptance of bondmanship is an obligation which rests upon each one of us?<a name=6:26></a> There may be matters about which we have had reserves.<a name=6:27></a> Would not the acceptance of bondmanship settle all things?<a name=6:28></a>

		G.R.<a name=7:6></a>C.<a name=7:7></a> Very much so!<a name=7:8></a> Love is the motive seen in the Hebrew bondman; but we have to recognise, as a basic matter, that we have no right to any other position.<a name=7:9></a> We are not our own, we have been bought with a price.<a name=7:10></a>

		G.R.<a name=7:16></a>C.<a name=7:17></a> Bondmanship is a basic idea in coming into the gain of the kingdom.<a name=7:18></a> The word there is, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=7:19></a> I think the force of the word 'kingdom' in that passage is that we are given part in royalty.<a name=7:20></a> But then the only persons capable of sustaining the dignity which God puts on us -- the dignity of royalty and priesthood -- are those who are committed to the Lord in bondmanship.<a name=7:21></a>

		Rem.<a name=7:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>it says, "And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation".<a name=7:23></a>

		G.R.<a name=10:7></a>C.<a name=10:8></a> That scripture confirms what has been said as to the link between bondmanship, and bridal and wifely affection.<a name=10:9></a> As remarked earlier, this book closes with the bondman saying, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".<a name=10:10></a> The bondman's affections and interests are wholly bound up with his Lord; all he desires is that his Lord should come.<a name=10:11></a> Where that feature marks the individuals, you will find, corporately, bridal and wifely response.<a name=10:12></a> So Abigail, a type of the assembly, says, "Behold, let thy handmaid be as a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:41">1 Samuel  25:41</a>.<a name=10:13></a>

		G.R.<a name=45:2></a>C.<a name=45:3></a> We are considering in these readings the way the Lord is presented in the book of Revelation, it being the mind of God that we should apprehend Him in each of the settings in which He is seen, the whole book being addressed to the assemblies -- "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>; and the result of it is that there is recovery to first love at the close of the book -- "The Spirit and the bride say, Come", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>.<a name=45:4></a> Recovery to first love is brought about through an apprehension of glories, which, it would appear, John himself had not seen before.<a name=45:5></a> It was not that John himself needed recovery; but the assembly needed it, and we all need it.<a name=45:6></a> We have considered the Lord as presented in chapter 1, and again in chapter 5; and the main subject of consideration in this reading is the male son in chapter 12, caught up to God and to His throne; and the coming forth of Christ in chapter 19, at the head of His armies.<a name=45:7></a> One verse in particular shows a link between the passages.<a name=45:8></a> In chapter 12: 5 it says, "She brought forth a male son, who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod"; and in chapter 19: 11 and in 15 John says, "I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and one sitting on it, called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war in righteousness .<a name=45:9></a>.<a name=45:10></a>.<a name=45:11></a> And out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he might smite the nations; and he shall shepherd them with an

	</div>

		The consideration of Christ, as presented in these chapters, will involve seeking help on travail, as seen in the woman, with a view to the male son being brought forth; and also on the marriage of the Lamb, because those who form the wife constitute the armies.<a name=46:3></a> We should notice that the setting of both scriptures is one of conflict and warfare, the Lord being finally seen as the great Warrior.<a name=46:4></a> The bringing forth of the male son is in a setting of conflict; then there is war in heaven; and then a retrospective view of the present conflict in the celebration in heaven -- "they have overcome him", it says, "by reason of the blood of the Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony, and have not loved their life even unto death", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12:11">Revelation  12:11</a>.<a name=46:5></a> It will no doubt apply to others after we have gone, but it is also a retrospective view of the conflict of our dispensation, which has its own character.<a name=46:6></a> Then in chapter 19 the warfare is brought to finality.<a name=46:7></a> It says in verse 20, as to the beast and the false prophet, "Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone".<a name=46:8></a>

		Similarly, in reading the book of Revelation, in whatever way the Lord may be presented, we must never overlook one of His final assertions in the book.<a name=102:1></a> He says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:13">Revelation  22:13</a>.<a name=102:2></a> The One who said this is the One who said, "Behold, I come quickly" <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:12">Revelation  22:12</a>.<a name=102:3></a> If we hold this truth in our hearts and minds, we shall be preserved worshipfully in relation to the Person of Christ.<a name=102:4></a> It will not detract from the reality of His Manhood, because, if such a Person is found in figure as a Man, He must be absolutely perfect in the condition into which He came; He could not be other than absolutely perfect in any position or relationship He might be pleased to enter into or take up.<a name=102:5></a> Thus, if the Word became flesh, as He has done; and if He became dead, as He did become; and if He is now living to the ages of ages, as He is; we see in Him Manhood in absolute perfection, without a flaw in any way; and we delight in Him as Man, because all our blessing depends upon His having become flesh, His having become dead, and His living again to the ages of ages.<a name=102:6></a> But, while we delight in every feature and every glory which attaches to Him in manhood, if we remember who He is we shall be preserved from ever bringing Him down in our minds to our level.<a name=102:7></a>

		Now, I pass on to the other John, the disciple that Jesus loved.<a name=111:2></a> We have been occupied with him as the bondman in Revelation, as it says at the beginning of the book, "he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John".<a name=111:3></a> What a favour it would be if the Lord could speak of anyone of us like that!<a name=111:4></a> John wanted no other place; he never calls himself an apostle.<a name=111:5></a> I am not suggesting that either Peter or Paul called themselves apostles for any selfish reason; they certainly did not; they both called themselves bondmen, and put the word bondman in front of apostle when using both; but John never speaks of apostleship; he is just, "His bondman John".<a name=111:6></a> And because he was Christ's bondman, he was, in a peculiar way, His friend.<a name=111:7></a> The John we have spoken about already was the friend of the Bridegroom; but the John we are speaking about now was, in a special way, the friend of Christ.<a name=111:8></a> That is what is implied in what is said in the passage we have read.<a name=111:9></a> "Peter turning round sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?<a name=111:10></a>" In chapter 13 it is also said that John was in the bosom of Jesus.<a name=111:11></a> That is the place of friendship.<a name=111:12></a> Friendship with Divine Persons is a wonderful thing; it is altogether on a different level from friendship as commonly spoken of amongst men.<a name=111:13></a> Friendship, in the divine sense, means a bosom friend; the secrets of the bosom are confided to such.<a name=111:14></a> How is it the Lord can confide secrets to persons?<a name=111:15></a> Because they are truly bondmen!<a name=111:16></a> He can trust His bondmen; He makes them His friends.<a name=111:17></a>

		So here it says, "The disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=112:1></a> That is how John refers to himself.<a name=112:2></a> Jesus loved all the disciples, but this one knew His love in a surpassing way.<a name=112:3></a> As a matter of time, this was written after the Revelation.<a name=112:4></a> John is the bondman in Revelation, but in writing the gospel he says, "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=112:5></a> He is referred to thus four times.<a name=112:6></a> Three times he uses the basic word for love as here, 'the settled disposition'; but on one occasion he uses the love of friendship -- "the disciple to whom Jesus was attached".<a name=112:7></a> The remarkable thing is that, at the end, Peter turns round and sees this one following.<a name=112:8></a> What a remarkable thing!<a name=112:9></a> John had been following all the way, and Peter looks round and sees him following.<a name=112:10></a> It was so evident that he was following, that Peter took account of it.<a name=112:11></a> Here was one who was following.<a name=112:12></a> The Lord Jesus had said to Peter, "Follow me", and Peter looks round and sees someone doing it.<a name=112:13></a> John was doing it.<a name=112:14></a> So Peter says to the Lord, "Lord, and what of this man?<a name=112:15></a> Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=112:16></a> Follow thou me".<a name=112:17></a> Those are the last words of the Lord in this gospel.<a name=112:18></a> That would be the Lord's command to each one of us here -- "Follow <i>thou</i> me".<a name=112:19></a> Who could think of disobeying a command like this when we think of who He is!<a name=112:20></a> Think of those first three verses of the gospel again, and of Who it is saying, "Follow thou me".<a name=112:21></a> Do not look at other people, do not be concerned with what others do; "Follow <i>thou</i> me".<a name=112:22></a> But John was already doing it, and the Lord said, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=112:23></a>" Now John is the one who abides till the Lord comes -- not personally, of course.<a name=112:24></a> John has gone to be with the Lord.<a name=112:25></a> He abides in his ministry, but that is

		not the only point here.<a name=113:1></a> The main point is that persons of this character are going to abide until the Lord comes; and the question is, Are we in this matter?<a name=113:2></a> There are going to be persons until the Lord comes who are like John; there will be such until the end.<a name=113:3></a> The point for you and me is, are we of this character -- persons who assume no official position or place, but love to be His bondmen?<a name=113:4></a> Persons who are conscious of His love, disciples whom Jesus loves, follow all the way.<a name=113:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That kind of person will be here when the Lord comes; and the word to each one of us at a time like this is -- Am I going to be among those who are marked by such features?<a name=113:6></a> So, at the end of Revelation, when the Lord speaks His last word, "He that testifies these things says, Yea, I come quickly", there is the bondman, the one who tarries till He comes.<a name=113:7></a> He is there and says, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".<a name=113:8></a> That is the language of the heart of every bondman.<a name=113:9></a> May it be ours, for His name's sake!<a name=113:10></a>

		Now it is a wonderful thing that the Lord Jesus Himself affords us a great Model on this line, though entirely different from us in the manner of His bondmanship.<a name=115:4></a> We were thinking of Him today, as recorded in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:6">Philippians  2:6</a>, "who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God".<a name=115:5></a> It was evident when He was here that He did not esteem it an object of rapine to assert His equality with God; but it says, He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men" and then it goes on "having been found in figure as a man".<a name=115:6></a> God has great thoughts of dignity connected with man, and the Lord was found here in figure as a man.<a name=115:7></a> Headship, kingship, and priesthood belong to man.<a name=115:8></a> But being found in figure as a man, He did not, at that time, claim those official positions, though they are His by right, but He "humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross.<a name=115:9></a> Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name that which is above every name".<a name=115:10></a> We see Him now as the Priest and King, God's anointed.<a name=115:11></a> God bears witness to Him as such.<a name=115:12></a> But He, in infinite grace, has reached that position by way of bondman service, becoming obedient even unto death and that the death of the cross.<a name=115:13></a> He went into depths which the creature could never fathom;

		The taking a bondman's form was His own act.<a name=116:12></a> "Once here in the form of a bondman, Thou servedst for wages of love".<a name=116:13></a> The Hebrew bondman is a great type.<a name=116:14></a> It says, if he came in with his body, he could go out with his body (see footnote to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21:4">Exodus  21:4</a>, New Translation).<a name=116:15></a> But if he said plainly, I love my master, my wife, my children, I will not go out free, then certain consequences were to follow.<a name=116:16></a> Thus the Lord Jesus served for wages of love.<a name=116:17></a> Love led Him to empty Himself and take a bondman's form; taking His place in the likeness of men to do bondman service; not, at that point, to take up His kingly position, but to do bondman service even unto death, even to the point of being made sin.<a name=116:18></a> And so, in His case, it was a matter of His body.<a name=116:19></a> He came in with His body, and bondmanship affects <i>our</i> bodies.<a name=116:20></a> According to
