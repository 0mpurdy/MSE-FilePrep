		G.R.<a name=16:1></a>C.<a name=16:2></a> I have suggested these scriptures as feeling the need to be prepared to stand alone with one's link with the Lord.<a name=16:3></a> I do not mean by that to isolate oneself from others, but the need to be sure in our souls where we individually stand as to the truth and the path we tread; so that we are not dependent on human aid, though very thankful for it.<a name=16:4></a> But one feels the need of intimate personal relations with the Lord as having an understanding with Him and experience with Him, so that we individually know where we stand, and that we may be able to say like Luther in his day -- though the circumstances are different in connection with the truth at issue -- "Here I stand, I can do no other".<a name=16:5></a> He was not looking round at that moment for human support.<a name=16:6></a> It was what he had arrived at with the Lord and a stand from which he could not move because he was there with the Lord.<a name=16:7></a> I believe it is needful in our day, one feels it for oneself, to arrive at that kind of point in soul-history because there is a good deal of doubt and confusion around.<a name=16:8></a> Surely the Lord would help each one of us to have our feet firmly planted so that we can say, 'Here I stand, whatever others may do; here I stand, I can do no other'.<a name=16:9></a> In principle it is like the end of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>where the soul says as the outcome of his deep exercises, "I myself with the mind serve the law of God".<a name=16:10></a> Whatever others may do, "I myself with the mind serve the law of God".<a name=16:11></a> Of course he adds, "but with the flesh the law of sin" because he has now learnt that the flesh is not subject to the law of God; it cannot be.<a name=16:12></a> Nevertheless

		there is the resolve as to himself, which would be his primary consideration, that 'here I stand'.<a name=17:1></a> If others are prepared to stand with me, good!<a name=17:2></a> we thank God for that; but the point is, here I stand, I can do no other.<a name=17:3></a> We do not want to make a false stand, of course, but one would desire for oneself to reach such an understanding with the Lord, assured in one's own soul of being on <i>divine</i> ground, and there you stand whatever others do; so that we are in peace of mind as to consequences though we shall need sustaining as to this.<a name=17:4></a> I have cited Luther, and while at that time he stood inflexibly for the truth of justification by faith, and the gain of the consequences of his stand remains for us, yet later in other matters he was not on divine ground.<a name=17:5></a> We are at the end of the dispensation and the Lord would have us on divine ground in <i>every matter</i>.<a name=17:6></a> The saints have gradually been recovered to the truth and the word of the Lord is, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".<a name=17:7></a> He says, "I come quickly;" there is not a long time during which we are to hold fast.<a name=17:8></a> Personally I desire to be perfectly sure as to the ground I stand on in relation to the Lord.<a name=17:9></a>

		R.W.<a name=17:10></a> Is it interesting the way in which Joshua rehearses to the children of Israel their history as about to leave them, and at the end he challenges them as to their future and whom they are going to serve; and then he says, "But as for me".<a name=17:11></a> Is that the thought in mind?<a name=17:12></a>

		G.R.<a name=17:13></a>C.<a name=17:14></a> Yes, I think it is.<a name=17:15></a> "But as for me and my house".<a name=17:16></a> Whatever others did, he was committed.<a name=17:17></a> You get the same idea with Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 when God says, "As for me" and He says what He would be to Abraham, but then He says, "As for thee", and circumcision was the bond of the covenant.<a name=17:18></a> There was that clear understanding of the ground on which he was with God and God with him.<a name=17:19></a> That was a personal matter with Abraham;

		G.R.<a name=18:7></a>C.<a name=18:8></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=18:9></a> It is.<a name=18:10></a>

		J.L.<a name=18:11></a>W.<a name=18:12></a> Is that why you brought in the altar?<a name=18:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=18:14></a>C.<a name=18:15></a> Yes.<a name=18:16></a> I thought that in these three scriptures we have first the thought of pillars.<a name=18:17></a> Now a pillar can stand by itself.<a name=18:18></a> It does not need propping up, otherwise it would not be a pillar, it would not serve its purpose.<a name=18:19></a> A pillar can stand by itself and can support other things, and so the pillars round the court were supporting the hangings, the five cubits of fine linen round the court.<a name=18:20></a> The pillars refer to the saints in their public testimonial position; they can be seen by everybody, and there they stood, each pillar standing on its own base, not only needing no support itself in that sense but supporting, with the help of neighbouring pillars, the curtains of fine linen.<a name=18:21></a> I thought we might get some help there as to taking up our position as pillars in the public testimony.<a name=18:22></a> And then in Peter it is again a personal matter as to where he stood with the Lord, and I would apply that to our arriving at our foundation in the Lord Himself.<a name=18:23></a> All these thoughts are foundational.<a name=18:24></a> Peter learnt in that experience to come to the Lord as the Living Stone.<a name=18:25></a> God says in Isaiah chapter 28 -- and it is quoted in Peter's first epistle chapter 2 -- "Behold, I lay for foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation".<a name=18:26></a> And Peter walking on the water to go to the Lord is like a saint seeking to be here for God in testimony where there is no foothold at all, no foundation or place of

		standing, the waves and water being unstable and turbulent.<a name=19:1></a> Such are the days we live in.<a name=19:2></a> But in coming to the Lord he came to stability, the foundation that God had laid in Zion, "a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation".<a name=19:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In relation to the corner-stone we are apt to think of the Lord as the head of the corner, which is true, i.<a name=19:4></a>e.<a name=19:5></a>, the top corner stone; but the initial thought in the corner stone is relative to the foundation; because it is from the foundational corner stone that all the measurements for the building are taken.<a name=19:6></a> In one sense everything depends on the foundation corner stone being properly laid.<a name=19:7></a> So that in coming to the Lord as the Living Stone we are on the sure foundation.<a name=19:8></a> It is true He will be the head stone -- that is the top corner stone when the building is completed -- and we want to reach that in faith now.<a name=19:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third scripture it is a question of going forth to Him, again a personal matter.<a name=19:10></a> Going "forth to Him without the camp".<a name=19:11></a> There is much in a human way to support you in the camp.<a name=19:12></a> All the systems that are built up by men are aimed at supporting and holding people in those systems.<a name=19:13></a> But we go forth to Him; we do not go forth to any man-made system; we go forth to Him as the Centre of a system which is apprehended in faith.<a name=19:14></a> It needs that personal going forth outside the camp to Christ as the One who is the Inaugurator and Sustainer of the faith system, if we are to really serve God acceptably.<a name=19:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		R.W.<a name=20:3></a> Is it striking that Paul in writing to those at Galatia refers to James and Cephas and John who, he states, were conspicuous as being pillars and gave to him and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship?<a name=20:4></a> Do you think that where there is definiteness -- persons being prepared to stand -- others will be drawn to them?<a name=20:5></a>

		G.R.<a name=20:6></a>C.<a name=20:7></a> Well, I think that.<a name=20:8></a> The pillars round the court would be conspicuous in the public eye as upholding the testimony of God -- they not only supported the curtains, but they were protective to the whole tabernacle system.<a name=20:9></a> They stood relative to the tabernacle as a whole, and that is what we are to do, each one of us, our prime responsibility in life is to stand true to the tabernacle system.<a name=20:10></a> I am speaking now spiritually; the tabernacle of witness or testimony being the assembly, and that vessel of testimony is one body, and one house or habitation of God in the Spirit.<a name=20:11></a> And therefore it is governed by one set of divine principles, the law of God.<a name=20:12></a> There are not two sets, there are not two bodies, there are not two or more houses of God; therefore it is one body, one house and one set of principles, and those principles were established by the sacrifice of Christ at the altar, and I take my stand there.<a name=20:13></a> I cannot therefore go on with anything contrary to the truth of the one body, the one house of God, and one law of God -- the law of His house.<a name=20:14></a> I have a base of copper to stand on, and that means that I am standing in conformity with the One who gave His life and His all that the one body might be established, that God's house might be set up -- the spiritual house -- and that the law of God might prevail to the ages of ages, in new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness.<a name=20:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=21:4></a>C.<a name=21:5></a> Well, that bears on what has just been said, that a pillar in that way becomes rightly in God's ways conspicuous and we can no doubt count on God to gather others on the same basis; but we have to begin with our own personal understanding with the Lord about this matter.<a name=21:6></a> What is my own understanding with the Lord?<a name=21:7></a> What am I here for?<a name=21:8></a> I would say that my main purpose in life, however little I may answer to it, is to stand for the truth, and in its application to our responsible pathway here it is a question of standing for the truth of the one body, the one house of God and the one law of God which governs that one body and that one house -- and not deviating, because the Lord Jesus did not deviate.<a name=21:9></a> He went right through to the Cross, the zeal of God's house devouring Him, and there offered Himself on the altar without spot to God to uphold God's glory for ever and to establish these things.<a name=21:10></a> Am I then going to give up what Christ gave His all to establish?<a name=21:11></a> Am I going to surrender the truth of the one body and the truth of the one house of God, and prevailing of the law of God?<a name=21:12></a> Am I going to surrender these at the last moment?<a name=21:13></a> "I come quickly" the Lord says.<a name=21:14></a> How can I surrender these things?<a name=21:15></a> but then I would like to be more settled in my soul with the Lord about them.<a name=21:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=22:6></a>C.<a name=22:7></a> Well I think so, but our ability to stand is going to depend on this which, as I say, I feel the need of -- I do not know whether other brethren feel the need of it, but I feel the need of it myself -- of getting down to things with the Lord and knowing where I stand.<a name=22:8></a> The Scriptures are written to help us to know where to put our feet down.<a name=22:9></a> The first thing is, as pillars round the court, to put our feet down, each of us, on the bases of copper and say 'I am not going to leave that, let others do what they will'.<a name=22:10></a> I am no longer a pillar in God's mind if I have left the base of copper.<a name=22:11></a>
