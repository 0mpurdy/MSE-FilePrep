		G.R.<a name=39:2></a>C.<a name=39:3></a> I thought we might consider the Service of the Tabernacle, this being the term used in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#3:8">Numbers  3:8</a> in relation to the charge placed upon the tribe of Levi; and a similar expression occurs towards the end of chapter 1.<a name=39:4></a> In considering this, a verse in the end of 1 Corinthians comes to mind, "Be vigilant, stand fast in the faith; quit yourselves like men; be strong.<a name=39:5></a> Let all things ye do be done in love".<a name=39:6></a> Levitical service is not the only work, and we are called into all the varied work and service of the tabernacle which begins with the military side.<a name=39:7></a> From twenty years old and upwards, all the males in Israel (except the tribe of Levi) were numbered for military service.<a name=39:8></a> There was no exemption from that service; so that the first thing is to recognise that we are soldiers of Jesus Christ, or as it might read (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:3">2 Timothy  2:3</a>) "soldiers of Christ Jesus", the glorified Man; we are His soldiers; and no one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, for he is at the command of the One who has enlisted him as a soldier.<a name=39:9></a> That is fundamental.<a name=39:10></a> As soldiers we surround the tabernacle, God's habitation, so that God might dwell there, as it were, in peace and restfulness.<a name=39:11></a> Then in the nearer circle were the Levites, who encamped round about the tabernacle, according to chapter 1; whilst Moses and the priestly family, Aaron and his sons, encamped before the tabernacle eastward, the service of the priests being the most important service.<a name=39:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the first verse we read, chapter 3: 10 reads -- and we need to note what it says -- "and Aaron and his sons shalt thou appoint that they may attend to their

		priest's office".<a name=40:1></a> That is the greatest office, and it was an exacting office, but one, of course, fulfilled in love, as Jehovah said: "Israel is my son, my firstborn .<a name=40:2></a>.<a name=40:3></a>.<a name=40:4></a> Let my son go, that he may serve me".<a name=40:5></a> So the relationship we are in is that of sons; the office to which we are appointed is that of priests.<a name=40:6></a> We need to distinguish between relationship and office.<a name=40:7></a> We are sons of God -- firstborn sons -- through faith in Christ Jesus, and therefore it is not an irksome matter to be appointed to office; and God has appointed us to the <i>highest</i> office, that of priests, and we are to attend upon it, to minister to Him.<a name=40:8></a> It is a daily matter.<a name=40:9></a> As with the priests of old, there were numerous duties of the day and night which fell to the priests, e.<a name=40:10></a>g.<a name=40:11></a>, the morning and evening oblations, and other sacrifices, the morning and evening incense, the lighting of the lamps, the evening to morning dressing of the lamps, and to ensure that they were burning.<a name=40:12></a> But then the sons of God have other services, and the Levites were taken instead of the firstborn, and given to the priests, "to do the service of the tabernacle" (chapter 3:8) so that things might be according to God in His own <i>habitation</i>, and that the priestly service might go on unimpaired.<a name=40:13></a> Then around all that, as we have said, were the military forces to ensure that no enemy could make any inroad or find a point of attack, so as to hinder the carrying out of those enjoined services connected with the habitation of God.<a name=40:14></a> As was said in years past, the early chapters of Numbers give typically the present aspect of the kingdom of God.<a name=40:15></a> The King had taken up His residence, His habitation; God Himself had come down to dwell; and the holy nation was encamped around Him, and their lives were regulated relative to God and His habitation.<a name=40:16></a> It is a picture of the kingdom of God at the present time -- the divine thought as to it.<a name=40:17></a> We are all to be in our position as soldiers -- every king has his soldiers

	<div class="paragraph">
		These are just general introductory remarks, but I especially had in mind the work of the Levites, hoping that the Lord will help us to be more intelligent as to it, especially the Gershonite and Merarite sides.<a name=41:2></a> We cannot, however, consider those two aspects without thinking of the Kohathite side -- there were the three families of the Levites, the Kohathites, the Gershonites, and the Merarites.<a name=41:3></a> In chapter 3 the Gershonites are put first and the recital of what they were to do, or to have charge of, and then the Kohathites, and lastly the Merarites.<a name=41:4></a> But in chapter 4 the Kohathites are first, in view of carrying, and then the Gershonites are mentioned, and afterwards the Merarites; and I think there is a reason for the change of order, each chapter having its own teaching.<a name=41:5></a> At any rate chapter 4 would give the order of importance because the Kohathites had charge of the ark, the table of shewbread, the golden altar, the candlestick, and the brazen altar, and these primarily speak to us of Christ Himself and God shining out in Him, so that must be first.<a name=41:6></a> Then the Gershonites had charge of the curtains of the tabernacle and the curtains of the tent over the tabernacle, that is the goats' hair curtains, also the covering of rams' skins dyed red and the covering of badgers' skins, and the hangings around the court, which have reference to what is seen in the saints -- the work of God, Christ characteristically in the saints.<a name=41:7></a> And then the Merarites had what constituted the heaviest burdens -- although not the most precious or the most holy -- the boards and the bars, and the pillars, and the pillars of the court (4:31 - 32) and in their case (see end of verse 32) it is stated, "by name ye shall number to them the materials which are their charge to carry".<a name=41:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:5></a>C.<a name=42:6></a> Yes, that is what I had in mind.<a name=42:7></a> We serve from the heart, and that is why it says, "Let all things ye do be done in love".<a name=42:8></a> "If ye love me, keep my commandments".<a name=42:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.McI.<a name=42:10></a> Could we have a word on the last verse that you referred to?<a name=42:11></a> "By name ye shall number to them (the Merarites) the materials which are their charge to carry".<a name=42:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.McI.<a name=42:16></a> Well, I don't know; I just thought that it would seem that the Lord has in mind some particular work that He wants us each to do in the service of the tabernacle.<a name=42:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:18></a>C.<a name=42:19></a> That is what I thought; according to chapter 4:49 everyone has his service and his burden; they are holy burdens but they are called burdens.<a name=42:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=42:21></a>R.<a name=42:22></a> Was Christ the great burden-bearer?<a name=42:23></a> If we had a sense in our souls of the magnitude of the burdens Christ has borne it would encourage us to take up burdens.<a name=42:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:25></a>C.<a name=42:26></a> I think it would.<a name=42:27></a> As to our taking them up, He says, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light".<a name=42:28></a> They are real burdens, but to love they are but light.<a name=42:29></a> It does not mean that the burdens themselves are not real.<a name=42:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.P.<a name=42:31></a> Would the last verse of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>fit in with that last verse of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4">Numbers  4</a>, "So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord"?<a name=42:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:33></a>C.<a name=42:34></a> Yes, I think that fits very much because it applied to every brother and every sister at Corinth; he calls them "my beloved brethren".<a name=42:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=42:36></a>H.<a name=42:37></a>R.<a name=42:38></a> So that however many Levites there are,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		each one has a sense of personal commission; is that right?<a name=43:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=43:2></a>C.<a name=43:3></a> It is right.<a name=43:4></a> Paul says that he was set out as a delineation of those about to believe on the Lord to life eternal; and I think what we can see from the case of Paul himself is that at the outset of our spiritual career God would give us some impression of what He has called us for, in this aspect of things.<a name=43:5></a> At the very outset the Lord said to Saul of Tarsus, "Why dost thou persecute me?<a name=43:6></a>" and he evidently received a distinct impression that Jesus was the Son of God; hence those two matters, sonship, and the assembly as Christ's body, became the <i>burden</i> of Paul's ministry.<a name=43:7></a> He was special as we know, yet in another sense he was an example.<a name=43:8></a> So I think the Lord would normally give us an early impression, and Paul tells Agrippa that he had received that.<a name=43:9></a> Paul did not tell anyone else at the time; he did not parade the fact that the Lord had given him something to do; he waited and went on patiently and later Barnabas brought him in, and eventually the Holy Spirit said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them".<a name=43:10></a> So that the Lord giving us an early impression would perhaps correspond with the Levites being first numbered from a month old, the month being related to the first distinctive impression of Christ we receive.<a name=43:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.P.<a name=43:12></a>S.<a name=43:13></a> "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me".<a name=43:14></a> Is that <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4">Numbers  4</a>rather than <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#3">Numbers  3</a>?<a name=43:15></a> You referred earlier to the other side, "If ye love me, keep my commandments", but then the Lord also says, "He that has my commandments".<a name=43:16></a> We have a responsibility of love have we not, to have the commandments, to find out what they are and to have them?<a name=43:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=43:18></a>C.<a name=43:19></a> I am sure that that is so.<a name=43:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		V.G.<a name=43:21></a> Is it the suggestion that in whatever capacity we serve, whether as soldiers or Levites or priests,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=44>[Page 44]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the saints stand in relation to the tabernacle at all times?<a name=44:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=44:2></a>C.<a name=44:3></a> Yes, in principle it is a whole-time service; we have our mundane work to do, and may have to give up a good deal of time to such other matters in our responsible life, but in our thoughts it is all with the view of expressing or subserving what we are as soldiers, Levites, and priests.<a name=44:4></a> Otherwise we have got things in wrong balance.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.J.<a name=44:6></a>J.<a name=44:7></a>W.<a name=44:8></a> Is it in your mind that all service, in whatever aspect we look at, is Godward?<a name=44:9></a> I was thinking of the whole setting in Numbers, God was dwelling in the midst of His people, and this great system is set up in order that He may be served and worshipped; and do we come into it on that line, that every service is really Godward?<a name=44:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=44:11></a>C.<a name=44:12></a> I think that is right; the concern of the soldiers, Levites, and priests, is that God may be rightly served in His habitation and that nothing should disturb that service, or intrude with what is foreign to it.<a name=44:13></a> The military side would keep that out, and then the Levites cared for everything so that the priests could serve unhinderedly.<a name=44:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=44:15></a>W.<a name=44:16></a> With the impressions that the Lord may give each one of us, would He also impress us distinctly with the preciousness of what we are called upon to maintain?<a name=44:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=44:18></a>C.<a name=44:19></a> That is what I felt, and that is why we really need to look first at the Kohathite's service, because of the exceeding preciousness of the things they had to carry.<a name=44:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=44:21></a>R.<a name=44:22></a> When Peter writes his epistles he speaks of various things that are precious.<a name=44:23></a> In his first letter, too, he says, "To you therefore who believe is the preciousness", and in that passage then goes on to speak of the kingly priesthood, and a holy nation, etc.<a name=44:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=44:25></a>C.<a name=44:26></a> So he begins with the question whether
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we value the precious things.<a name=45:1></a> And it is touching to consider the circumstances of God's speaking in Numbers.<a name=45:2></a> The book opens with "And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting;" that is where Jehovah is shown to be, where He has come down to dwell, and He is in the tent of meeting.<a name=45:3></a> So the saints are a habitation of God in the Spirit; it is God down here in His own dwelling, and He is speaking, from that aspect, in the tent of meeting; and He as much as says, 'Well now I have come down to dwell with you in love, and I am counting on you to take up these services, so that My habitation and the service in it may be what they should be'.<a name=45:4></a> In this book the tabernacle is also called the tabernacle of testimony -- we are to have that view of the assembly, as the tabernacle of testimony, God dwelling here in testimony.<a name=45:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.J.<a name=45:6></a>J.<a name=45:7></a>W.<a name=45:8></a> Is that the particular object of attack by the enemy, the representation of God here, corresponding with Corinthians, the assembly of God in a place, with the view of God being rightly represented?<a name=45:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=45:10></a>C.<a name=45:11></a> So that the Corinthian epistles really give the view of the assembly as the tabernacle of testimony, here in the wilderness in testimony; and all these kinds of service are needed, if the service of God is to be rightly maintained, whether in the unholy conditions of Corinth or any other city of this world; all these services are needed so that the conditions in God's dwelling are suited to Him, in accord with His own specification; there is to be no drop in the level of things; and scripture supposes that what goes out in testimony to men, flows out from conditions which are right within, so that, things being right inside the house, the testimony going out from those conditions is the true representation of God our Saviour.<a name=45:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=45:13></a>H.<a name=45:14></a>R.<a name=45:15></a> Is that why it says in chapter 4:4 that the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting "is most holy"?<a name=46:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=46:2></a>C.<a name=46:3></a> Yes "it is most holy".<a name=46:4></a> Now I think we need to keep that in mind and I would submit that in our day every Levite -- and we are all called to that -- should engage in all three kinds of Levitical service.<a name=46:5></a> You will notice how the word "families" runs through, everything being done on a family footing, suggesting what is tender and loving.<a name=46:6></a> There are the families of the Kohathites, and of the Gershonites, and of the Merarites; and while we may see in a brother or sister special features of, say, Merarite or Gershonite service, yet I think that, in some measure, there should and must be with every one of us an appreciation of Kohathite service.<a name=46:7></a> The Kohathite has to do with the most holy things, and what is most precious within.<a name=46:8></a> Likewise there would be some appreciation of Gershonite service and what the saints are, as typified in the curtains of the tabernacle and, for example, the curtains and coverings of goats' hair, etc.<a name=46:9></a>, over the tabernacle.<a name=46:10></a> And then there must be appreciation -- proper to the Merarite -- of what the saints are and have to meet in their responsible lives, as represented in the boards, and pillars round the court, because without that side being maintained, the whole thing, as you might say, collapses testimonially.<a name=46:11></a> So that I would think a true Levite has desires and instincts in all three directions: but unquestionably some are given special ability in one particular line.<a name=46:12></a> I feel it is important to look on the brethren that way.<a name=46:13></a> Perhaps we could have a word as to the position of their respective encampments.<a name=46:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=46:15></a>H.<a name=46:16></a> I was thinking of what our brother said a moment ago, about all being in relation to the centre of the tabernacle.<a name=46:17></a> The first one (the Gershonites) in chapter 3 is behind it (westward), and I wondered if it is not a reminder that we have to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		look to the tent and curtain carriers -- they are behind it; divine principles are not to be overlooked.<a name=47:1></a> And then those (the Merarites) that look after the saints are to the north; cold comes from the north; and then the Kohathites are to the south.<a name=47:2></a> Well, we can enjoy the south when the persons and the principles have been safeguarded.<a name=47:3></a> I wondered too if it connects with 2 Timothy and the man of God being fully fitted to every good work?<a name=47:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=47:5></a>C.<a name=47:6></a> I think it does.<a name=47:7></a> As regards those behind, they could oversee the whole thing; and those looking after the curtains I suppose need specially to be able to do that, to be on the lookout over the whole thing, because they are maintaining principles.<a name=47:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=47:9></a>H.<a name=47:10></a> For those of us who are young, what answers to the service of the Kohathites today?<a name=47:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=47:12></a>C.<a name=47:13></a> We could not exactly think of the Lord as a Levite, because the things were expressed in Him, but He did the work in perfection.<a name=47:14></a> As regards the Lord, I would assume that the Kohathite service was the declaration of God, to begin with, making God known.<a name=47:15></a> "Thou that sitteth between the cherubim", it says of God, that is on the mercy-seat; and the Lord came to make known the God who has His seat there.<a name=47:16></a> "The only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him".<a name=47:17></a> And then we see that the Lord is the Antitype in perfection of those things which the Kohathites carried.<a name=47:18></a> He is the Ark; the altars represent Him; similarly the table and the candlestick.<a name=47:19></a> The Lord Himself brought the things forward in the first instance, brought them into the sphere of testimony, in His own Person.<a name=47:20></a> But then, how wonderfully the Lord took up the other services, in the sense of bringing out the principles and teaching relative to God and what is suited to Him in His house.<a name=47:21></a> And how affecting is His shining forth as the true Merarite in service, seen perhaps more particularly

		G.R.<a name=48:5></a>C.<a name=48:6></a> Yes, that is it; it is enlarged on (although we had not time to read it) in the early part of chapter 4, where, in speaking of the priests covering these things when the camp sets forward, more detail is given as to the ark, the altars, the candlestick and so on.<a name=48:7></a>
