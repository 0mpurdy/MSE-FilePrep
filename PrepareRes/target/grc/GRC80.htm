		We were engaged yesterday afternoon with the living water, and I trust the Lord will help us this afternoon as to the living bread.<a name=20:2></a> We need bread and water for the sustenance of life, both naturally and spiritually; and if a person is famishing, he needs water first.<a name=20:3></a> We all, if we have to do with God, first experience the blessing of the living water.<a name=20:4></a> "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=20:5></a> But then we need sustaining in the path of God's will, and for that we need the living bread as well as the living water.<a name=20:6></a> We connect the living water with the Spirit, and rightly so, because scripture does, but it would link especially with the Spirit as bringing the love of God into our souls and the blessing of God in an ever fresh way.<a name=20:7></a> The living bread connects with the Lord Himself, and He is it.<a name=20:8></a> While the living water brings into our souls what God is as revealed, the living bread refers to the Lord Jesus as Man.<a name=20:9></a> He is the One in whom God has been expressed, but then He is the One who perfectly carried out God's will, and He becomes the food of our souls thus.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there are three aspects of food brought before us in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>.<a name=20:11></a> It is a comprehensive chapter.<a name=20:12></a> The first is what would correspond with the manna of old.<a name=20:13></a> He says, "I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me".<a name=20:14></a> The manna came down from heaven, and Jesus came down from heaven to tread a path that was different

		from that which any man had ever trod.<a name=21:1></a> That is, He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him.<a name=21:2></a> Then secondly you get the thought of eating His flesh and drinking His blood, which refers to our feeding upon Christ in death; and thirdly, "if then ye shall see the Son of man ascending up where he was before".<a name=21:3></a> This is a question of feeding upon Him as the Man of God's counsels, as having ascended to fill out the place that was given Him in those counsels.<a name=21:4></a> In each aspect it is food for our souls.<a name=21:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.V.<a name=21:6></a>W.<a name=21:7></a> So that the gospels are very important, because they depict for us the pathway of Jesus, and this is food for our souls as the manna was; is that what is in your mind?<a name=21:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=21:9></a>C.<a name=21:10></a> Yes, indeed.<a name=21:11></a> And then it is the bringing of impressions of Christ, as depicted in scripture, into our souls livingly day by day.<a name=21:12></a> The manna fell on the dew and then had to be gathered.<a name=21:13></a> From God's side, it falls on the dew, but from our side it has to be gathered.<a name=21:14></a> So the Lord says, "Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto life eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you".<a name=21:15></a> It is a gift from the divine side, but we labour much for other things which perish.<a name=21:16></a> The thing is to use energy in securing and appropriating the living bread which abides to life eternal, because the manna builds up a constitution which goes through.<a name=21:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.V.<a name=21:18></a>W.<a name=21:19></a> Does this involve the Spirit working in the believer?<a name=21:20></a> You spoke of the manna being on the dew.<a name=21:21></a> Would the dew speak of the Spirit, and is the Spirit essential to give us this living food as we feed on Christ?<a name=21:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=22:1></a>C.<a name=22:2></a> Yes, I thought so.<a name=22:3></a> The Spirit in us would prepare the way for the manna.<a name=22:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=22:5></a>C.<a name=22:6></a> Would the introduction of the manna in this chapter and how it was to be gathered be helpful as to the way in which we appropriate Christ as we feed upon Him.<a name=22:7></a> It was to be gathered every day, and nothing was to be left over from one day's portion.<a name=22:8></a> You spoke of energy just now; there is a need for a continuous fresh gathering of impressions of Christ.<a name=22:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=22:10></a>C.<a name=22:11></a> Yes.<a name=22:12></a> Each had to gather for his house, and they gathered according to the eating, but then all were supposed to have in a way the same kind of appetite.<a name=22:13></a> It says, "Gather of it every man according to what he can eat, an omer a poll".<a name=22:14></a> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16:16">Exodus  16:16</a>).<a name=22:15></a> The normal eating would be an omer, the tenth part of an ephah.<a name=22:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=22:17></a>H.<a name=22:18></a>R.<a name=22:19></a> The Lord emphasises a great deal His having come down out of heaven, and as to the manna emphasis was also made in the same way.<a name=22:20></a> Would you say something about that?<a name=22:21></a> It speaks about the corn of heaven and the food of the mighty.<a name=22:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=22:23></a>C.<a name=22:24></a> The food of the mighty seems to me to be a very beautiful description of the manna, because those who have been mighty in spiritual acts and power have fed upon that.<a name=22:25></a> It was the food of Paul and Peter and the other apostles.<a name=22:26></a> They were mighty men, and it was the food of J.<a name=22:27></a>N.<a name=22:28></a>D.<a name=22:29></a>, we might say.<a name=22:30></a> In fact the manna no doubt has been the food of all those who would be called mighty in the path of faith.<a name=22:31></a> Is that so?<a name=22:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=22:33></a>H.<a name=22:34></a>R.<a name=22:35></a> Yes, I would think so.<a name=22:36></a> You reminded me immediately of what was said of Gideon, "Go in this thy might".<a name=22:37></a> His strength lay in the admittance

		of his own smallness.<a name=23:1></a> I wondered if that was the idea, it was a small thing.<a name=23:2></a> As far as what we are here, the manna would reduce us.<a name=23:3></a> I am very impressed with this repetition of "out of heaven;" are these three foods you have referred to progressive?<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=23:5></a>C.<a name=23:6></a> Yes, except that of course we have to begin with the second (eating His flesh and drinking His blood) do we not?<a name=23:7></a> The manna was not available to anybody who had not already eaten the passover.<a name=23:8></a> So that the first thing was that they had to appropriate Christ in death, and feed on the lamb roast with fire.<a name=23:9></a> The light of Christ here would not be food for our souls if we have not first appropriated His death.<a name=23:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=23:11></a>H.<a name=23:12></a>R.<a name=23:13></a> What impressed me this morning at the supper was that I felt how little one knew and appreciated Christ in death.<a name=23:14></a> I had a feeling that perhaps it depended on one's measure of appreciating Him in glory -- "I live on account of the Father", He says afterwards, and that is something further?<a name=23:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=23:16></a>C.<a name=23:17></a> I think it may be important to enquire more into what you are saying, because after all, in the history of the children of Israel, they increased in the appreciation of the death of Christ typically as they went on.<a name=23:18></a> So even though we say the second food comes first, and it does initially, still, as we are treading the wilderness path, appropriating the manna, we enter into the death of Christ more and more fully as we go along.<a name=23:19></a> The passover gave them strength to pass through the Red Sea, but they needed the manna to continue to learn what the death of Christ meant in the wilderness.<a name=23:20></a> And finally it would enter into their ability to cross the Jordan, although they had other food; and in the finality of things after they had crossed the Jordan they kept the passover

		and ate the manna and the old corn of the land all on the same day.<a name=24:1></a> They merge then and, of course, the passover being repeated annually meant a continual increase in the appreciation of it.<a name=24:2></a> In Egypt they would be mainly concerned with an escape from judgment, but in going over the passover again in the wilderness it would assume more a contemplative character relative to the experiences they passed through.<a name=24:3></a> Whereas the passover in the land would have still more depth of meaning, after further experiences like the brazen serpent and the Jordan.<a name=24:4></a> The passover would continually take on a deeper meaning, I believe, so that each year normally -- I am speaking spiritually now -- the appropriation of the lamb roast with fire would be a deeper experience.<a name=24:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=24:6></a> Is this now what the Lord is substantially to us?<a name=24:7></a> "I am the bread of life;" Christ before us, the living bread.<a name=24:8></a> Joseph said, "Be not angry with yourselves, .<a name=24:9></a>.<a name=24:10></a>.<a name=24:11></a> for God sent me before you to preserve life".<a name=24:12></a> The matter on hand is life.<a name=24:13></a> "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died".<a name=24:14></a> But this is something that is substantially sufficient to preserve the whole being in the joy of life.<a name=24:15></a> And it is remarkable that you do not get bread mentioned at all until <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>, do you?<a name=24:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=24:17></a>C.<a name=24:18></a> That is very remarkable.<a name=24:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=24:20></a> In the garden of Eden there was no bread.<a name=24:21></a> Bread came in after the question of sin came in, and they were to eat bread with the sweat of the face.<a name=24:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the first mention, I think, of bread in scripture.<a name=24:23></a>

		like the manna; and then the old corn of the land would sustain life in the land.<a name=25:1></a> I take it that is implied in "If then ye shall see the Son of man ascending up where he was before", and then you get the tree of life, sustaining life in the paradise of God in the place of God's pleasure and delight.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=25:3></a> Does it not challenge us as to how much we enter into the joys of what is really life?<a name=25:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=25:15></a> We ponder much on the death of Christ.<a name=25:16></a> I realise it is essential; but I do feel that we should feed more upon the Man where He is, so that glory might fill our souls continually.<a name=25:17></a> Do you think so?<a name=25:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=25:19></a>C.<a name=25:20></a> Well, I think that is right; the three sides perhaps should go on in a commensurate kind of way.<a name=25:21></a> You mean we are apt to leave out the third.<a name=25:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=25:23></a> Yes, and I wonder whether we dwell too much on the side of the death of Christ.<a name=25:24></a> It is most essential that we should begin there, but do you think that we should move over to His side of things and get the joy of life where Christ really is at the present time?<a name=25:25></a>

		that, the more we shall appreciate His death.<a name=26:1></a> We stay at the death of Christ from the standpoint of our need and the elementary truth of it as meeting the need of a sinner.<a name=26:2></a> But you see, as they went on feeding on the manna, so they appropriated the passover in the wilderness in, no doubt, a way that they did not understand at all in Egypt.<a name=26:3></a> Then finally they had the passover in the land.<a name=26:4></a> At all stages of their history in the land they kept the passover.<a name=26:5></a> So I would say that the further we go in the appreciation of the manna and of the old corn of the land, the more we shall appreciate the death of Christ, so that there is depth with us, increasing depth, as well as increasing apprehension of God's purpose.<a name=26:6></a> What do you think?<a name=26:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=26:8></a> Yes, I suppose the old corn is the previous year's gleanings; the thing is there, is it not?<a name=26:9></a> It is something that is ripe and matured and would create life, and sustain life.<a name=26:10></a> I think what you say is very helpful because we are all feeding on something; and I believe it is most essential, especially as we read John's gospel, because John's gospel is progressive, is it not?<a name=26:11></a> It arrives at fulness.<a name=26:12></a>
