		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> The thought in these readings is that we should consider the way Paul presents unity in the epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians and Ephesians.<a name=1:3></a> Having in mind the universal desire of the saints, it is in all our hearts that we should be preserved in increasing unity until the Lord comes, in the recognition that apart from it there can be no true portion for Christ, and no true portion for God.<a name=1:4></a> It has often been said that union cannot be enjoyed without unity, and it is interesting to keep in mind that in Paul's gospel treatise -- and what, I suppose, is the highest note in Romans -- he says, "that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:6">Romans  15:6</a>.<a name=1:5></a> The working out of that, no doubt, involves Paul's ministry as a whole, but he brings it into his gospel treatise, showing that the great end in view is <i>unison in praise</i>; and I am sure it is before the minds of the brethren continually, that there should be unison in praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ universally on the earth.<a name=1:6></a> What must precede that is unity, and entering into the truth of union with Christ.<a name=1:7></a> In the revival the great truth that separation from evil is God's principle of unity was brought out, but, as this epistle indicates, unity cannot be maintained without dealing with what is within, that is, within ourselves.<a name=1:8></a> Outward separation is essential, but the history of those who profess to be outwardly separate shows that all along the line there have been hidden workings, to which, I suppose, we could trace every division that has occurred.<a name=1:9></a> There have been conflicts for the truth, but what

		has made the conflict necessary has been the working of what is hidden, and that is what the old leaven signifies.<a name=2:1></a> It speaks of a woman hiding leaven in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.<a name=2:2></a> And so in dealing with the state of things at Corinth the apostle begins with their lack of unity, and goes on to this hidden working.<a name=2:3></a> And one wondered whether we might consider the passover, and the feast of unleavened bread, as a continual necessity.<a name=2:4></a> The passover was initially celebrated in Egypt, but it was also celebrated in the wilderness and in the land; the idea being, one would judge, that the further we move on in spiritual experience and history the more we value the passover, and the more fully we appropriate it.<a name=2:5></a> It was eaten in Egypt, but the implications of it in Egypt were no doubt little understood.<a name=2:6></a> As we learn experimentally in the wilderness, there should be an ever-increasing appreciation of the implications of the passover, and in the land more still.<a name=2:7></a> If we dwell a little on that it may lead us on to chapter 12, where the positive side of unity is introduced, linked with the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=2:9></a>P.<a name=2:10></a> Would the fact that the children of Israel moved out of Egypt in rank, following the eating of the passover, bear upon what you are saying as to unity?<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:12></a>C.<a name=2:13></a> It seems as though the idea of military array is included in that; and in the final idea of unity, as presented in Philippians, conflict is in mind, as it says, "ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:27">Philippians  1:27</a>.<a name=2:14></a> So that, on the one hand, unity would lead us on to unison in praise, and, on the other hand, to be joined in one spirit and one soul, labouring together in the same conflict as Paul (see <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:30">Philippians  1:30</a>).<a name=2:15></a>

		G.R.<a name=3:1></a>C.<a name=3:2></a> And then the exercise of purging out the leaven is a very important thing.<a name=3:3></a> One feels it is needed at the present time in every part of the world, and nowhere more than in oneself.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=3:5></a> Before we move on to the passover, can we get your mind about this first scripture, as to how lordship in Christ bears upon the question of unity?<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> He says, "Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:10">1 Corinthians  1:10</a>.<a name=3:9></a> They were concerned about leaders, but, in one sense, there is only One Leader.<a name=3:10></a> The word used for Leader, as regards Christ, is unique to Himself, the chief Leader, or the Captain; and it is Him we are to follow.<a name=3:11></a> The word "imitate" is used as to others, but the word "follow" as regards Christ Himself.<a name=3:12></a> So that there is one flock and one Shepherd, the great Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=3:13></a> He is leading the flock, and our eye is to be ever on Him.<a name=3:14></a> The apostles are the great examples, for they were men who never led away disciples after them.<a name=3:15></a> The dispensation started with twelve men who never led away a disciple after them, but always directed to Christ.<a name=3:16></a> So that we are said to be built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets -- we could not have been built on a foundation that lacked unity, or that was partisan -- and their names appear in the foundations of the wall of the city.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=3:18></a> I was thinking of the exhortations in the end of Hebrews.<a name=3:19></a> We are to imitate the faith of the leaders, and we are to esteem them and obey them.<a name=3:20></a> But the difficulty in Corinth was not so much that the leaders were turning people after them, but some persons were following certain leaders of their choice.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:22></a>C.<a name=3:23></a> Quite so.<a name=3:24></a> Therefore this word, "the name of our Lord Jesus Christ", should affect us.<a name=3:25></a> There is no other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved, and salvation involves following Him, as He said, "they follow me; and I give them life eternal".<a name=3:26></a> We are not in practical

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:3></a>G.<a name=4:4></a> So that in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>the apostles rejoiced that they were counted worthy to be dishonoured for <i>the</i> Name.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:6></a>C.<a name=4:7></a> Do you not think that the name of Jesus, or the Lord Jesus, is the testimonial name, the name of the great Leader?<a name=4:8></a> If people submit to His authority and are baptised to His name, they are also baptised to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the name of God as declared.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=4:10></a> May I ask why you are emphasising the Name, and not simply speaking of the Person?<a name=4:11></a> You speak of it as testimonial.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:13></a>C.<a name=4:14></a> I was thinking of the renown, or fame, attaching to Christ, and, as you say, we are all in danger of attaching a certain renown or fame to those the Lord raises up in leadership, in a subordinate way down here.<a name=4:15></a> But, from the standpoint from which we are now speaking, there is only one Name.<a name=4:16></a> We are not to be occupied with the fame of leaders, although we obey and honour them.<a name=4:17></a> If we attach the idea of fame to leaders we shall become partisan.<a name=4:18></a> Fame attaches to one Man.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:20></a>E.<a name=4:21></a> Is that why of Christ Himself alone the word "leader" is employed as connected with the One who sets things on?<a name=4:22></a> His renown is connected with His place as the originator, is it not?<a name=4:23></a> Paul disowns anything of that in relation to himself, so that he says, "lest anyone should say I baptised to my own name".<a name=4:24></a>

		G.R.<a name=4:25></a>C.<a name=4:26></a> What renown attaches to Christ, the Originator, the chief Leader!<a name=4:27></a> He should fill the vision of our souls, and every true leader under Him would have that in mind, like John the Baptist, who said, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=4:28></a> He is the Person of

		renown, so John's disciples now follow Jesus.<a name=5:1></a> But then there is the idea of imitating, but the only ground on which we can ask people to imitate us is that we are imitating Christ: "Be my imitators, even as I also am of Christ".<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=5:3></a> Is it seen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>, where Peter and John said, "Look on us", but not with intention to draw the man to them, for they refer immediately to the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene?<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:5></a>C.<a name=5:6></a> It is in the defence of that action that Peter says that there is no other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved; and then you have to note that while to the lame man he said, "Look on us", and it is a fact that those who are truly representative of Christ affect souls, and are to be looked at, <i>yet</i>, when it came to explaining the matter to the people, Peter said, "why do <i>ye</i> gaze on us as if we had by our own power or piety made him to walk?<a name=5:7></a>", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:12">Acts  3:12</a>.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=5:9></a>P.<a name=5:10></a> Is it not in that passage also that the word "originator of life" is used, and the footnote says, "It is a 'leader', but it is more.<a name=5:11></a> It is used <i>for</i> one who begins and sets a matter on?<a name=5:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:13></a>C.<a name=5:14></a> Quite so.<a name=5:15></a> And so the testimony of John the Baptist in John's gospel bears on what we have in mind.<a name=5:16></a> He was a prophet; indeed the Lord said he was the greatest of the prophets; and his prophecy is most extraordinary in its brevity and its scope; it is greater than any other prophecy up to that time, I would say.<a name=5:17></a> And he says, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=5:18></a> Who could set that on?<a name=5:19></a> We sing:

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>Hark!<a name=5:20></a> Ten thousand voices crying <br>"Lamb of God!<a name=5:23></a><a name=5:21></a>" with one accord.<a name=5:24></a><a name=5:22></a> (<a href=".<a name=5:25></a>.<a name=5:26></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=5:27></a>htm#14:1">Hymn 14</a>)</blockquote>

		In that gospel the Spirit of God has already shown that He is the "I am".<a name=5:28></a> The first three verses are an emphatic assertion that Jesus is "I am".<a name=5:29></a> But John presenting Him says, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=5:30></a>

		G.R.<a name=6:14></a>C.<a name=6:15></a> Very good.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=6:17></a>E.<a name=6:18></a> Is there not evidence of the peculiar jealousy of the Holy Spirit that He lays great stress on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of God's Son, and brings home to the brethren the great need of the testimony of the Christ being confirmed amongst them?<a name=6:19></a> Is that to help us in the direction of Christ being everything and in all?<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:21></a>C.<a name=6:22></a> I am sure it is.<a name=6:23></a> The Corinthian epistle has in mind the tabernacle of testimony, has it not, and the testimony of <i>the Christ</i> was confirmed in them.<a name=6:24></a> The ark was enshrined in the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=6:25></a> But then the testimony of God was there too, as he says in chapter 2: 1, "announcing to you the testimony of God".<a name=6:26></a> The testimony of God is also in the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=6:27></a> So this book does not close without referring to God being all in all.<a name=6:28></a> There is a testimony to that in the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=6:29></a> So in the saints as viewed thus, there is a testimony to Christ, His greatness and His rights, and there is a testimony to God right on to the point of God being

		J.S.<a name=7:2></a>E.<a name=7:3></a> So that the allusion to the testimony of the Christ being confirmed amongst them must have reference to Christ personally, but coming, by way of these chapters, to chapter 12, where we get the allusion to the Christ, as connected with the vessel here, but solidly based on what you have emphasised, this matter of unity?<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:5></a>C.<a name=7:6></a> As I understand it, the title "the Christ" in chapter 12 does not exclude Christ personally.<a name=7:7></a> It is referring to the anointed vessel here, but Christ enshrined in it.<a name=7:8></a> What would it be without Him?<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:10></a>G.<a name=7:11></a> Have you in mind that if we had a true understanding of the testimony of the Christ on the one hand, and the testimony of God on the other, as committed to and enshrined among the saints, there is nothing that would be more unifying?<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:13></a>C.<a name=7:14></a> I am sure of that.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=7:16></a> Does that not give emphasis to Paul's answer to those who said, "I of Christ".<a name=7:17></a> That might appear to run very near to what you are saying, but he said, "Is the Christ divided?<a name=7:18></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:19></a>C.<a name=7:20></a> Just so.<a name=7:21></a> It is noticeable that Christ is put last.<a name=7:22></a> Is not that the effect of men making much of human leaders?<a name=7:23></a> We see it rampant in Christendom.<a name=7:24></a> Look at the various divisions of Christendom!<a name=7:25></a> Christ is last.<a name=7:26></a> If you speak to people who are in them, Christ is usually the last Person they want to speak about.<a name=7:27></a> They will speak about their great men.<a name=7:28></a>
