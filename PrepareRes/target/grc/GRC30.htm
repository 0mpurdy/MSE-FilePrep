		THE CHOICE OF A CAREER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Strictly speaking, the believer has no choice.<a name=1:1></a> He is not his own, he is bought with a price; and his true business in life is to do the will of God.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's will is, therefore, his career; Christ his Object and Christ his Motive.<a name=1:3></a> What a wonderful career this is!<a name=1:4></a> None other can compare with it.<a name=1:5></a> Those who pursue it are assured of divine support, a heavenly Father's care, and the acquisition of the true, the eternal riches.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus is the great Model.<a name=1:7></a> "Coming into the world he says .<a name=1:8></a>.<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a> Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:5">Hebrews  10:5</a> and 7.<a name=1:11></a> That will involved for Him the offering of His body once for all as the great Antitype of all the offerings and sacrifices of old.<a name=1:12></a> Our sanctification and all our blessing depend upon it.<a name=1:13></a> At twelve years of age He said, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?<a name=1:14></a>", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:49">Luke  2:49</a>.<a name=1:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God's will for the Christian is clearly set out in Scripture.<a name=2:1></a> Christ's body is here and he is to function as a member of it.<a name=2:2></a> God's house is here, and he is responsible to undertake military, levitical, and priestly service in relation to it, and to the God who dwells in it (see <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1">Numbers  1</a>- 4).<a name=2:3></a> His calling is heavenly and he is to pursue with all his energies, "looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>.<a name=2:4></a> God's will, therefore, 'demands my soul, my life, my all!<a name=2:5></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The young believer may say, 'Yes, but I have my living to get'.<a name=2:6></a> The Lord Jesus, referring to temporal needs, says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:33">Matthew  6:33</a>.<a name=2:7></a> God, as it were, says (to use the language of another), 'You make my interests your concern, I'll make your wants My care'.<a name=2:8></a> God does far better for a man than a man could do for himself.<a name=2:9></a> And so the Scripture says, "Confide in Jehovah with all thy heart, and lean not unto thine own intelligence; in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make plain thy paths", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#3:5">Proverbs  3:5</a> and 6.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you pray and wait upon Him about your earthly calling, your heart already fixed upon Him and His interests, He will make quite plain what that earthly calling shall be.<a name=2:11></a> And, as chosen by Him, it will be the calling that will serve best your place in His kingdom here below, and thus your present and eternal happiness.<a name=2:12></a>
