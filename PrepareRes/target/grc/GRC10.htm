		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> I thought we might consider what Paul calls "our gospel", in verse 3 of chapter 4: "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost".<a name=1:3></a> In chapter 3, relative to "our gospel", he says that he and those with him were competent new covenant ministers, verse 6; God had made them that: "who has also made us competent as new covenant ministers", as the note indicates.<a name=1:4></a> On the other hand, in chapter 5, he says they were ambassadors: "We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as it were beseeching by us", verse 20.<a name=1:5></a> As competent new covenant ministers, they had a ministry which would meet the need of every man; as ambassadors, they were beseeching and entreating because of the longings of God's heart.<a name=1:6></a> They represented God in their entreaty and in their beseeching.<a name=1:7></a> In the one case, what is in mind is the need of man; in the other, as we say, the need of God.<a name=1:8></a> So these two features are both linked with the word "our gospel".<a name=1:9></a> Some may say, Surely Paul's gospel was the gospel of sonship -- and so it was, and is; that is the great blessing.<a name=1:10></a> He is writing to sons; in most of his epistles, he writes to sons.<a name=1:11></a> The salutation here is "Grace to you, and peace from God our Father", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:2">2 Corinthians  1:2</a>.<a name=1:12></a> He is writing to sons, and he says that his preaching was "the Son of God, Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:19">2 Corinthians  1:19</a>.<a name=1:13></a> But then sons should know the moral basis on which the gospel comes to them.<a name=1:14></a> Those who were marked out beforehand for sonship needed redemption, and it is essential that they should know the moral basis on which the gospel has reached them; otherwise they will never

		be in the liberty of the relationship.<a name=2:1></a> And so in chapter 3, Paul speaks of the ministry.<a name=2:2></a> He and those with him were made by God competent new covenant ministers, but he tells us what the ministry is, in verse 8: the ministry of the Spirit subsists in glory; and in verse 9: "the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory".<a name=2:3></a> They were the things which he and those with him, as new covenant ministers, were ministering.<a name=2:4></a> God was ministering, indeed, through them, the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness, subsisting in glory and abounding in glory.<a name=2:5></a> So that the gospel from this standpoint is the gospel of the glory, as Paul says: "the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God", chapter 4: 4.<a name=2:6></a> It is a radiant message.<a name=2:7></a> The gospel comes from the glory, fits men for the glory, and attracts men into the glory.<a name=2:8></a> God is bringing many sons to glory -- <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>.<a name=2:9></a> I thought this morning we should dwell mainly on the aspect in chapters 3 and 4.<a name=2:10></a> How God had made Paul and those with him competent as new covenant ministers; what the ministry was, and where it brings us, not leaving out of our thoughts that the longings of the heart of God are in the matter.<a name=2:11></a> I suggested reading the two verses in chapter 5 for this reading also, that we might see both sides -- that those who were carrying the gospel at this time were made by God competent new covenant ministers, and they were also ambassadors.<a name=2:12></a> An ambassador cannot be an ambassador unless he comes from the presence of the king.<a name=2:13></a> They were men who were in the gain themselves of new covenant ministry, who were habitually in the presence of God Himself, and knew the longings of His heart; therefore they were ambassadors.<a name=2:14></a> Then the last verse of chapter 5 shows the foundation of the whole matter.<a name=2:15></a> The foundation is not referred to in chapter 3, but whichever view we are taking -- whether that of new covenant ministry, or the ministry of reconciliation --

		both are founded upon the momentous truth that "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that <i>we</i> might become God's righteousness in him", chapter 5: 21.<a name=3:1></a> So at the beginning of the reading, our hearts no doubt will be solemnised as we think of that -- the awfulness of it -- Him who knew not sin, God has made sin for us.<a name=3:2></a> Apart from that, there could be no new covenant ministry, and no ministry of reconciliation.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.F.<a name=3:4></a> Is that what is involved in the suggestion that the competency is of God?<a name=3:5></a> They are competent ministers of the new covenant, but that competency is of God Himself, is it not?<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> Quite so.<a name=3:9></a> It is remarkable what Paul says, "not that we are competent of ourselves to <i>think</i> anything as of ourselves", chapter 3: 5.<a name=3:10></a> It is not a question only of doing, it is a thing to take to heart, that we are not competent of ourselves even to <i>think</i> anything as to ourselves -- showing how dependent we are upon the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.E.<a name=3:12></a>E.<a name=3:13></a> Would it be right to say that in the new covenant ministry, as meeting the need of men, God is telling man what He is for him, but in the ministry of reconciliation is it more what man is intended to be for God?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:15></a>C.<a name=3:16></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=3:17></a> Chapter 3, as you say, brings out in a remarkable way what God is towards us, and what He is ministering through those whom He fits for the ministry.<a name=3:18></a> But then, the ministry of reconciliation brings home to us the longings of the heart of God to have man in His presence in suitability, that all distance should be removed, and the lengths to which He has gone to bring that about.<a name=3:19></a>

		G.R.<a name=5:5></a>C.<a name=5:6></a> Quite so.<a name=5:7></a> Paul was an example of this, even in the fact that he did not need a letter of commendation.<a name=5:8></a> He said, "<i>Ye</i> are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:2">2 Corinthians  3:2</a>.<a name=5:9></a> That is to say, Paul did not need to carry a letter of commendation about with him; it was so manifest that the Corinthians were written on his heart, that they were his letter.<a name=5:10></a> And this raises the whole question as to how we regard the brethren, how we talk about them.<a name=5:11></a> I feel certain that if anyone met Paul, they would not have heard about all the troubles at Corinth although he would tell Timothy and Titus.<a name=5:12></a> But there is a tendency in our hearts, which we know, to dwell upon troubles and difficulties.<a name=5:13></a> Brethren go from one country to another, possibly, and they say, 'What are the brethren like in <i>that</i> country?<a name=5:14></a>' And the tendency may be -- well, it <i>is</i>, with the natural heart -- I am only saying this as a warning to myself and to others -- to begin to talk about troubles and difficulties.<a name=5:15></a> But that is no letter of commendation -- that is the opposite.<a name=5:16></a> It does not commend a brother to me, when he is talking like that.<a name=5:17></a> Paul would speak to others of the positive side of things at Corinth, but he would bear in his own spirit the side of what needed adjustment.<a name=5:18></a> We should speak well of the brethren, viewing them as God views them, as the work of God; not comparing some to the disadvantage of others.<a name=5:19></a> To spiritual persons who are concerned and who may help in the matter, it is another thing to confide, in view of help.<a name=5:20></a> But the general thing was that the

		that we get our commission from the top.<a name=88:1></a> Whatever service we are given to do, if we do not get our commission from the top, our service will never be what it should be; it will never have the full flavour of Christianity about it.<a name=88:2></a> So we find Isaiah in the temple.<a name=88:3></a> In the year that king Uzziah died, he saw the Lord "sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up".<a name=88:4></a> A wonderful thing, the link between the throne and the temple.<a name=88:5></a> It is in Revelation, all through the book, Isaiah saw "the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up" -- "the Lord", "Adonai", a divine title of God, often used of the Lord personally, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>, but here evidently referring to God as God, for it says, "Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts" (verse 3).<a name=88:6></a> In the light of Christianity, it is the Trinity.<a name=88:7></a> But how do we know the Trinity in a man?<a name=88:8></a> So it is Jesus; Jesus is the King.<a name=88:9></a> He is the One sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, but the One in whom "dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=88:10></a> What a King!<a name=88:11></a> So that, as in His presence, from this standpoint, we are in the presence of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.<a name=88:12></a> Where the Lord is exalted and supreme like this, the Father's presence is always known, like the cloud on the mount.<a name=88:13></a> You cannot separate divine Persons in this sense.<a name=88:14></a> You can distinguish; but where surroundings are suitable, divine Persons are never separated.<a name=88:15></a> If conditions are there for the dwelling of God, we shall know the presence, not only of the Holy Spirit, but of the Son, and of the Father.<a name=88:16></a> So this passage sets out the idea of the temple in the full blaze of glory, and the seraphim are examples for us -- the service is proceeding.<a name=88:17></a> All priestly service should proceed in the light of the holiest, in the light of the glory -- in our day, that is.<a name=88:18></a> It was not so in Israel's day, but it is in our day.<a name=88:19></a> It is in the light of the holiest, and in the enjoyment of our place in the holiest, that we can take up the service, at the altars.<a name=88:20></a> And here was Isaiah -- he sees the seraphim.<a name=88:21></a> "Holy, holy, holy

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to say a word tonight, dear friends, on power and wisdom relative to planning.<a name=96:5></a> This is a great day for planning: every nation, especially the leading nations, is planning; the United Nations is planning.<a name=96:6></a> In a way, every one of us is a planner -- we seek to plan our lives: we have our business plans, it may be, and our plans as to our home, our family.<a name=96:7></a> So that planning is a thing that affects all of us.<a name=96:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You would all agree that in connection with planning, you need wisdom.<a name=96:9></a> It is a very foolish thing to plan either in a small or a big way unless you are a wise man, because your plan will not be much good.<a name=96:10></a> And the second thing that is needed if you are going to plan is power to carry it out.<a name=96:11></a> Now the world is especially engaged on planning at the present time, as we know; huge plans are afoot.<a name=96:12></a> And the planning in a way can be separated into two parts.<a name=96:13></a> Everyone in the world knows, every intelligent being, that something is wrong.<a name=96:14></a> I am sure everyone here will admit that anyway; we shall agree on that point, that there is something <i>wrong</i> with men, and with the world in general.<a name=96:15></a> Therefore, the first thing that must

	<div class="paragraph">
		engage planners is to deal with the problems, to seek to deal with what is wrong.<a name=97:1></a> There are many tremendous problems to be solved -- even as far as human planners see, there are many problems to be solved: racial problems, national problems, labour problems, international problems.<a name=97:2></a> So if planning is to be of any effect, the first thing is to deal with the problems; the next thing is, to plan a better world, once the problems are settled.<a name=97:3></a> What shape is the new world going to be?<a name=97:4></a> -- is a question that sometimes comes into the minds of human planners.<a name=97:5></a> You know, this quest for a better world has been going on for six thousand years or so, and we do not seem to be any nearer to it, do we?<a name=97:6></a> We have a much cleverer world, but not a better world.<a name=97:7></a> Evil is as mighty and powerful as ever, perhaps more mighty.<a name=97:8></a> The more clever you make a man, you see, if he is not right with God, the more scope he has to pursue what is evil.<a name=97:9></a> And so, in a way, with all the inventions and the cleverness that marks men of this age, the basic problem of sin and wickedness is worse than ever; instead of a better world, in many ways it is worse than ever.<a name=97:10></a> We want a peaceful world: but then peace is further away than ever.<a name=97:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so men are engaged with planning, both as to meeting the problems and as to bringing in something better.<a name=97:12></a> Whatever they may plan, they need power to carry it out, and so men are seeking power; each party with its plans wants power -- each party thinks its plans are best, and it seeks power to carry them out.<a name=97:13></a> The history of mankind shows a continuous tale of disappointment -- the planners are always disappointed, those who had hopes; the plans have always failed.<a name=97:14></a> You may not believe it, but I will tell you this: the plans always will fail.<a name=97:15></a> The planners do not, and cannot, go deep enough; the planners only touch the surface -- racial problems, labour problems, national problems, are just touching the surface; they

	<div class="paragraph">
		But all those remarks sprang from the statement that the planners have never tackled the matters of life and death.<a name=99:5></a> The medical profession extends our lives to some extent, but death is always around the corner.<a name=99:6></a> You see, what I can hold out to you, even the youngest here, as a certainty is not that <i>life</i> is before you, but that <i>death</i> is before you.<a name=99:7></a> That is the truth and the thing that needs to be faced.<a name=99:8></a> A boy or a girl may well say: well, I am only five years old, six years old, twelve.<a name=99:9></a> In ordinary average reckoning, we would say, well, you have life before you, but we cannot say that for certain.<a name=99:10></a> One thing we can say for certain: that, unless the Lord Jesus comes and you belong to him, you have death before you.<a name=99:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in planning we ought to face up to these things; but men blind their eyes to these things, they go on with surface matters.<a name=99:12></a> I do not want to decry those in authority; God uses them for the preservation of men, but I am thinking of the world planners.<a name=99:13></a> It says in the passage we read in Corinthians that the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God.<a name=99:14></a> Human wisdom at its very best is just foolishness in the eyes of God; it does not touch the root of anything, it gets you nowhere; it just scrapes the surface, and leaves you where you were.<a name=99:15></a>

		But now, I do not want to delay too long on negatives; I want to come on to God's planning.<a name=100:6></a> God has planned; and Job came to it -- he says to God: "Thou canst be hindered in no thought of Thine", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:2">Job  42:2</a>.<a name=100:7></a> God's plans are going through without the slightest doubt.<a name=100:8></a> Men would like to think, who do not believe in God, that the whole universe came into being haphazardly, chaotically.<a name=100:9></a> That is wishful thinking, you know, that is all it is; just wishful thinking.<a name=100:10></a> You see, men who are not prepared to face the truth as to their own need of a Saviour indulge in wishful thinking, and their wishful thinking says: well, let us pretend that this great universe in which we find ourselves just came into being chaotically -- certain atoms and molecules decided to become a horse and others decided to become other things and so it all came about, and we just came into being by chance.<a name=100:11></a> Well, I would say unequivocally, and many of the most renowned scientists agree with this now, that this is just wishful thinking; it is wishful thinking because you would like to shut God out, and feel that after all you could live and die and do just what you like, and in the end you would never have to face God and give an account to Him.<a name=100:12></a> Now, do not indulge in

		In Exodus there is conflict on <i>our</i> part.<a name=134:7></a> The first attack on the people of God after they crossed the Red Sea, was at Rephidim by Amalek, and it came at a certain point when the water was flowing out of the rock.<a name=134:8></a> Young man, have you a satisfied heart?<a name=134:9></a> Have you learnt to get supplies from the rock?<a name=134:10></a> It is when he sees that he is in danger of losing power over you, on account of your finding satisfaction in Christ alone, that Satan attacks.<a name=134:11></a> He has built up a system to seduce you.<a name=134:12></a> His system is the world, and it is made up of the "lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:16">1 John  2:16</a>.<a name=134:13></a> If you are not prepared to fight you will become a casualty.<a name=134:14></a> You have to learn to use the sword, or go down.<a name=134:15></a> Perhaps you do not like a sword, or the edge of it, but it is the only way of safety.<a name=134:16></a> Joshua broke the power of Amalek by the edge of the sword.<a name=134:17></a> The sword is used as "by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, so ye shall live", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:13">Romans  8:13</a>.<a name=134:18></a> Satan attacks through the flesh by its lusts.<a name=134:19></a> It may be the lust of the flesh, making us dissolute and drunken; or the lust of the eyes, the desire for outward show; or the pride of life, leading us to bend all our energies to get to the top of the ladder in our earthly calling.<a name=134:20></a> His aim is that we should waste the best years of our
