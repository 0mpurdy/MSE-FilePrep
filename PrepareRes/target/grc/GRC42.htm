		G.R.<a name=39:1></a>C.<a name=39:2></a> I think the link between <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> and <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>will be apparent.<a name=39:3></a> Sometimes objection is raised as to praising God according to the Name of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> on the ground that that name is connected with the setting of baptism; and also that, as is often said, it is in a testimonial setting; <i>but the song in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>is in the setting of baptism</i>; they have just passed through the Red Sea.<a name=39:4></a> The baptising of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> has its type in the Red Sea, so that the persons who sing the song have just been baptised -- I am speaking <i>typically</i> now -- to the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=39:5></a> It says, they "all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud in the sea", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:2">1 Corinthians  10:2</a>.<a name=39:6></a> We know that the cloud represented the presence of God, and they had been baptised in the cloud; and it says, "<i>Then</i> sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to Jehovah, and spoke, saying.<a name=39:7></a>.<a name=39:8></a>".<a name=39:9></a> so that as soon as the Red Sea is passed, the service of song commences -- not yet as ordered, as it was under David, but it breaks out in a kind of spontaneous way under the leading of Moses who is typical of Christ.<a name=39:10></a> It seems to me that that in itself is sufficient to meet the difficulty in some minds as to connecting the Name of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> with the praise of God.<a name=39:11></a> Immediately they are over the Red Sea, they praise God; and what is to be noticed is that they praise Him in three great names: Jehovah

		and Jah and El.<a name=40:1></a> First of all: "I will sing unto Jehovah"; then in verse 2, "My strength and song is Jah", and then, later in that verse, "This is my God" -- that is "El" -- the dot in front indicating that.<a name=40:2></a> As I understand it, Jah and El are the greatest names of God in the Old Testament; so that, immediately they have crossed the Red Sea, they praise God according to the greatest names by which He was known; and I believe these three names, Jehovah, Jah and El, can all be linked with the Name of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>.<a name=40:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>we have a <i>wilderness setting</i>.<a name=40:4></a> It says there in verse 7: "O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness".<a name=40:5></a> But in verse 4 we read: "Sing unto God, sing forth his name", and then it says, "<i>His name is Jah</i>".<a name=40:6></a> So that, again, in a wilderness setting, the greatest name of God is occupying the people; and in verse 20 "El" appears -- also in verses 24 and 35 -- indeed it is a psalm of great names and titles.<a name=40:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>, the climax of praise, it is to be noted that the name Jehovah is not used, but these two words alone appear, Jah and El.<a name=40:8></a> The first word is "Hallelujah!<a name=40:9></a>" -- "Praise ye Jah" -- then, "Praise El in his sanctuary".<a name=40:10></a> Finally, "Let everything that hath breath praise Jah.<a name=40:11></a> Praise ye Jah".<a name=40:12></a> There is a striking link between the original song in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, and the climax of praise under David in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>.<a name=40:13></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>begins with Jah and El, and the idea of the sanctuary comes in at the end of that chapter, and then <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>says, "Praise ye Jah.<a name=40:14></a> Praise El in his sanctuary".<a name=40:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=41:4></a> Would you say a little more as to the primary application of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>being to Matthew; is it because in Matthew and Mark we have the forsaking?<a name=41:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=41:6></a>C.<a name=41:7></a> Yes, the atoning sufferings come into Matthew; so the first phrase of the Psalm is quoted by the Lord on the cross.<a name=41:8></a> Secondly, Matthew is the assembly gospel, and the heading of the psalm, and verse 22, imply, for us, the assembly.<a name=41:9></a> Matthew, too, would link with the praises of Israel -- <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:3">Psalm  22:3</a> -- the Israel of God, being secured; it is also the gospel of the Son of David.<a name=41:10></a> So that one would suggest that the primary link of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>is with the gospel of Matthew.<a name=41:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		secure men in the light of revelation in such a manner that they can praise Jah and praise El in His sanctuary.<a name=43:1></a> It is with that end in view that creatures are blessed in the knowledge of God as revealed in the economy -- applying it to Christianity -- that they might praise Jah, and praise El in His sanctuary.<a name=43:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sanctuary idea is different from the home-life idea.<a name=43:3></a> When we think of access to the Father through the Son and by the Spirit, it is like divine home-life; but when we think of praising El in His sanctuary, it is a question of God in His greatness.<a name=43:4></a> It is the persons who know the home-life who are qualified to praise God in His sanctuary.<a name=43:5></a> To use a human illustration: in a palace home-life is known; but also in the palace there are state apartments where the king is known in royal splendour; and those who know him in home-life are best qualified to give him the glory due to him in his splendour on state occasions.<a name=43:6></a> The sanctuary involves the holy splendour connected with the presence of God in His greatness and majesty.<a name=43:7></a>

		Rem.<a name=43:8></a> And, to use the human illustration, an intelligent son recognises that he is a subject of His Majesty.<a name=43:9></a> While thoroughly at home in paternal affections in the home-life, it is as a subject that he addresses the King in the state apartments; he would not address him as father there, although he knows him as such, but would render to him the tribute and homage due to him as the King, though we must always remember that no human illustration can adequately convey the idea of the Trinity.<a name=43:10></a>

		of the other aspect of it?<a name=45:1></a> For the Name also conveys <i>the co-equality of the Persons in the oneness of Godhead</i>; and I believe that is where the link would come in with Jah and El.<a name=45:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=45:3></a> You mean that the relative positions They have come into in the economy in no way detract from the essential equality attaching to each of the three Persons; and the fact of Their essential equality only adds glory to the respective places into which They have come in view of revelation.<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=45:5></a>C.<a name=45:6></a> As getting the gain of the economy, it sets us free for what is the highest form of praise, that is the praise of God according to the abundance of His greatness, as it says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150">Psalm  150</a>; and <i>all the greatness suggested in the great names Jah and El applies equally to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit</i>.<a name=45:7></a>

		G.R.<a name=46:5></a>C.<a name=46:6></a> Yes, baptism puts us together; they went out in rank, and I would say that while it is not yet the ordered service under David, it is <i>in principle</i> the Lord singing in the assembly.<a name=46:7></a> They are called the children of Israel here, but Stephen in his address in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>says that Moses was "in the assembly in the wilderness", and they are called "the assembly" in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>; so the idea of the assembly is there, though not in its ordered form under David.<a name=46:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=46:12></a>C.<a name=46:13></a> It does; the doxologies in Romans greatly help as to this.<a name=46:14></a> All the honours of Deity are due to Christ in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>; He is "over all, God blessed for ever".<a name=46:15></a> <i>He</i> is Jah; <i>He</i> is El, equally with the Father, "that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:23">John  5:23</a>.<a name=46:16></a>
