		G.R.<a name=30:1></a>C.<a name=30:2></a> In the brief time at our disposal we can only touch an outline of what is in mind, that is the relation between the family, the body and the temple.<a name=30:3></a> The truth of the assembly of God has to be arrived at that way if it is to be arrived at vitally: it is what we might call Paul's <i>constructive</i> way.<a name=30:4></a> And so, in writing to the Thessalonians, while he calls them the <i>assembly</i> of the Thessalonians, shewing what he has in mind, yet the epistle shews that his aim there had been to lay a basis in <i>family affections</i>; and that was really as far as they had proceeded at that time.<a name=30:5></a> We never leave family affections behind.<a name=30:6></a> They are to increase with us and they go on to all eternity; and our ability to move on to other features of Paul's ministry depends on a thorough basis of family affections amongst us.<a name=30:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Corinthians he develops the truth of the assembly of God and shows that they were the body of Christ and temple of God.<a name=30:8></a> The passage in John is appropriate to our day, John's gospel having been written last.<a name=30:9></a> It says, the Lord, having made a scourge of cords, cleansed the temple.<a name=30:10></a> If we apply it to the last days it would refer to what He did through J.<a name=30:11></a>N.<a name=30:12></a>D.<a name=30:13></a> Every evil practice in Christendom was exposed.<a name=30:14></a> But in acting thus the Lord said, "make not My Father's house a house of merchandise"; that is, He brings in the <i>family</i> idea.<a name=30:15></a> He was not speaking of the Father's house as in chapter 14.<a name=30:16></a> Applying it to our day, it would mean "the habitation of God in the Spirit" here and now on earth.<a name=30:17></a> It is a sphere of family affections where the presence of the Spirit and
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the Son and of the Father is to be known.<a name=31:1></a> But then in verse 19 He brings in the idea of the temple.<a name=31:2></a> "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=31:3></a> And when the Jews raise difficulty it says, "he spoke of the temple of his body".<a name=31:4></a> So we find the Lord here describing God's habitation on earth as a sphere of family affections -- My Father's house.<a name=31:5></a> But then, speaking of the temple, the Spirit of God says, "He spoke of the temple of his body".<a name=31:6></a> When He was here His own body was the shrine -- the word "temple" here and in Corinthians means the shrine; now the saints form the shrine.<a name=31:7></a> "Do ye not know that ye are the temple [shrine] of God?<a name=31:8></a>" But if the saints form the shrine it is because they are the body of Christ.<a name=31:9></a> Now, as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>and 14 shew, it is the saints as His body -- and functioning as such -- who are the temple.<a name=31:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first instance, we should see the importance of family affections because, if we try to rear the superstructure of assembly administration and order on any other base, it will become official and formal and, it may be, harsh.<a name=31:11></a> Furthermore, I do not think we can face body exercises properly without a foundation of family affections.<a name=31:12></a> And so Paul ministered in such a manner in Thessalonica that after three weeks' service he described them as the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=31:13></a> They were in the gain of the kingdom as in the Lord Jesus Christ, but they were also in the <i>gain of the family as in God the Father</i>.<a name=31:14></a> And he shews that if the saints are to be in the gain of the family it will be through the influence of men who are representative of God in <i>parental</i> character.<a name=31:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		small cords and brought in a ministry which exposed the whole of christendom.<a name=32:1></a> Saints were liberated and an early feature of the revival was the bringing about of family affections amongst the saints which are not found in current religions.<a name=32:2></a> You can go into associations which profess Christ's name and you will not find family affections there.<a name=32:3></a> Persons gathered are simply congregations.<a name=32:4></a> But what strikes a person first, coming into contact with what is vital, is family affections.<a name=32:5></a> He finds a circle of love; "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>.<a name=32:6></a> A circle of love cannot be found in current religion in the world.<a name=32:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=32:10></a>C.<a name=32:11></a> Quite so, and Paul says, "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a>.<a name=32:12></a> The family is a <i>basic matter</i>.<a name=32:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=32:16></a>C.<a name=32:17></a> That is very good.<a name=32:18></a> He got two impressions at least, at his conversion.<a name=32:19></a> One was that Jesus is the Son of God, that is, he apprehended sonship and the family; and secondly that the church is the body of Christ.<a name=32:20></a> They are the two great lines of Paul's ministry, first his ministry of the gospel which brings in sonship, and secondly his ministry of the assembly.<a name=32:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=32:22></a> This expression of the Lord "my Father's house" would set out in a supreme way the feelings that are proper to the family.<a name=32:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=32:24></a>C.<a name=32:25></a> Feelings in the family originate with the Father.<a name=32:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=32:27></a> So that Paul's word is "gentle".<a name=32:28></a> He says, "gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse would cherish her own children".<a name=32:29></a> That is very wonderful.<a name=32:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=32:31></a>C.<a name=32:32></a> It is wonderful.<a name=32:33></a> He does not call himself an apostle in this epistle, he does not want anything official to intrude, for the time being, on family

	<div class="paragraph">
		affections and feelings.<a name=33:1></a> He wants the truth of the family thoroughly laid in the souls of the saints, and we need to see to it that it is thoroughly laid in our localities.<a name=33:2></a> The Father's affections came into display when the Son was found here in Manhood.<a name=33:3></a> In the presence of an adequate Object the Father's affections, in their glory, came into manifestation.<a name=33:4></a> "The Father loves the Son".<a name=33:5></a> That is the beginning of things from this standpoint; and the Lord says, "as the Father has loved me so have I loved you.<a name=33:6></a> This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I love you".<a name=33:7></a> The love begins with the Father.<a name=33:8></a> The Father loves the Son, the Son loves us as the Father has loved Him, and we are to love one another with the same character of love.<a name=33:9></a> Paul was actually carrying the new commandment out; he was loving these saints as Christ loved them and therefore as the Father loves them.<a name=33:10></a> The new commandment is fundamental to christianity.<a name=33:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=33:12></a> So the relation between the affections and the commandments is very noticeable in John's ministry.<a name=33:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=33:14></a>C.<a name=33:15></a> Quite so.<a name=33:16></a> Is not every commandment a necessity of divine love?<a name=33:17></a> Separation is a commandment because it is a necessity of divine love.<a name=33:18></a> But the new commandment is, I suppose, the greatest of commandments because it commands love of a character which has its origin in the Father and His love for the Son.<a name=33:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=33:20></a> So that the Father's love for the Son is what impresses you in the beginning and then the Father's commandment, that is, His authority.<a name=33:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=33:22></a>C.<a name=33:23></a> His commandment is life eternal and the conditions we are speaking of now -- family conditions -- are essential to life eternal, are they not?<a name=33:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=34:7></a> The first mention of love in the Bible is the father's love.<a name=34:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=34:9></a>C.<a name=34:10></a> Exactly, and this is the source of love of this kind -- the Father's love for the Son.<a name=34:11></a> It is the great motive which will bring to pass the universe as depicted in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>.<a name=34:12></a> In naming every family the Father's great motive is His love for the Son.<a name=34:13></a> It works down to His love for every family, but the great motive is His love for the Son.<a name=34:14></a> He will bring to pass a universe adequate for the Son as a centre.<a name=34:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=34:16></a> Is it significant, therefore, that the top note, so to speak, of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>is, "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them"?<a name=34:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=34:18></a>C.<a name=34:19></a> Is it not a great service of the Spirit to bring us into the flow of the Father's love for the Son, on the one hand, and into the flow of the Son's love for the Father on the other, "I in them", so that we see the necessity for the Spirit's service.<a name=34:20></a> Who else could bring us into the flow of the Father's affections for the Son and the Son's affections for the Father?<a name=34:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=34:22></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, when Judas went out, the Lord calls them children.<a name=34:23></a> Do the feelings of the Father toward them as children find expression in the Lord Himself?<a name=34:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=34:25></a>C.<a name=34:26></a> That is confirmed in chapter 14 where He says, "He that has seen me has seen the Father".<a name=34:27></a> They had seen Him in chapter 13 as a father who would do anything for his children.<a name=34:28></a> The Lord would wash the feet of the disciples, taking the place of a slave.<a name=34:29></a> A true father would do anything for his children, so would a true mother and, of course, both features are seen in Christ, because both features

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=35:5></a> I see what you mean.<a name=35:6></a> You are speaking about the great thought of the Father, and so the mother is a kindred line.<a name=35:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=35:8></a>C.<a name=35:9></a> It is the other side of the parental position.<a name=35:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=35:11></a> Paul was mother to the Galatians.<a name=35:12></a> He could say, "of whom I again travail in birth".<a name=35:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=35:14></a>C.<a name=35:15></a> Yes.<a name=35:16></a> He writes to the Corinthians as a father, but he writes to the Galatians as an outraged mother.<a name=35:17></a> Somebody was damaging the children, and his maternal feelings were thoroughly aroused.<a name=35:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=35:19></a> In <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:7">1 Thessalonians  2:7</a>, Paul speaks of himself as a nurse who "would cherish her own children", and in verse 11, "ye know how, as a father his own children".<a name=35:20></a> Both features were found in Paul.<a name=35:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=35:22></a>C.<a name=35:23></a> And it is interesting that the mother comes first.<a name=35:24></a> The first love that a child consciously experiences is a mother's love, and so Paul puts that first.<a name=35:25></a> It comes first also in the practical application of the commandment in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#19:3">Leviticus  19:3</a>, "Ye shall reverence every man his mother, and his father, and my sabbaths shall ye keep: I am Jehovah your God".<a name=35:26></a> That chapter is very instructive because the assembly is in mind; "Speak unto all the assembly of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Holy shall ye be, for I Jehovah your God am holy".<a name=35:27></a> But the first thing is, "Ye shall reverence every man his mother".<a name=35:28></a> Now, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>it says, "Honour thy father and thy mother".<a name=35:29></a> The father is put first on the divine side; but, when it is a question of our coming into the thing practically, it puts the mother first.<a name=35:30></a> It is very tender on God's part to do so, because the place where authority is least irksome of all is in the mother.<a name=35:31></a>
