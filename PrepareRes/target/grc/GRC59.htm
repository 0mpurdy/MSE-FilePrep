		What is in mind is the need to get back to and understand the Divine System.<a name=1:7></a> It is not a question of thinking of a system we have left, but of a system which will stand for ever, which it would be apostasy to leave.<a name=1:8></a> It is the system to which we belong and which, in so far as we have been carried away by man-made ideas, we have departed from.<a name=1:9></a> In leaving a system which has become dominated by man's thoughts, it would be sad if we found ourselves with an empty void.<a name=1:10></a> It would mean that we had got virtually no appreciation of Christ and of the divine system, of which He is the Author, Centre and Upholder.<a name=1:11></a> There is a great need to understand that we belong to a system, the principles of which are unalterable, which is already existing and which abides for eternity.<a name=1:12></a> It is described in this Epistle as the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man, and nothing that has happened during recent years, or however far back we go, has in any way altered the tabernacle which the Lord has pitched, and we have to take account of those words added, "<i>not man</i>".<a name=1:13></a> That is the thing we have got to lay hold of, "<i>not man</i>"; because whenever man intrudes he brings in something which <i>diverts</i> from the divine system.<a name=1:14></a> So we have got to think of a system, the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man; there is not a thing of man about it.<a name=1:15></a> In chapter 9 it speaks

		of Jesus not having entered into holy places made with hands.<a name=2:1></a> We want nothing of man's making.<a name=2:2></a> So we have to discard what is of man's making and what man has pitched, but it is all with a view to getting back to what was always there, to what we know we have departed from, to the system to which we belong.<a name=2:3></a> We are not freelances, free to act as though we did not belong to a system at all, that would be anarchy.<a name=2:4></a> For everyone to do what is right in his own eyes is anarchy.<a name=2:5></a> But in being released from what is of man, the value of it lies in coming, in a fuller way than we have ever known, to what is of God, in which lies true liberty.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=2:7></a> Viewing the tabernacle system have you in mind that everything there was according to the divine plan.<a name=2:8></a> There is a system now that is going through that is wholly of God, and is the divine intention today to search our hearts as to how far we are in it?<a name=2:9></a> Are we in it livingly, practically and fully?<a name=2:10></a> What are we giving ourselves to?<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:12></a>C.<a name=2:13></a> Yes.<a name=2:14></a> So that the epistle develops the system before it speaks of going forth to Him without the camp; that is the order of the teaching.<a name=2:15></a> You do not go forth to an empty void, in fact you go forth to <i>Him</i>, but we have to understand that, in going forth to Him, we go forth to Him as the Centre of a system which the book has described.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=2:17></a> So that everything of the tabernacle system was there in divine order.<a name=2:18></a> That is, the curtains, and the boards and the furniture; God was concerned that that system would go through.<a name=2:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:20></a>C.<a name=2:21></a> And we see in Revelation that it does go through.<a name=2:22></a> The tabernacle of God is with men.<a name=2:23></a> The tabernacle which the Lord pitched goes through into eternity, and I suppose we might say it began at Pentecost.<a name=2:24></a> Although the Lord was gathering material for it earlier, I suppose the pitching of it was at Pentecost, and at the beginning of Acts

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=3:2></a>M.<a name=3:3></a> Would you say that the book of Hebrews was written to link on those that believed in Jerusalem with the system set up.<a name=3:4></a> We tend to give up the assembly position.<a name=3:5></a> That is what you are encouraging us not to do, not to be freelances.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=3:9></a> Although they were in Jerusalem, they had to learn that Jerusalem, as the centre of the Jewish system, was essentially part of the camp.<a name=3:10></a> The Lord suffered without the gate of that particular city, and we are to go forth to Him without the camp because there is nothing in the camp that has any compatibility with the divine system.<a name=3:11></a> The divine system is entirely apart from the camp, there is nothing in common.<a name=3:12></a> Therefore if you go forth to Him it is a very comprehensive thing, you go forth to that blessed Person.<a name=3:13></a> He has founded, upholds, and gives character to the vast divine system.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=3:15></a>W.<a name=3:16></a> Is that the meaning of His title here, Jesus, the Son of God?<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:18></a>C.<a name=3:19></a> It is.<a name=3:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.G.<a name=3:21></a>V.<a name=3:22></a>C.<a name=3:23></a> Is the basis of your exhortation what we have in the first verse read in chapter 4 "let us hold fast the confession"?<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:25></a>C.<a name=3:26></a> That is good, because as Christians our confession lies really in the fact that God is soon going to bring this system into display.<a name=3:27></a> That is the idea of the testimony.<a name=3:28></a> But we are in it already in faith and by the Spirit.<a name=3:29></a> We are well acquainted with it, in fact we know the innermost part of it; and God is going to bring it into display, so that immediately after speaking of entering the holy of holies, it says "and let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering".<a name=3:30></a> You see, the hope is certain; we are already well acquainted with the system in the faith of our souls and in the power of the Spirit,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		therefore we know it is only a matter of God's time before the system comes into display, and the more we go into the holy of holies and enjoy our part in it, the stronger our confession will be, the confession of the hope.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=4:2></a>P.<a name=4:3></a> I wonder if the truth that the High Priest is on high, Jesus, the Son of God, to support us is important for all of us today.<a name=4:4></a> We should hold fast the confession.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:6></a>C.<a name=4:7></a> There is a danger at the moment, through reaction or through suffering or depression; and the suffering is becoming more severe with some just now in the breaking up of families, through wicked teaching.<a name=4:8></a> There is the danger of failing to hold fast and then the enemy gets an advantage.<a name=4:9></a> We want to go on with buoyancy; hope suggests buoyancy.<a name=4:10></a> The more you know of the system you belong to, the more buoyant you are; it is the confession of the hope and not simply the confession of faith.<a name=4:11></a> Faith must be there, but the confession of the hope suggests something very lively.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.G.<a name=4:13></a>R.<a name=4:14></a> Do we need to maintain in our minds the pattern that was shown on the mount?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:16></a>C.<a name=4:17></a> Quite so; and that enters into going forth unto Him without the camp, because not only is He the Founder and Upholder and Head and Centre of the system, but the whole system takes character from Him.<a name=4:18></a> You go forth unto Him and you find that He is linked with a system where there is nothing of the old man at all -- it is outside the camp.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.G.<a name=4:20></a>R.<a name=4:21></a> So that in <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43">Ezekiel  43</a>it says that the visions that he saw were like the vision he had seen by the river Chebar in chapter one.<a name=4:22></a> Was he sustained, in spite of the pressure and the breakdown publicly, in the full light of what God was going to bring in in glory?<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:24></a>C.<a name=4:25></a> Yes.<a name=4:26></a> So that the visions of Ezekiel are most important in our day.<a name=4:27></a> And then getting

		back, as you say, to the pattern on the mount is important -- for it is getting back to fundamentals.<a name=5:1></a> Every part of the tabernacle was Christ in character.<a name=5:2></a> There was not a single thing in the tabernacle which was not typically Christ -- Christ personally or Christ in the saints.<a name=5:3></a> So that going forth to Him outside the camp, you are brought to a system where He is everything and in all.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=5:5></a>R.<a name=5:6></a> That makes the Holy Spirit very important in this matter.<a name=5:7></a> The tabernacle was pitched when the Spirit came down.<a name=5:8></a> But the Spirit's presence is the assurance that it will all go through, yet nothing but Christ will go through.<a name=5:9></a> He is occupied in forming Christ in the saints and He was greatly grieved when the Spirit of Christ was rejected.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:11></a>C.<a name=5:12></a> Quite so.<a name=5:13></a> What a wonderful thing it is that, not only did the Spirit come down as the anointing, because the whole tabernacle system was anointed, but in His coming, God came down to dwell in the habitation.<a name=5:14></a> It is not an uninhabited tabernacle.<a name=5:15></a> God is there; and if there are tabernacle conditions, a simple person or unbeliever coming in will say God is among you of a truth.<a name=5:16></a> Because in Corinthians the assembly is viewed as the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, and God is there.<a name=5:17></a> That is to say if we are governed by the system in faith and giving place to the Spirit, that will be our experience.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=5:19></a>H.<a name=5:20></a> What answers to the camp today?<a name=5:21></a> We have often quoted "Let us go forth to Him outside the camp bearing His reproach".<a name=5:22></a> I wonder whether we sufficiently understand what the camp signifies.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:24></a>C.<a name=5:25></a> One thing that would be accepted by the early Hebrew Christians would be that Jerusalem was part of the camp.<a name=5:26></a> That was the extraordinary thing in that day.<a name=5:27></a> And we have had to accept that what we thought was our Jerusalem has become part of the camp.<a name=5:28></a> "Go forth", it says.<a name=5:29></a>

		are the camp, which you have drawn our attention to?<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:2></a>C.<a name=6:3></a> I believe that is a key word in this book; first "not made with hands", and then "which the Lord pitched and not man".<a name=6:4></a> No part of it is made with hands, not even a little section of it.<a name=6:5></a> And the whole thing was never pitched by man.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=6:7></a> So the One who is the Head of it is the great High Priest who has passed through the heavens; that is something that cannot fail, it is nothing to do with this world at all.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:9></a>C.<a name=6:10></a> In the type it refers no doubt to the high priest going right in with the blood.<a name=6:11></a> He passed through the court into the holy place and right through into the holiest of all.<a name=6:12></a> And in another scripture it says He is made higher than the heavens; He has gone above them all, because of who He is.<a name=6:13></a> But the point here is that He is gone through the heavens; our Great High Priest has gone right into the centre of the system.<a name=6:14></a> He Himself is the Centre of it.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.G.<a name=6:16></a>R.<a name=6:17></a> Is that why it is "Jesus the Son of God"?<a name=6:18></a> Is it that we should be impressed with the reality of the One who has been here on our behalf and on God's behalf too?<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=6:20></a>C.<a name=6:21></a> Each of these scriptures speaks of what <i>we</i> have.<a name=6:22></a> We could have read parts of this book which refer more to what God has.<a name=6:23></a> But these passages refer more particularly to what <i>we have</i>.<a name=6:24></a> "Having a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God".<a name=6:25></a> And then in the next passage, the summary is "that we have such a one High Priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".<a name=6:26></a> Here it is simply that He has passed through, like the priests going in.<a name=6:27></a> But in that chapter, His work is viewed as so complete that He has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens.<a name=6:28></a> And then chapter ten is also what we have,

		"having boldness" to enter, because He has made a new and living way through for us.<a name=7:1></a> So that we have boldness to enter, and we have Him there as the Great Priest.<a name=7:2></a> And finally "we have an altar", that is down here.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=7:4></a>P.<a name=7:5></a> I wonder whether on the one hand we have the greatness of the Person who has gone right into heaven itself, yet on the other hand we have His love and sensitiveness as to all the saints may be passing through.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:7></a>C.<a name=7:8></a> That is right.<a name=7:9></a> And so according to this passage we approach the throne of grace.<a name=7:10></a> The word approach could be translated "come near"; it is so in the Authorised -- "Come boldly".<a name=7:11></a> So you have the idea in this book, firstly approaching or coming and then going.<a name=7:12></a> We are not told to "go forth" until we come.<a name=7:13></a> The thing is to learn to come boldly to the throne of grace and with boldness to enter into the holy of holies.<a name=7:14></a> And then knowing what we have got on the positive line, in the power of it, we go forth unto Him outside the camp.<a name=7:15></a> What do we want of the camp once we have known the blessedness of this system?<a name=7:16></a> Who would go back into the camp after that?<a name=7:17></a>

		G.R.<a name=7:20></a>C.<a name=7:21></a> I think our confession would be our living appreciation of the whole truth of Christianity in so far as we have learnt it.<a name=7:22></a> The confession abstractly is the whole truth of Christianity livingly held by the saints.<a name=7:23></a> But then our measures of course differ.<a name=7:24></a> What a confession belongs to the Christian!<a name=7:25></a> He is here in a world where Christ has been cast out to confess that Jesus is the Inaugurator and Sustainer and Centre of a system that is soon going to supersede everything man has built up.<a name=7:26></a> Jesus is the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.<a name=7:27></a>
