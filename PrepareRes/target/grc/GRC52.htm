		Now, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23">Psalm  23</a>you have the language of one who has returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of his soul.<a name=72:16></a> I am applying it that way because it fits in with present exercises.<a name=72:17></a> Let us test ourselves by this Psalm as to whether we have so returned.<a name=72:18></a> David says, "Jehovah is my shepherd, I shall not want".<a name=72:19></a> Have we proved that?<a name=72:20></a> Have we proved His all-sufficiency?<a name=72:21></a>
