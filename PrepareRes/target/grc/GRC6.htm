		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> I thought we might consider the great truth of Emmanuel, which means "God [El] with us"; and then the kind of persons who are able to appreciate this name, as it says in verse 23 of chapter 1, "<i>they</i> shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'", so that we might get some apprehension of who the "they" and the "us" are.<a name=1:3></a> It is a matter which bears on the personnel which composes the assembly, and also on the assembly itself.<a name=1:4></a> In this first reading, however, it would be well to consider the person of Christ Himself.<a name=1:5></a> He is introduced here as Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham; and in verse 17 all the generations concentrate on <i>the Christ</i>.<a name=1:6></a> Then there is His personal Name -- "Thou shalt call his name Jesus", and the reason for that; and then, "they shall call His name Emmanuel".<a name=1:7></a> <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9">Isaiah  9</a>indicates that there are those who appreciate in full measure the One who has come in -- "For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulders; and His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God", [mighty El] "Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace.<a name=1:8></a> Of the increase of His government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it".<a name=1:9></a> So that peace is what is in view in the rule of the Son of David, He whose name in the type -- Solomon -- means 'peaceful'.<a name=1:10></a> But then it is an immense thing that our affections should be engaged with the Person.<a name=1:11></a> He is introduced in Matthew as <i>the Beloved</i>.<a name=1:12></a> The son of David was named Jedidiah, "Beloved of Jehovah",

		gospel of Matthew, rightly understood, would bring about in us what corresponds to the virgin -- or unconquered -- daughter of Zion; and that is why I think it is important to see that the One coming in, according to Matthew, is the Beloved.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:2></a> I would like to go back to what you said about the Beloved.<a name=3:3></a> Does it not involve that <i>we</i> are brought into communion with the Father in regard to the Son?<a name=3:4></a> The names Son of David and Son of Abraham, suggest the Father's thoughts about the Son.<a name=3:5></a> Are we not brought into communion with Him?<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> God says of the son of David, "I will be to him father and he shall be to me son".<a name=3:9></a> The Lord Jesus is the Son of the Father's love.<a name=3:10></a> Then the word to Abraham was, "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac".<a name=3:11></a> God has relied upon an object of such tender affection to carry things through for Him; as the Son of Abraham He was to lay the basis for blessing.<a name=3:12></a> The Father, the Lord of the heaven and of the earth, had in mind to fill heaven and earth with families named of Himself, and the carrying through of His purpose was entrusted to One whose affections were equal to it -- His only Son, whom He loved.<a name=3:13></a> On the other hand, the Son of David is the one upon whom God relies to gather up the response of the whole universe.<a name=3:14></a> The outgoings of all the saved families will be gathered up by Him in responsive praise to God.<a name=3:15></a> It is the Beloved who accomplishes those great matters.<a name=3:16></a> Is that so?<a name=3:17></a>

		G.R.<a name=4:4></a>C.<a name=4:5></a> We learn to love the Christ, the Centre of the divine system.<a name=4:6></a> Paul says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, "I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .<a name=4:7></a>.<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a> in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that <i>the Christ</i> may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".<a name=4:10></a> He is the Beloved of the Father, and <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9">Isaiah  9</a>shows how affectionately we embrace Him -- "unto <i>us</i> a child is born, unto us a son is given".<a name=4:11></a> How much we appreciate that <i>such</i> an One had been given to us.<a name=4:12></a> We can think delightedly of what He is to God; but He is also given to <i>us</i> to be the Object of <i>our</i> affections, the Object of our trust.<a name=4:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:18></a>C.<a name=4:19></a> That is why I suggested reading in chapter 2.<a name=4:20></a> The word there is, "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=4:21></a> He is Son of David and Son of Abraham, but the One who fills out those great positions is the One of whom God says, "my Son".<a name=4:22></a> That is why the positions are so great.<a name=4:23></a> Whatever promises of God there are -- and most of these were connected with the Son of David and the Son of Abraham -- in the Son of God is the yea, and in Him the amen.<a name=4:24></a> The Son of God has, in grace, become Son of David and Son of Abraham.<a name=4:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:6></a>C.<a name=5:7></a> I am sure it is; and, as I was saying, we have to keep in mind that behind the expression, "Son of David", lies <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>and the Song of Songs.<a name=5:8></a> Solomon, the king, is the beloved.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:10></a> I was wondering whether the Person of Christ is a theme which constantly recalls our hearts, because the three sets of fourteen generations involve the matter of recovery at the end, do they not?<a name=5:11></a> Abraham to David is, in one sense, an unbroken line; and then we have the carrying away; and then everything recovered in the Christ.<a name=5:12></a> Would that bear upon our day, and cause the hearts of recovered persons to appreciate Christ more and more?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:14></a>C.<a name=5:15></a> I think that.<a name=5:16></a> The Immanuel section of Isaiah begins with "Shear-jashub", which means, "a remnant shall return".<a name=5:17></a> Isaiah was told to take his stand, with his son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller's field, <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#7:3">Isaiah  7:3</a>, and it was the remnant who returned in heart to God who proved the truth of Emmanuel in that day.<a name=5:18></a> You are referring to the return from Babylon; but even before the captivity they had departed from God; and, through Isaiah's ministry, a remnant of Judah returned to God.<a name=5:19></a> Thus the features of the virgin daughter of Zion came to light in Jerusalem, and therefore the truth of Emmanuel, "God with us", was realised.<a name=5:20></a> And so, in our day, unless the features of the virgin daughter of Zion come to light through affection for Christ and true return to God, we shall never understand the truth of Emmanuel.<a name=5:21></a> Virgin

		G.R.<a name=18:1></a>C.<a name=18:2></a> I think it will be helpful to dwell upon John the Baptist's testimony to Christ.<a name=18:3></a> He refers to the axe being applied to the root of the trees, and then bears testimony to activities of a very distinctive kind on the part of the Lord -- "He shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire; whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner".<a name=18:4></a> This refers prophetically to His activities which would bring about conditions amongst His people, saving them from their sins, which would permit them to know unhinderedly the truth of Emmanuel, God with us.<a name=18:5></a> Then in chapter 5, in the Lord's first recorded teaching, He sets out in the first seven beatitudes the character of the wheat which He is securing, the features proper to the personnel of the assembly, the sons of the kingdom; so that the operations of the threshing-floor are to bring to pass those features without which we cannot know the blessedness of Emmanuel.<a name=18:6></a> These features are set out in the King, Whom we referred to this afternoon as the Beloved, the Object of such affection, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.<a name=18:7></a> Both of these titles bring the Lord Jesus before us as the Beloved, and so also does the title "the Christ".<a name=18:8></a> Those who are held in virgin affection for Him become numbered among those who call His name Emmanuel, come to apprehend the truth of His Person, and experience the blessedness of God with us, as saved practically from their sins.<a name=18:9></a> If that is to be so, the activities of the Lord are necessary, because of what we are.<a name=18:10></a> He thus takes us in hand.<a name=18:11></a>
