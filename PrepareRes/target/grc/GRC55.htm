		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> I thought we might be helped in conversing on these four items, connected with the call of God.<a name=1:3></a> Firstly, the call out of Egypt, then the call out of Babylon, and then the call <i>into</i> the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and finally the calling on high.<a name=1:4></a> The calling of God, because it is the <i>calling of God</i>, is of supreme importance.<a name=1:5></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#50">Psalm  50</a>, "God, Elohim -- Jehovah, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof".<a name=1:6></a> His voice carries an authority which no other voice could, and that Psalm connects it with the shining forth of God.<a name=1:7></a> "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth".<a name=1:8></a> The calling has what is wonderfully positive behind it; the shining forth of God in the face of a glorified Man, the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=1:9></a> And the perfection of beauty is in Him; that is, that not only is God shining forth radiantly in Jesus glorified in His presence, but we see in Christ also the perfect answer to the call.<a name=1:10></a> The perfection of beauty -- not only the Urim but the Thummim, not only the perfection of light, that is God shining forth in Jesus, but in the same Person is the perfect answer to the brilliant light that is now shining.<a name=1:11></a> It is in the light of all that that the call reaches us.<a name=1:12></a> It is a wonderful call because it is a call to glory -- the calling on high.<a name=1:13></a> The One who is there, the One who established God's glory on the cross and

		who is therefore now glorified, and God's glory shining in His face -- which we ought to be acquainted with: the face of Jesus -- He is our righteousness, He is our claim; and having Him as our righteousness we have a divine title to be where He is.<a name=2:1></a> And the calling calls us there, it calls us to where Jesus is, the calling on high.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, that being so, it must be a call out, because God's glory is not shining in Egypt, and God's glory is not shining in Babylon.<a name=2:3></a> All that is in Egypt and in Babylon would obscure the glory from our gaze.<a name=2:4></a> But the whole thing is most attractive.<a name=2:5></a> Even in the first scripture we read, the attractiveness of it is emphasised -- "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=2:6></a> The calling involves sonship -- many sons to glory.<a name=2:7></a> And for the many sons that God foreknew, what a place he has prepared!<a name=2:8></a> He has given us Christ as our righteousness, so that where Christ is we can be.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.P.<a name=2:10></a> Would the first scripture link on with the Epistle to the Romans in chapter 1: 7, "beloved of God, called saints"?<a name=2:11></a> And then in chapter 8 it is also those whom He has called, that is in view of sonship.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:13></a>C.<a name=2:14></a> Yes.<a name=2:15></a> And it goes on, these also He justified and glorified.<a name=2:16></a> Romans might well be studied from that angle -- the call of God and what He has done for the subjects of His call.<a name=2:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		gospel is so wonderful.<a name=3:1></a> It is a call from the glory to the glory.<a name=3:2></a> And if that is apprehended by the soul, what is involved in it in the way of negative things is incidental.<a name=3:3></a> We have heard a voice from glory which called us to the glory.<a name=3:4></a> Before we ever moved or thought of Him we were sons in purpose.<a name=3:5></a> Out of Egypt have I called my son.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:7></a> Did not Peter say they heard a voice "by the excellent glory"?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:9></a>C.<a name=3:10></a> Yes, and Hebrews suggests that that voice is still being heard because it says, "See that ye refuse not him that speaks".<a name=3:11></a> He speaks from heaven.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=3:13></a> Does not this shew intense feelings on the part of God, because right at the outset God calls to man, does He not?<a name=3:14></a> He says, Where art thou?<a name=3:15></a> God calls to Adam after the distance had been brought in.<a name=3:16></a> And is it not this that gives us a real sense of the urge in God's heart towards His creature man?<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:18></a>C.<a name=3:19></a> And at that early date, having discovered in some degree to man the distance into which he had got, God shows how He is going to justify him, by making the coats of skin.<a name=3:20></a> Now, we know that God not only justifies but glorifies.<a name=3:21></a> The voice now comes from the glory and calls to the glory those who are entirely fitted for glory by the work of Christ and by Divine workmanship in the soul through the gift of the Spirit.<a name=3:22></a> It is a most wonderful thing to be called of God.<a name=3:23></a> But not everybody answers to the call.<a name=3:24></a> In fact who of us has fully answered to the call?<a name=3:25></a> My own impression is that as the call reaches us through the gospel.<a name=3:26></a> God would give us at the outset a touch of the highest things.<a name=3:27></a> If anyone here feels they have not had much impression as to this call, today is the time.<a name=3:28></a> If any young people here feel they have not

	<div class="paragraph">
		had much touch as to the heights to which God has called them, now is the time, because I believe God would have us enter into that.<a name=4:1></a> You see, Paul at the close of his life in prison is still pursuing towards the call; it does not mean that he had not been pursuing it from the day he was converted.<a name=4:2></a> He had a wonderful impression of it at his conversion because he preached Jesus that He is the Son of God.<a name=4:3></a> God calls us from that place where Jesus is, glorified in His presence.<a name=4:4></a> He calls us <i>from</i> there and He calls us <i>to</i> there.<a name=4:5></a> So that should become our home even now; the holiest is open to us all.<a name=4:6></a> He calls us from glory to glory and the glorified Man in whom we see God's glory shining is our righteousness, so that we can go there with all boldness.<a name=4:7></a> That is open to the new believers we may say, the ones just begotten again by the living and abiding word of God.<a name=4:8></a> And so if we get a sense of that, and I believe God would give it, it will help us much with the negative side.<a name=4:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:12></a>C.<a name=4:13></a> Yes.<a name=4:14></a> Quite so.<a name=4:15></a> From the point of view of which we are speaking He has called us into the highest things, the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus; something far beyond that which angels or any other creatures, as far as we know, are called into.<a name=4:16></a> We are called into the very highest things, the highest level.<a name=4:17></a> As far as we can see from scripture, no other creature will have such a call -- to such bliss and nearness to God -- God to be our everlasting portion as being immediately near to Him, as far as the creature can be.<a name=4:18></a> Well, it is a wonderful calling; and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=5:3></a>W.<a name=5:4></a> You are linking that with the word we get in Exodus, "Let my son go that he may serve me".<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:6></a>C.<a name=5:7></a> Yes.<a name=5:8></a> How wonderful are the thoughts of God.<a name=5:9></a> "Israel is my son, my firstborn".<a name=5:10></a> Although Israel is the firstborn of earthly families, it was written typically <i>primarily</i> for us.<a name=5:11></a> Think of that, that God should be calling out of a state of nature's darkness and degradation in which man was at the time of the cross, both Jew and Gentile, that God should be calling us out of similar degradation today -- He is indeed calling us out of everything here as His firstborn sons, no other thought in His mind.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:13></a> You are thinking of that as over against what it might have been, had He said, 'I have called my people'?<a name=5:14></a> You are thinking of the dignity of the position -- sonship.<a name=5:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=9:7></a>C.<a name=9:8></a> Well, it has been interesting to me just lately to see that in the book of Acts it appears as if the Spirit gives the immediate directions; the Lord gives the long term directions.<a name=9:9></a> The Lord gives a long term direction as to Paul, all that he would do; He gives a fairly long term direction as to Corinth -- "I have much people in this city", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>; it was quite a big thing in view.<a name=9:10></a> And so elsewhere, that Paul must testify in Rome, and so on.<a name=9:11></a> The Lord tells him those things.<a name=9:12></a> But when it comes to the hour by hour action, you get the direction of the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:13></a> The sudden word to Philip, "approach and join this chariot", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>.<a name=9:14></a> Then a sudden word to Peter, "Go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because <i>I</i> have sent them".<a name=9:15></a> The word at Antioch, "Separate me <i>now</i>, Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".<a name=9:16></a> Then Paul in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>was forbidden to go there, and so on.<a name=9:17></a> There are other passages, the brethren telling Paul by the Spirit not to go to Jerusalem -- the immediate direction for the next step.<a name=9:18></a> You do not get much of that once Paul is in prison, but the beginning of Acts seems to show what is normal; and I am sure we all desire to get back
