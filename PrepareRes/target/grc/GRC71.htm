		G.R.<a name=38:1></a>C.<a name=38:2></a> I thought we might dwell on three things, the system, the position, and the path.<a name=38:3></a> The verses in Hebrews refer to <i>the divine system</i>, that is the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=38:4></a> It is apprehended by faith, but that does not mean that it is not substantial and real.<a name=38:5></a> Indeed it is eternal in character, the tabernacle of God, and the Lord has pitched it; and if He is upholding all things physically by the word of His power, it is quite certain that He is upholding the spiritual system by the word of His power; it cannot break down.<a name=38:6></a> He is the great High Priest, and the Minister of the holy places.<a name=38:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scriptures read in Corinthians refer to <i>the position</i>, that is something established in a concrete way down here, namely the body of Christ and the house of God.<a name=38:8></a> The body of Christ is of course the house of God, it comprises the same persons, every Christian who has the Spirit.<a name=38:9></a> It is suitable to be the house of God because it is the body of Christ, and this position is established by the presence of the Spirit.<a name=38:10></a> Therefore, on the divine side, the position never breaks down.<a name=38:11></a> But then there is <i>the path</i>; this involves fellowship, as it says, "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?<a name=38:12></a>" <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:3">Amos  3:3</a> -- that is the path.<a name=38:13></a> As to the fellowship, we are <i>in it</i> if we are; we are <i>called into it</i> by God.<a name=38:14></a> We are called out of the world, but we may not be out of it.<a name=38:15></a> We are

		called into this path that is pleasing to God, but the fact that we are called into it, does not mean that we are in it; that depends on how far we have answered to the call.<a name=39:1></a> Similarly we are also called, for instance, to eternal life, "Lay hold of eternal life to which thou hast been called", but that does not mean we are in the gain of it, though called to it.<a name=39:2></a> The idea that every Christian is in fellowship is false.<a name=39:3></a> They are called into it, but it involves a path and <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>, speaking of communion or fellowship, says, "Are not they who eat the sacrifices in communion [or fellowship] with the altar?<a name=39:4></a>" this refers to the path, and in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>it is the path in a day such as this.<a name=39:5></a> I thought we might get help on these thoughts.<a name=39:6></a> Commonly when we speak of the system nowadays we mean a system gradually built up over the years and in which we have moved, and which we have had to leave.<a name=39:7></a> It helps us, however, to look at the divine system.<a name=39:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.A.<a name=39:9></a>B.<a name=39:10></a> Would you say that although the tabernacle that was set up has ceased to exist, what it represented goes through?<a name=39:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=39:12></a>C.<a name=39:13></a> Yes, what it represented is the true tabernacle, the other is only a type and a shadow, but we belong to the real thing, the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=39:14></a> We have discovered that the system we have left has become man-made.<a name=39:15></a>

		G.R.<a name=39:23></a>C.<a name=39:24></a> Yes, the Lord pitched it then.<a name=39:25></a> In fact, He had already put it together, as it were, because the

		disciples were all together with one accord in one place; they were set together; and the Spirit came upon a company already set together by Christ and pleasing to the Spirit, but the coming of the Spirit set the whole system in life.<a name=40:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.A.<a name=40:2></a>B.<a name=40:3></a> Would you say in regard to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, whether the Spirit given consequent on the Lord's ascension, involved the economy?<a name=40:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=40:5></a>C.<a name=40:6></a> Yes, I suppose it required the Spirit to be given to enable us vitally to enter into the gain of the economy, but the economy was seen at the Lord's baptism, for instance.<a name=40:7></a> Objectively the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit were on that occasion all in evidence.<a name=40:8></a> Then there are other allusions to the three Divine Persons in the gospels, especially John.<a name=40:9></a> In the commission in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>there was a formal setting out of the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=40:10></a> That Name conveyed two truths -- one, the truth of the economy, the manifestation of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the Persons being brought before us objectively in their relative places in the economy; and then as that Name is one, it means that the Persons thus known in the economy are co-equal in the oneness of Deity, commanding our worship.<a name=40:11></a> It is a wonderful Name!<a name=40:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.F.<a name=40:13></a> Would it be right as to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>to say that the Lord is the One distinguished in this system, having in mind the verse, "We have such a one high priest"?<a name=40:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=40:15></a>C.<a name=40:16></a> Well, there is what we have and what God has.<a name=40:17></a> From our side "we have such a one high priest".<a name=40:18></a> What God has, that the One who is High Priest is the Minister of the holy places, assuring that God will be served because the whole system centres in God.<a name=40:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=41:1></a> Is it stabilising to see that our apprehension of God's thoughts may vary, but His thoughts never fail, "Thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine"?<a name=41:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=41:3></a>C.<a name=41:4></a> That is right.<a name=41:5></a> Our apprehension may vary, and does; and gifts are given with a view to our arriving at the unity of the faith.<a name=41:6></a> The unity of the faith is not a test of fellowship, because none of us can say we have got there yet, to the fulness of the faith.<a name=41:7></a> But we are moving on, and the more we take in divine thoughts, the more there will be the unity of the faith amongst us.<a name=41:8></a> But we need patience, because persons are being converted and coming in whose apprehension is small, and ministry is needed all the time in that great work to bring us all to the unity of the faith.<a name=41:9></a> The system is not measured by the extent of our apprehension of it.<a name=41:10></a> <i>The system exists</i>.<a name=41:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=41:12></a> Is that suggested in the note to the word "summary" -- in chapter 8: 1 -- in the reference to the substance of what is in the speaker's mind?<a name=41:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=41:14></a>C.<a name=41:15></a> Yes, because however young we are in the faith, if we once apprehend the Person who upholds the system -- He inaugurated it as the Apostle and upholds it as the Priest -- we are on the road to understanding the whole system; whereas anyone who does not apprehend Christ as the High Priest and as the Minister of the holy places, may fail to apprehend the system at all.<a name=41:16></a> But once you apprehend the One who is the great active Administrator of the system both Godward and man ward, then the way is open for you, as held in faith in Him, to apprehend the system more and more clearly.<a name=41:17></a> We have not, any of us, fully apprehended the true tabernacle yet, have we?<a name=41:18></a>

		W.B.<a name=42:1></a>F.<a name=42:2></a> Does a person give character to a system?<a name=42:3></a> At the outset Nimrod gave his character to a system of things.<a name=42:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:5></a>C.<a name=42:6></a> Yes, and what is so precious is that the Person who gives character to this system is a Divine Person in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, so that it must be in every way in accord with God.<a name=42:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=42:8></a> Is that why it is stated that He is Minister of it?<a name=42:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=42:13></a> I was thinking that if He is the One who inaugurated it, He is the One capable of being the Minister of it.<a name=42:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:15></a>C.<a name=42:16></a> That is just it.<a name=42:17></a> He is the Inaugurator in chapter 1; we see that He inaugurated the physical creation too -- "By whom also he made the worlds".<a name=42:18></a> Then you have Him as the Centre of this system, because it says that He is the effulgence of God's glory.<a name=42:19></a> This system is for God and His glory, and He is the effulgence of God's glory, and the expression of His substance; and He has made the purification of sins, so that there might be an unchallengeable moral basis for the establishment of this system.<a name=42:20></a> But then it is also stated that He upholds all things by the word of His power.<a name=42:21></a> As Apostle He inaugurated, and as High Priest He upholds, and as Minister He is active in this divine system, that it might all be according to God.<a name=42:22></a>

		F.A.<a name=42:23></a>B.<a name=42:24></a> So you would say that it enhances the dignity of the saints to take account of the glorious Person who is the Head of it all.<a name=42:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=42:26></a>C.<a name=42:27></a> It does.<a name=42:28></a> Some days ago I was thinking of that beautiful hymn:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'Thousand thousand saints attending <br>Swell the triumph of His train' </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and I thought, a thousand thousand, that is a million, and we know there are many more than that, and I said to myself, however can I be sure of being maintained in God's system; I am only a little speck, among thousands upon thousands, and thousands of thousands.<a name=43:1></a> Then I thought of the One who upholds all things by the word of His power.<a name=43:2></a> Astronomers now say that there are probably a trillion galaxies of which even the Milky Way is but one; and I thought of Jesus upholding all these physical galaxies, with their countless myriads of suns, and then I said, 'Well, He will uphold me.<a name=43:3></a> How glorious is the One who is the Centre of the spiritual system; He can uphold even me among the myriads that are His'.<a name=43:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.A.<a name=43:5></a>B.<a name=43:6></a> It has been a great comfort to me to consider the dignity that attaches to having any part at all in this glorious system, in which God is served.<a name=43:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=43:8></a>C.<a name=43:9></a> And that would stimulate us to attend to the priestly office.<a name=43:10></a> It says in Numbers, "And Aaron and his sons shalt thou appoint that they may attend to their priest's office", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#3:10">Numbers  3:10</a>.<a name=43:11></a> They were appointed.<a name=43:12></a> Well now, God has appointed everyone here, you and me, brothers and sisters, to attend to the priestly office; and there is this glorious Person, the Minister of the holy places, and the High Priest is there to uphold us in attending to the priestly office every day.<a name=43:13></a> Our first thought every morning should be that we are priests; the priests encamped before the tabernacle eastward, toward the sunrising so that when a priest awoke in the morning the first thing he would notice would be the sun rising.<a name=43:14></a> So
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=44>[Page 44]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		when we awake in the morning, we think, 'Well, the Lord may come today'.<a name=44:1></a> Then, the priest would look the other way and see the cloud over the tabernacle and the smoke ascending from the brazen altar, for the fire never went out, and he might say, 'Well, there is the opportunity today to attend to the priestly office'; and with what energy he would go and offer the morning incense and the morning lamb.<a name=44:2></a> We need to fulfil that every day, the priest's office, because we belong to this system, and it is to work in practice.<a name=44:3></a> It is not only that the Lord Jesus is there by divine appointment as <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>shews, but we too are moving by divine appointment and filling out our function as priests.<a name=44:4></a> And we have liberty, we have His support, to enter the holy of holies, that is our place in the system.<a name=44:5></a> We serve at the altar too.<a name=44:6></a> We offer sacrifices, the sacrifice of praise and of doing good, "for with such sacrifices God is well pleased".<a name=44:7></a> All that is priestly work, and fills out the day, but the first thing to do is to go right in to the holy of holies, because all our service springs from Christ having gone into the holy of holies, which is thus the true Christian place in the system.<a name=44:8></a>
