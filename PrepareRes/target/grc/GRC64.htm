		I would like to raise the question, at the commencement, dear brethren, as to whom we are boasting in.<a name=80:1></a> We may even be boasting in ourselves; the Pharisees boasted in themselves, but made nothing of the rest of men.<a name=80:2></a> We each need to be delivered from self-boasting.<a name=80:3></a> There was a time when Paul boasted in himself; at that time he did not know a better man than himself; but through God's grace, all that was broken down.<a name=80:4></a> He was brought to say, "O wretched man that I am" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:24">Romans  7:24</a>).<a name=80:5></a> There are others who boast in men, an ever-present danger, especially with young people.<a name=80:6></a> We may see men as trees walking.<a name=80:7></a> The purpose of a meeting like this is to deliver you from all such boasting; that yourself, and every other man, should disappear from your vision, and that you should see Jesus only -- "they saw Jesus only with themselves".<a name=80:8></a> You have no right to boast in any mere man, least of all yourself.<a name=80:9></a> The word in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:21">1 Corinthians  3:21</a> is "let no one boast in men".<a name=80:10></a> May the Lord bring that word home to us.<a name=80:11></a> Have done with that kind of boasting!<a name=80:12></a> "Who then is Apollos, and who Paul?<a name=80:13></a> Ministering servants through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each".<a name=80:14></a> They had nothing till the Lord gave them something.<a name=80:15></a> Therefore Paul says "neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase".<a name=80:16></a> Why let our vision be obscured by men?<a name=80:17></a>

		use the language of Paul, who exulted in it; he said, "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=82:1></a> What could be greater grace than that I, who deserve to be crucified and to bear the curse myself, can now say "I am crucified with Christ"?<a name=82:2></a> The curse has been borne, the judgment is past; I can regard myself as crucified with Christ and reckon myself alive to God in Him.<a name=82:3></a> But, if He was my substitute on the cross, the only righteous thing on my part is to allow Him to substitute me.<a name=82:4></a> "No longer live I" Paul said, "but Christ lives in me".<a name=82:5></a> <i>Christ</i> was to be magnified in his body, whether in life or death.<a name=82:6></a> "In that I now live in flesh", he said, "I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me".<a name=82:7></a> Do you know what living by faith means?<a name=82:8></a> Some people think it means trusting God about their circumstances -- but faith and trust are two different things, though closely connected.<a name=82:9></a> In that verse "I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God" Paul meant that the Son of God displaced self in his vision.<a name=82:10></a> The controlling object of his life was the Son of God, who had loved him and given Himself for him.<a name=82:11></a> Was Paul going to live for himself any more?<a name=82:12></a> Not at all!<a name=82:13></a> "No longer live I, but Christ lives in me".<a name=82:14></a> Let me say that again -- faith means that the Son of God fills the vision to the exclusion of self.<a name=82:15></a> If a man is full of faith it means self is <i>completely</i> gone from before his vision, and the Son of God, and the system of glory that centres in Him, fills the vision of his soul; and on that principle he lives.<a name=82:16></a> Paul was justified by faith and now he says, "I live by faith".<a name=82:17></a> He lived on the same principle on which he was justified, and we have to learn to do this.<a name=82:18></a> If so we shall be able to trust God for our circumstances; but that is a secondary matter which flows out of the first, however important.<a name=82:19></a> The great thing is that self should be gone from our vision, displaced by the Son of God, the controlling Object of our life, so that Christ

		And so that brings us back to my original question  -- In whom are we boasting?<a name=83:4></a> <i>Let no one boast in men</i>.<a name=83:5></a> Paul says "he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord".<a name=83:6></a> Every Christian should be a boasting man but he does not boast in himself nor does he boast in other men.<a name=83:7></a> <i>He boasts in the Lord</i>.<a name=83:8></a> Talk about evangelisation, if we were all boasting men, boasting in the Lord, the word of the Lord would be sounded abroad.<a name=83:9></a> People would say, 'there must be something in Christianity.<a name=83:10></a> These people are all boasting in the Lord'.<a name=83:11></a> And you know, the more you are full of faith, the more you will be filled with the Holy Spirit: the two things go together, because as self goes from your vision, and the Son of God fills it, the Holy Spirit fills you.<a name=83:12></a> The Holy Spirit cannot fill a man who is full of himself, but a man who is living by the faith of the Son of God, is the kind of man who is filled with the Holy Spirit.<a name=83:13></a> The Holy Spirit has come here to glorify God's Son, and to fill those who walk by faith in Him.<a name=83:14></a> So faith and the Spirit go together; and if you are filled with the Spirit you are filled with the new wine.<a name=83:15></a> We have spoken about abstaining from earthly wine but there is nothing like being filled with the Spirit.<a name=83:16></a> It was said of such.<a name=83:17></a> "These men are full of new wine".<a name=83:18></a>

		Paul ends chapter one by the word, "he that boasts let him boast in the Lord".<a name=83:19></a> He precedes this by saying, "of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and redemption".<a name=83:20></a> Have you realised that the Lord Jesus is that to you?<a name=83:21></a> What marvellous grace!<a name=83:22></a> The basis for all God's acting in grace is the cross of Christ, where He effected reconciliation.<a name=83:23></a> How our affections should be drawn out to Him!<a name=83:24></a> The apostle

		And so Philippians gives you a man On this road and you may say to me, 'I have not got far On that road'; nor have I, but there is this encouragement, Paul says, "whereunto we have attained let us walk in the same steps".<a name=92:4></a> He did not reckon himself to have attained, he was pressing On.<a name=92:5></a> We are all in the race to Christ in glory, in order to reach the goal and get the prize.<a name=92:6></a> It is not a competitive race -- the prize is open to all and we want all the brethren to be in at the finish.<a name=92:7></a> But there is not only the race to be run; but the walking, "whereunto we have attained", in testimony here to God's glory.<a name=92:8></a> The measure to which we have attained in the race, is the measure in which Christ is magnified in our body in our walk here.<a name=92:9></a> "Let us walk in the same steps".<a name=92:10></a> Your steps may be faltering compared with Paul's but walk in them nevertheless; you will get stronger in your walk as you go On further in the race.<a name=92:11></a> "Be imitators all together Of me, brethren, and fix your eyes On those walking thus as you have us for a model".<a name=92:12></a> We can afford to accept as model a man like Paul, who could say, "Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life Or by death", and "for me to live is Christ and to die gain".<a name=92:13></a> May the Lord help us to be sustained in a spirit Of exultation as to what we have in Christ and what He is to us.<a name=92:14></a> Let us never boast in ourselves, nor in other men, but boast in Christ Jesus; and boast in the cross Of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to us and we to the world, for His name's sake.<a name=92:15></a>
