		One feels the importance of paying attention to the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:2></a> John the Baptist refers to it in each of the gospels.<a name=3:3></a> The Lord Jesus in the 1st of Acts, and Paul in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=3:4></a> One feels that the Lord Jesus would have us learn what immersion means in this respect.<a name=3:5></a> We are all tested as to whether we are prepared unreservedly to commit ourselves to the Holy Spirit in the way He may be pleased to move at any time -- to be wholly in the current of His movements.<a name=3:6></a> The figure of baptism helps.<a name=3:7></a> It is in the acceptance of it that we come practically into the gain of the body.<a name=3:8></a> In actual fact the body is formed and we are members of it.<a name=3:9></a> "In the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body".<a name=3:10></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>).<a name=3:11></a> If we understand the meaning of baptism the truth of the body would work out practically and vitally amongst us, and there would be no persons moving independently or in any way that causes concern to the saints.<a name=3:12></a> Such movements are not compatible with the truth of the body nor with the truth of the Spirit being here.<a name=3:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to see that in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>it says "There is one body and one Spirit".<a name=3:14></a> We might have written it in the reverse order, but scripture says, "There is one body and one Spirit, as ye have been also

		called in one hope of your calling", showing that if we are to get the gain of the Spirit we must recognise the truth of the body.<a name=4:1></a> The baptism of the Spirit, if understood by us, would mean that we are moving bodywise.<a name=4:2></a> John the Baptist brings in the great truth to magnify the person of Christ.<a name=4:3></a> "I indeed", he says, "baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear, he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire".<a name=4:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:11">Matthew  3:11</a>).<a name=4:5></a> I am not sure that any such suggestion is made earlier in scripture.<a name=4:6></a> John brings in a remarkable new unfolding of the truth, that there was to be such a thing as this, the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=4:7></a> In announcing the coming of Christ, this is how he introduces Him, this is what would mark Him off -- "He shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit".<a name=4:8></a> He is indicating that the baptism of the Spirit is one of the most outstanding events on the divine calendar -- an outstanding feature in connection with the coming in of Christ and what He would effect.<a name=4:9></a> The mystery hidden throughout the ages in God was to be brought to pass, that is, the formation of the saints into one body.<a name=4:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then when persons receive the Spirit they partake in the baptism of the Spirit, they become members of the body, but it is quite a different idea.<a name=4:11></a> The moment you think of the baptism of the Spirit you have the corporate thought in mind.<a name=4:12></a> It is as an individual that I receive the Spirit.<a name=4:13></a> Our bodies are spoken of as "temple of the Holy Spirit", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:19">1 Corinthians  6:19</a>).<a name=4:14></a> But then have I apprehended that, the Spirit having come to dwell in me in that way, I have part in the baptism of the Spirit?<a name=4:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, the description of the coming of the Spirit greatly helps: "And there came suddenly out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing and filled all the house where they were sitting.<a name=5:6></a> And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them to speak forth", verses 2 - 4.<a name=5:7></a> Those who were together on the day of Pentecost were not only thinking the same thing, but <i>saying</i> the same thing.<a name=5:8></a> The intention is that we should all be immersed in the current of the Spirit, and then the body becomes a practical matter.<a name=5:9></a> We are all moving together.<a name=5:10></a>

		John, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:11">Matthew  3:11</a>.<a name=5:11></a> (Matthew, being the assembly gospel), though he would not have known it, is really prophesying of the formation of the body -- the assembly.<a name=5:12></a> But first of all he speaks of the axe as applied to the root of the trees, then he brings in the baptism of the Spirit, and following that he refers to the Lord's service in thoroughly purging His threshing floor.<a name=5:13></a> Do not these things bear on one another?<a name=5:14></a> He says, "Every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire".<a name=5:15></a> Has not every kind of tree been tested?<a name=5:16></a> We might speak of the Jewish tree.<a name=5:17></a> The fig tree had been cultivated,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but it had produced no fruit.<a name=6:1></a> Then the Gentile tree -- there was no fruit there.<a name=6:2></a> So that whether it was Jew or Greek, bondman or freeman, whatever kind of man, socially, racially, or in any other way, he had been found fruitless.<a name=6:3></a> Have we not to recognise that, if we are to value the baptism of the Spirit?<a name=6:4></a> So it says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>, "In the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free".<a name=6:5></a> Is not the axe a sweeping matter, showing that the ground is to be cleared of every kind of man after the flesh?<a name=6:6></a> It says, "Already the axe is applied to the root of the trees".<a name=6:7></a> If independence of thought or movement come out, it shows that the fact of the axe being applied to the "<i>root</i>" -- not only to the trunk -- has not been accepted.<a name=6:8></a> It is every feature belonging to the flesh that has to be cut down.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can understand God not bringing in the truth of the body, until every kind of man had been tested -- man's <i>will</i> lying at the <i>root</i> and the <i>trees</i> are the <i>evidence</i> of it.<a name=6:10></a> Among the features of the flesh in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5">Galatians  5</a>-- "contentions, disputes", etc.<a name=6:11></a> is "schools of opinion"; and that is what we are troubled with at the present time -- schools of opinion or heresies.<a name=6:12></a> They come about through persons who never accepted that the axe is laid to the root of the trees.<a name=6:13></a> They are still trying to cultivate one of the trees and therefore have not learnt the truth of immersion in the Spirit.<a name=6:14></a> They have not let themselves go entirely in what Ezekiel describes as "Waters to swim in".<a name=6:15></a> (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:5">Ezekiel  47:5</a>).<a name=6:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The baptism of the Spirit in Matthew being the Lord's operation involves the Lord's authority, and
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		only our recognition of His authority brings us vitally into the truth of the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=7:1></a> And it is of no avail for anyone to claim he is moving under the authority of the Lord if he is not accepting the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=7:2></a> The Lord's rights require that we should suffer ourselves to be immersed in the Spirit.<a name=7:3></a> There is nothing more blessed than to move along with the brethren as immersed in the Spirit.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable how closely baptism with water is linked with the baptism of the Spirit -- they both come in the same sentence: "I baptise you with water .<a name=7:5></a>.<a name=7:6></a>.<a name=7:7></a> he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:11">Matthew  3:11</a>).<a name=7:8></a> In the case of Cornelius the baptism of the Spirit comes first, but was immediately followed by water baptism; but in the more normal cases as in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>, <i>water</i> baptism comes first, "Repent and be baptised each one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit".<a name=7:9></a> All those baptised in water that day were also baptised in the Spirit.<a name=7:10></a> Then we are inwardly carried along in our thoughts and affections with the one great current that is flowing.<a name=7:11></a> To be indwelt by the Spirit is one thing, but it is another thing to understand that I am <i>in</i> the Spirit.<a name=7:12></a> That is the divine thought, that I should be moving along in that current.<a name=7:13></a> It is a wonderful thing that the Spirit should be pleased to dwell in me, but, in a way, it is more wonderful that I should be privileged to move as in the Spirit.<a name=7:14></a>

		To be filled with the Spirit is to recognise the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=7:15></a> It is seen in the figure we have often used in other connections as to the ocean.<a name=7:16></a>

		If we put a vessel into the ocean it is not containing the ocean, yet the ocean is in the vessel; but as in the ocean it can be carried along with the current.<a name=8:1></a> If we are really immersed in the Spirit, we shall certainly be filled with the Spirit.<a name=8:2></a> What wonderful seasons we should have bodywise, if that were true!<a name=8:3></a> But it is well to pay attention to the fire, as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:12">Matthew  3:12</a>, "The chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable", and then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:3">Acts  2:3</a>, ".<a name=8:4></a>.<a name=8:5></a> Parted tongues, as of fire".<a name=8:6></a> It shows that God cannot tolerate the flesh in any form.<a name=8:7></a> Man in the flesh has been tried in the fullest way, and has been found fruitless.<a name=8:8></a> God cannot tolerate any feature of the flesh, and in no setting are they more distasteful to Him than when they intrude into divine things.<a name=8:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>where the question of circumcision comes in, there where schools of opinion, but afterwards at the end of the chapter we read, "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us", (verse 28); that would be <i>merging together</i>.<a name=8:10></a> There is always the danger of heresies or schools of opinion dividing the church.<a name=8:11></a> Their tendencies are always to divide, because they are propagated by persons who do not recognise the truth of the Spirit and the body.<a name=8:12></a> Therefore they can only divide the saints.<a name=8:13></a> In that chapter christianity was taking form, but it is a beautiful result, because they were all moving in the current of the Spirit.<a name=8:14></a> We function bodywise as we are prepared for immersion in the Spirit, because we are all moving then as wholly amenable to the Spirit.<a name=8:15></a> So that in verse 11 of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>the Spirit distributes to each as He pleases.<a name=8:16></a> He has sovereign rights, and if we are submissive to Him, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, "God has set certain in the assembly .<a name=9:7></a>.<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a>".<a name=9:10></a> That is with a view to this unity.<a name=9:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:12">Ephesians  4:12</a> the gifts are "For the perfecting of the saints, with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ".<a name=9:12></a> One purpose of the gifts is to help us to understand the truth of the body and to fill out our part in it vitally.<a name=9:13></a> Take Antioch, how manifestly that assembly was in the gain of the truth of the body!<a name=9:14></a> The Spirit said: "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul".<a name=9:15></a> I presume that He spoke through some brother, but nobody criticised what was said.<a name=9:16></a> They might have said, Why take Barnabas, the one at the top of the list, and Saul at the bottom?<a name=9:17></a> But they were prepared for whatever the Spirit was pleased to say.<a name=9:18></a> That is a great point at all times.<a name=9:19></a> It meant that any predilection or self-importance that I might have has got to go, and things are under the control of the Spirit.<a name=9:20></a> In the first scripture we read, John the Baptist stresses the greatness of Christ -- Who He is.<a name=9:21></a> The first thing is for us to have an immense impression of the greatness of Christ; it is in the recognition of His lordship that we really submit to the baptism of the

		Spirit.<a name=10:1></a> But when the Lord refers to the matter in the Acts, He does not say: I shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit -- that was of course true.<a name=10:2></a> But He says: "<i>Ye</i> shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days".<a name=10:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:5">Acts  1:5</a>), That is, He would now specially impress them with the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:4></a> The first thing is to be impressed with Christ and His greatness, and then that makes way for us to be impressed with the wonder and greatness of the Person who has come from Christ -- the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:5></a> So that the Lord does not bring Himself into the matter there, but says, "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit".<a name=10:6></a> And further on He says, "The Holy Spirit having come upon you".<a name=10:7></a> Then when we come to Paul's doctrine in Corinthians, we have, "In the power of one Spirit", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>).<a name=10:8></a> In other words as we go on in this matter, we learn more and more to value the Spirit.<a name=10:9></a> Our valuation of the Spirit never displaces Christ, but the point is the <i>Spirit</i> is becoming greater to us.<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The greatness of the Father also comes before the soul, as the Lord Himself makes much of Him in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>in connection with the gift of the Spirit: "Whom the Father will send in my name".<a name=10:11></a> (verse 26).<a name=10:12></a> Then at the end of Luke: "I send the promise of my Father upon you".<a name=10:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:49">Luke  24:49</a>).<a name=10:14></a> It shows the unselfish love that marks the Persons of the Godhead.<a name=10:15></a> The Lord thus stresses the greatness of the Person that is coming, and Paul stresses His greatness as having come.<a name=10:16></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>he refers to the sovereign will of the Spirit, "Dividing to each in particular as He pleases".<a name=10:17></a> (verse 11).<a name=10:18></a> Then lower down in the chapter, "In the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised

		into one body".<a name=11:1></a> (verse 13).<a name=11:2></a> Then the Father's love is shown in the expression of "The promise of my Father" -- in giving us the Holy Spirit.<a name=11:3></a> And also that, as "The Holy Spirit of promise", He would link up with every promise God has made to men.<a name=11:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The precious sufferings and death of Christ should greatly affect us when we consider what we have been brought into -- things that were never conceived in Old Testament times.<a name=11:5></a> Although there are types of the assembly there, yet we should be impressed with the fact that we are brought into something entirely new.<a name=11:6></a> The axe is applied to the root of the trees.<a name=11:7></a> What was ever in God's mind in purpose is brought in -- <i>the baptism of the saints by the Holy Spirit into one body</i>.<a name=11:8></a> As we move together in the Spirit, we come into a realm of things which can never be compassed by human language -- waters to swim in (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:5">Ezekiel  47:5</a>) -- and we can never say that we have reached finality.<a name=11:9></a> That is the test of the moment.<a name=11:10></a> But the secret of the working of the organism lies in the fact that each, in love, esteems the other more excellent than himself.<a name=11:11></a> That gives the Spirit room and right of way.<a name=11:12></a> There is nothing to obstruct Him.<a name=11:13></a> That would be a great experience for us.<a name=11:14></a> And in the spirit of mutual love and respect we prove the word: "But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; and those parts of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour".<a name=11:15></a> That would give the Spirit of God a free hand to bring in that which He desires.<a name=11:16></a>

		A third point is in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3">Matthew  3</a>"Whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor".<a name=12:10></a> The baptism of the Spirit has to do with what is corporate -- the body -- but in order that we might fit into our place in the body, the Lord deals with us severally in connection with His threshing-floor.<a name=12:11></a> He is dealing with us all with a view to helping us to fit together bodywise.<a name=12:12></a> We are all in the threshing-floor, and the Lord has His winnowing fan in His hand.<a name=12:13></a> Extreme measures may have to be taken by the Lord with some of us, so as to free us from the chaff.<a name=12:14></a> And in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>too the Lord's washing of the feet of His disciples, is with a view to setting them together; it is really a "body" chapter.<a name=12:15></a> The Lord uses the words 'yourselves', 'one another', 'Love one another' and 'love among yourselves'.<a name=12:16></a> These are body ideas.<a name=12:17></a> And He is seeking to rid us of the chaff;

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have 'one body' in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, and later in the chapter it is called 'body of Christ', and in Colossians we see its relation to Christ.<a name=13:6></a> He is the Head of the body; the body is a basic matter.<a name=13:7></a> There would be nothing for Christ in the way of bridal response apart from it.<a name=13:8></a> Persons that go off on independent lines are damaging everything that is precious to Christ.<a name=13:9></a> We need to wait on the Lord and on the Spirit in all our gatherings.<a name=13:10></a> We do not want to launch out even into a reading without the Spirit.<a name=13:11></a> Much of the independent teaching has not been in a collective setting, and we can only get the Spirit's help in guiding us into the truth as we are in the recognition of our relations with our brethren -- then He will confirm us.<a name=13:12></a> The gain of the anointing in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>is proved bodywise; that dies not shut out what is individual.<a name=13:13></a> We are anointed and as we serve God in the power of the Spirit, the grace of the anointing is seen in the service.<a name=13:14></a> But <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>show that in a peculiar way the anointing is linked up with the saints bodywise -- the anointed vessel.<a name=13:15></a> There the grace and power of the anointing is seen in a unique way; it can be named -- "So also is the

		The passages we have read, dear brethren, all contain the words "my brethren".<a name=15:2></a> The Lord Jesus uses those words; a most remarkable thing when we think of who He is that He should use words such as those in resurrection.<a name=15:3></a> He says, in Matthew, "Go, bring word to my brethren", and then to Mary of Magdala in John He says, "Go to my brethren".<a name=15:4></a> It is wonderful that the Lord Jesus is not ashamed to call us "brethren", but then Paul also uses the expression.<a name=15:5></a> In the scriptures read he uses it to the Roman Christians, most of whom he had never seen; and he uses it to the Philippians, those he knew well, those who had him in their hearts, those who had continued in fellowship with the gospel from the first day until that moment.<a name=15:6></a> He says, "my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown".<a name=15:7></a> It is a great thing that we should be numbered amongst those whom the Lord Jesus calls His brethren, nothing could be greater than that; at the same time there is a certain challenge as to whether we can be numbered amongst those whom Paul calls "my brethren".<a name=15:8></a> I would like to be numbered amongst those whom Paul calls "my brethren".<a name=15:9></a> I would like to be numbered amongst them, especially amongst those of whom he could speak as "beloved and longed for", his joy and crown.<a name=15:10></a>

		To begin with one would refer to these words as on the lips of the Lord Jesus.<a name=16:1></a> The viewpoint in Matthew and John is different.<a name=16:2></a> The word in Matthew is, "go bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me".<a name=16:3></a> So that Matthew had the position of testimony in mind.<a name=16:4></a> Matthew would link in this respect with "the generation of Jesus Christ".<a name=16:5></a> The book opens with, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ", and at the end of the book there were those whom the Lord Jesus could own as His generation.<a name=16:6></a> The word in Isaiah is, "who shall declare his generation?<a name=16:7></a> for he was cut off out of the land of the living" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:8">Isaiah  53:8</a>).<a name=16:8></a> The book of Matthew shows how His life was taken from the earth.<a name=16:9></a> It gives us a good deal of detail as to the cruel circumstances that surrounded the death of Christ, and the sufferings into which He went; but in resurrection the "generation of Jesus Christ" were there; He could own them.<a name=16:10></a> He says, "Go, bring word to my brethren".<a name=16:11></a> It reminds one of what was said to Gideon in answer to his enquiry that all those slain were like him, "each one resembled the sons of a king" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#8:18">Judges  8:18</a>), and Gideon says "they were my brethren".<a name=16:12></a> I think that is the idea in Matthew.<a name=16:13></a> The Lord had those who were like Him, and think of Who He is -- Who Jesus is!<a name=16:14></a> Peter had confessed Him, "thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=16:15></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a>).<a name=16:16></a> Now He has those of whom He can say, "go, bring word to my brethren".<a name=16:17></a> Seven weeks later they shone out truly as the "generation of Jesus Christ" in Jerusalem.<a name=16:18></a> He had been cut off from the land of the living, but in the very city where He was cut off, the "generation of

		Jesus Christ" came to light, and as He was, so were they in their measure, each one of them resembled the son of a king, no one could withstand them.<a name=17:1></a> Of Stephen, coming into the testimony later, it says, "And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke".<a name=17:2></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:10">Acts  6:10</a>), truly the son of a king, and that is what Matthew has in view to produce, dear brethren.<a name=17:3></a> We are all, through grace, of the "generation of Jesus Christ" as believers here.<a name=17:4></a> Jesus Christ is in us unless we "are reprobates".<a name=17:5></a> Let us be true to our generation, let Jesus Christ be manifest in us, let us accept the truth of Jesus Christ and Him crucified which Matthew brings before us in such a powerful and affecting way.<a name=17:6></a> "<i>I</i> am crucified with Christ", Paul said.<a name=17:7></a> Let us not be occupied with our old man or cater for him in ourselves or in anyone else.<a name=17:8></a> Let us not feed upon that man, let us look upon the brethren as the generation of Jesus Christ.<a name=17:9></a> The word to Peter was "Rise, Peter, slay and eat".<a name=17:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:14">Acts  10:14</a>).<a name=17:11></a> That meant that he would not be feeding on those creatures according to their natural uncleanness, but as those whom God had cleansed, and that involves what I am saying, "the generation of Jesus Christ".<a name=17:12></a> In these persons that the Lord own as "my brethren", there is a work of God and that is the thing to discover, and that is the thing to feed upon in one another.<a name=17:13></a> If we discover it we shall find plenty of food.<a name=17:14></a> All the creatures in that vessel became food for Peter, he would not be hungry any more.<a name=17:15></a> May the Lord help us all to answer to the truth as Paul did.<a name=17:16></a> Jesus Christ was portrayed crucified among the Galatians, for <i>He was expressed in Paul</i>.<a name=17:17></a> They saw a man who, as to

		In saying "my brethren" in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>the Lord has the highest levels and relationships of the assembly in mind; that is why the message was sent by such a person as Mary of Magdala, representative as she is of the hind of the morning, representative of what the assembly is as a vessel that can move with the Lord in high places, the vessel that can say to Him at the close of the Song of Songs, "Haste, my beloved, And be thou like a gazelle or a young hart upon the mountains of spices" (chapter 8: 14).<a name=27:8></a> She is so with Him in mind and affection that He has not any longer to urge her to come away and move upward, but, as the hind of the morning, she urges Him to move up on those mountains of spices.<a name=27:9></a> The message, sent by Mary, has in view that we should be free to merge in the assembly in its highest aspects; first of all as in union with Himself.<a name=27:10></a> So that when He comes amongst them He <i>immediately</i> shows them His hands and His side.<a name=27:11></a> In the light of the message they were ready immediately for the further disclosure of what the assembly is as the vessel which is wholly of Him, the vessel of which it could

		I would add a word now as to Paul.<a name=29:2></a> He says, "my brethren", as I said at the beginning I would like to be among those who can be called Paul's brethren.<a name=29:3></a> I believe Paul would use this word "my Brethren" to those he was completely free with in the consciousness that they were fully with him in relation to the whole of his ministry.<a name=29:4></a> What we have had before us today is all included in Paul's ministry, and I would raise the question with us, as to whether we are wholly committed to Paul's ministry, whether it is in our minds to go the whole way in relation to it, and not to fall short of any part of it.<a name=29:5></a> He uses this expression to the Roman christians, most of whom he had not seen, bearing out what I have already said, the respect with which he approached the brethren.<a name=29:6></a> He is giving them credit for this.<a name=29:7></a> We do not help one another unless we give one another credit.<a name=29:8></a> I would not put anyone out of the company of Paul's brethren until it was absolutely proved that he was out of it.<a name=29:9></a> Until then I would give him credit for being in it.<a name=29:10></a> See how Paul approached these brethren that he had never seen.<a name=29:11></a> "But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge".<a name=29:12></a> He was hoping to come to Rome, but this was how he was going to approach the brethren when he came to Rome.<a name=29:13></a> He was not going
