		GOD'S WORK IN US -- IN GRACE AND GOVERNMENT

		<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8:5">Isaiah  8:5</a> - 8, 11 - 18, 10: 11 - 12, 24 - 25; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a> - 13; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:2">Matthew  18:2</a> - 5, 20

		I believe, dear brethren, that what God has before Him at the present time is to work, not only in His grace in ministering to us spiritually, but also in His government in disciplining us, having in view to bring about in us full correspondence with the Leader of our salvation -- Christ.<a name=1:1></a> If there is to be full correspondence in us with the Lord Jesus it implies that we should not only know our status and position before God as sons, but that we should be here in this world as true <i>children</i>.<a name=1:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, there are three quotations brought in and attributed to the Lord Jesus Christ who is presented as the Leader of our salvation.<a name=1:3></a> God has appointed Him Leader to bring many sons to glory: that is the great end in view; and in the quotations which are attributed to Him, the highest thought is presented first: "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=1:4></a> That implies that the saints are brought into accord with the Lord Jesus Christ as sons with Him in the presence of God; He can speak of them as His brethren; we correspond with Him in that way, and as His brethren we are able to take up the song that He sings and to join in it, so that He leads the praise in the midst of the assembly.<a name=1:5></a> That is the marvellous issue that is before God in providing us with the Leader of our salvation.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the next quotations immediately refer to the other side, the second one being, "I will trust in him".<a name=1:7></a> God would have us to correspond with our

	<div class="paragraph">
		Leader in that.<a name=2:1></a> For many years now we have been privileged to take in and enjoy much ministry bearing on our portion before God in the assembly as associated with Christ, and we have enjoyed having our part in the service Godward; but, dear brethren, what is the real substantial value of that if we do not <i>also</i> correspond with Christ in connection with these other quotations?<a name=2:2></a> I am not saying there is no value in it, but I would raise the challenge: what is the value of a people who can come together and praise God, but who in their practical life are out of accord with Christ in their trust in God?<a name=2:3></a> Surely if we are to be ever with Christ before God, God has it before Him to bring us into accord with Christ in a practical, substantial way during this brief period while we are here; we cannot get this education in heaven.<a name=2:4></a> One is spoken of in this epistle, who "though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered", and who "in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears was heard because of his piety", because He feared God.<a name=2:5></a> God would have us brought into accord with Christ in that.<a name=2:6></a> Think what God has before Him today!<a name=2:7></a> He would have us in our measure trust Him like Christ did, and He would have us to be marked by piety like Christ's when here, and say, "Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I put my trust".<a name=2:8></a> God will bring this about.<a name=2:9></a> Surely this is attractive to our hearts that we should honour God by the same kind of trust as characterised His own blessed Son down here in those days when He learned obedience by the things which He suffered!<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unless we learn that lesson of trust in God we shall not answer to the third quotation, which means that there is a people on earth to whom the Lord Jesus can point: "Behold, I and the children which God has given me".<a name=2:11></a> It is the heart of Christ delighting

		in having a people here on earth who are like Him, not only in assembly service, but like Him as He was down here in practical every day life, walking as He walked, as John says in his epistle, righteous as He is righteous, pure as He is pure, loving as He loved.<a name=3:1></a> That is the idea of children -- true representation.<a name=3:2></a> We never grow out of being children in one sense; a son is ever a child, however old he may get.<a name=3:3></a> There is the idea of true representation and likeness to the features of the parents continued in the children, whereas the thought of son suggests image, status and dignity.<a name=3:4></a> We shall be conformed to the <i>image</i> of God's Son; but with children it is <i>likeness</i>.<a name=3:5></a> When God made man He said "<i>Let</i> us make man in our image and after our likeness".<a name=3:6></a> The Lord Jesus Christ looks for that: His heart requires that He should have those here like Himself in the practical day-today affairs of this life.<a name=3:7></a> He can point to these children as signs and wonders in Israel, as Isaiah says.<a name=3:8></a> The Lord is looking for signs and wonders; He requires to have those in testimony here to whom He can point in this way, those who trust God in their measure as He trusted Him, and who walk here as beloved children.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to say a few words as to this matter of <i>children</i>, for I feel that we ought to give more attention to it.<a name=3:10></a> The book of Isaiah has a good deal to say about children.<a name=3:11></a> In the first chapter Jehovah has to say, "I have nourished and brought up children; and they have rebelled against me", showing us that the affections of the heart of God require children -- "beloved children", as the apostle says: "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>.<a name=3:12></a> How God's heart longs to have beloved children down here!<a name=3:13></a> From the point of view of substantial formation and likeness to God it is the highest truth.<a name=3:14></a> Sonship is a higher truth according to position and status; but it is in Ephesians that we read this exhortation as to being beloved children,
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and it is the epistle to Philippians which says, "That ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation", chapter 2.<a name=4:1></a> God is looking for children like that.<a name=4:2></a> The flesh does not like to be simple, small, meek and gentle, but that is the kind of children for whom God is looking, shining as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=4:3></a> It is in the <i>character of children</i> that we are in testimony.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as you go on in the book of Isaiah, you get the thought of Jerusalem yearning for children.<a name=4:5></a> It is very touching.<a name=4:6></a> Jerusalem above is our mother; and God considers for the yearnings of Jerusalem, and sees to it that she has children.<a name=4:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:20">Isaiah  49:20</a> - 21 we read: "The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too narrow for me: make room for me, that I may dwell.<a name=4:8></a> And thou shalt say in thy heart, Who hath borne me these, seeing I had lost my children and was desolate, an exile, and driven about?<a name=4:9></a> and who hath brought up these?<a name=4:10></a> behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?<a name=4:11></a>", showing how God considers for the mother heart of Jerusalem.<a name=4:12></a> While Jerusalem is desolate, God secures these children for her, brings them up, as it were, and presents them to her.<a name=4:13></a> No doubt it has an application to the joy which the earthly Jerusalem will yet have in seeing the <i>church as begotten by the testimony which emanated from that city</i>; but primarily it has in mind the earthly people which God will secure.<a name=4:14></a> But I read that scripture to show how the <i>heart of the assembly looks for children</i>.<a name=4:15></a> Surely we long for children, and God would love to satisfy that desire.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 53 we have Christ Himself brought before us: "Who shall declare his generation?<a name=4:17></a> for he was cut off out of the land of the living".<a name=4:18></a> The heart of Christ requires children.<a name=4:19></a> It is the way the Lord views us as down here, taking character from Himself, begotten by His own service and testimony.<a name=4:20></a> It says
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Who shall declare his generation?<a name=5:1></a>" Could any of our hearts brook the thought that there should not be a generation here like Christ?<a name=5:2></a> that His life should not be continued in character here?<a name=5:3></a> It goes on to say, "He shall see a seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand".<a name=5:4></a> God will see to it -- and He is seeing to it -- that Christ has a seed.<a name=5:5></a> So how precious is this thought of children -- God's heart desiring children, the heart of Jerusalem looking for children, and the heart of Christ requiring children!<a name=5:6></a> Divine affections require children, and <i>beloved children</i>.<a name=5:7></a> If we look at the New Testament we find the apostles Paul and John bringing out this side of the truth as to children, being like God and like Christ.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said at the outset, I believe God is working to secure this substantial formation in His people, so that we might truly be such that the Lord can point to us in our practical lives here and say, "Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me".<a name=5:9></a> To bring this about discipline is necessary.<a name=5:10></a> Two things are always necessary to achieve God's end: firstly, the ministry of grace from His own heart, and secondly His ways in government, or discipline.<a name=5:11></a> The two sides come out in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=5:12></a> The early part of the book is full of the provision of God's grace.<a name=5:13></a> It speaks of all the grace resident in the apostle and High Priest of our confession; it speaks of our place with Him within the veil, of the Minister of the sanctuary, and of our liberty of approach to God.<a name=5:14></a> God would minister that side to us continually; but then when we are exhorted to be here in practical faith, corresponding with Christ here, we get the thought of discipline brought in in chapter 12; in fact in chapter 10 the apostle speaks of the way the saints were going through suffering, persecution and the spoiling of their goods.<a name=5:15></a> In chapter 12 he exhorts them to endure discipline, reminding them that the Father of spirits

		is over the whole matter; for God's government and grace work to one great end, to achieve His purpose in us, that we might correspond with Christ in every sphere: in assembly, in our place before God, and down here in testimony and in our practical lives.<a name=6:1></a> How patiently God works in His grace and government to bring about this great end -- correspondence with Christ!<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The early part of Isaiah bears on what we are passing through at the present time.<a name=6:3></a> Up to chapter 39 it is the Assyrian invasion which is largely in the prophet's mind, an invasion which occurred in Hezekiah's day, although it has a future bearing, alluding to the overflowing scourge which will again pass through the land in the near future.<a name=6:4></a> But this early part of the book had its immediate fulfilment in Hezekiah's day, and that section of the book closes with that, dealing with Hezekiah and the coming of Sennacherib king of Assyria.<a name=6:5></a> The latter part of the book deals more with the return from Babylon.<a name=6:6></a> The going to Babylon is foretold in chapter 39, and then immediately God says, "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people", and the latter part of the book speaks of the return from captivity.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So chapter 8 which speaks of the invasion has its fulfilment in Hezekiah's reign.<a name=6:8></a> If you read the account of this invasion in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#32">2 Chronicles  32</a>, you will find that it occurred at a peculiar time, as we might think.<a name=6:9></a> We read in the chapters preceding of the early years of his reign, and of the remarkable spiritual development in connection with the house of God and His service.<a name=6:10></a> It is remarkable to read how the service of God in His house was restored, the priests and the Levites set in their places, and then the song of the Lord began.<a name=6:11></a> They were so enjoying the restoration of the service Godward, that Hezekiah sent to the ten tribes to gather others in to keep the feast of the passover in Jerusalem; he longed for more

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the brethren to enjoy it.<a name=7:1></a> The people were giving so freely that great heaps accumulated, and Hezekiah asked what they were, and had to make special provision because of the way divine love was flowing in the hearts of the saints.<a name=7:2></a> You might say, That is a peculiar time for God to order this terrible invasion!<a name=7:3></a> It says in chapter 32: "After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib, king of Assyria came and entered into Judah".<a name=7:4></a> You will see an analogy between that day and our own day.<a name=7:5></a> We have had many years of ministry dealing with the assembly and our privileges in it.<a name=7:6></a> Possibly brethren are enjoying their part with Christ and in service Godward as they have not done perhaps for centuries.<a name=7:7></a> It was so in Hezekiah's day; they enjoyed it as they had not done since the days of Solomon.<a name=7:8></a> And now God has allowed discipline to come upon us.<a name=7:9></a> You may say, Why has He allowed it at such a time of spiritual prosperity?<a name=7:10></a> We often think that God brings in discipline when there is a low state; well, He does in His mercy; but God is concerned to help forward a good state, to make what is good really solid, to consolidate it in the souls of the saints.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Assyrian comes up, and Hezekiah says, "This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling"; but, thank God, Hezekiah gets to the root of the matter.<a name=7:12></a> It is a great thing to get to the root of the matter.<a name=7:13></a> If we see the reason for the discipline, we can be with God in relation to it.<a name=7:14></a> Hezekiah puts on sackcloth -- it would be well for us today to put on sackcloth -- and he says, "This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling"; but he gives the reason: "for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth"; as much as to say, We have had wonderful assembly privileges, we have enjoyed the service of God together, but there has not been a really practical state that answered to it!<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved brethren, if I search my heart I know that is true of me, and perhaps it is true of others.<a name=8:1></a> We have had wonderful privileges; we have enjoyed our place in the assembly; we have enjoyed the praises of God, and God has enjoyed them too, one might reverently say; times have been good.<a name=8:2></a> But have we not many of us, perhaps all of us, felt that in our public lives we were hardly equal to our place in the assembly, that there was a kind of disparity, or discrepancy?<a name=8:3></a> Have we not often felt ashamed that we could enjoy the presence of God when together, and outside our faith in God was so small, our trust so little, not like the trust which marked the Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=8:4></a> Have we not enjoyed divine things in our spirits among the brethren, and outside our spirits have been so unlike the spirit of Christ, that He could hardly point to us and say, "Behold, I and the children which God has given me", for we have not really been representing Him in our spirits, ways and words outside?<a name=8:5></a> To represent Christ in our spirits and words and ways outside involves having <i>that</i> as our one aim in life, and making everything else secondary; otherwise we shall never really be children who represent Christ as He was here, acting like God, speaking God's words, doing God's works.<a name=8:6></a> He filled out His place in testimony perfectly, and if we are true children in the sense in which I am speaking, it implies that we are like Him in that way, marked by His spirit, His acts and His words.<a name=8:7></a> You remember how in John's gospel, which speaks so much of the children of God, the Lord as the great Example in testimony says, "I cannot do anything of myself", <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:30">John  5:30</a>; and, again, "I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak .<a name=8:8></a>.<a name=8:9></a>.<a name=8:10></a> What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak", chapter 12: 49, 50.<a name=8:11></a> Perfect dependence marked the Lord.<a name=8:12></a> We cannot
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		speak of the Lord as a child in the way I am speaking of it, but what a beloved <i>One</i> He was in the humble dependence in which He trod His way, not speaking from Himself, but as the Father commanded Him so He spoke.<a name=9:1></a> What dependence, humility and lovability marked Christ before the Father's heart as He moved with one object, to represent His Father in this world!<a name=9:2></a> If we know our place with Christ in assembly, what a great thing it is that God has before Him that we should go out from that sphere and really represent Christ in this world, in our measure acting like Him, marked by His spirit, speaking His words, doing His works -- may be in a feeble measure, but moving in such a way that He can regard us as beloved children and God can view us in that way, and the heart of the saints -- "Jerusalem above" -- is rejoiced.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Hezekiah touched the point; he realised that was where the weakness lay.<a name=9:4></a> Conception was there: the children had come to the birth.<a name=9:5></a> We have often found ourselves in that condition; we have conceived the idea of being here to represent Christ: all our desires are that way, but there is no strength to bring forth.<a name=9:6></a> When a little test comes, it is self that is seen, and not Christ.<a name=9:7></a> God says, I will help you as to that!<a name=9:8></a> The ministry of grace alone will not work it.<a name=9:9></a> God says, I will bring in something to help you.<a name=9:10></a> God moves in a way which we might think most drastic: He brings up the king of Assyria, the waters of the river overflowing all his channels and all his banks, reaching up even to the neck.<a name=9:11></a> I take it to mean that when the king of Assyria came up, he reached right to the walls of Jerusalem -- to the very neck.<a name=9:12></a> He brought home to the people of Jerusalem their helplessness, for if a man is in water up to the neck, he cannot help himself.<a name=9:13></a> In some measure we have seen something like it: a scourge which has reached a very long way.<a name=9:14></a> In coming to this point, I would like to

		make clear that when God brings up an instrument of this kind He effects many things at the same time, though His foremost concern is His people walking in the truth.<a name=10:1></a> That is what God is doing today.<a name=10:2></a> He is chastising many nations at the same time, as we read in Isaiah.<a name=10:3></a> Isaiah speaks of what happened to many nations.<a name=10:4></a> God deals with matters between nation and nation, between man and man, in His perfect overruling government; He deals with persons who profess His name, represented by Samaria and Judah; but what He had mainly before Him in Hezekiah's day was to perform, "His whole work upon mount Zion and upon Jerusalem"; after that He had in mind to "punish the fruit of the stoutness of heart of the king of Assyria".<a name=10:5></a> So God is doing many things today; His ways in government are past finding out.<a name=10:6></a> We can thank Him whenever we can see what He is doing.<a name=10:7></a> If He is cleansing those who profess His name from the pleasure-loving spirit that has taken hold of them, and if He is cleansing the beaches from all the indecencies which marked them, we can thank God for all He is doing.<a name=10:8></a> But what is specially before Him is what answers to that remnant in Jerusalem.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You might say, Well, the work seemed complete before God began to bring in this discipline: Mount Zion was inhabited and the service of God was going on in Jerusalem.<a name=10:10></a> But there was no strength to bring forth, and God had before Him to perform His whole work, that there might be a practical answer to the truth, and strength to bring forth.<a name=10:11></a> Strength to bring forth lies in the knowledge of God in a practical way, and we need to get into difficult circumstances to know Him thus.<a name=10:12></a> I am not suggesting that the Lord Jesus needed to know God at all in the way in which we do, but it does say that He <i>learned</i> obedience through the things which He suffered.<a name=10:13></a> It is as passing through affliction that we learn God.<a name=10:14></a> When God

	<div class="paragraph">
		brought up this great river it affected the whole profession, but His great end was to perform His whole work on mount Zion and upon Jerusalem; after which He would punish the king of Assyria; and while this was going on He exhorts them not to be afraid.<a name=11:1></a> He says in chapter 10: 24: "O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian".<a name=11:2></a> If we are dwelling in Zion, if we are truly set for the truth of the assembly -- Zion representing the privilege and praise side of it -- we need not fear the Assyrian.<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole work will be performed.<a name=11:4></a> It may be very painful, but we need not be afraid, for God says, "For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and mine anger, in their destruction".<a name=11:5></a> It is very encouraging that this kind of work on God's part, the work of discipline, is always short, it is always but for "a little while".<a name=11:6></a> God says of Jerusalem in chapter 54: 7: "For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee".<a name=11:7></a> Even the final tribulation is only for a little while, three-and-a-half years, or forty-two months.<a name=11:8></a> It is never God's way to prolong affliction of this kind.<a name=11:9></a> The point is to get the gain of it during the little while.<a name=11:10></a> So the writer in Hebrews says, "For yet a very little while he that comes will come, and will not delay", chapter 10: 37.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wanted to show the bearing of this on the great thought of Immanuel, God with us.<a name=11:12></a> It is in knowing that God is with us that we find strength to bring forth.<a name=11:13></a> I cannot go out and face the world for Christ if I do not know that God is with me, nor can we do it collectively.<a name=11:14></a> So in connection with this discipline the thought of Immanuel is brought in: "The stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel!<a name=11:15></a>".<a name=11:16></a> If God is with us we are under <i>His</i> wings.<a name=11:17></a> We have come to trust under the wings of Jehovah; but it is because those who profess to trust in the shadow of His wings have given up confidence in Him that He allows alien wings to come over them.<a name=11:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He allows these other wings to cover the land because they did not know the reality of "God with us".<a name=12:1></a> It was Immanuel's land, but the profession had no practical experience of it.<a name=12:2></a> If God was to give them to know the blessedness of Immanuel's land, they must know it as in contrast to the other wings being stretched over them.<a name=12:3></a> I suppose in a way we can regard Christendom as Immanuel's land.<a name=12:4></a> It is not heaven, of course; it is down here in the presence of the fiercest opposition.<a name=12:5></a> That is the idea of Immanuel, God with us.<a name=12:6></a> Christendom is really divine territory, like Samaria and Judah were at this time, but God would give that remnant at Jerusalem to know what Immanuel really meant -- that the Holy One of Israel was in the midst of them.<a name=12:7></a> How can that come about?<a name=12:8></a> Only as the work of the ministry goes on and we are formed by it; so it is that God is with us.<a name=12:9></a> We may say, Where two or three are gathered, the Lord will be in the midst!<a name=12:10></a> Not at all, dear friends: it is "Where two or three are gathered together <i>unto my name</i>, there am I in the midst of them", and it implies this state of which I am speaking -- that we are truly formed as children whom the Lord can own.<a name=12:11></a> In this actual invasion Immanuel became an immense reality to this remnant.<a name=12:12></a> They found strength to bring forth.<a name=12:13></a> In that emergency in crying to God they learnt the full meaning of, "I will trust in Him", and in that emergency they learned the reality of God with them, and the enemy was overthrown.<a name=12:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I alluded to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, because it brings in the moral features of these children.<a name=12:15></a> We do not get in that chapter the thought exactly of children in the way I have been speaking of it, but we get the moral features of a child.<a name=12:16></a> If we are to be true children of Christ in the way I have been speaking of it, and true children of God, it can only come about by a moral process, by putting on the moral features that belong to a child, simple trust, and harmlessness.<a name=12:17></a> The Lord

		I read these passages, beloved brethren, because the importance of keeping before us God's chief interest on earth -- the assembly -- has been pressed upon me.<a name=42:1></a> For many centuries saints have had little conception of it, but in these last few days God has revived the light of it; and we, who have had the benefit of the ministry He has given, to see that the assembly is God's chief concern at the present time.<a name=42:2></a> When we think of the place it has in the counsels of God -- that it is to be finally the residence of His glory and that He Himself will dwell there -- <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:3">Revelation  21:3</a> -- we can understand of what supreme importance it is to God in His ways down here.<a name=42:3></a> The enemy seeks to divert us from it by every means; in his power.<a name=42:4></a> The light of it has been recovered, but little practical expression of it has been seen.<a name=42:5></a> It is <i>urgent</i> for us to give expression to it in our locality -- to make in <i>this</i> place a working expression of it.<a name=42:6></a> <i>Dignity, intelligence</i> and <i>affection</i> are connected with the thought of the assembly.<a name=42:7></a> Dignity because it is composed of those called out by God.<a name=42:8></a> The meaning of the word implies this.<a name=42:9></a> Intelligence because those called should, normally, know why and for what they are called.<a name=42:10></a> And affection because the assembly is a corporate whole, and this can only be in the power of divine affections.<a name=42:11></a>

		The assembly is presented in these passages in three ways:
	</div>

		(3) The assembly <i>of God</i> which He has purchased with the blood of His Own.<a name=43:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first case we might have thought that Paul would have referred to these young converts simply as Christians, but instead he brings this great idea of the assembly before them, although in an elementary way.<a name=43:3></a> It is true the epistle is mainly on family lines and, indeed, this underlies the truth of the assembly; for growth is needed if assembly affections and intelligence are to develop.<a name=43:4></a> Paul had been among them as a nursing mother and a nursing father; in his measure, showing them the Father in his care for them, so that they knew their place in divine affections.<a name=43:5></a> They were Thessalonians, but there were no other Thessalonians like them.<a name=43:6></a> <i>They</i> had heard the call of God and it had separated them from the Thessalonians who were idolators.<a name=43:7></a> <i>They</i> were in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=43:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we need to carry this first aspect of the assembly with us.<a name=43:9></a> We are of the assembly of the 'Hornchurchians'.<a name=43:10></a> An understanding of this would have two effects.<a name=43:11></a> Firstly, it would give us tender regard for one another as considering the actual local setting in which we are found, and for other local assemblies.<a name=43:12></a> If we think of the assembly of the 'Londoners', for instance, we think sympathetically of what it means to our brethren to carry the testimony in such a city as that.<a name=43:13></a> The epistles to the Thessalonians are full of such tender sympathy and affection.<a name=43:14></a> Secondly, it would give us a sympathetic and evangelical outlook on the townsmen around us.<a name=43:15></a> The Apostle says, "from <i>you</i> sounded out the word of the Lord" -- that is, from the assembly.<a name=43:16></a> Though the assembly, as such, does not preach or teach, yet all true activity works from and to the assembly; and sympathetic affection "towards one another and towards all", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:12">1 Thessalonians  3:12</a>, is proper to it.<a name=43:17></a>

		Now these three passages I read speak of three pairs of young men, or boys as the last two are called.<a name=47:12></a> They illustrate the principle of displacement.<a name=47:13></a> The first pair represent <i>the man of faith</i> and <i>the man of works</i>, and teach us that the only principle upon which we can have relations with God is the principle of faith.<a name=47:14></a> It is not only the principle upon which we begin, but "The just shall live by faith"; all our personal relations are to continue on the principle on which we begin.<a name=47:15></a>

		In the first case it is a question of faith, and essentially has to do with our justification.<a name=48:3></a> The second is a matter of spirituality, without which we cannot enter into or lay hold of the blessing or inheritance.<a name=48:4></a> Sarah says, "the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son -- with Isaac".<a name=48:5></a> It is a question of the inheritance and the character of the blessing, which is sonship.<a name=48:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust we can see clearly these three lines: the line of <i>faith</i> which gives us justification and acceptance with God, and is the principle by which we are to live; the line of the <i>Spirit</i> which relates to the way we lay hold of the blessing and the inheritance; the line of <i>godliness</i> which is to govern our practical pathway down here and qualify us for our part in God's house, which is connected with the mystery of piety.<a name=48:8></a> No one can be truly in the house of God in a practical sense without godliness; there is no room for the world in the house of God.<a name=48:9></a>

		Just think of the potentialities, that if my walk and ways are right, I can promote peace-offerings and thanksgivings amongst the whole of the brethren, all who know me.<a name=79:12></a> Think of what was going up from Paul in this respect, and how it stimulated him in his service, as he thought of the Philippians; and think of the inwards of Paul, how right they were!<a name=79:13></a> He says in verse 8, "For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of Christ Jesus".<a name=79:14></a> In the peace-offering itself the inwards were for God, and we

		Then as the epistle proceeds, he speaks further of himself, and then he speaks of Timothy, and then of Epaphroditus.<a name=80:9></a> Later in this chapter he tells us of what his own desires were, to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better, but for their sakes he would remain.<a name=80:10></a> He would continue here, as set to add to the wealth of the fellowship.<a name=80:11></a> And not only so, but he says, "But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all", chapter 2: 17.<a name=80:12></a> The libation, or the drink-offering, was something in addition to what we have had before us; he was thinking of the sacrifice and ministration of their faith; that is what they were putting on the altar; how they were devoting themselves; but in order to make that more excellent, he was prepared to be poured out, in order that <i>their</i> contribution might be more excellent.<a name=80:13></a> And he would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to Malachi, they said "The table of the Lord is polluted", chapter 1: 12 -- and they brought what was torn and lame.<a name=81:6></a> And it says, "Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King", verse 14.<a name=81:7></a> We cannot bring <i>anything</i> to the altar of God.<a name=81:8></a> If we have an appreciation of the way the Lord Jesus has given His all to make the fellowship wealthy, then God looks to us, that on our part there should be a full committal, the male, the best.<a name=81:9></a> Not the best of our energies for our own things, but the best of our energies for God, and for His people.<a name=81:10></a> For I am a great King, he said.<a name=81:11></a> A great King <i>must</i> have the best.<a name=81:12></a> But at Corinth, alas, I am afraid they were regarding the table of Jehovah as contemptible, they were not concerned about it.<a name=81:13></a> They might not have said so in so many words; they were seeking their own things, and so they were missing the wealth of the fellowship.<a name=81:14></a> But how happy it is that we have in this epistle to the Philippians the practical example of a company who were committed; so that, according to this epistle there was no lack of the sacrifice of peace-offering.<a name=81:15></a> The table of Jehovah was being supplied.<a name=81:16></a>

		We have come together today, dear brethren, to mark the beginning of a walk together of two of the Lord's people, and the scripture says, "Can two walk together except they be agreed?<a name=88:2></a>", <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:3">Amos  3:3</a>.<a name=88:3></a> One felt it might be profitable this evening to consider the walk together of the saints.<a name=88:4></a> Brothers and sisters may walk together in a special way as husband and wife, but their agreement in walking together must be based upon the <i>general fellowship of the saints</i>, otherwise it cannot be called a "marriage in the Lord", for our walk together as saints vitally affects our household affairs, and our household links vitally affect our walk together as saints.<a name=88:5></a> I desire to speak of this walk in three ways: firstly, our walk together in separation; secondly, our walk in the light, as it says, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin"; and finally, our walk in love, for we are exhorted to "walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour".<a name=88:6></a> The first has to do with our associations, the second with our state, and the third with positive formation in love in our souls; and all these things should enter into our walk together as Christians.<a name=88:7></a> I wish to show from the other scriptures how our walk together affects the formation of that which is for the heart of Christ in His assembly, both in its future aspect when the bride, the Lamb's wife,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the fundamental basis of our walk together in separation must be agreement as to principles.<a name=89:3></a> We must have a common judgment as to what is of God and what is not, as to what is holy and what is unholy, what is clean and what is unclean.<a name=89:4></a> God has called us to the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, and He has constituted us priests with the power of discernment that we might all have the same mind and the same opinion as regards separation from evil.<a name=89:5></a> The enemy would seek to bring in divergence of mind and opinion, as at Corinth.<a name=89:6></a> Some were allowing evil, while others, such as the house of Chloe, were remaining faithful to the principles of separation.<a name=89:7></a> The apostle writes, "I exhort you, brethren, that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion".<a name=89:8></a> He would have them in agreement in mind and judgment.<a name=89:9></a>

		Our households are of great importance in this matter; they should be spheres marked by complete separation from the world.<a name=89:10></a> That is why I read the passage in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#35">Exodus  35</a>, in connection with the spinning of goats' hair.<a name=89:11></a> Goats' hair refers to the principle of separation.<a name=89:12></a> The tabernacle consisted of ten coloured curtains -- they are called "the tabernacle" -- which provided the immediate surroundings of the ark and the precious vessels.<a name=89:13></a> But over that was the "tent over the tabernacle", consisting of eleven curtains of goats' hair to protect what was underneath, and the <i>women</i> spun the goats' hair.<a name=89:14></a> I have no doubt they spun it in their tents.<a name=89:15></a> I do not mean to say that this exercise is limited to women; it refers to a subjective state that should mark every one of us.<a name=89:16></a> Nevertheless the sisters have a special part in this matter because principles of separation are tested.<a name=89:17></a> Worldly elements come into

		The home is the sisters' sphere in a special way, as Paul says in Timothy, "I will therefore that the younger [women] marry .<a name=90:4></a>.<a name=90:5></a>.<a name=90:6></a> rule the house", meaning the rule of a despot.<a name=90:7></a> If the sister is faithful, that rule must entail the maintenance of the principles of separation in the home.<a name=90:8></a> Goats' hair implies that there is nothing legal about the separation; the goat is a clean animal, it chews the cud and has a cloven hoof; it is agile, able to walk in high places, and is often found alone.<a name=90:9></a> If we are marked by these features, our separation will not be legal or pharisaical.<a name=90:10></a> The most unclean person is one who is separate on wrong lines, as typified by the swine which has a cloven hoof but does not chew the cud.<a name=90:11></a> It refers to pharisaical separation which men may admire, but God regards it as a most unclean thing.<a name=90:12></a> The goat does not represent that at all; it has the cloven hoof but it chews the cud.<a name=90:13></a> If we chew the cud and are often in high places and alone with God, <i>our separation will spring from our communion with God</i>, and that is a great thing.<a name=90:14></a> To chew the cud means to take to heart what we hear, not superficially taking in ministry but taking it home to heart and conscience, allowing it to affect our inward being; so that we are drawn aside in individual intercourse with God, our sensibilities are kept alert, and we find power to exclude what is unholy and unclean.<a name=90:15></a>

		Now I pass on to the thought of walking in the light.<a name=92:6></a> This is a matter which affects our state; it comes home closer to us.<a name=92:7></a> It is not now our associations, what we allow from without, but it searches all our motives within.<a name=92:8></a> Light makes everything manifest; there is nothing more searching than to walk and to serve under divine scrutiny, in the searching light of God Himself.<a name=92:9></a> It searches us through and through, disclosing all our motives, all that we are.<a name=92:10></a> That is where Christian fellowship is -- "in the light".<a name=92:11></a> "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another".<a name=92:12></a> This particularly bears on our assembly relations.<a name=92:13></a> In a general way, of course, in regard of the children of Israel, God looked to them to walk in the light they had of Himself.<a name=92:14></a> But the priests inside the holy place walked in the very direct light of the candlestick; they served in that wonderful light.<a name=92:15></a> Now, dear brethren, walking in the light would free us from all self-deception, all idea of a reputation.<a name=92:16></a> Walking in the light would mean that we are all just what we are, and this is really the basis of Christian fellowship -- that we are what we are, with no pretensions whatever.<a name=92:17></a> As after the flesh we are all sinners by nature and practice, and the light shows us that truth; at the same time, <i>through grace</i> we are born of God.<a name=92:18></a> John,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one feels for oneself how easily darkness comes in; how easily we can begin in the Spirit and then seek to be made perfect in flesh.<a name=93:5></a> I do not know of anything that mars the fellowship more than a kind of pretence to be a perfect Christian who can never do anything wrong or make a mistake.<a name=93:6></a> That spirit can come into assembly matters, and nothing is so deadening from an assembly point of view.<a name=93:7></a> I have sin in me and shall have as long as I am here.<a name=93:8></a> James, a prince among the saints, says, "We <i>all</i> often offend".<a name=93:9></a> To think that I do not offend is to make myself a better man than James, or Peter.<a name=93:10></a> We are called upon to walk together in all the blessed light of God, and the only ground on which we can be in that unstained light is that "the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin".<a name=93:11></a> It takes away all pretence, it brings us right down to rock-bottom, where we are all on one common ground, the ground of mercy.<a name=93:12></a> It makes us sympathetic, kind and forgiving towards one another; it is the great basis of fellowship -- walking in the light.<a name=93:13></a> "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth".<a name=93:14></a> One way of walking in darkness is to deceive myself and to deceive other people as to my true state as in the flesh -- to be darkened by that most subtle notion that my very Christianity makes me perfect in the flesh.<a name=93:15></a> To keep up false pretences is to walk in darkness.<a name=93:16></a> "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all".<a name=93:17></a>

		No darkness was there; He was Himself the light, and He was altogether what He said.<a name=94:1></a> Such transparency with us involves the admission of what we are by nature and of our need of the blood of Christ, and also a thankful recognition of God's own work in us, that we have been born of God.<a name=94:2></a> We can take account of one another in that way; we walk in the light together and we have fellowship with one another.<a name=94:3></a> We thus become acquainted with God's glory, for if I am not prepared to admit what I am, how shall I ever learn the mercy of God?<a name=94:4></a> That ray of His glory will be unknown to me, and so will the glory of His grace.<a name=94:5></a> How shall I understand His righteousness?<a name=94:6></a> How shall I understand His holiness?<a name=94:7></a>

		It is only as we get down to rock-bottom that there is room for the divine glory to flood our souls.<a name=94:8></a> We own the truth, the light exposes the truth, it exposes things as they really are, and as we are prepared to own the truth which the light exposes, our hearts are filled with the light of His glory -- His mercy, His grace, His righteousness and His holiness -- and we walk and serve in the light together.<a name=94:9></a> You can see how this bears on the heavenly city, the principle of transparency, for there is no part dark in it.<a name=94:10></a> I have no doubt that everyone belonging to that city will give God all the glory; they will own their blessing as the fruit of "the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus".<a name=94:11></a> Thus God's glory shines out through that city -- she comes down having the glory of God.<a name=94:12></a> She is herself a glorious vessel, but it does not say she comes down having her own glory, but the glory of God.<a name=94:13></a> She is a living witness to what God is and to what He has done; a witness to <i>His</i> grace, <i>His</i> kindness, <i>His</i> righteousness and <i>His</i> holiness.<a name=94:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are positive obligations.<a name=95:9></a> The communion of the body and blood of Christ implies that He placed His body and blood upon the altar; everything He has He put upon the altar in love.<a name=95:10></a> He walked in love to the extent that He laid down His life for us.<a name=95:11></a> If I am really in the communion of that, I shall be walking as He walked, in measure -- not simply in separation but in positive love.<a name=95:12></a> It raises the question as to what we are doing with our bodies; <i>have we put our bodies on the altar</i>?<a name=95:13></a> We ought to do it; we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<a name=95:14></a> This is where real formation comes in -- formation in the divine nature.<a name=95:15></a> Romans tells us to present our bodies to God as a living sacrifice, which is our intelligent service.<a name=95:16></a> It is a wonderful thought; "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God" -- think of our bodies, holy and acceptable!<a name=95:17></a> -- "which is your intelligent service".<a name=95:18></a>

		I desire, dear brethren, to speak of three things; first <i>discipline</i>, secondly <i>adjustment and formation</i>, thirdly <i>comfort</i>.<a name=100:1></a> I think these things are closely connected, for discipline has in view adjustment and formation, and, if <i>God</i> sends discipline, He has in mind to comfort His people both in the discipline and also in the results that accrue from it.<a name=100:2></a> At the present time we are passing through a common discipline.<a name=100:3></a> God's people were always the subjects of His discipline, but at the moment we are drawn together in sharing in that which is a common discipline.<a name=100:4></a> I think God would have us appreciate Him more than we have ever done hitherto in connection with His discipline, and to be in sympathy with Him as seeing the end He has in view.<a name=100:5></a> He would have us to realize that in His ways in government He is dealing with His household, and in that connection He is spoken of as the Father of spirits, dealing with those whom He regards as sons, in love and wisdom.<a name=100:6></a> At the same time as the blessed and only Ruler He maintains His over-ruling government amongst the nations.<a name=100:7></a> In His great wisdom He can make these "things work together".<a name=100:8></a> Whilst He has His chief interest in His assembly, and everything can only serve for the furtherance of its spiritual welfare, God does not give up His other interests.<a name=100:9></a> The consideration of this enlarges our thoughts as to Him.<a name=100:10></a> We may have thought His chief interest was His only interest.<a name=100:11></a> But with Israel of old, when He chastised His people He dealt with all the nations round about.<a name=100:12></a>

		It is true He does not govern the world publicly yet, because when He does He will have to come in as Judge, but in connection with the happenings of the present time He is behind the scenes, and things will never get out of hand, we may rest assured.<a name=101:1></a> In Revelation it says the beast <i>was given</i> power to continue 42 months.<a name=101:2></a> Even in the darkest day nothing happens except under God's over-ruling hand.<a name=101:3></a> He may allow evil to come to its full head, but things are never out of control.<a name=101:4></a> God would have us to be intelligent as to this.<a name=101:5></a> He is able to deal with matters among the nations, and yet cause everything to promote His chief interest -- the assembly.<a name=101:6></a> He would especially have us appreciate Him in His dealings with His people.<a name=101:7></a> Parents know how much patience is required to discipline children.<a name=101:8></a> How much more so in the case of His children for whom He has so great an end in view.<a name=101:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are two things that are put together in scripture as the means whereby God reaches His end.<a name=101:10></a> On the one hand there is a ministry of grace, and on the other hand there is discipline.<a name=101:11></a> One would not achieve the desired result without the other.<a name=101:12></a> I trust we have all appreciated <i>God as the source of grace</i>, but have we appreciated Him in His discipline?<a name=101:13></a> If discipline is not brought in children will go astray.<a name=101:14></a> Does it not touch our hearts to think of the patience of God?<a name=101:15></a> If He relinquished His hand, where should we be?<a name=101:16></a> How carefully He brings in just what is needed; if He did not do so we would be swamped by the world.<a name=101:17></a> We can thank God for His discipline.<a name=101:18></a> So God would have us to be with Him in it, for if so, it will be an easier matter for Him to reach His end.<a name=101:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I referred to the scripture in Isaiah because discipline had come in at that time in an overwhelming way, and at a time when he might have thought it least necessary.<a name=101:20></a> During the 14 years of Hezekiah's reign there had been a great recovery in Israel.<a name=101:21></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings me to my second point -- adjustment and formation.<a name=102:5></a> They come out in Hezekiah himself: "And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent His garments".<a name=102:6></a> I think that represents adjustment, or at any rate preparedness for adjustment.<a name=102:7></a> <i>Our garments suggest habits</i> -- habits of life, habits of thought.<a name=102:8></a> How often these are borrowed from the world; the fact that we are going on with something spiritually great may not prevent that.<a name=102:9></a> We read in the book of Ecclesiastes, "In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider".<a name=102:10></a> So the best thing we can do is to rend our garments as Hezekiah did.<a name=102:11></a> And then he put on sackcloth, the sign of repentance.<a name=102:12></a> Was it needed?<a name=102:13></a> It is needed all along the way.<a name=102:14></a> In 5 out of 7 addresses in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 there is a call to repent.<a name=102:15></a> It is meet that we should be marked by such a state.<a name=102:16></a> Before true adjustment can take place there needs to be a state of repentance.<a name=102:17></a> The happenings of the last 12 months have shown that we do need adjustment in our habits of thought, perhaps in many ways.<a name=102:18></a> We need to take to heart the fact that few perhaps, if any, thought that discipline of this kind is necessary.<a name=102:19></a> If we did not foresee that it was necessary, if we lacked prophetic vision, must there not have been with us a state that caused blindness?<a name=102:20></a> One cause of a state of blindness is a self-satisfied

		condition.<a name=103:1></a> We need to beware of self-satisfaction.<a name=103:2></a> We can cloak ourselves with our blessings and become self-satisfied through the very goodness of God to us.<a name=103:3></a> One would desire to be careful as to one's remarks.<a name=103:4></a> But I am suggesting this need of adjustment in order that our thoughts and hearts may be brought into line with what God has before Him.<a name=103:5></a> Our thoughts were hardly in line with God's when we felt certain war was not coming.<a name=103:6></a> Did we not think we needed discipline?<a name=103:7></a> Did we not think christendom needed it?<a name=103:8></a> Had we felt the state of apostasy growing all around us, men becoming lovers of pleasure more than of God?<a name=103:9></a> Did we feel it enough?<a name=103:10></a> We need to face the question of lack of prophetic vision, and judge the state that brought it about.<a name=103:11></a> We need to rend our garments.<a name=103:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature of adjustment is the need for the broader outlook to which I have already referred.<a name=103:13></a> The church is God's chief interest; nothing can happen which does not promote its welfare.<a name=103:14></a> But He still has His interests among the Jews as well as among the nations.<a name=103:15></a> He would have our hearts enlarged as to all His interests.<a name=103:16></a> He would have us to feel more with Him as to the whole course of government, to feel more the state of christendom, to feel more concerned about our own state and the way self-satisfaction so readily creeps in, so that we may be prepared to rend our garments, prepared for adjustment.<a name=103:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We also have to face the fact that the Lord has allowed certain of His own with whom we walk to be taken home in a way we did not expect.<a name=103:18></a> Why has the Lord acted in this way?<a name=103:19></a> Can it be that we have linked christianity too much with earth?<a name=103:20></a> Have we regarded it too much as an insurance for life?<a name=103:21></a> Have we allowed the very privileges we enjoy down here to link our hearts too much with this scene unconsciously?<a name=103:22></a> Were we limiting our piety to God's care of us

		What is in view is formation.<a name=104:11></a> If we are not adjusted how can formation come about?<a name=104:12></a> "The children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth".<a name=104:13></a> That was a remarkable admission on Hezekiah's part.<a name=104:14></a> They had great light, great privileges, great enjoyment, but there was <i>no corresponding state</i>, no strength to bring forth.<a name=104:15></a> God would help us that Christ might be formed in us in a practical way so that we are like Him on Monday as well as on Lord's day.<a name=104:16></a> We would covet to be like Him in measure in our trust in God, in our piety, in our testimony, and that is what God has in mind to bring to pass.<a name=104:17></a> The Lord Jesus says prophetically in this very book: "Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8:18">Isaiah  8:18</a>.<a name=104:18></a> One feels the challenge is most urgent that our whole lives should be in accord with Him,

		But then God would always comfort His people.<a name=105:9></a> He would comfort us both in the discipline and in the results that accrue from it.<a name=105:10></a> Nahum means "comfort", and he prophesied in Hezekiah's reign to comfort the people <i>in</i> the trial.<a name=105:11></a> He foretold the destruction of Nineveh, the stronghold of the mighty enemy of God's people.<a name=105:12></a> He says, "God is jealous, and the Lord revenges .<a name=105:13></a>.<a name=105:14></a>.<a name=105:15></a> The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked".<a name=105:16></a> Then he goes on to say, "His way is in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet", <a href="../bible/Nahum.htm#1:3">Nahum  1:3</a> - 4.<a name=105:17></a> This may primarily refer to His dealings in judgment, but may apply it as a word of comfort to His own discipline, for if His <i>way</i> is in the whirlwind and in the storm, He has His <i>end</i> in view, an end of perfect blessing.<a name=105:18></a> We see it in a remarkable

		So Daniel stands out as an example for all time since his day of how believers are to conduct themselves in the sphere of God's government and testimony down here.<a name=109:5></a> If we are to conduct ourselves so that <i>our</i> way and <i>our</i> doings are pleasing to God and a comfort to the saints in that sphere, we need to have an impression of the greatness of God.<a name=109:6></a> That is what marked Daniel and his companions.<a name=109:7></a> Daniel's name means 'God is judge', Hananiah's name means 'Jah is gracious' -- Jah is the most exalted name of God -- Michael means, 'Who is what God is', and Azariah means 'Jah is keeper'.<a name=109:8></a> So that you find with all four a great impression of God.<a name=109:9></a> Well, dear brethren, one feels, speaking for oneself, how much one needs help as to conduct in the sphere of God's government and of <i>our</i> testimony.<a name=109:10></a> How we need to be marked by courage and wisdom; and if that is to come about we need to have a very great impression of God: "God is judge".<a name=109:11></a> The <i>word</i> 'judge' is not the thought simply of a penal judge passing sentence on evil, but it is the same <i>word</i> as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68:5">Psalm  68:5</a>, "A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation", and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#9:8">Psalm  9:8</a>, "He will judge the world in righteousness".<a name=109:12></a> The thought in it is the supreme and sovereign Ruler,

		Now Daniel, in this outburst of praise that goes up to God when the vision is revealed to him, gives us an idea of how great God was in his sight.<a name=110:6></a> He begins with a note of worship; he says, "Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever", or "from eternity to eternity".<a name=110:7></a> One of the highest notes of worship in the Old Testament is involved in that expression, indicating his knowledge of God in connection with purpose and counsel.<a name=110:8></a> He brings this knowledge into the realm of God's government for he says, "wisdom and might are his.<a name=110:9></a> And it is he that changeth times and seasons; he deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding".<a name=110:10></a> Now one feels we need to know God in this way and to be bowed in worship before Him as the supreme and sovereign Ruler; it is He who changes times and seasons, Daniel says.<a name=110:11></a> It links on with what the Lord says to the disciples in the beginning of Acts: "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority".<a name=110:12></a> In one way, there is no more exalted view of God than this; God would keep in His own hands and knowledge the times and seasons.<a name=110:13></a> What a great thing to know a God like that!<a name=110:14></a> He has determined every dispensation, when it should begin and when it should end.<a name=110:15></a> As to the end of the present age the Lord says, "Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:32">Mark  13:32</a>.<a name=110:16></a> How great God is in this character, keeping times and seasons in His own hand!<a name=110:17></a> In the epistle to Timothy, which refers to the saints here in public testimony as the house of God, this side of the truth

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in addition to that, Daniel says that He removes kings and sets up kings.<a name=111:13></a> Now dear brethren, that applies in a practical way at the present moment.<a name=111:14></a> He is the blessed and only Ruler and has His own way at the present time.<a name=111:15></a> So that whatever kind of person has power at the moment we can look behind that person and bow to the hand of God in it.<a name=111:16></a> We can humble ourselves under His mighty hand as to what He allows in that respect.<a name=111:17></a> I believe we need to be grounded in this truth if we are to be truly bold and free in testimony.<a name=111:18></a> We need to be on this bedrock, that the One whom we are representing holds the whole reins of government in His hands, although not publicly but behind the scenes, and they never

		Now to pass on for a moment to Ezra; I suppose all of us would like to be a help and a comfort to the saints, and Ezra shows how we can be a help -- his name means that.<a name=114:1></a> Well, we all have to tread our path in the realm of God's government here, and we also all stand connected with God's house.<a name=114:2></a> These things bear closely on one another.<a name=114:3></a> In the realm of God's government He has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father", and the book of Daniel shows how that kingdom, which saints are, is going to break the image and fill the earth.<a name=114:4></a> But then, we also have part in God's house and in God's city.<a name=114:5></a> The kingdom, the house and the city are closely connected.<a name=114:6></a> What gives the house its importance is that it is the dwelling-place of God, the King; and what gives the city its importance is that it is the place whence the light and administration proper to the kingdom is exercised.<a name=114:7></a>

		We would all, surely, desire to be a help in connection with the house of God, and Ezra comes in in that connection.<a name=114:8></a> He was not a pioneer; Joshua and Zerubbabel and others were pioneers years before.<a name=114:9></a> None of us here can exactly claim to be <i>pioneers</i> -- others have done that kind of work, and the truth of the house has been recovered to us.<a name=114:10></a> But we can all come in as <i>helps</i>, and the Lord would encourage us to move on on this line.<a name=114:11></a> How can I be a help?<a name=114:12></a> In taking character from Ezra!<a name=114:13></a> First of all, he was a priest and he could trace his genealogy right back to Phinehas, Eleazar and Aaron.<a name=114:14></a> The way a person can prove his genealogy, spiritually today is by being marked by the features of priesthood.<a name=114:15></a> No doubt Ezra, in his measure, was marked by features which marked Phinehas, Eleazar and Aaron.<a name=114:16></a> Then it says of him in verse 6: "This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given", and again in verse 10: "For Ezra had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah and to do it, and to teach in Israel the statutes and

		I desire to say a word as to the assembly, and I hope that the Spirit of God may help us more fully to understand what an exceedingly great vessel the assembly is, the masterpiece of divine operations.<a name=122:1></a> To be occupied with the greatness of the assembly in no way detracts from the greatness of Christ; for if the assembly is great, Christ is surpassingly great.<a name=122:2></a> The assembly is great because it is His body, His fulness.<a name=122:3></a> I suppose there is not a feature attaching to His perfect and glorious manhood which does not find an answer in the assembly as His counterpart.<a name=122:4></a> "I will make him a helpmate, his like".<a name=122:5></a> The assembly is "the fulness of him who fills all in all".<a name=122:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		While sonship is a primary matter in the Christian calling, the very word 'assembly' also involves the idea of calling: it means <i>a called out company</i>.<a name=123:8></a> God has called us out to have a functional part in this great vessel, the assembly.<a name=123:9></a> So even in addressing the Thessalonians, who had only been converted a short time, Paul says, "the assembly of Thessalonians".<a name=123:10></a> He would give them an impression that they had been called out with a view to being set together assembly-wise.<a name=123:11></a>

		I have referred to the versatility of the assembly.<a name=123:12></a> When God was bringing out His thoughts of old, He had to use many types to illustrate the various aspects and functions of the assembly.<a name=123:13></a> In addition to the types representing the wife and the bride, there was the tabernacle, the city, and the house that Solomon built.<a name=123:14></a> In all these things the assembly was in God's mind.<a name=123:15></a> That is what I mean by the versatility of the assembly.<a name=123:16></a> She fills out every position, for she is the city of God, the tabernacle of God, the temple of God, the habitation of God, as well as the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=123:17></a> In Revelation these things are identified: the word to John is, "I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=123:18></a> But what does John see?<a name=123:19></a> "The holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God".<a name=123:20></a> Think of the versatility of such a vessel!<a name=123:21></a> The bride, the Lamb's wife, <i>is</i> the city of God, the holy Jerusalem.<a name=123:22></a> And in the eternal view-

		We can understand, too, Christ loving the assembly.<a name=125:3></a> He loves the assembly and has delivered Himself up for it.<a name=125:4></a> The assembly loves Christ because she sees in Him the ideal Man, "the root and offspring of David".<a name=125:5></a> We see in Jesus the Man of God's purpose, the Man in whom God has found His delight, "my beloved Son", as He says, "in whom I have found my delight".<a name=125:6></a> And the soul of the assembly finds its delight in Christ.<a name=125:7></a> Our very soul is moved as we think of Him.<a name=125:8></a> We delight in the Man who ever considered for His God.<a name=125:9></a> According to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>He went into the depths for His God; He sacrificed Himself completely in consideration for His God.<a name=125:10></a> The assembly loves the Lord Jesus in His perfect Manhood.<a name=125:11></a> She is in accord with God, who says, "My beloved in whom my soul has found its delight.<a name=125:12></a> I will put my Spirit upon him", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:18">Matthew  12:18</a>.<a name=125:13></a> Honours rare are placed upon that blessed Man.<a name=125:14></a> "I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:27">Psalm  89:27</a>.<a name=125:15></a> The assembly says "Amen" to all that.<a name=125:16></a> He is "the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star".<a name=125:17></a> The more the assembly loves Christ, in that bridal way, the more the other features proper to the assembly develop in her.<a name=125:18></a> The more Christ is enshrined in our affections, the more we become in a practical way the habitation of God.<a name=125:19></a> What is the habitation of God?<a name=125:20></a> The place where Christ is enshrined, where the Ark is.<a name=125:21></a> You think of the tabernacle, of the house; it was the shrine for the ark; where the ark is, God is.<a name=125:22></a> "Arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place, thou and the ark of thy strength", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#6:41">2 Chronicles  6:41</a>.<a name=125:23></a> The truth is one whole.<a name=125:24></a> The bride, the Lamb's wife, is the city, and the vessel prepared as a bride adorned for her husband

		Paul had the assembly always before him and he addresses the youngest Christians as "the assembly of Thessalonians".<a name=126:3></a> He is not developing the assembly yet, but he reminds them that they are the assembly of the Thessalonians, that they are called out for a purpose.<a name=126:4></a> If we are to be free to take on these great thoughts of the assembly, which relate to what Christ has and what God has, we need to be satisfied as to our own portion, settled as to our own affairs, so that we are free to be engaged with God and His affairs.<a name=126:5></a> And so he speaks to the Thessalonians in the way of comfort because we need comforting.<a name=126:6></a> It is a comforting epistle.<a name=126:7></a> He speaks of their having received "eternal consolation and good hope by grace".<a name=126:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to Corinth, it is a question of the universal features of the assembly, the assembly of God in Corinth, not the assembly of Corinthians.<a name=127:7></a> If we think of the assembly of the Thessalonians, we are thinking of the personnel in connection with their local setting and peculiar exercises; but if we think of the <i>assembly of God</i> in a place we are thinking of the vessel that is marked by the same features everywhere -- there is no variation.<a name=127:8></a> As we get help on the line of comfort, as maintained in the sense that we are in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, we become victorious in our local setting.<a name=127:9></a> We find sufficiency in the Father and in the Lord for all our matters, and we are able to take on the features of the assembly of God in a place.<a name=127:10></a> So now the apostle, while speaking of the assembly in a locality, in Corinth, is bringing out characteristics which are proper to the assembly universally.<a name=127:11></a> What is proper to the assembly of God in London, is proper to the assembly of God in Sydney or New York, because it is the assembly of God.<a name=127:12></a> It is therefore a question of divine order and what is suitable to God in a vessel

		G.R.<a name=133:1></a>C.<a name=133:2></a> I trust the Lord may help us together in considering three thoughts of <i>oneness</i> -- first the unity of the body, secondly, union with Christ, as it says in Ephesians, "the two shall be one flesh", and thirdly, what the Lord speaks of in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>as being "one in us" -- our unity in the Father and in the Son.<a name=133:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One has felt that the Lord has been stressing the thought of union with Himself, the church's union with Him, but it seems to me if that is to be realised it raises the question first of all of unity amongst ourselves.<a name=133:4></a> In other words it bears in a very practical way on our local conditions and relations with each other, because unity precedes union, that is, the unity of the vessel to which Christ is united.<a name=133:5></a> It is true there is the individual thought of union -- "he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit" -- that is a blessed thing; but the full thought of union is that of Christ and the assembly, as it says, "we are members of his body; we are of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=133:6></a> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife".<a name=133:7></a> In the individual setting it says, "he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit", but in the assembly setting it does not put it that way; it speaks of <i>Christ being united to the assembly</i>.<a name=133:8></a> The assembly is attractive to Christ and He leaves other things to be united to the assembly.<a name=133:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=136:19></a>R.<a name=136:20></a> That is very suggestive, so that we work out what is local in the light of the universal, and that is a great stimulus.<a name=136:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=136:22></a>C.<a name=136:23></a> That is a most important point to lay hold of.<a name=136:24></a> We do not work up from the local to the universal.<a name=136:25></a> God has made us members of the universal body of Christ, and <i>we bring</i> the light of the universal <i>into</i> the local.<a name=136:26></a> It is the opposite way to which men work; men form local branches, and then a federation of local branches; but the only membership scripture speaks of is the membership of the body of Christ -- not membership of a local church.<a name=136:27></a> Having the light of that we are governed in our local setting by it.<a name=136:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=137:5></a>C.<a name=137:6></a> Quite so.<a name=137:7></a> I think the thread runs through scripture.<a name=137:8></a> The Levites had to encamp <i>around the tabernacle</i>, whereas the others encamped according to their tribes.<a name=137:9></a> While we all have a local setting corresponding with the tribal one, from another angle we are <i>all</i> Levites and are all encamping around the tabernacle, that is the great universal whole.<a name=137:10></a> Unless we are true Levites encamping around the tabernacle we shall not be right in our tribal setting.<a name=137:11></a>
