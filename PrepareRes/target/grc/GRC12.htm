		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> It is in mind in reading this book, to consider the grace and the government of God in days of recovery, and to see how God coordinates His operations of grace and government in order to reach the divine end, the divine end being indicated in the last chapter of the book where it says, "Jehovah shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Jehovah, and his name one", chapter 14: 9.<a name=1:3></a> The Old Testament prophets had as their objective the world to come, and the earth, but these scriptures are written for our instruction, and as Christians we have in view heaven and earth, and the day of eternity, when God will be all in all.<a name=1:4></a> God is operating both in grace and in government to bring those who have returned from captivity into the fulness of His thoughts, so that there might even now be a response which will give Him the foretaste of what He will have in that eternal day.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first vision the matter of government is introduced first, so that we might be settled in our minds about that, in a general way; and then the great objective is brought forward, that is Jerusalem.<a name=1:6></a> While the immediate matter in view was the building of the house, God brings forward His great objective, Jerusalem, which is typical of God's complete thought as to the assembly in Christ Jesus, including, of course, His abode, but embracing everything proper to the city of the great King; for it is in and through this city that He will be known as the great King both in the world to come and, I suppose, in the

		eternal day.<a name=2:1></a> He has nothing less before Him than the full thought of the assembly, and He would help us, as returned captives, to embrace His full thought.<a name=2:2></a> Then, as the chapter proceeds, there is another view of the gentile powers, the four horns that scatter; but we are shown that they are defeated by the four craftsmen.<a name=2:3></a> In chapter 2 the man goes forth to measure Jerusalem and the prophet is told that it is to be inhabited and that God will dwell there.<a name=2:4></a> So it is a comprehensive vision to prepare us for what follows.<a name=2:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=2:6></a>M.<a name=2:7></a> "I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy", <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#1:14">Zechariah  1:14</a>.<a name=2:8></a> It is an unfolding of the heart of God; it is a great comfort to us.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:10></a>C.<a name=2:11></a> That is very precious.<a name=2:12></a> Jealousy would flow from His heart.<a name=2:13></a> His love lies behind it.<a name=2:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.M.<a name=2:15></a>S.<a name=2:16></a> Is government brought forward first because of the poor state of the people at this time?<a name=2:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:18></a>C.<a name=2:19></a> They had been deterred from building through opposition on the part of the authorities, brought about by their enemies, but, as a result of the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah, they did not wait for a further message from the king; they started to build, and then God moved the authorities in their favour.<a name=2:20></a> This prophecy was in the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month.<a name=2:21></a> They had already been stirred by the prophetic word, and had already begun to build and now God assures them that government is under control, so that they should go forward without fear.<a name=2:22></a>

		the hands of Christ, but during the night, while God is not governing directly, He nevertheless maintains complete control by indirect providential operations which faith can take account of.<a name=3:1></a> So he says, "I saw by night, and behold".<a name=3:2></a> It is what faith beholds.<a name=3:3></a> We are living in the night, in this sense, the day has not dawned, but we behold, we are given light as to a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees.<a name=3:4></a> As you say, it is a type of Christ as the One who says, "Behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:20">Matthew  28:20</a>.<a name=3:5></a> He stood among the myrtle trees.<a name=3:6></a> You were thinking that the myrtle trees in the low valley would represent the saints?<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=3:8></a>S.<a name=3:9></a> I thought it stressed the lowly position marking the saints as set out in Galilee.<a name=3:10></a>

		G.R.<a name=3:11></a>C.<a name=3:12></a> I think so.<a name=3:13></a> And what a lowly position ours is, as having returned from captivity.<a name=3:14></a> Outwardly the Christian profession is in a state of apostasy, but there is everything needed to maintain those who view things aright and are preserved in lowliness.<a name=3:15></a> The Lord is with such, "Behold, I am with you all the days"; and "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am <i>I</i> in the midst of <i>them</i>", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=3:16></a> How lowly the position of the two or three!<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:20></a>C.<a name=3:21></a> That should ever be in our minds as the great principle of God's government.<a name=3:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:2></a>C.<a name=4:3></a> So that He uses them to carry out governmental discipline upon His saints.<a name=4:4></a> That is a solemn matter is it not?<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=4:6></a>M.<a name=4:7></a> Is it striking that where faith is not in exercise the government is not favourable to the saints?<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:9></a>C.<a name=4:10></a> That is good.<a name=4:11></a> But as soon as faith was exercised by the returned captives, the government became favourable.<a name=4:12></a> That would encourage us to go forward in faith, having God's objective as our objective.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.E.<a name=4:14></a>M.<a name=4:15></a> The basis of God's operations must be faith in us.<a name=4:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:17></a>C.<a name=4:18></a> Faith would lay hold of what God is doing now, would it not?<a name=4:19></a> So that we should be fellow-workmen, moving together in relation to God's chief interest.<a name=4:20></a> And then God will overrule in His providential government to help forward the work.<a name=4:21></a> But if we depart from that, and become occupied with our own houses, as in <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:4">Haggai  1:4</a>, and depart from God's prime interest, God will use the authorities in discipline.<a name=4:22></a> Here in the vision the power that had been used primarily in discipline is not seen; the discipline had done its work, in one sense.<a name=4:23></a> There were the three powers left, Persia, Greece and Rome.<a name=4:24></a> But they were all behind the man riding upon a red horse.<a name=4:25></a> That is, they could make no movement without the man who was in front of them.<a name=4:26></a> Angels and principalities and powers are subject to Christ.<a name=4:27></a>

		S.McC.<a name=4:28></a> And is it not interesting that all the answers to enquiries at this point come from the man that stood <i>among</i> the myrtle trees?<a name=4:29></a> Verse 9: "My lord, what are these?<a name=4:30></a> then the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.<a name=4:31></a> And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said".<a name=4:32></a> <i>He</i> gives the answer.<a name=4:33></a> I thought perhaps

		G.R.<a name=5:2></a>C.<a name=5:3></a> Very good.<a name=5:4></a> Did not Mr.<a name=5:5></a> Taylor help us much in our view of the authorities, that they are really a department of God.<a name=5:6></a> "The man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom <i>Jehovah</i> hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth".<a name=5:7></a> That is faith's view of them, a remarkable thing.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=5:9></a> Would the myrtle trees have reference to the saints as recovered to the truth, something evergreen and precious before God?<a name=5:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:11></a>C.<a name=5:12></a> I think so, as in a suitable state of soul, in the low valley, and as thus having the Lord among them.<a name=5:13></a> Matthew visualises a position such as this right until the end of the age.<a name=5:14></a> Where <i>two or three</i> are gathered together to His name there <i>He</i> is in the midst of <i>them</i>.<a name=5:15></a> But then the One who is in the midst of <i>them</i> is the One to whom all power has been committed in heaven and upon earth.<a name=5:16></a> All powers are under His control, and He gives us light as to them.<a name=5:17></a> These are they whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.<a name=5:18></a> It would give us respect for the powers without fearing them.<a name=5:19></a>

		G.R.<a name=5:23></a>C.<a name=5:24></a> Quite so.<a name=5:25></a> The One who is in their midst is the One to whom all authority, or power, in heaven and earth is given.<a name=5:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		control of the authorities.<a name=6:1></a> They are active in other ways to make inroads among the saints themselves; but we see, in the course of history, that the gates of hades ever scheme to get the authorities under their control, and thus to use them as persecuting powers against the saints.<a name=6:2></a> But, as you say, the gates of hades shall not prevail against the assembly.<a name=6:3></a> If our state is right and the Lord is in our midst, we have the One in our midst who is really in control.<a name=6:4></a> Faith sees Him to be in control of all these things.<a name=6:5></a>

		G.R.<a name=6:8></a>C.<a name=6:9></a> It says, "they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle trees, and said", showing that they were responsible to the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle trees.<a name=6:10></a> It shows what a place Christ has in this sphere.<a name=6:11></a> And they say, "We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still and is at rest".<a name=6:12></a> And then that leads to intercession.<a name=6:13></a> I suppose this is a backward view, it would refer to the time before the captives had been set free.<a name=6:14></a> Babylon had carried them away captive, and had oppressed them; and instead of the authorities, who were responsible to God, whether they knew it or not, being concerned about Jerusalem, the whole earth was sitting still and was at rest.<a name=6:15></a> And so the angel of Jehovah intercedes and says, "Jehovah of hosts, How long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?<a name=6:16></a>" And Jehovah answers the intercession.<a name=6:17></a> It may be we could regard that as the intercession of Christ Himself.<a name=6:18></a>

		G.R.<a name=6:21></a>C.<a name=6:22></a> I think the two lines we are engaged with, that is, God's activities in grace and in government,

		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		should be known to us in such a manner that we can pray intelligently about both.<a name=7:1></a> And one has felt concerned as to how small one's own intelligence is in praying for kings and all that are in dignity.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.M.<a name=7:3></a>S.<a name=7:4></a> Please help us on that line -- how to pray intelligently for those who are in authority.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:6></a>C.<a name=7:7></a> I am thinking especially of praying for them relative to God's operations in grace; and so here we have an intercession, "How long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah?<a name=7:8></a>" An intervention in government on God's part was needed.<a name=7:9></a> "And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words, comforting words.<a name=7:10></a> And the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry, saying, thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy, and I am wroth exceedingly with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little wroth, and they helped forward the affliction.<a name=7:11></a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and the line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem", verses 13 - 17 -- and then further He refers to the cities.<a name=7:12></a> So that the answer to the intercession was that God had returned to Jerusalem with mercies.<a name=7:13></a> But the way that operated, in actual fact, was that the Persian power overthrew Babylon, which was thought to be an invincible city, in one night, and Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain.<a name=7:14></a> This made way, in due course, for Cyrus, who was a subject of Isaiah's prophecy to come forward and release the captives and to issue the decree that the house of God in Jerusalem should be rebuilt.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=7:16></a>E.<a name=7:17></a> Is it significant that, following the fall of Babylon, Daniel is brought into relief with his windows open towards Jerusalem?<a name=7:18></a> Does that link on with the thought of appreciating God's government, that he would keep his eye on Jerusalem whatever the outward circumstances might be?<a name=7:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:1></a>C.<a name=8:2></a> I think that.<a name=8:3></a> So that if we are to be intelligent in praying for kings and those that are in authority we have to keep <i>our</i> eye on Jerusalem.<a name=8:4></a> It is a question of what God is going to do for Jerusalem; that is, the assembly.<a name=8:5></a> He is determined that at the close of the dispensation there should be saints on earth who are empowered by the Spirit to lay hold of His full thoughts as to the assembly.<a name=8:6></a> That is what He is operating for.<a name=8:7></a> And it is a question of being intelligent in our prayers for kings and those that are in dignity with that in view.<a name=8:8></a> Our eye is on Jerusalem; what is God going to do for Jerusalem?<a name=8:9></a> He has sent out these powers.<a name=8:10></a> "These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth".<a name=8:11></a> But He has sent them out relative to Jerusalem.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=8:13></a>C.<a name=8:14></a>L.<a name=8:15></a> So that in the history of Daniel, when he is so concerned about matters, it is interesting to see how the angel speaks in regard to being in the court of Persia, and being withstood there for one and twenty days, Michael coming and helping him.<a name=8:16></a> Is that the inside view of what God does in relation to powers?<a name=8:17></a> That is unfolded, is it not, to Daniel, a man exercised about how things are going to be carried through?<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:19></a>C.<a name=8:20></a> Very good.<a name=8:21></a> Jerusalem was Daniel's centre, and he received light, as you say, as to what lay behind God's operations and providential government.<a name=8:22></a> Could you say any more about these persons you referred to?<a name=8:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=8:24></a>C.<a name=8:25></a>L.<a name=8:26></a> We have no access to political matters in our own time, but God has access to them.<a name=8:27></a> And I thought, in the detailed way in which the operations of the angel are unfolded to Daniel in his exercise, it would keep him perfectly restful in the sense that the struggle is not against flesh and blood but that these powers are being held in check angelically by powers of good on behalf of the saints.<a name=8:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=8:29></a>C.<a name=8:30></a> Quite so.<a name=8:31></a> So that we may look at this further when we come to chapter 6.<a name=8:32></a> It says in chapter 6: 5,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		referring to the four Gentile monarchies, "These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth".<a name=9:1></a> That is, the view point in this book is not so much what the monarchies are in themselves, as in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7">Daniel  7</a>where they are seen as wild beasts, but as instruments used by God.<a name=9:2></a> The four spirits of the heavens suggest the Divine energy of providential government behind and controlling these powers.<a name=9:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=9:4></a>D.<a name=9:5></a> Would a knowledge of the government of God in this way tend to preserve the saints in tranquility of mind in relation to all that is transpiring amongst men and nations, so that we might be understanding and free in our spirits to take account of what God is doing, and the great end to which He is working, and to be with Him in it?<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=9:7></a>C.<a name=9:8></a> Exactly.<a name=9:9></a> I would think we need to be with God as to what He is doing at this moment, especially as regards the rulers of the great powers.<a name=9:10></a> The U.<a name=9:11></a>S.<a name=9:12></a>A.<a name=9:13></a>, the British Commonwealth and Russia would be in our thoughts as to how God may use them relative to Jerusalem, to the assembly, because we would desire that our brethren in every land might be set free to work out the great truth suggested in Jerusalem, and to have liberty to dwell in their cities, the local settings.<a name=9:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:15></a> So that this spirit of intercession is very important, as bearing on matters of associations and trade unions, and the relation of the authorities to them.<a name=9:16></a> Perhaps there is need for greater intensification of the spirit of intercession that a way may be made for the conscience of the people of God.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=9:18></a>C.<a name=9:19></a> You are feeling that if there were more intercession we could count on God using the authorities against these things; because they are really not only a challenge to the saints, they are a challenge to government.<a name=9:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=10:2></a>C.<a name=10:3></a> Quite so; taking character in that way from Christ Himself.<a name=10:4></a> It is touching, if we think of verse 12 as being the intercession of Christ Himself; His own concern that, at the close of the dispensation, the assembly in all its features should come into expression in humble persons released from captivity.<a name=10:5></a> Would not <i>His</i> intercession lead us, and encourage us, to be engaged in intercession ourselves?<a name=10:6></a>
