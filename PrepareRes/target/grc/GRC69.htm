		I wish to say a word, dear brethren, about righteousness and the pursuit of it.<a name=41:1></a> It is said of our great Leader that He "loved righteousness and hated lawlessness".<a name=41:2></a> It is the desire of God that we, each one of us, should take character from Him; that we should love righteousness and hate lawlessness.<a name=41:3></a> In actual fact lawlessness is going to be put away from God's universe.<a name=41:4></a> We await new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.<a name=41:5></a> There will not be there one feature of lawlessness which could ever intrude itself.<a name=41:6></a> It is helpful to contrast the two words, righteousness and lawlessness.<a name=41:7></a> Righteousness means that the law of God prevails and that no one questions it; and it is right that throughout the universe the law of God should prevail.<a name=41:8></a> And it is going to prevail without any question.<a name=41:9></a> We await that condition of things where the law of God will prevail to the ages of ages, and God has brought in the reign of grace to establish His law in our hearts now, that we might love righteousness and hate lawlessness.<a name=41:10></a> The putting of man under law never established law.<a name=41:11></a> It only showed man to be lawless, a sinner lost and undone.<a name=41:12></a> As Scripture says, "law came in in order that the offence might abound".<a name=41:13></a> It proved the sinfulness of man; it made sin exceeding sinful.<a name=41:14></a> That having been fully demonstrated, God brought in the reign of grace.<a name=41:15></a> Thank God, grace is now reigning.<a name=41:16></a> What lies behind the reign of grace is the love of God, His very nature, for God is love, and the law of God is the law of love.<a name=41:17></a> Even the law of Moses was the law of love, only it put things in a negative way because man was a sinner, but if you look at the provisions
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of that law you will see that it only forbade what is incompatible with love.<a name=42:1></a> God is love and He will not have anything incompatible with love.<a name=42:2></a> And so the spirituality of the law of Moses lies in the two great commandments: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy strength;" and "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself".<a name=42:3></a> Hence Scripture says love is the whole law.<a name=42:4></a> So that when we say the law of God is going to prevail in the universe, in new heavens and a new earth, it means that love will prevail, God all in all, supreme in every heart, and relations between His creatures regulated by His law, what God is in Himself, love.<a name=42:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to see that righteousness, faith and love go together.<a name=42:6></a> We are exhorted to pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace.<a name=42:7></a> Peace is the result of righteousness, faith and love, and these three things are inseparable.<a name=42:8></a> They are distinguished for us for our help, but you could not have one without the other.<a name=42:9></a> If love is the whole law, then I cannot be righteous if I do not love; and, without faith, no one has ever been righteous in this world since the beginning of time.<a name=42:10></a> It would be impossible, for "without faith it is impossible to please God".<a name=42:11></a> What we need first of all as sinners is the righteousness that God has in grace provided for us when we had none.<a name=42:12></a> This righteousness, the righteousness of God, is revealed in the gospel; for the gospel shows us how God has so wrought in love that He can righteously provide us as sinners with this perfect righteousness.<a name=42:13></a> But love has done it; thus love and righteousness are inseparable.<a name=42:14></a> God's Man is living to provide righteousness for men who have none; and in result Christ is our righteousness.<a name=42:15></a> He is made to us wisdom from God and righteousness.<a name=42:16></a> A marvellous thing is that as I look up to heaven I see the glorified Man at the right hand of God in whom God's glory shines,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and I perceive that He is my righteousness and my claim to be there.<a name=43:1></a> This is a most glorious thing to consider.<a name=43:2></a> I am nothing myself, but Christ is my righteousness, so I can be happy in the very presence of God's glory because the One in whom that glory shines is Himself my righteousness.<a name=43:3></a> I could not possibly have, nor could I wish to have, a better acceptance than I have in Christ.<a name=43:4></a> I can enter the Holy of Holies with boldness.<a name=43:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the gospel brings all this to us -- the free gift of righteousness.<a name=43:6></a> It refers to "Those who receive the abundance of grace and of the free gift of righteousness".<a name=43:7></a> But, you see, that has a profound effect on the heart of the one who does receive it.<a name=43:8></a> Once you really come to that you surrender your heart not only to Christ but to God who has done such wonderful things for you.<a name=43:9></a> And so in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>it says: "Yield yourselves to God as alive from among the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God".<a name=43:10></a> I do not now think of winning my way into God's favour; I could not do it; but, as being in God's favour and as having Christ as my righteousness and owning Him as my Lord, I yield my members "instruments of righteousness to God".<a name=43:11></a> I begin to love righteousness; I cannot tolerate anything else.<a name=43:12></a> I love righteousness and hate lawlessness, and though I find the law of sin in my members which operates against the law of my mind, and tends to hinder me all the time from doing what is right with my members, yet, in the chapter (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>) where that is worked out, the writer says, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man".<a name=43:13></a> Think of what grace has done for him!<a name=43:14></a> What has established, in his heart, that delight in God's law?<a name=43:15></a> Not being put under law; but the transcending reign of grace; the way God has dealt with him in grace.<a name=43:16></a> He says I delight in the law of God, I want to be in accord with that law of love and holiness; and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		at the end of the chapter he says, "I myself with the mind serve the law of God".<a name=44:1></a> He resolves that whatever others may do, that is his position.<a name=44:2></a> The flesh can only serve the law of sin, but "I myself" serve the law of God; and he finds in chapter 8 that in the Spirit he has the power to carry it out, and the truth is that a Christian will never be happy unless he is carrying it out, because his inward desires, having been wrought upon by grace, make him delight in the law of God.<a name=44:3></a> In spite of his having peace with God and eternal security he is not fully happy until he learns that he has power in the Spirit to do what he wants to do; that is not only he delights in the law of God but is able to carry it out.<a name=44:4></a> So the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit.<a name=44:5></a> And that is the way -- so wonderful -- God has wrought to establish His law in the hearts of Christians now, and eventually it will be established to the ages of ages in a universe where there will not be a shred of lawlessness.<a name=44:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now we come to the Scriptures I have read and we have this affecting word of Jesus: "for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=44:7></a> It is very touching to think of Jesus coming here to do God's will.<a name=44:8></a> You may say to me 'Well, what is really man's righteousness, what is man's duty?<a name=44:9></a>' "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God".<a name=44:10></a> The latter phrase sets out the measure of man's duty.<a name=44:11></a> Man, it says, is God's image and glory; he was created in the image of God.<a name=44:12></a> When you think of a man's duty you may perhaps think of his duty to his wife and family, or his employer or his fellow-men, but these do not constitute the prime duty of man.<a name=44:13></a> The prime duty of man -- that is his highest responsibility  -- flows from the fact that man is God's image and glory; and the measure of our sin is that we have come short of that.<a name=44:14></a> We have failed in our prime

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		responsibility; we have failed to express God, to be like God; and that bears on the present moment.<a name=45:1></a> If you set up a false image of God in your mind you will not express God.<a name=45:2></a> Unless Christ is enshrined in your heart -- and may He be enshrined in all our hearts!<a name=45:3></a> May we be helped to know Him better, Him that is from the beginning, who is the beginning, and "image of the invisible God" -- and unless He is filling our vision we shall not truly express God.<a name=45:4></a> And our duty as men and women is to express God in everything we say and do and feel.<a name=45:5></a> It is a false image of God that has led so many of our brethren astray.<a name=45:6></a> They think of God as a hard God; that is like the Galatians, going back to law.<a name=45:7></a> They think God is hard and so they are hard.<a name=45:8></a> For whatever image of God you form in your mind it will take form in you.<a name=45:9></a> On the one hand, if you think God is making all kinds of demands you will make demands.<a name=45:10></a> On the other hand if you think God is tolerant of evil and will go on in unending patience with the things that men allow, you are making a false image of God, such as the golden calf, as though that were a true representation of God, as though God would tolerate anything.<a name=45:11></a> Neither is true.<a name=45:12></a> "The Son of God has come that we should know him that is true", we should have the true image of God as seen in Jesus.<a name=45:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He says, "thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=45:14></a> He had come here to express God in absolute perfection.<a name=45:15></a> I love to think of the gospels from that angle, that everything that Jesus said, everything He did, and every feeling that He expressed, was God in expression.<a name=45:16></a> So that if I see Him in the house of Matthew sitting at table with publicans and sinners, He was expressing God; He was fulfilling all righteousness.<a name=45:17></a> God had feelings of kindness and love to men, and it came into view in Jesus; "the kindness and love to man of our

		Saviour God appeared".<a name=46:1></a> It is righteous, it is righteousness, to express that to men.<a name=46:2></a> Then, think of Him in the temple denouncing the Pharisees: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites .<a name=46:3></a>.<a name=46:4></a>.<a name=46:5></a> serpents, offspring of vipers, how should ye escape the judgment of hell?<a name=46:6></a>" They too were the feelings of God.<a name=46:7></a> It was God in expression; you can see it as you go through the gospels; God in expression in the One who is God's image.<a name=46:8></a> And that is true now; all that was expressed in Him here is now expressed in Him in radiant glory.<a name=46:9></a> But to bring that glory into expression in such a manner that men could find their home in it involved His death.<a name=46:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gospel of Matthew records the severity of the sufferings of Christ, what He endured, what it meant to Him to fulfil all righteousness, to bring in the full and true expression of God -- sin having come in.<a name=46:13></a><a name=46:11></a> It meant His death; it meant the atoning sufferings; it meant His bearing our sins in His body on the tree.<a name=46:14></a><a name=46:12></a> It meant that He was made sin for us, God made Him who knew not sin to be sin for us; and in that scene of darkness, as our hymn says, 'God is light I also see' (<a href=".<a name=46:15></a>.<a name=46:16></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=46:17></a>htm#212:2">Hymn 212</a>).<a name=46:18></a> In that great work on the cross God shone out in love which is His nature, and in His attributes of holiness and righteousness in an absolute sense.<a name=46:19></a> In fact in that scene at Calvary we see all the radiance of God's glory come into display.<a name=46:20></a> And it is now all resplendent in the face of Jesus, the One who died there; Jesus suffered in that way; it became Him thus to fulfil all righteousness.<a name=46:21></a> If God was to be fully expressed and if there were to be results for God, then Jesus must identify Himself with us as He did in that baptism.<a name=46:22></a> There, where were the repentant remnant, He Himself came, to be baptised.<a name=46:23></a> John said, "I have need to be baptised of thee and comest thou to me?<a name=46:24></a>" But Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=46:25></a> To bring in the true expression of God, to be truly the

		image of God in the universe, this involved that Jesus must identify Himself with us as He did with that remnant, and must do so, in going into death as taking up our case.<a name=47:1></a> But there is response secured by such grace.<a name=47:2></a> We thankfully recognise that we are become identified with Him in the likeness of His death -- that is baptism -- so that we now give no more place to our old man who was crucified with Him.<a name=47:3></a> That is the initial response that grace begets in our hearts, the grace that took Him into death.<a name=47:4></a> And then as we sang in our hymn

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus was unique, of course, because in the volume of the book it was written of Him, "To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and thy law is within my heart".<a name=47:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:8">Psalm  40:8</a>) God's purpose centred in Him.<a name=47:11></a> He came on a mission and, for Him, all righteousness involved the accomplishment of what He came to do.<a name=47:12></a> He came that there might be those redeemed by Him who would be baptised by the Holy Spirit and with fire.<a name=47:13></a> He came that the one body might be formed on this earth.<a name=47:14></a> He came in order that God might have a <i>dwelling</i> place -- His cry in His atoning sufferings: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=47:15></a>" is from the Psalm where He prophetically goes on to say: "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel".<a name=47:16></a> Jesus came and wrought redemption that Jew and Gentile might be brought together, baptised by the Spirit, into one body and that thus God might have His house down here, a habitation of God in the Spirit, that God might have praises.<a name=47:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Christ's mission was unique.<a name=47:18></a> But then I want to apply this to us and to show what our obligations are in love and in further response to grace.<a name=47:19></a> A verse that is especially on my mind in that connection is the verse we ended with in chapter 5: "Blessed they

	<div class="paragraph">
		who hunger and thirst after righteousness", and I trust the word tonight will help each one of us to hunger and thirst after righteousness.<a name=48:1></a> It really means in one sense that this matter is consuming the whole of one's being; and the Lord says blessed are such.<a name=48:2></a> Well, as I remarked, the Lord uttered those words "in the volume of the book it is written of me", referring to the holy obligations that rested on Him, as having come to do God's will.<a name=48:3></a> But then He came and made that sacrifice supreme that there might be formed on this earth the one body, that there might be here a habitation of God in the Spirit, and this itself involves obligations so far as we are concerned.<a name=48:4></a> You see, we are apt to limit righteousness as regards ourselves to our obligations to our fellowmen, to be upright in our family and business relations; but our obligations as Christians, subjects of divine grace, are far greater than that.<a name=48:5></a> If the Lord Jesus having come to do the holy will of God delivered Himself up in death that there might be here the one body and God's habitation in the Spirit, we having part, through grace, in these supremely great results, <i>it is incumbent on us to hold this ground</i>.<a name=48:6></a> If we love righteousness, and hunger and thirst after it, all this would lead us to recognise the prime obligations that lie upon us to answer and hold to these great and blessed truths.<a name=48:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness puts God first, and His claims; thus we treasure what is precious to Him, and do not let go what has cost Christ so much to bring about.<a name=48:8></a> So do not let us, dear brethren, in any way surrender these precious truths.<a name=48:9></a> We form part of that one body, as baptised in the power of one Spirit, and of God's habitation, so how can we compromise with sectarianism in any way?<a name=48:10></a> No sect has the Christian altar.<a name=48:11></a> We can truly say "We have an altar".<a name=48:12></a> That is not a sectarian altar.<a name=48:13></a> It stands related to the house of God, what He has established here.<a name=48:14></a> If we allow,

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what is in the Lord's mind for each one of us; so the Lord finishes this gospel by saying, "teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you".<a name=49:7></a> I quoted the scripture as to the Lord Himself "in the volume of the book it is written of me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:7">Psalm  40:7</a>) -- the book of God's purpose I suppose -- and He came, and carried through all that was written of Him.<a name=49:8></a> And now what is written for us?<a name=49:9></a> "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you".<a name=49:10></a> Have you got the Lord's commandments?<a name=49:11></a> "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me".<a name=49:12></a> The Lord is not laying it upon you as a condition of salvation; He has saved you; He has died for you; He represents you in the presence of God; He secures your place up there.<a name=49:13></a> Now, He says, "If you love me keep my commandments".<a name=49:14></a> It is the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Why not prove these things?<a name=50:12></a> "His commandments are not grievous".<a name=50:13></a> The believer loves the idea of it, he loves righteousness, and as I say, our supreme duty is to express God, and His mind and will, which means expressing Christ, and surely it is a pleasure to express Christ.<a name=50:14></a> I would like to express Christ to every Christian on earth, but I will not help him if I go in a bye-way that he is treading.<a name=50:15></a> But I can express Christ to him, I can skew the love of Christ to him; I cannot walk in his path, I would not help him if I did, and I would not help myself, and I would not be doing my duty to God; but I can shew the love of Christ to him.<a name=50:16></a> And it is the same to men generally, it is my duty as a Christian to represent God, to shew the kindness and love of our Saviour God to men, not to come down to their level in any way, but to glorify God in shewing His kindness and love to men.<a name=50:17></a> Let us do it more; let us be more kind and loving to men, and shew the kindness and love of our Saviour God to them;
