		I wish to speak of the Person of Christ, of John's witness and, finally, of the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who spoke the words, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".<a name=3:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When reading the gospel of John, whatever part we are reading, we should never lose sight of the first three verses, which assert in unequivocal terms the deity of Christ.<a name=3:2></a> As we proceed in the gospel we find Him in a subject position, speaking in the perfection of manhood here, and we delight in all that is expressed in Him thus, but we must never leave out of our minds those first three verses.<a name=3:3></a> The Person we are contemplating in perfect manhood, in perfect obedience, is there described.<a name=3:4></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=3:5></a> He was in the beginning with God.<a name=3:6></a> All things received being through him".<a name=3:7></a> These are amazing statements.<a name=3:8></a> He never began to be, He always was; but all things began to be through Him and without Him not one thing began to be which exists.<a name=3:9></a> That is a sobering thought for all of us, because each one of us here began to be through Him.<a name=3:10></a> If we think of this, can we do other than worship Him?<a name=3:11></a> These verses state in a most emphatic way that He is the great I AM, the great self-existent One.<a name=3:12></a> All else owes its existence to Him.<a name=3:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Similarly, in reading the book of Revelation, in whatever way the Lord may be presented, we must never overlook one of His final assertions in the book.<a name=4:1></a> He says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:13">Revelation  22:13</a>.<a name=4:2></a> The One who said it is the One who said, "Behold, I come quickly", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:12">Revelation  22:12</a>.<a name=4:3></a> If we hold this truth in our minds we shall be preserved worshipfully in relation to the Person of Christ.<a name=4:4></a> It will not detract from the reality of His manhood, because, if such a Person is found in figure as a Man, He must be absolutely perfect in the condition into which He came.<a name=4:5></a> He could not be other than absolutely perfect in any position or relationship He might be pleased to take up.<a name=4:6></a> Thus, if the Word became flesh, as He has done, and if He became dead, as He has done, and if He is now living to the ages of ages, as He is, we see in Him manhood in absolute perfection, without a flaw in any way; and we delight in Him as Man because all our blessing depends upon His having become flesh, His having become dead, and His living again to the ages of ages.<a name=4:7></a> But, while we delight in every feature and every glory that attaches to Him in manhood, if we remember who He is, we shall be preserved from ever bringing Him down in our minds to our level.<a name=4:8></a> We shall be preserved from taking advantage of the condition into which He has been pleased to come (and I do not refer only to His condition when here in humiliation, but also to His glorified condition), to deprive Him of the honour and glory due to Him in Deity.<a name=4:9></a> If we fail to give Him the homage that is due to Him in His Person, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		involves prostration before Him, we shall surely make shipwreck.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, if we consider the way He is presented to us -- "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father)" we see sonship in Him in perfection and uniqueness.<a name=5:2></a> He is <i>the</i> Son, and He is referred to as "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father".<a name=5:3></a> He has been pleased to raise us up, as it were, to the level of association with Him, but never to the level of equality with Him.<a name=5:4></a> Impossible!<a name=5:5></a> We are brought into the relation of sons, but never to be on equality with Him, dear brethren.<a name=5:6></a> He is <i>the</i> Son, and the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=5:7></a> He says at the close of the gospel, "I ascend".<a name=5:8></a> Who else could say that?<a name=5:9></a> "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God".<a name=5:10></a> Marvellous thing that He should say, "go to my brethren".<a name=5:11></a> He is pleased to raise us to that status, to acknowledge us as His brethren.<a name=5:12></a> Through divine grace we are men of His order, born of God, born of the Spirit.<a name=5:13></a> So He says, "go to my brethren", but let us not bring Him down to our level.<a name=5:14></a> He is the Firstborn; He is the One who can say, "I ascend to my Father (that is unique to Himself) and your Father, and to my God (unique to Himself) and your God".<a name=5:15></a> If we think of Him as singing praise in the midst of the assembly, let us not in our minds, bring Him in any way down to our level.<a name=5:16></a> If He is singing praise in the midst of the assembly, He is doing so as the One who is Head of the assembly, and Head over all things to it.<a name=5:17></a> Even the persons

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture is careful in referring to His manhood; and we need to be careful, not in any way to limit Him to manhood.<a name=6:10></a> Scripture speaks freely of His manhood; for Jesus is truly Man.<a name=6:11></a> He Himself says, "but now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:40">John  8:40</a>.<a name=6:12></a> Scripture also speaks of "the <i>man</i>, Christ Jesus", and yet the Spirit of God guards the truth of His Person with care.<a name=6:13></a> The Lord Jesus delights to call Himself the Son of man, as we know, but in the description in the first of Revelation it says, "one like the Son of man", and so in Ezekiel "a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it" (chapter 1: 26), that is, upon the throne.<a name=6:14></a> I am not wanting to weaken the truth of the manhood of Christ at all, only that we need care not to bring Him

		down to a mere human level.<a name=7:1></a> Though we are men of His order through grace, we <i>shall never be more than men</i>.<a name=7:2></a> But the Lord Jesus is unique because of who He is.<a name=7:3></a> We shall never be more than men, the most blessed of men, glorified men, nearest of all creatures to Him.<a name=7:4></a> But let us not take advantage of that nearness to belittle the unique glory that is His, or, in any way, to speak in uncomely familiarity to Him or about Him.<a name=7:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>it says that Christ Jesus "did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God".<a name=7:6></a> In the gospel of John He made statements which implied equality with God.<a name=7:7></a> In fact He says to His enemies, "Before Abraham was, I am", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:58">John  8:58</a>.<a name=7:8></a> We are free to speak of Him as Man because He is the true Man, but, in a passage which is stressing His Person, it says, "taking his place in the likeness of men; and having been found in figure as a man", this because His Person never changed.<a name=7:9></a> The condition is changed; He was here in flesh in humiliation, He is now in glorious manhood in another condition, but His Person is unchanged all the way through and that is what we have to hold in our minds and hearts.<a name=7:10></a> "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a>.<a name=7:11></a> However highly we are raised up by God and ennobled, we are still men and only men.<a name=7:12></a> <i>He</i> is the Man Christ Jesus, but who is He?<a name=7:13></a> He is the great I AM.<a name=7:14></a> Thank God He has taken His place in the likeness of men in humiliation here, and now as Man in glory.<a name=7:15></a> We can never thank God enough for it, but let us render to Him at all times the honours that are His.<a name=7:16></a>

		Now I go on to speak of the witness of John.<a name=7:17></a> He is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not called the baptist because this gospel is not stressing his service but the person.<a name=8:1></a> John is brought forward as a sample minister, though he does not belong to this dispensation.<a name=8:2></a> He becomes an example for us of the features of a true minister of Christ.<a name=8:3></a> The Word had become flesh.<a name=8:4></a> What was required in a minister of such a One?<a name=8:5></a> It is set out in John, a man sent from God.<a name=8:6></a> That is the first requirement in the minister -- that he should be sent from (or "from with") God.<a name=8:7></a> "The Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=8:8></a> If a man is sent from God, he will have an understanding -- in so far as the creature is able -- of the greatness of the Person to whom he is bearing witness.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So John, when they come to him, makes nothing of himself at all; and, dear brethren, that is the point for us in these days.<a name=8:10></a> This is not the time to make anything of men, as men.<a name=8:11></a> We are reaching the end of the dispensation.<a name=8:12></a> John's gospel was written for the end, and the great thing is to make everything of Christ; that is the point for the moment, so that <i>He</i> might shine in all His radiance before the hearts of the saints.<a name=8:13></a> Let no one get in the way to prevent the shining of Christ undimmed upon the saints: "his countenance as the sun shines in its power", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:16">Revelation  1:16</a>.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They come to John and say, "Thou, who art thou?<a name=8:15></a>" He could have said quite truly, I am a man sent from God, but he "acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged".<a name=8:16></a> How definite he was about it!<a name=8:17></a> There was no hesitation, not a little bit of reserve that would claim just a little recognition, just a little flattery, a little place.<a name=8:18></a> Nothing of that kind at all!<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He "acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ".<a name=9:1></a> As if to say, Do not look at me: I am only here to point you to Someone else.<a name=9:2></a> "And they asked him, What then?<a name=9:3></a> Art thou Elias?<a name=9:4></a> And he says, I am not.<a name=9:5></a> Art thou the prophet?<a name=9:6></a> And he answered, No.<a name=9:7></a> They said therefore to him, Who art thou?<a name=9:8></a>" The answer literally is, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness".<a name=9:9></a> That is all he was; just a voice.<a name=9:10></a> The voice would not get in the way of the glory of Christ's shining; it is persons who get in the way.<a name=9:11></a> John was just a voice, and the Lord would help us to be like that, dear brethren: to be voices to point to Christ, so that there might be nothing to obscure His shining; that the saints might not be occupied with the vessel, but with the One to whom the vessel bears witness.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So he says, "I baptise with water.<a name=9:13></a> In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose".<a name=9:14></a> He was not worthy to be a slave of such a Person!<a name=9:15></a> It was the slave's duty to unloose the sandal, and here is a man who said, I am not even worthy to be a slave to the Person I am bearing witness to.<a name=9:16></a> If we have an appreciation of who Jesus is, this will be the language of our hearts.<a name=9:17></a> We are not even worthy to be slaves!<a name=9:18></a> Think of who the Person is!<a name=9:19></a> Who am I to be the slave of One like that?<a name=9:20></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .<a name=9:21></a>.<a name=9:22></a>.<a name=9:23></a> and the Word became flesh".<a name=9:24></a> John would have counted it the greatest honour to be allowed to stoop down and unloose the Lord's sandal.<a name=9:25></a> That is the spirit in which we are called upon to take up our witness.<a name=9:26></a> This is the witness of John.<a name=9:27></a> Are we

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		going to be behind John?<a name=10:1></a> We are more favoured than he: we know the Lord better than he did; are we going to be behind him in our witness?<a name=10:2></a> Are we to obtrude into the picture?<a name=10:3></a> Or are we taking the view that we are not even worthy to be slaves?<a name=10:4></a> Thank God we may be slaves!<a name=10:5></a> The Lord will accept us as His slaves, but we could not say that we are worthy of it.<a name=10:6></a> If we think of the Lord as the great Warrior, coming forth riding upon a white horse, and "upon his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords", who would not count it an honour to unloose the thong of His sandal?<a name=10:7></a> What a mercy it is that we are allowed to be His slaves!<a name=10:8></a> What an honour!<a name=10:9></a> What a privilege!<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So John's witness goes on.<a name=10:11></a> He says, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=10:12></a> He knows how to present the Person effectively in a way that would be most calculated to reach the heart and meet the need.<a name=10:13></a> "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=10:14></a> Who else could do it?<a name=10:15></a> Who else but the One who is the I AM become flesh for this great sacrificial work?<a name=10:16></a> John says, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me".<a name=10:17></a> Colossians says, "He is before all, and all things subsist together by him.<a name=10:18></a> And he is the head of the body, the assembly", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:17">Colossians  1:17</a>, 18.<a name=10:19></a> Who would not worship Him?<a name=10:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, "John bore witness saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.<a name=10:21></a> And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=11:1></a> And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God".<a name=11:2></a> Now you have another title; John's witness is that He is the Son of God and that He baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=11:3></a> He brings in life for men, but as for Himself, the Spirit descends as a dove and <i>abides</i> upon Him, indicating the Spirit's delight in this blessed Person.<a name=11:4></a> I love to think of what it means to the Father and to the Spirit that the Word has become flesh, and that Jesus is now a glorified Man.<a name=11:5></a> I delight to think of what it means to the Father to have One, who in manhood is the Son of His love, the delight of His heart, the image of the invisible God; the glorious Centre of God's universe!<a name=11:6></a> And then what it meant to the Spirit, and what it still means to the Spirit; the affections of the Spirit so drawn out that He descended and abode upon Him!<a name=11:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a witness this was on the part of John!<a name=11:8></a> A witness to the greatness of the Person and to men coming into the greatest possible blessing through Him; the sin of the world to be taken away, and men to be baptised with the Holy Spirit.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in chapter 3: 28, he says, "Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.<a name=11:10></a> He that has the bride is the bridegroom"; he brings out another great title, the Bridegroom.<a name=11:11></a> How wonderful that a divine Person should in manhood be the Bridegroom!<a name=11:12></a> How attractive to our hearts!<a name=11:13></a> How did John know about the bride and the Bridegroom?<a name=11:14></a> He was let into the secret: he was the friend of the Bridegroom.<a name=11:15></a> Bondmanship leads to friendship.<a name=11:16></a> He did not count himself

		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		worthy to be a bondman, but the Lord, the Bridegroom, made him His friend, and John, I suppose, knew about the bride and the Bridegroom before any other human being.<a name=12:1></a> He says, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom; this my joy then is fulfilled".<a name=12:2></a> His whole heart's satisfaction lay in the fact that the Bridegroom had come and that He had the bride.<a name=12:3></a> He, the friend, had heard His voice, and he says, "He must increase, but I must decrease.<a name=12:4></a> He who comes from above is above all".<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the word for us, dear brethren, "<i>He must increase</i>".<a name=12:6></a> That is the word for the close of the dispensation.<a name=12:7></a> The Lord is about to come, and the Spirit's concern in present ministry is surely to cause His glory to shine in its radiance before the brethren, and that nothing should obstruct the shining.<a name=12:8></a> "He must increase, but I must decrease".<a name=12:9></a> It is a question of the Christ shining directly into, and capturing, every heart in view of the rapture, in view of the appearing, in view of the Bridegroom having the bride.<a name=12:10></a> Are we going to distract attention from the Bridegroom?<a name=12:11></a> John the baptist did not.<a name=12:12></a> Think of obtruding ourselves between the bride and the Bridegroom, and thus robbing the Bridegroom of His portion!<a name=12:13></a> Who could think of such a thing?<a name=12:14></a> It would be abhorrent to John the baptist.<a name=12:15></a> How much more so should it be with us who form part of the bride.<a name=12:16></a> We should not only emulate John the baptist, but go beyond him in self-effacement, in our concern that the Bridegroom should have the bride without any obstruction or

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		distraction whatever.<a name=13:1></a> We want every eye and every heart to be fixed on Him, "He must increase".<a name=13:2></a> Let Him do so, dear brethren, until He comes and fills us for all eternity.<a name=13:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the other John, the disciple that Jesus loved.<a name=13:4></a> We have been occupied with him as the bondman in Revelation, as it says at the beginning of the book, "he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John".<a name=13:5></a> What a favour it would be if the Lord could speak of any one of us like that!<a name=13:6></a> John wanted no other place.<a name=13:7></a> He never calls himself an apostle.<a name=13:8></a> I am not suggesting that either Peter or Paul called themselves apostles for any selfish reason.<a name=13:9></a> They certainly did not; they both called themselves bondmen and put the word 'bondman' in front of 'apostle' when using both; but John never speaks of apostleship.<a name=13:10></a> He is just "his bondman John", and because he was Christ's bondman he was, in a peculiar way, His friend.<a name=13:11></a> The John we have spoken about already was the friend of the Bridegroom, but the John we are speaking about now, was, in a special way, the friend of Christ.<a name=13:12></a> That is what is implied in the passage we have read.<a name=13:13></a> "Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?<a name=13:14></a>" In chapter 13 it is also said that he was in the bosom of Jesus.<a name=13:15></a> That is the place of friendship.<a name=13:16></a> Friendship with divine Persons is a wonderful thing; it is altogether on a different level from friendship as commonly spoken of amongst men.<a name=13:17></a> Friendship, in the divine sense, means a bosom friend; the secrets of the bosom are confided to such.<a name=13:18></a> How is it the Lord
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=14>[Page 14]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		can confide secrets to persons?<a name=14:1></a> Because they are truly bondmen: He can trust His bondmen, He makes them His friends.<a name=14:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So here it says, "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=14:3></a> That is how John refers to himself.<a name=14:4></a> Jesus loved all the disciples, but this one knew His love in a surpassing way.<a name=14:5></a> As a matter of time, this was written after the Revelation.<a name=14:6></a> He is the bondman in Revelation, but in writing the gospel he says, "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=14:7></a> It is referred to four times.<a name=14:8></a> Three times he uses the basic word for love as here, 'the settled disposition', but on one occasion he uses the love of friendship -- "the disciple to whom Jesus was attached".<a name=14:9></a> The remarkable thing is that, at the end, Peter turns round and sees this one following.<a name=14:10></a> What a remarkable thing!<a name=14:11></a> John had been following all the way and Peter looks round and sees him following.<a name=14:12></a> It was so evident that he was following that Peter took account of it.<a name=14:13></a> Here was one who was following.<a name=14:14></a> The Lord Jesus had said to Peter, "Follow me", and Peter looks round and sees someone doing it: John was doing it.<a name=14:15></a> So Peter says to the Lord, "Lord, and what of this man?<a name=14:16></a> Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=14:17></a> <i>Follow thou me</i>".<a name=14:18></a> Those are the last words of the Lord in this gospel That would be the Lord's command to each one of us here, "Follow thou me".<a name=14:19></a> Who could think of disobeying a command like this when we think of who He is!<a name=14:20></a> Think of those first three verses of the gospel again, and of whom it is saying, "Follow thou me".<a name=14:21></a> Do not look at other people: do not be concerned with what others do: "Follow <i>thou</i> me".<a name=14:22></a> But John was already
