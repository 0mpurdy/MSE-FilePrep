		G.R.<a name=7:1></a>C.<a name=7:2></a> It is in mind in these meetings to consider the headship of Christ as leading to the headship and supremacy of God.<a name=7:3></a> One feels sure that the Spirit of God will help in the enquiry because the truth of headship is so much needed and, one feels for oneself, so little known.<a name=7:4></a> I think we would all recognise that God's place in the universe must be that of head, and the incoming of sin has raised a challenge as to that, so that while God remains head, He cannot be other than head, yet His headship is disregarded in the world.<a name=7:5></a> But we wait for a "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness", and righteousness involves that God's place should be recognised and fully accepted by every intelligent creature.<a name=7:6></a> Then it is a great thing to see that headship under God is committed to man, not to angels.<a name=7:7></a> Angels have had a place in connection with the maintenance of the rights of God and in representing God, but it would appear that the idea of headship as under God has been reserved for man, that order of being, and angels recognise that.<a name=7:8></a> Angels are referred to in our third scripture, and we shall find that they are referred to in scriptures that we may consider later.<a name=7:9></a> The unfallen angels carry out God's will without question, and they do not question God's purpose as to man.<a name=7:10></a> So at the outset God said, "Let us make <i>man</i>" -- a very important statement in connection with the purpose of God as to man.<a name=7:11></a> There is no statement like that about anything else in the creation.<a name=7:12></a> It does not say 'Let us make light', or 'Let us make cattle', but God said, "Let us make man, in our image, after our likeness".<a name=7:13></a> This brings us in a

		primary sense to what God's thought is as to man; God was to be represented in a full way in His creation, but it was to be through man -- Adam, of course, being but a figure of Him that was to come, and the figure pales into insignificance when compared with the One of whom he is a figure.<a name=8:1></a> Adam's dominion was over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the heavens and over the cattle and over the whole earth, but the dominion of the Son of Man extends to heaven and earth.<a name=8:2></a> He is "head over all things".<a name=8:3></a> God was not primarily occupied with Adam but with Christ, even at the beginning.<a name=8:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it might be well to say that while scripture begins with God and man, later in this book the thought of Father and Son comes in in Abraham and Isaac, because for God to be fully known in His nature and attributes, revelation and relationship were necessary.<a name=8:5></a> Finally, in David and Solomon the two thoughts of manhood and sonship combine.<a name=8:6></a> That is, we see God's full thought, as far as the types could give it, as to man in David and Solomon, both being in the place of sonship typically, but filling out headship in a glorious way.<a name=8:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought this morning we might think of the initial features of headship seen in Genesis; of the way the Lord Jesus has laid the moral basis for His own headship in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, and then the general principles of headship in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>-- that is, the woman and the man and God, the order.<a name=8:8></a>

		G.R.<a name=8:18></a>C.<a name=8:19></a> I think so.<a name=8:20></a> It is a "new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness", and the One who has brought it into being says, "Behold, I make all things new".<a name=8:21></a> It is new <i>creation</i> and God in His supremacy.<a name=8:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=9:8></a>C.<a name=9:9></a> I am sure that is right, and in that connection a vessel is being formed which appreciates Christ's headship as no other ever could or will.<a name=9:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=9:13></a>C.<a name=9:14></a> I think that would link with the outshining of God.<a name=9:15></a> Paul speaks of "the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God" -- that is a touch of headship.<a name=9:16></a> Christ is the image of God, and there is the radiancy of glory connected with that, and we have to keep in mind that that title, 'the Christ', links with headship.<a name=9:17></a> No doubt the title 'the Christ' will Come before us as these meetings proceed, for it is a title that we need to give great consideration to.<a name=9:18></a>

		E.J.<a name=9:19></a>B.<a name=9:20></a> What is involved in the word "in our image"?<a name=9:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=9:22></a>C.<a name=9:23></a> Well, is it not needful for God to be expressed and represented, because He is the invisible God?<a name=9:24></a> The Lord Jesus is said to be the "image of the invisible God", and God ever remains invisible, "whom no man has seen, nor is able to see".<a name=9:25></a> Therefore the need of image becomes apparent, because if God, who dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen nor is able to see, is to be apprehended intelligently in His creation, it can only be through an image, and the Christ is the image of the invisible God.<a name=9:26></a> There is a full representation of God in His moral character, in His nature and His attributes, in that blessed Person.<a name=9:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=10:3></a>S.<a name=10:4></a> The word in verse 26 is in the plural, "Let <i>us</i> make man in our image, after our likeness".<a name=10:5></a> Does that suggest that as to this matter Divine Persons took counsel together, do you think?<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=10:7></a>C.<a name=10:8></a> Well, it <i>may</i> leave room for that, but I am not quite clear about it.<a name=10:9></a> 'Elohim' in the Old Testament, the word normally used for 'God', is a plural word.<a name=10:10></a> The extraordinary thing is that in the Old Testament, which stresses that "Jehovah thy God is one Jehovah", a plural word is often used for God, but when you come to the New Testament, where God is declared as the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the singular is used for God.<a name=10:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, it is the "counsel of his own will", not the counsel of 'Their own will', so that I could not with certainty reply to your question.<a name=10:12></a> Mr.<a name=10:13></a> Taylor years ago said that this might be the plural of majesty, and this chapter has the majestic side in mind.<a name=10:14></a> It is 'Elohim', God in His supremacy, that is in mind, and yet a God who would be known; a God who would not remain, as it were, in unapproachable light, though ever dwelling there, but a God who would be known in one who is His image.<a name=10:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=10:16></a> At the end of verse 27 it refers to the singular pronoun, "in the image of God created he him".<a name=10:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=10:18></a>C.<a name=10:19></a> That is interesting, yet there is the "let us" and "our".<a name=10:20></a> But we have to keep in mind that counsel does not mean agreement like three human beings agreeing together; it is "the counsel of his own will".<a name=10:21></a> I think counsel implies the way things are worked out.<a name=10:22></a> Purpose is the objective.<a name=10:23></a> God purposes something, but then He works all things according to the counsel of His own will; He counsels with Himself, as it were, and works things out according to the counsel of His own will.<a name=10:24></a> In Deity, as I understand it, there is only one will.<a name=10:25></a> J.<a name=10:26></a>N.<a name=10:27></a>D.<a name=10:28></a> says there is one will and mind and purpose, although separate willing in the detail of divine operations.<a name=10:29></a> But in spite of all that I am saying, I am not shutting out that there may be some veiled allusion to the Trinity in the passage.<a name=10:30></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=11:1></a>C.<a name=11:2></a> Yes.<a name=11:3></a> So that, while there may be a veiled allusion to the Trinity, I think the plural of majesty has its place here, and I think we should avoid -- I speak subject to correction -- the idea of counsel as being agreement between persons, because I understand that God is One in will and purpose -- one in Essential Being.<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=11:5></a> May we not use the expression 'Divine Persons' too much, thus rather weakening the thought of the unity of the Godhead?<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=11:7></a>C.<a name=11:8></a> I think there is a danger of that.<a name=11:9></a> The word 'Persons' is useful in conveying what we mean as to the distinct activities of the Father and the Son and the Spirit, but I think it is well to limit the use of the words 'Divine Persons' as much as possible, and rather to speak of God.<a name=11:10></a> It is scriptural to speak of God.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=11:12></a> Is that again confirmed in Hebrews when it says of the Son, "who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power"?<a name=11:13></a> I was thinking of His glory, His substance and His power.<a name=11:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=11:15></a>C.<a name=11:16></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=11:17></a> It is God speaking, in Son.<a name=11:18></a> The One in whom He is speaking is the One we know as the Son, but it is God speaking.<a name=11:19></a> He is the brightness of God's glory; as you say, it puts it in the singular, and He is the expression of His substance.<a name=11:20></a> We can distinguish the Persons, but God is One in His Essential Being.<a name=11:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.G.<a name=11:22></a>B.<a name=11:23></a> When we come to the way that divine counsel is to be put into operation, is it not remarkable that the singular word is used?<a name=11:24></a> I was thinking of verse 18 of chapter 2 and again of verse 21.<a name=11:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=11:26></a>C.<a name=11:27></a> It is.<a name=11:28></a> "I will make him an helpmate", and yet it is Jehovah <i>Elohim</i> who is speaking.<a name=11:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=11:30></a> When you say that God is one, have you in mind that that is something more than what we refer to as unity?<a name=11:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=11:32></a>C.<a name=11:33></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=11:34></a> We can speak of the unity of the saints; we are set together in unity, but "God is one" is a stronger expression.<a name=11:35></a> It is oneness of Being, as I understand it.<a name=11:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=12:10></a>C.<a name=12:11></a> I would not apply it to Christ.<a name=12:12></a> I would not apply the word 'make' to Christ, but rather that God was bringing in an order of being according to His purpose.<a name=12:13></a> He had previously created angels but He was not making <i>man</i> then.<a name=12:14></a> But all was in view of the incarnation.<a name=12:15></a> The Lord Jesus was born of a woman.<a name=12:16></a> God was making the order of being in which in due time the Son would take His place, but as the Second Man, out of heaven.<a name=12:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=12:27></a>C.<a name=12:28></a> That is quite true, but then the greatness of this, do you not think, is that God was making an order of being in view of Christ becoming incarnate.<a name=12:29></a> God was preparing the way, as it were.<a name=12:30></a>

		Ques.<a name=12:31></a> I would like to ask what is involved in the words of the Lord Jesus, "a body hast thou prepared me".<a name=12:32></a> I wondered whether God had not something to do with the body that the Lord Jesus took?<a name=12:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=12:34></a>C.<a name=12:35></a> Quite so.<a name=12:36></a> I think it is good to bring that out, and it is another case where it is important to keep to the word of scripture, "a body hast thou <i>prepared</i> me".<a name=12:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can safely go as far as that, that a body was prepared for the Lord Jesus, and a body is essential; angels have not bodies, they are spirits.<a name=12:38></a> For headship, for image, a body is essential.<a name=12:39></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=48:23></a>C.<a name=48:24></a> The theme that has been before us is the headship of Christ, as making way for the headship and supremacy of God.<a name=48:25></a> In the first reading we considered in a general way the truth of headship, and noticed particularly that according to God's purpose headship under God has been given to <i>man</i> as an order of being, not to angels; and so when man is first mentioned in scripture the word is, "Let us make man In our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion", and it says, "God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them".<a name=48:26></a> This brings out typically the great truth of Christ's headship, Adam being a figure of Him to come, and also of the assembly's place with Him in the headship as united to Him.<a name=48:27></a> We dwelt at some length on the wonderful truth of image.<a name=48:28></a> The Lord Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the God who always will be invisible, but who is known in the One who is His image.<a name=48:29></a> We noted that it never says the Lord Jesus is in the likeness of God, because He <i>is God</i>.<a name=48:30></a> It would therefore be derogatory to speak of Him as in God's

		likeness.<a name=49:1></a> The saints have to be brought into God's likeness, to be properly representative, but the Lord Jesus is the image of God, because He is God.<a name=49:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second reading we considered in Ephesians the scope of Christ's headship, particularly having in mind the title 'the Christ', which implies the great and magnificent office or position into which He has been installed as Man, as the Lord's Anointed; and the mystery of God's will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself for the administration of the fulness of times, to head up all things in the Christ.<a name=49:3></a> It is God's good pleasure that the Christ should be the One in whom everything is headed up in heaven and earth, and He has placed Him above every principality and authority and power and dominion and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come, and given Him to be head over all things to the assembly which is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=49:4></a> We saw the bearing of that on the present time in chapter 3, where the assembly, as functioning under the headship of Christ as the true Solomon, displays the all-various wisdom of God to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies, not only in administrative matters but also in relation to the ascent, the service of God.<a name=49:5></a> An earthly principality saw Solomon's ascent, and there was no more spirit left in her, whereas the heavenly principalities are witnesses of the ascent of the true Solomon in connection with the service of praise in the assembly, so it says, "in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him".<a name=49:6></a> The Father would strengthen us in all these matters that <i>the Christ</i>, referring to His headship, should dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=49:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third reading we considered the special and the most sweet character of Christ's headship as relative to the assembly.<a name=49:8></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>indicates what He is to the assembly as head.<a name=49:9></a> "What is thy beloved more than another beloved?<a name=49:10></a>" Such an One as <i>He</i> is the head of the body, the assembly.<a name=49:11></a> We dwelt on His greatness in several aspects, particularly being detained on the thought of "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=49:12></a> Such an One is the head of the body.<a name=49:13></a> We also dwelt briefly on what the assembly is to Him according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we move on to consider the great subject of <i>God</i>, as presented by John -- the declaration of God in chapter 1 and the great end in view in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, where it says, "the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself" -- those words being particularly in mind, "<i>God himself</i>".<a name=50:4></a>.<a name=50:5></a>.<a name=50:6></a> "shall be with them, their God".<a name=50:7></a> "God himself" suggests the greatest intimacy that could be known between the Supreme Being and the creature.<a name=50:8></a> It is God Himself, the God who has been declared.<a name=50:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that the Gospel of John begins with very great stress on the Deity of Christ, lest we should in any way limit the thought of God.<a name=50:10></a> It does not begin 'in the beginning was God', but "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=50:11></a> Lower down it says, "No man has seen God at any time", which takes us back to that beginning.<a name=50:12></a> In that state of Deity no one has seen God at any time.<a name=50:13></a> But the verses which follow disclose the marvellous truth that that God has been declared.<a name=50:14></a>

		I have read a number of scriptures, dear brethren, but I have three thoughts in my mind: and that is to speak of the Lord Jesus as the Son of man, as the Son of Abraham and as the Son of David.<a name=96:1></a> In all those aspects of His manhood He was the subject of promise.<a name=96:2></a> Although the words read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>were said to the serpent, they came in the nature of a promise to mankind, and refer to the Lord Jesus as the Son of man, "he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel".<a name=96:3></a> Then Abraham was promised a seed in and through whom the blessing was to come, "in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves".<a name=96:4></a> The blessing was to come through the Son of Abraham.<a name=96:5></a> Thirdly, God promised David a son who would build God's house, and God said, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son" -- the glorious Son of David!<a name=96:6></a> And the passage we have read in the New Testament says that whatever promises of God there are, the yea and amen is in the Son of God, and that is the truth.<a name=96:7></a> No mere son of man could have fulfilled the promise of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>; the great truth is that the Son of man is the Son of God.<a name=96:8></a> No mere son of Abraham could have fulfilled the promise of blessing which was made to Abraham; the great truth is that the Son of Abraham is the Son of God.<a name=96:9></a> And no mere son of David could have built God's habitation; the truth is that the Son of David is the Son of God.<a name=96:10></a> So that whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the yea and in Him the amen for glory to God by us.<a name=96:11></a> The word to Mary in Luke is "That holy thing that shall be born shall be called Son of God";

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have begun with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a> because it brings in the full Name of God as now declared, to which we have all been baptised, and to which, in a peculiar way, the assembly stands related.<a name=106:4></a> The assembly both apprehends and responds to the declaration of God in a much fuller way than any other creature vessel.<a name=106:5></a> It is of the utmost importance, therefore, as approaching the subject of the assembly, to have in our minds the name of God as declared.<a name=106:6></a> It comes in the assembly gospel and the words are the words of the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=106:7></a> But while in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>He brings out the full name of God as declared, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>He greatly stresses the Person of the Holy Spirit; and you will remember that in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>His last words before leaving His own relate to the Holy Spirit.<a name=106:8></a> He says, "And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:49">Luke  24:49</a>.<a name=106:9></a> So that according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>the apostles were left with a very powerful objective presentation of the Holy Spirit.<a name=106:10></a> While the Lord Jesus in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>presents Himself living and also gives the Father fully the place that is His, yet He puts <i>great</i> stress upon the Holy Spirit, and we have to remember that He is dealing with what is foundational to the assembly.<a name=106:11></a> The names of the men to whom He is speaking appear

		G.R.<a name=141:14></a>C.<a name=141:15></a> Yes.<a name=141:16></a> Although Peter had this vision in order to clear the ground for Paul's ministry, yet Peter's commission -- he was the apostle of the circumcision -- was not the administration of the mystery, although he had the keys of the kingdom and was used to bring the Gentiles in, in the wisdom of God's ways.<a name=141:17></a> It was given to Paul to work out the truth of the assembly in its full conception; that is, as embracing Jew and Gentile and every type of man.<a name=141:18></a>

		assembly in the sphere of testimony.<a name=155:1></a> In the earlier part of Acts the activities were largely in the hands of the apostles, the foundation men; but now the structure is erected and the assembly as a living organism, a living structure, is functioning in its own dignity, and, as we may say, in its own precedence, because the assembly takes precedence over the greatest gifts, although it needs the gifts and their service.<a name=155:2></a> It is good to get a view of the dignity of the assembly as a living active vessel for God here in testimony, devoted to the interests of Christ.<a name=155:3></a> Chapter 11 refers to "the ears" of the assembly, and as she hears things which relate to the interests of her Husband her feelings are aroused and she takes action.<a name=155:4></a> It says, "the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas".<a name=155:5></a> Then chapter 12 refers to the prayers of the assembly.<a name=155:6></a> The assembly had a right valuation of Peter, and unceasing prayer was made by the assembly to God concerning him.<a name=155:7></a> The whole assembly in Jerusalem was praying.<a name=155:8></a> At least three local companies are mentioned in this chapter.<a name=155:9></a> There may have been a hundred meetings; the whole assembly was engaged in prayer and it results in angelic intervention, which we can count upon.<a name=155:10></a>

		In chapter 13 the assembly is the vessel in which the gifts are set and in which the Holy Spirit speaks authoritatively in His own sovereign right, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".<a name=155:11></a> The Lord Jesus had commissioned Saul for his great work at his conversion, as he tells Agrippa.<a name=155:12></a> But he did not go round telling people that the Lord had commissioned him; he waits until the Holy Spirit speaks in the assembly so that there can be no question about it.<a name=155:13></a> Persons claiming that the Lord has commissioned them, when the brethren know nothing about it, do not carry confidence.<a name=155:14></a> But the great apostle patiently pursued his service at Antioch as at the bottom of the list, esteemed, I suppose, as the least of the gifted men at Antioch at that time.<a name=155:15></a> Although he knew in his own soul what the Lord had called him to, he waited until the Holy Spirit's voice was heard in the assembly saying, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".<a name=155:16></a> Who could say anything against that?<a name=155:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great joy to speak of the King; the Psalmist might well say, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed -- or, 'my occupation' -- touching the king".<a name=195:2></a> The King is a wonderful occupation!<a name=195:3></a> The King, indeed, enraptures all our hearts as we come to know Him and apprehend His glories.<a name=195:4></a> He is the Beloved.<a name=195:5></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>is headed "A song of the Beloved".<a name=195:6></a> David's name means 'beloved'; Solomon's other name -- Jedidiah -- means 'beloved of Jehovah'.<a name=195:7></a> God's idea of a King is that He rules in the affections of His people -- He is the Beloved.<a name=195:8></a> Not that He is King over the assembly.<a name=195:9></a> If we think of an earthly king and queen, we do not think of the king as ruling over the queen; and yet no one appreciates the king as much as the queen.<a name=195:10></a> If the queen refers to <i>the king</i> you know whom she means; it is her husband, he is the king to her.<a name=195:11></a> That is how the church stands related to Christ: He is head over all things.<a name=195:12></a> He is truly God's King, but He is head over all things <i>to</i> the assembly.<a name=195:13></a> No company will ever have such an appreciation of the King as the assembly, The King is her Husband, and the fact that He is the King only enhances to her the wonder of His affection for her as Husband.<a name=195:14></a> It is wonderful to her to think that such a Person as the King needs her for the satisfaction of the affections of His heart, and also needs her as His consort in the glorious position which He occupies as King, and that He will not take up that position publicly until the queen is by His side.<a name=195:15></a> Now that is what is true as regards Christ

		and the assembly.<a name=196:1></a> At the present time He has left other things to be united to the assembly, and not till the assembly is complete and in glory at His side will He take up all the vast interests in a public way which pertain to Him as head over all things.<a name=196:2></a> The assembly will then share with Him in the headship.<a name=196:3></a> Thus no company has such an appreciation of the King as the assembly, because, to use the figure, she is the queen; and who values the king, even in a human royal family, like the queen?<a name=196:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the King is not only beloved to the assembly, He is beloved of God.<a name=196:5></a> God chose David, a man after His own heart, who would do all His will.<a name=196:6></a> How God loved David!<a name=196:7></a> He said, "I will make him firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:27">Psalm  89:27</a>.<a name=196:8></a> So the scripture says, "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:18">Matthew  12:18</a>.<a name=196:9></a> Think of God expressing Himself like that!<a name=196:10></a> And then, "I will put my Spirit upon him" -- that is the King.<a name=196:11></a> God says, as it were, 'I will anoint that Man because He is my Beloved, and My soul has found its delight in Him'.<a name=196:12></a> That is what the title 'the Christ' means.<a name=196:13></a> God has put His Spirit in its fulness upon one Man and one Man only.<a name=196:14></a> We share in the anointing, but the Spirit in its fulness is upon the Christ.<a name=196:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>says, "I have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness".<a name=196:16></a> The King in the Old Testament corresponds with "the Christ" in the New.<a name=196:17></a> He is the Anointed, God's beloved in whom His soul has found its delight, the Man after His own heart who will do all His will.<a name=196:18></a> God can trust Him fully and has put all power in His hands, assured that everything will be carried through according to His will.<a name=196:19></a> "The Christ" is an official title and relates to the highest office in the universe.<a name=196:20></a> We little realise -- we shall see it soon!<a name=196:21></a> -- the magnificence and splendour attaching to it; an office so great that, although it belongs to manhood, only a Person of the Godhead could fill it.<a name=196:22></a> So when Paul refers to the incarnation in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>he says, "of whom, as according to flesh, is <i>the Christ</i>, who is over all, God blessed for ever"; because no one who was not "over all, God blessed for ever" could ever sustain in manhood the glorious office of "the Christ".<a name=196:23></a> God says, "in whom my soul has found its

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>goes on to say, "Thou art my Son; I this day have begotten thee", and the great truth of Christianity is that this blessed Person who is the Christ is God's Son.<a name=197:4></a> Only a Person in the relation of sonship could fill out this great position.<a name=197:5></a> All that God had in His mind in purpose as to man finds expression in the Christ.<a name=197:6></a> In Him we see manhood in its fulness and glory according to God.<a name=197:7></a> Paul speaks of the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God.<a name=197:8></a> There is God's full thought of Manhood, but it is expressed in One who is in the relationship of Son.<a name=197:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>brings out the glories of Christ in a remarkable way, "I have anointed my king", then, "thou art <i>my Son</i>; I this day have begotten thee", and then in the last verse there is a word to the kings of the earth: "Kiss <i>the Son</i>", a title which especially brings before the soul His Deity.<a name=197:10></a> It is a remarkable opening to the Psalms.<a name=197:11></a> This blessed Person, who is the Son of God and the Christ of God, is <i>the Son</i> co-equal with the Father and with the Holy Spirit.<a name=197:12></a> "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry".<a name=197:13></a> We are on the eve of the time when that word will go out to the kings of the earth, because the time is at hand when no earthly ruler will be allowed to exercise any authority except that which he derives from God's King.<a name=197:14></a> The kissing of the hand, as we know, is an acknowledgment of royalty; in this country when the king appoints his ministers they kiss his hand.<a name=197:15></a> That is the idea.<a name=197:16></a> No earthly authorities will be allowed to exercise power unless they are prepared to kiss the Son and receive their power from Him.<a name=197:17></a> He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.<a name=197:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to speak a word as to what the assembly is to Christ according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=197:19></a> The Psalm opens, "To the chief Musician, Upon Shoshannim", and the word 'Shoshannim' means 'lilies'.<a name=197:20></a> This Psalm, which is a song of the Beloved, runs very closely along with the Song of Songs.<a name=197:21></a> The Song of Songs speaks of the Beloved, and the Beloved is the King.<a name=197:22></a> At the beginning of the Song the spouse says, "the king hath brought me into his chambers", and "while the king is at his table, my spikenard

		sendeth forth its fragrance".<a name=198:1></a> The Song of Songs also refers to lilies; it says more than once that the Beloved feeds among the lilies.<a name=198:2></a> There is a reference to the spouse too; she says, "I am the narcissus of Sharon, a lily of the valleys"; and He says, "as the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters".<a name=198:3></a> If the assembly is to be what she should be for Christ, the character suggested in the lily must mark her; and thus it must mark us all severally.<a name=198:4></a> The lily suggests purity, chastity and fragrance -- that alone is worthy of the King.<a name=198:5></a> It is what He looks for in His spouse, and the Spirit is here that these conditions might be found with us.<a name=198:6></a> It is impossible to nature, but in sanctification of the Spirit the saints become lilies, marked by purity, chastity and fragrance for the Beloved; and as we are marked severally in that way, with what pleasure He can look upon the assembly and say, "as the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters", and, "thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse".<a name=198:7></a> In such conditions the praises are set free, the Lord has His portion and we have our portion too.<a name=198:8></a> "He feedeth among the lilies".<a name=198:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"My heart is welling forth with a good matter; I say what I have composed touching the king.<a name=198:10></a> My tongue is the pen of a ready writer".<a name=198:11></a> I cannot go into the details of this Psalm, but I believe it provides abundant material for enlargement in our praises to the Lord Jesus because it views Him in so many settings: first in His moral excellencies and worth, "Thou art fairer than the sons of men"; secondly, in His military might and majesty, "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, in thy majesty and thy splendour"; thirdly, on the throne and wielding the sceptre, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom", the assembly recognising the truth of His Deity and worshipping Him accordingly.<a name=198:12></a> Yet, as so frequently happens in scripture, His Deity is set alongside His manhood, as it says, "thou has loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions".<a name=198:13></a> It is <i>the Person</i> we worship.<a name=198:14></a> It is not true to say that we worship Him as God and not as man.<a name=198:15></a> There is to be no such analysis of the Person of Christ.<a name=198:16></a> Following this the Psalm

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, which refers not so much to the assembly as <i>for</i> Christ, but as <i>with</i> Christ -- that is, as moving with Him.<a name=199:12></a> The heading is.<a name=199:13></a> "Upon Aijeleth-Shahar", which means, 'the hind of the morning'.<a name=199:14></a> As we know what it is to be with the King in the royal apartments, and as reciprocal affections between Christ and the assembly are satisfied, we are free to move with Him.<a name=199:15></a> This again links with the Song of Songs, where the Beloved is referred to more than once as "a gazelle or a young hart".<a name=199:16></a> The spouse says, "The voice of my beloved!<a name=199:17></a> Behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.<a name=199:18></a> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart", chapter 2: 8.<a name=199:19></a> The point of the Song of Songs is, Is she capable of moving <i>with</i> Him?<a name=199:20></a> Except when her state is bad she is glad to receive Him and to be for Him in His house of wine.<a name=199:21></a> But is she free to move upwards with Him?<a name=199:22></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>suggests the assembly in her perfect ability, as a vessel formed by the Spirit, to move with Christ.<a name=199:23></a> He is the gazelle or the young hart upon the mountains; she is the hind of the morning.<a name=199:24></a> So that if He moves she will not be left behind.<a name=199:25></a> She is well able to move

		G.R.<a name=239:1></a>C.<a name=239:2></a> Our theme in these readings is the praises of God in the Psalms, each book yielding its tribute of praise to Him to whom all praise is due, and we have already considered the first and second books.<a name=239:3></a> In the first book God is presented in relation to His purpose, the doxology at the close being, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity.<a name=239:4></a> Amen and Amen", and Christ is presented as the Man of His purpose.<a name=239:5></a> In the second book God is praised in connection with the <i>effectuation</i> of His purpose, "Blessed be Jehovah Elohim, the God of Israel, who alone <i>doeth</i> wondrous things!<a name=239:6></a>" It is a question of what He has done here and now in the scene of testimony, and what He will yet do in the day of display.<a name=239:7></a> So it says, "Blessed be His glorious name for ever!<a name=239:8></a> and let the whole earth be filled with His glory!<a name=239:9></a> Amen, and Amen", and the longings of the soul, expressed in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42">Psalm  42</a>, are completely satisfied, "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended".<a name=239:10></a> We saw in that book what the assembly is to Christ as the King in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>, and what it is to God as the great King in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48">Psalm  48</a>, the assembly being His city, where He is praised worthily.<a name=239:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering the third book we should note at the outset that the doxology at the close is to God personally.<a name=239:12></a> It is not God relative to His purpose nor to what He has done.<a name=239:13></a> The book ends with this simple yet moving outburst, "Blessed be Jehovah for evermore", and it unfolds His ways with the saints in order that we might come to a profound appreciation of the blessedness of God <i>Himself</i>: Thus the doxology is addressed to God in a personal way and the book unfolds His personal dealings with us and His provision for us, so that we might come into the truth substantially and experimentally.<a name=239:14></a> The earlier books have dealt with His purpose and the effectuation of it, but now it is a question of our being brought into the present gain of His purpose.<a name=239:15></a> The importance of this is apparent,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The book, therefore, begins with the experiences of a soul, but as bearing on God's general dealings with Israel, "Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are of a pure heart".<a name=240:3></a> Whatever appearances may seem, God is good and He has only good in view.<a name=240:4></a> And then he recounts his experiences, "As for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped", but at the end of the Psalm he can say, "Whom have I in the heavens?<a name=240:5></a> and there is none upon earth desire beside thee".<a name=240:6></a> That is the great end God has in view in His dealings with us.<a name=240:7></a> He is going to fill heaven with people to whom He is everything.<a name=240:8></a> God is going to be all in all.<a name=240:9></a> We can therefore understand that His operations at the present time are to reach with us the end that the Psalmist arrives at, "Whom have I in the heavens?<a name=240:10></a> and there is none on earth I desire beside thee.<a name=240:11></a> My flesh and my heart faileth; God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever".<a name=240:12></a> God will fill heaven with people who have learned to use language like that.<a name=240:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other Psalms bring out in more detail the tenderness of God's dealings with His people, first in leading them like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<a name=240:14></a> The book is not presenting Christ so much in what He effects for God, but rather as provided by God, in His tender consideration for us.<a name=240:15></a> So He leads His people in the wilderness like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron, and in the next Psalm He chose David and took him from the sheepfolds and brought him to feed Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance in the land.<a name=240:16></a> How considerate of God to raise up such a Person as this -- first as typified in Moses and Aaron, and then in David.<a name=240:17></a> Then the experience with God which this book contemplates leads us greatly to value the house of God, so that His house becomes our home; it becomes the most precious place on earth to the believer, more precious than his own home.<a name=240:18></a> "A day in thy courts is better than a thousand".<a name=240:19></a> That is <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84">Psalm  84</a>.<a name=240:20></a> And then His city becomes so precious to us that we speak

		The fourth book, I think, has in view days of recovery.<a name=258:3></a> In the exercises that mark days of recovery we learn God's faithfulness and unchangeableness.<a name=258:4></a> Whatever has happened amongst His people in the sphere of responsibility, He has never changed.<a name=258:5></a> So that an appreciation of God is wrought out in the souls of the saints in days of recovery that has its own special features.<a name=258:6></a> The book furnishes guidance for our exercises in such days.<a name=258:7></a> First of all, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90">Psalm  90</a>shows that we have to go back to first principles; it is the prayer of Moses, the man of God.<a name=258:8></a> Since we are in the Psalms it does not give his doctrine, but in going back to his doctrine, as typical of apostolic doctrine in our day, it is a great thing, also, to go back to his prayer and thus to his own view of God, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.<a name=258:9></a> Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God".<a name=258:10></a> This surely is the keynote to recovery.<a name=258:11></a> And then at the end of the Psalm there is the prayer, "Return, Jehovah", the covenant name, the name of relationship being used.<a name=258:12></a> That would be the earnest desire in days of recovery.<a name=258:13></a> We would return to God, but our prayer would be that He would return to us.<a name=258:14></a>

		Each passage we have read refers to God dwelling.<a name=292:1></a> According to the first passage He dwells in light unapproachable; it says of Him, "who only has immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might.<a name=292:2></a> Amen".<a name=292:3></a> Paul's heart is moved in worship to the God who dwells, in the self-sufficiency and greatness of His essential Being, in light unapproachable, entirely beyond the vision of the creature.<a name=292:4></a> It is remarkable that a worshipper should give expression to this, and I suppose only a worshipper could do so.<a name=292:5></a> Paul himself is the outstanding example of a worshipper in the New Testament.<a name=292:6></a> As he touches one truth after another, even while writing epistles, he breaks out in worship, showing what a constitutional worshipper he was.<a name=292:7></a> In Romans he has only to mention God as Creator, "the incorruptible God", as he calls Him, when his heart is moved to worship, and he says, "who is blessed for ever.<a name=292:8></a> Amen", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:23">Romans  1:23</a>, 25.<a name=292:9></a> And so later in that epistle, as he touches one important truth after another, he gives expression to a doxology.<a name=292:10></a> It is such a man as that who gives us this statement as to God, "dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see".<a name=292:11></a> How did Paul know about this?<a name=292:12></a> It does not say here that God is dwelling in thick darkness.<a name=292:13></a> That was so in Old Testament times, as far as <i>men</i> were concerned; but God in His absoluteness dwells in <i>light</i>, although it is unapproachable.<a name=292:14></a> It magnifies God in our minds and thoughts to know that He dwells in light, although it is entirely beyond us.<a name=292:15></a> What a marvellous thing

		I suppose we might think of God moving out from His place of seclusion, in the first instance, to act in creation.<a name=293:10></a> We are told that all things were made by and for the Son and that He upholds all things by the word of His power.<a name=293:11></a> "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse showeth the work of his hands", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a>.<a name=293:12></a> The immortal, invisible, incorruptible God began to express Himself in creation, "Framed with wondrous skill".<a name=293:13></a> He manifested His eternal power and divinity, and made known to the man He had made, His perfect goodness and beneficence in surrounding him with every tree that was pleasant to the eyes and good for food, and by putting the tree of life in the midst of the garden, showing that His mind for man was life.<a name=293:14></a> He made Himself known thus as the blessed God, and that is why Paul, when he speaks of Him in Romans as the Creator, says, "Who is blessed for ever.<a name=293:15></a> Amen", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:25">Romans  1:25</a>.<a name=293:16></a> Do we worship God, dear brethren, sufficiently as Creator?<a name=293:17></a> Paul says men have "changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an
