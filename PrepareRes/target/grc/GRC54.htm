		I wish to say a word, dear brethren, about God, the One who is the beginning and the end, and especially to speak of Him as the End, the great End, the great objective in all divine operations.<a name=1:1></a> God is the beginning and the end of everything.<a name=1:2></a> He is the beginning and the end with each one of us as to our soul histories.<a name=1:3></a> We begin with God, having to do with God about our sins, and if we move right on in the divine way, we end with God in profound worship, making our boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:4></a> While that word comes in in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, J.<a name=1:5></a>N.<a name=1:6></a>D.<a name=1:7></a> said that it is something we can never get beyond -- making our boast in God, God Himself, "through our Lord Jesus Christ", verse 11.<a name=1:8></a> I also wish to speak of the Mediator, "the mediator of God and men .<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a>.<a name=1:11></a> the man Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a> -- and the glory of the Mediator.<a name=1:12></a> Then also to refer to God's desires for men.<a name=1:13></a> "Our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:4">1 Timothy  2:4</a>.<a name=1:14></a> Now that word, "knowledge" means full knowledge.<a name=1:15></a> The note says "true knowledge" but it is also translated equally "full knowledge", as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:17">Ephesians  1:17</a>, where Paul bows his knee, "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ .<a name=1:16></a>.<a name=1:17></a>.<a name=1:18></a> would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the <i>full knowledge</i> of him".<a name=1:19></a> I don't know of anything in Scripture greater than the proposal that the creature, man, should come to the full knowledge of God.<a name=1:20></a> So God desires that all men should be

		saved -- but don't let us stop there -- and come to the <i>full knowledge</i> of the truth.<a name=2:1></a> The truth in large measure is summed up in what follows.<a name=2:2></a> "For God is one"; it is the great truth of the moment.<a name=2:3></a> God is one is an eternal truth.<a name=2:4></a> "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>.<a name=2:5></a> The point is to come to a <i>full knowledge</i> of what it means.<a name=2:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pause here a moment and refer to the fact that God desires all men to be saved -- it says, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:15">1 Timothy  1:15</a> -- and if <i>He</i> came into the world to save sinners, what are you and I in the world for?<a name=2:7></a> He had other objectives in mind.<a name=2:8></a> He came to secure the assembly for Himself, but He could not do that if He had not come to save sinners.<a name=2:9></a> So we may have other objectives, too, in being sent into the world, for the Lord says to the Father, "As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:18">John  17:18</a>.<a name=2:10></a> Our only right reason for being in the world is as having been sent into it; taken out of it by the gospel and then sent into it to represent God and to represent Christ in the world.<a name=2:11></a> However much we have failed in it and however little we have done it, let even the youngest believer here get some impression of that, that the reason for your being in the world is to be in it as sent into it.<a name=2:12></a> The gospel has taken you out of it.<a name=2:13></a> That is out of the world in its moral power as a system; so if you are in the world, the thing is to be in it as sent and as representative of Christ and of God.<a name=2:14></a>

		But when it comes to fellowship the command in this epistle is quite clear, "Lay hands quickly on no man, nor partake in others' sins", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:22">1 Timothy  5:22</a>.<a name=3:11></a> We can go a long way with people, but we must heed divine commands.<a name=3:12></a> The epistle, written for the benefit of the Ephesians, deals with the house of God in its public aspect and of what is due to God in His house which is "the pillar and base of the truth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=3:13></a> On the one hand God is to be represented as the Saviour, the Preserver, the Blessed and only Ruler.<a name=3:14></a> We are to let men know about Him, to get near to men to tell them about Him, this blessed God, and the way that we tell it, and the words that we speak are to convey <i>the glory of the blessed God</i>.<a name=3:15></a> Everything we do in testimony is to be according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=3:16></a> But then in God's house, what is due to Him is maintained.<a name=3:17></a> So in chapter 5 of this epistle, verses 21 - 22, "I testify before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, that thou keep these things without prejudice, doing nothing by favour.<a name=3:18></a> Lay hands quickly on no man, nor partake in others' sins".<a name=3:19></a>

		Chapter 1: 11 refers to the glad tidings of the <i>glory</i> of the blessed God.<a name=7:5></a> There you have Ephesians.<a name=7:6></a> The glory of the blessed God!<a name=7:7></a> What glad tidings!<a name=7:8></a> It has often been linked with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>; the shepherd going after the sheep, the woman sweeping the house, the father receiving the returning son.<a name=7:9></a> What a picture of the glory of the blessed God!<a name=7:10></a> How He has moved to save sinners, but not only to save them, but to give the best in heaven even to men who may have been the worst on earth.<a name=7:11></a> So that Ephesians shows that in the gospel there is not only the negative side that God would save sinners, but that He would do the very best, more than the human mind could conceive -- "bring out the best robe and clothe him in it", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:22">Luke  15:22</a>.<a name=7:12></a> What a love chapter the 15th of Luke is, God acting to satisfy His own love!<a name=7:13></a> So <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>speaks of the best robe -- "Taken into favour in the Beloved", verse 6, and it speaks of the "good pleasure of his will" that we should be "to the praise of the glory of his grace".<a name=7:14></a> Again later it says, "to the praise of his glory", verse 12 -- the glory of the blessed God.<a name=7:15></a> Everything in God's house is to be in keeping with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=7:16></a> Sound teaching is always in keeping with that.<a name=7:17></a> There are

		He is also referred to in this epistle as the "preserver of all men, specially of those that believe", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:10">1 Timothy  4:10</a>.<a name=8:7></a> We hope in Him in that way as the living God who is the Preserver of all men.<a name=8:8></a> If God was not moving in that connection, men would destroy themselves.<a name=8:9></a> But "we hope in a living God who is the preserver of all men, specially of those that believe".<a name=8:10></a> It is another way in which you are alongside of men.<a name=8:11></a> Paul, the chief of sinners, was alongside of every man from that standpoint.<a name=8:12></a> He could take his place along with any sinner, to speak of the need of a Saviour.<a name=8:13></a> Then as needing preservation, we can place ourselves alongside of men and tell them of a God who is preserving them, their very breath being in His hand, saving them from themselves and their folly, from self-destruction.<a name=8:14></a> "The preserver of all men, specially of those that believe".<a name=8:15></a> Finally in this epistle Paul praises Him as, "the blessed and only Ruler, King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, to speak a word or two about the scripture, "God is one".<a name=9:4></a> I would say that whereas the teaching of Ephesians, opening up our place in the heavenlies, specially links with the Lord's words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, the words of the Mediator, "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God", verse 17; this passage in Timothy links more with the words of the Mediator in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>, and the great unfolding connected with the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:5></a> Apart from that unfolding this word of Paul that, "God is one" would have no force.<a name=9:6></a> Even in the Old Testament they knew there was only one God but they did not know God as One.<a name=9:7></a> It is an expression that only has force when you come to the Christian unfolding of the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:8></a> The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are One in eternal Being in Godhead.<a name=9:9></a> And then the Mediator of God and men is also one, the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=9:10></a> No man has seen God at any time; "whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>.<a name=9:11></a> Therefore we need a Mediator.<a name=9:12></a> The Mediator is the image of the invisible God, because He is God.<a name=9:13></a> In Him God was <i>manifested</i> in flesh down here, and now God's glory shines forth in Him without a veil.<a name=9:14></a> It is wonderful in any measure, by the Spirit's power,

		Now to go on for a moment to Paul's commission.<a name=10:14></a> He says, speaking of the testimony, "to which I have been appointed a herald and apostle (I speak the truth, I do not lie) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:7">1 Timothy  2:7</a>.<a name=10:15></a> That also links in my mind, with the 28th of Matthew, "Go and make disciples of all nations", verse 19.<a name=10:16></a> No doubt that has an application to the Jewish remnant in the day to come.<a name=10:17></a> The word will go out to the kings of the earth, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, though his anger burn but a little", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:12">Psalm  2:12</a>.<a name=10:18></a> But there can be no doubt that the commission to the nations

		But now I want to say another word about God, and about the Mediator.<a name=12:17></a> There is another glory attached to Christ and that is that He is the Declarer of God.<a name=12:18></a> No apostle could declare God nor did; it was impossible.<a name=12:19></a> You say, Were not the apostles inspired?<a name=12:20></a> Indeed they were.<a name=12:21></a> But no inspired human vessel could declare God.<a name=12:22></a> The only begotten Son alone could do it and we need to give Him that glory and place in our minds, and to take great heed to what Jesus said about the Father and about Himself and about the Holy Spirit.<a name=12:23></a> Therein lies the declaration of God.<a name=12:24></a> The apostles had the ministry of the gospel to bring men into the gain of the declaration and, in that way, from the point of view of experience, they could

		I leave these exercises with us, dear brethren, as to the great truth that God is One, and to bear in mind that the doxologies in Romans -- three to God and one to Christ -- and the doxologies in Timothy, as well as others, are to help us as to assembly praise; and the more we know of the intimacy of the relations into which we have been brought through the declaration, the more we shall be qualified to render praise to God in accordance with these doxologies.<a name=14:6></a> I may add that, in connection with the relationships into which we are brought, the unfolding of God's name, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, was essential if we were to be brought into the place which is ours according to purpose, as accepted in the Beloved.<a name=14:7></a> Similarly every other family named of the Father will be brought into its place, not so great as that which the assembly has, not so near, not so blessed, but all on account of that unfolding, the unfolding of the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=14:8></a> The Name does not, in itself, suggest any
