		<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> - 37, 49 - 51
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> It is in mind to look at some chapters in John's gospel in connection with purification and life.<a name=1:3></a> We know that his gospel was probably the last book of scripture to be written, when much had come in from which the saints needed purifying.<a name=1:4></a> It is also written specially for these last days, when we are surrounded by corruption, and therefore by moral death, even in the sphere of Christian profession where life should be.<a name=1:5></a> So that the Holy Spirit presents the Lord and His ministry in this gospel with a view to purification.<a name=1:6></a> That is one of the great ends in view.<a name=1:7></a> As in all matters he touches, John has what is inward primarily in his mind.<a name=1:8></a> It is a question of inward purification.<a name=1:9></a> Outward purification must flow, if it is to be acceptable, from inward purification.<a name=1:10></a> Paul, of course, would have both in mind, but he stresses outward purification; in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a> he quotes the injunction "Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not what is unclean", because purification in its outward aspect involves separation, but follows that by saying "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#7:1">2 Corinthians  7:1</a>.<a name=1:11></a> Undoubtedly in that injunction he is including, not only the outward purification which necessitates separation, but what is inward.<a name=1:12></a> Similarly, in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:21">2 Timothy  2:21</a> he speaks of purification and separation, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these", (that is from vessels to dishonour) "in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to

		honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master".<a name=2:1></a> We cannot think of Paul having anything in mind other than that those who separate themselves do it as a result of what is inward.<a name=2:2></a> We have to take warning in that respect, from the remnant who returned from Babylon.<a name=2:3></a> They left Babylon and returned to the truth of the house and of the city, but, while there were those who maintained an outward separation, the inward thing lapsed.<a name=2:4></a> And so the bitterest enemies of the Lord in this gospel were those who were maintaining an outward separation -- the Pharisees -- but their inward parts were full of plunder and wickedness.<a name=2:5></a> We have to face this matter, because we have come out; we are positionally in purification through separation; but then we have to face the question as to whether our purification has begun from within, especially those of us who have been brought up in the meeting.<a name=2:6></a> If things are not worked out within, our separation becomes something which is very obnoxious, like the unclean beasts with the cloven hoof who did not chew the cud; there was nothing inward.<a name=2:7></a> So I think we can see the great importance, from this standpoint, of the gospel of John, because, if we take heed to it, we shall become purified persons inwardly, and a person purified inwardly could not be other than so outwardly; but the great thing is to get the inward matter right.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the gospel commences with this great presentation of the Person of Christ, for two reasons; first that we should be purified from every Philistine intrusion and speculation about His Person, and from every wrong thought of God; and secondly, the presentation is so great that if we really apprehend it, Christ will eclipse all others for us and we shall be purified as to our Object and motive.<a name=2:9></a> The first chapter thus stands out as very important in that respect, bringing in a most purifying presentation of the Person of Christ.<a name=2:10></a> Later in the chapter we get the

		marvellous scope of His work, taking away the sin of the world, and then the present aspect of His work, baptising with the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:1></a> At the close we see persons coming to Him, the gathering Centre, and His glories in dominion engage the heart.<a name=3:2></a> So this is a wonderful chapter.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We might consider first the glory of His Person, and the glory of His Person, in this gospel, links with "The Name" of the Old Testament.<a name=3:4></a> There are <i>names</i> and <i>titles</i> in the Old Testament, but the name of the only true God was "I am that I am".<a name=3:5></a> The creature's answer to that is "Jah", the One who is, and in revelation, "Jehovah"; but those three cognate words, "I am", "Jah", and "Jehovah", constituted the name of God as disclosed in the Old Testament, and this gospel links on with that.<a name=3:6></a> The first gospel, Matthew, brings in the greatest of <i>titles</i>, "El", "Emmanuel .<a name=3:7></a>.<a name=3:8></a>.<a name=3:9></a> 'God with us' ", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:23">Matthew  1:23</a>, and closes by telling us who that God is, what His <i>name</i> is as known <i>now</i>, "the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>.<a name=3:10></a> But this gospel does not go back to a title in that sense, nor, in the first three verses, to Christ as the subject of prophecy; it goes back to the fact that the Person who came is the "I AM".<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.Hr.<a name=3:12></a> Does it help to see that this Person who is so glorious was found in the midst of all the corruption that is in the world, and yet maintained every feature that was right in relation to God?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:14></a>C.<a name=3:15></a> Is not that involved in the word "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=3:16></a> J.<a name=3:17></a>N.<a name=3:18></a>D.<a name=3:19></a> says:

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=3:21></a>H.<a name=3:22></a> Is your word about the "I am" emphasised in chapter 8, where the Lord says, "unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins", verse 24, and then in verse 28, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:3></a>C.<a name=4:4></a> Yes, and He immediately brings out the perfection of His dependent manhood.<a name=4:5></a> One such as He, who is "I am", could yet say that "the Father has taught me".<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=4:7></a>H.<a name=4:8></a> I was wondering about that very thing, His dependent manhood, in the very same verse as He mentions His own name, as God.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:10></a>C.<a name=4:11></a> Scripture seems to delight to put His deity and manhood together.<a name=4:12></a> They are so often put in juxtaposition, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am", but then He goes on "I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things".<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=4:14></a> The expression "In him was life", chapter 1: 4, bears of course on His deity; but in chapter 5 He speaks of the Father having given Him to have life in Himself.<a name=4:15></a> Would that bear on His perfect dependence, ever preserved as the Sent One, in the midst of corruption and death?<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:24></a>C.<a name=4:25></a> "In him was life".<a name=4:26></a> We cannot limit that expression.<a name=4:27></a> It seems a kind of absolute statement which no doubt involves the truth of His Person.<a name=4:28></a> But then, it was what was manifested <i>here</i>; such an One here manifested life in perfection in manhood.<a name=4:29></a> "That eternal life", John says in the epistle, "which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:2">1 John  1:2</a>.<a name=4:30></a> "And the life was the light of men".<a name=4:31></a> All the springs of His life were in God.<a name=4:32></a> He did nothing but what He saw the Father doing, He did not speak except words given to Him by the Father.<a name=4:33></a> There was

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:7></a>G.<a name=5:8></a> Does that mean that in thus manifesting that life, God had in mind that men should be brought into it?<a name=5:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:10></a>C.<a name=5:11></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=5:12></a> The life of Jesus here, while it exposed man, was a manifestation that it was God's mind for men to be in a life like that, in so far as the creature can be.<a name=5:13></a> And is not that where purification from our point of view becomes essential?<a name=5:14></a>

		E.J.<a name=5:18></a>H.<a name=5:19></a> In chapter 20: 31, you get the words "that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name".<a name=5:20></a>

		G.R.<a name=5:21></a>C.<a name=5:22></a> That is the great objective.<a name=5:23></a> Believing "that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God" is really believing on Him as the theme of prophetic testimony.<a name=5:24></a> That is what comes in later in chapter 1.<a name=5:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:26></a>D.<a name=5:27></a> Does the darkness not apprehending the light mean that there is some moral cause for that, hence the need of purification to follow if the light is to be apprehended?<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=5:29></a>C.<a name=5:30></a> Yes.<a name=5:31></a> And I suppose we have to take account of the fact recorded in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>that darkness existed before man.<a name=5:32></a> <i>The</i> darkness is spoken of here, it is an awful thing, "the darkness apprehended it not".<a name=5:33></a> No doubt it is physical darkness that is actually referred to in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, but nevertheless, one would think that it is to bring home to us the spiritual darkness, "darkness was on the face of the deep".<a name=5:34></a>

		L.A.<a name=7:2></a>C.<a name=7:3></a> Is there a link in Ezekiel's prophecy with what we have here?<a name=7:4></a> The question is asked in chapter 8: 12 "Hast thou seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark", and in chapter 43: 2 it says "And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was lit up with his glory".<a name=7:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:7></a>C.<a name=7:8></a> Quite so.<a name=7:9></a> And I think before we proceed farther we ought to take account of the first three verses, because they are a very emphatic assertion by the Spirit of God that Jesus is "I am".<a name=7:10></a> We have His own assertion of it in chapter 8: 58, but the Spirit's assertion that Jesus is "I am" is in the first three verses of the gospel.<a name=7:11></a> It says "In the beginning was the Word"; that is, He had no beginning, in the beginning He was; "and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=7:12></a> He was in the beginning with God".<a name=7:13></a> There is certain light in that as to the Godhead, that is, the distinction of the Persons, "He was in the beginning with God".<a name=7:14></a> But then it says "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being".<a name=7:15></a> The idea of the name "I am" is that God alone is self-existent, He is the great self-existent One, and all other existences are derived; and that is what is predicated of Christ here.<a name=7:16></a> He ever was, He never began to be, but all things began to be (that is the literal word here) through him.<a name=7:17></a> That is the idea of the "I am".<a name=7:18></a> He alone has existence in Himself.<a name=7:19></a> Every other existence, everything else, began to be, and began to be through Him.<a name=7:20></a> So that Jesus is presented in His glory, as "I am that I am".<a name=7:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=23:1></a>C.<a name=23:2></a> We are engaged with the subject of purification, and we were noticing that John deals with inward matters, and that true purification begins within.<a name=23:3></a> If purification marks us within, outward purification, in the way of separation from everything that is not of God, will be a very simple matter; and our separation will be real, not a pharisaical one; it will be a real separation to God.<a name=23:4></a> So that while separate, we shall be true witnesses.<a name=23:5></a> Perhaps many of us can look back over our history and feel how exceedingly poor we have been as witnesses to Christ, even though we have been in an outward path of separation; and if we have failed in our witness it is because of inward purification.<a name=23:6></a> We have been retaining something of self, the principle of self-centredness has not been completely eradicated; and therefore the glory has failed to shine through.<a name=23:7></a> It is a sad thing for oneself to look back over one's life from that angle.<a name=23:8></a> So that in bringing this subject forward one would desire for oneself, as well as for the brethren, that in the little time we have left here, we might really be purified vessels.<a name=23:9></a> I believe that is the aim of this day of recovery, purified vessels.<a name=23:10></a> And every such vessel is great, a great vessel in the mind of God, like the great fishes in the end of this gospel.<a name=23:11></a> Not that such a one is great in his own eyes, it is just the reverse: in his own eyes such an one is not fit even to be a slave of Christ, Christ is so great; but though we are not really worthy to be slaves, yet in the greatness of His grace He permits us to be, as in the sphere of testimony.<a name=23:12></a> We are brought into intimate

		relationships, in infinite grace, but in the sphere of the testimony the great thing is to comport ourselves as those who are His slaves, and yet we are not even worthy to be that.<a name=24:1></a> So that we become witnesses to this glorious Person.<a name=24:2></a> If His glory filled our souls, He would be on our lips at every opportunity.<a name=24:3></a> How we have failed in that!<a name=24:4></a> He was on John the baptist's lips at every opportunity and thus how effective his testimony was.<a name=24:5></a> When he was not talking to anyone but himself he says "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=24:6></a> His heart was prostrated as he considered the greatness of the Person walking there.<a name=24:7></a> And that affected others, but it did not draw them to John.<a name=24:8></a> If we are purified persons we shall not draw people to ourselves, we shall draw people to Christ, direct people to Christ.<a name=24:9></a> And so the <i>first chapter of John really brings out the great principle of purification</i>; that is, that instead of being self-centred, we become Christ-centred.<a name=24:10></a> Christ, and God in Christ, becomes the Centre, the Object, the Motive; the whole man is thus affected.<a name=24:11></a> Therefore this great presentation of Christ in chapter 1, as to <i>who</i> He is, the "I am"; as to <i>what</i> He is in manhood, the Word, the full expression of the mind of God; as to what He is as the Declarer of God, whom no one has seen at any time, but He has declared Him.<a name=24:12></a> So that God is known in the fullest way in which the creature could possibly know Him, but Jesus is the Declarer, no one else.<a name=24:13></a> We do not go to apostolic doctrine for the declaration of God.<a name=24:14></a> <i>Jesus is the Declarer of God</i>.<a name=24:15></a> And then John sets out His operations, how vast; the One who takes away the sin of the world!<a name=24:16></a> Who else could do it?<a name=24:17></a> And He has sacrificed Himself in the most absolute sense in order to lay the moral basis to put things right in the world; to take man away from himself as the centre, and bring God in as the Centre.<a name=24:18></a> He has laid the moral foundation in His death.<a name=24:19></a> Then there is what He is doing now, baptising with the Spirit, forming the body, the vessel that is

		the subject of eternal purpose and counsel.<a name=25:1></a> All this is so great; not, in a specific way, the subject of prophetic testimony, but One coming out of eternity, as it were, and bringing all this with Him.<a name=25:2></a> Then you get the idea of prophetic testimony, John bearing witness that He is the Son of God.<a name=25:3></a> That means that He is the Anointed.<a name=25:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>shows that when the One they were expecting, God's Anointed, should come, what would mark Him out would be that He would be the Son of God.<a name=25:5></a> So that the great centre of prophetic testimony is that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, or as Paul would present it, that Jesus is the Son of God, the Christ.<a name=25:6></a> Paul's ministry is in the reverse order.<a name=25:7></a> He is the subject of prophetic testimony.<a name=25:8></a> We have spoken of other glories, but there is something that peculiarly draws the heart out to Christ, as we see Him as the fulfilment of prophetic testimony.<a name=25:9></a> He has come at last, the One who fulfils all prophetic testimony.<a name=25:10></a> The Son of God has come, and the Son of God is the Anointed of God; He is the One that God can trust.<a name=25:11></a> But then Nathanael has to learn that the anointing is not limited to "King of Israel" but, as "the Christ", He takes up all that is His as Son of Man.<a name=25:12></a> The title "the Christ" is no longer limited to Israel, but it takes in heaven and earth, the whole dominion of the Son of man.<a name=25:13></a> So that the glories of chapter 1 are exquisite, they are surpassing, and are calculated to deliver us completely from self as a centre; that Christ, and God in Him, might become our Centre, our Object, our Motive.<a name=25:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 2, we have His own activities in two spheres.<a name=25:15></a> When it comes to the practical working out of purification, there is much to be done, and the Lord commences in chapter 2 what needs to be done, first in the sphere of natural affections, and then in the religious sphere.<a name=25:16></a> It is remarkable that in this most spiritual gospel He should manifest forth His glory, and begin His signs, in dealing with the sphere of

		natural affections, reminding us of Ephesians where detailed directions as to natural relations are brought in on the highest level.<a name=26:1></a> We were speaking of the darkness this afternoon as including the darkness of nature and the darkness of religion, and they are touched here.<a name=26:2></a> Satan has a foothold in both, and you find both running on in this gospel.<a name=26:3></a> For instance, chapter 5 is the darkness of religion, where they seek to kill the Lord because He violated the sabbath, and called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.<a name=26:4></a> It is the darkness, the murderous hate of men who feel that they are being outshone; they are not prepared for purification.<a name=26:5></a> We have all been outshone; the point is, are we prepared for it, religiously?<a name=26:6></a> They were being outshone, and they would kill the One who was thus taking away from them all their vaunted glory.<a name=26:7></a> But then in chapter 6 you have the natural setting, and it is just as dark, only a different form of darkness.<a name=26:8></a> It is the 'work-a-day' setting, the setting of ordinary everyday work and relationships (that is Galilee).<a name=26:9></a> The working population were glad to be fed, and they wanted to make the Lord king; there was no religious prejudice.<a name=26:10></a> But then they were overcome by natural prejudice; they said "Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph?<a name=26:11></a>" verse 42, and at the end of the chapter there were only twelve walking with Him, so that He says "Will ye also go away?<a name=26:12></a>" verse 67.<a name=26:13></a> We have to see how darkness is entrenched, both in the sphere of nature, and in the sphere of religion.<a name=26:14></a> If we have got a 'brethren's religion', darkness will be there.<a name=26:15></a> But then the Lord is operating so that natural relations, and the setting up of homes, might stand related to the testimony, on the basis of purification.<a name=26:16></a>

		G.R.<a name=45:1></a>C.<a name=45:2></a> Chapter 2 deals with purification in the sphere of natural relationships, and in the sphere of the profession, the religious sphere.<a name=45:3></a> This chapter brings it down to each one of us in a personal way.<a name=45:4></a> The Lord's teaching goes to the root of the matter inwardly.<a name=45:5></a> So that it is of the utmost importance that we should get help by the Spirit to understand the meaning of the Lord's teaching to Nicodemus.<a name=45:6></a> Some may wonder why we are linking purification with life; Romans links justification with life.<a name=45:7></a> Death has come upon us because we have all sinned, and justification from the judicial standpoint is essential if we are to have life.<a name=45:8></a> The cause of death coming upon us must be removed.<a name=45:9></a> Justification freed us from the sins, the guilt, which brought death upon us, so that justification is in view of life, it is justification of life.<a name=45:10></a> And on that basis of judicial clearance, the act of favour of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=45:11></a> But if we are to <i>enjoy</i> eternal life, purification is essential.<a name=45:12></a> It is one thing to see that, as justified, the way into life for us is clear, but it is another matter to enter into and enjoy eternal life.<a name=45:13></a> That necessitates purification, so that John in his gospel speaks of purification, and purification is spoken of in Hebrews, where it is a question of drawing near to God.<a name=45:14></a> The way is open for us to draw near to God, but nothing impure can come into His presence.<a name=45:15></a> So that even as to sins in Hebrews, it speaks of the Lord Jesus as "having made by himself the purification of sins", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>.<a name=45:16></a> <i>We</i> need justification, but <i>God's nature</i> requires purification.<a name=45:17></a> The work of Christ upon the

		G.R.<a name=116:1></a>C.<a name=116:2></a> This chapter deals with recovery, and I think one thing to learn from it is that, in days of recovery, God would secure 'great fishes'.<a name=116:3></a> Numbers may not be great, but it is a question of quality.<a name=116:4></a> And I would say that every person who has faced and gone through the exercise of purification, both within and without, would be included amongst these great fishes.<a name=116:5></a> So that in 2 Timothy days, God has in mind the quality of the persons secured through the very conditions which they have to face, God using these conditions to deepen the work in themselves, and to deepen their appreciation of the greatness and glory of Christ and of God.<a name=116:6></a> I think it would help us to look upon one another too, in this light, that those we are privileged to walk with, and thus feed upon in the way of fellowship, are great fishes; humble persons, it may be, as far as this world is concerned, but if they face the exercises that have been before us in these meetings, in God's mind they are great fishes.<a name=116:7></a> And what comes to light at the end is that the net is strong enough.<a name=116:8></a> There is no idea of the net breaking.<a name=116:9></a> The truth as to the assembly goes through intact, and these great fishes are held relative to that.<a name=116:10></a> Peter is used to drag the net to land, in this incident, according to verse 11, but he himself becomes an outstanding example of a great fish; a man who was a leader, appointed to be so, but who had failed in denying the Lord, and failed here too in independent leadership, leading others with him.<a name=116:11></a> But the Lord deals with him in this chapter, so that he becomes a thoroughly purified man.<a name=116:12></a> I think, therefore, we might, for our

		purpose today, apply to our own times the 14th verse, "This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among the dead"; and I think we may regard the first two manifestations as foundational, the first one relative to the assembly and the highest level of the truth, the second to bring about what the Lord is seeking from each one of us personally, our personal appreciation of Him, "My Lord and my God".<a name=117:1></a> I am not now applying that to Israel dispensationally, but in the light of chapter 20: 24, where it says that Thomas was one of the twelve.<a name=117:2></a> That means it is a foundational matter, and enters, in the way we are thinking now, into our dispensation.<a name=117:3></a> There is the assembly manifestation, and a personal manifestation, although the others were there; but it was particularly personal to Thomas, and we need to have our personal dealings with, and appreciation of, the Lord.<a name=117:4></a> All that is foundational and belongs to the beginning of things, but continues, of course.<a name=117:5></a> But then this third time, as we are applying it, would refer specially to the time of the end, to days of recovery, in a collective sense.<a name=117:6></a> That is to say, these fish were all in the net, and they were great.<a name=117:7></a> And so it says in verse 4, "early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore".<a name=117:8></a> It would touch our hearts to think of that surely, "early morn already breaking", the morning just at hand, and the Lord coming in in this way in tender affection, so that there might be this recovery at the dawn of the morning.<a name=117:9></a>

		that we should have a personal knowledge of God, and that means a personal knowledge of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and in a most intimate way.<a name=151:1></a> Because, after all, our links with the Father and the Son and the Spirit are closer than any links we have in nature, and even closer than the links we have with one another, I would suppose, in the one body, and in the family.<a name=151:2></a> Surely our links with God Himself are closer than any.<a name=151:3></a> God known and loved, and in intimate relationship with us.<a name=151:4></a> What a conception this is!<a name=151:5></a> And God would dwell as thus known.<a name=151:6></a> We know the Son, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine".<a name=151:7></a> I am not in any way contradicting another saying of the Lord that "No one knows the Son but the Father", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a>, that is another idea altogether.<a name=151:8></a> I am referring to Jesus as having come forth, "the Word became flesh", and "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father"; and He says "I know my sheep, and am known of mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".<a name=151:9></a> Then He says as to the Father, "henceforth ye know him and have seen him", and as to the Spirit, "whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but <i>ye</i> know him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a>.<a name=151:10></a> What a knowledge this is, the personal knowledge of God.<a name=151:11></a> We know the Father, we know the Son, and we know the Spirit.<a name=151:12></a> And how has it all come about?<a name=151:13></a> Because the One who is shown so clearly to be the <i>I am</i> in the first three verses of chapter 1, became flesh, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=151:14></a> That is why He came -- to dwell.<a name=151:15></a> That is why God has disclosed Himself in a personal way.<a name=151:16></a> We need to know the persons we live with, and love them; and therefore God wants us to know Him, and to love Him.<a name=151:17></a> He would dwell where He is thus known and loved.<a name=151:18></a> Dwelling is a most exquisite thought, the tabernacle of God with men.<a name=151:19></a> The great finality of it is in the book of Revelation;
