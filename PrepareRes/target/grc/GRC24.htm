		G.R.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> It is in mind in these readings to consider certain fundamental truths that have their basis in the sacrificial work of Christ.<a name=1:3></a> Therefore, it is proposed this morning to consider the subject of righteousness, which includes the truth of justification; justification really meaning being judicially set right, or set up in righteousness, before God.<a name=1:4></a> Each of the features of the truth we may consider we can only touch lightly.<a name=1:5></a> The subject of righteousness is a very vast one, and the passages read speak first of all of righteousness of God, in chapter 3.<a name=1:6></a> In chapter 4 we have righteousness of faith (verse 13), and in chapter 8 practical righteousness, "the Spirit life on account of righteousness".<a name=1:7></a> The verse in Timothy, while it would include every feature of practical righteousness, includes also ecclesiastical righteousness.<a name=1:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness of God is an immense thing.<a name=1:9></a> It is said to be revealed in the gospel, as in chapter 1 -- "for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith".<a name=1:10></a> And we cannot think of this subject without thinking of the great day of atonement.<a name=1:11></a> Indeed, in chapter 3 it moves on immediately to it, referring to "the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for the shewing forth of his righteousness".<a name=1:12></a> So that we have to look at the passage in chapter 3 in an objective way to get the bearing of the greatness of it.<a name=1:13></a> <i>We</i> come into the matter in chapter

		4, but chapter 3 is referring to righteousness of God; that God might be just (or righteous) and the Justifier of him that is of the faith of Jesus.<a name=2:1></a> The whole passage in chapter 3 relates to God.<a name=2:2></a> Therefore the truth is presented at its height.<a name=2:3></a> Chapter 4 is our coming into it.<a name=2:4></a> We come into it by righteousness of faith, and chapter 4 (if we take the type of the day of atonement) scarcely goes further than what is called, in the Authorised Version, the scapegoat, namely, that Jesus was delivered for our offences and raised for our justification.<a name=2:5></a> It is the way things are brought down to us to meet us in our need.<a name=2:6></a>

		B.H.<a name=2:7></a>T.<a name=2:8></a> Is it quite in contrast to what prevailed under the old economy?<a name=2:9></a> You spoke of being set up in righteousness.<a name=2:10></a> Under the old economy they had to attain to it, did they not?<a name=2:11></a>

		G.R.<a name=2:12></a>C.<a name=2:13></a> Yes, and there was no possibility of attaining it by works of law.<a name=2:14></a> The law was given that the offence might abound.<a name=2:15></a> The law was weak through the flesh.<a name=2:16></a> If it had been possible for man in the flesh to carry out the law he would have lived by law.<a name=2:17></a> And that would have been man's righteousness -- not God's.<a name=2:18></a> If the law could have been fulfilled, at the very best it would only have been man's righteousness.<a name=2:19></a>

		G.R.<a name=2:23></a>C.<a name=2:24></a> Yes, it is in contrast to man's.<a name=2:25></a> All that the law could require was man's righteousness, but the law only proved that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and so there was no hope on that line.<a name=2:26></a> It only caused the offence to abound.<a name=2:27></a> It exposed the offences and made them more hideous and apparent.<a name=2:28></a> We therefore needed Someone to come in Who would be delivered for our offences.<a name=2:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:10></a>C.<a name=3:11></a> The law is the perfect standard of conduct for man on earth, and therefore it is holy and just and good.<a name=3:12></a> The righteous requirement of it, which is not in the letter, is that "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thine understanding; and thy neighbour as thyself", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:27">Luke  10:27</a>.<a name=3:13></a> That is the spirituality, as it were, of the law.<a name=3:14></a> But the very form in which the literality of it was given, showed that man was a sinner, because nearly all the commandments are negatives -- they are prohibitions, proving that they were addressed to man as under the power of sin and telling him what he should not do.<a name=3:15></a> And therefore, in its very nature -- though men would not accept it and had to learn by experience -- it proved that it could not be the way to life and righteousness for men.<a name=3:16></a> The very prohibitions indicated that man was under sin.<a name=3:17></a> But the positive side of the law, the spirituality of it, is fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.<a name=3:18></a> Through divine grace we do love God and, if we move on in His love and abide in it, we shall be brought to a point where we love Him with all our heart and soul and mind and strength, and the sooner we get to that the better.<a name=3:19></a> But it is divine grace alone which brings us to that -- the knowledge of God and His love and His righteousness.<a name=3:20></a>

		F.J.<a name=3:21></a>F.<a name=3:22></a> The Lord magnified the law and made it honourable.<a name=3:23></a> But He was the only One who did.<a name=3:24></a>

		G.R.<a name=4:6></a>C.<a name=4:7></a> And yet, of course, there is a greater plumbline.<a name=4:8></a> The law was the rule of conduct for man on earth.<a name=4:9></a> But Christ is the true standard.<a name=4:10></a> What came out in Christ exceeds anything which the law commanded.<a name=4:11></a> The law never commanded anyone to lay down his life and to save sinners.<a name=4:12></a> The law said "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"; but after every kind of indignity and suffering had been heaped upon Christ, He then took all the guilt upon Himself.<a name=4:13></a> The law never visualized such a thing.<a name=4:14></a> So that Christ is the great standard, Christ is the One who truly expressed God.<a name=4:15></a> The law does not express God fully; it sets out God's righteous requirement for man on earth but it does not display God in His nature and character.<a name=4:16></a> Christ displayed God in His nature and character.<a name=4:17></a> He is the image of God and that is the real standard.<a name=4:18></a> Law is not the real standard.<a name=4:19></a> The law has been our tutor up to Christ, but it is not the real standard.<a name=4:20></a> Christ is the standard and that is indicated in the passage we have read, "for all have sinned" -- that is one thing (as the note indicates) -- "and come short of the glory of God".<a name=4:21></a> Now that is the standard.<a name=4:22></a> We have come short of our responsibility as men: we were created to express God's image and glory.<a name=4:23></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:7">1 Corinthians  11:7</a>.<a name=4:24></a> That is greater than the law.<a name=4:25></a> The face of a man was created with ability to express the attributes of God.<a name=4:26></a> Man can express love, kindness, compassion, mercy, anger.<a name=4:27></a> God created a creature with a face capable of expressing Himself in His character, and man has failed.<a name=4:28></a> We have all come short.<a name=4:29></a> The responsibility committed to man was to represent God in the creation and man has failed in that responsibility.<a name=4:30></a> The degrading sins we have dropped into are incidental, but the primary thing is that we have failed in the initial

But the point here is its efficacy to satisfy the claims of God's throne and the requirements of His holiness in respect of sins and sin. For this His sufferings from God as bearing sins and as made sin were essential. His sufferings from man as the perfect witness or martyr would not have sufficed.

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this was primarily for the nostrils and for the eye of God, the cloud of fragrant incense filling the most holy place and the blood upon the mercy-seat and seven times before the mercy-seat.<a name=28:11></a> The odour of the fragrant incense was brought out in its fulness by His submission to the very sufferings of atonement which gave atoning efficacy to the blood.<a name=28:12></a> Christ was fragrant to God all through His life, but the fragrance was brought out in fulness and perfection in the intensity of the sufferings in the garden of Gethsemane and on the cross.<a name=28:13></a> And it is in the power of all that has come into expression in the intensity of suffering, that He has entered into the presence of God.<a name=28:14></a>

		G.R.<a name=47:1></a>C.<a name=47:2></a> We have already considered the righteousness of God as revealed in the gospel, which is the moral foundation of everything that God is doing in grace; and in that connection we considered the truth of justification, God meeting us at the point of our need; the establishment of His righteousness as revealed in the gospel setting Him free to meet us in our need, and justify us, and give us the Spirit and set us up here in practical righteousness.<a name=47:3></a> In the second reading we considered the truth of reconciliation, called atonement in the Old Testament, also based upon the righteousness of God as revealed in the gospel, but setting out the work of Christ as it affects God Himself; the way Christ, by His sacrifice and going in to God, has met all the claims of the throne, His blood covering everything that was offensive under the eye of God.<a name=47:4></a> So that God dwells in the midst of a system where the blood is at the centre, on the mercy-seat, "And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood; and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law"; so God looks out upon a system purified from the standpoint of the blood.<a name=47:5></a> That is, all that is offensive to Him is covered, indeed removed judicially, from before His eye, by the blood, although not actually removed yet.<a name=47:6></a> Thus God has a complacent outlook on the whole system of which He is the centre.<a name=47:7></a> At the present time, this is represented in the assembly as the tabernacle of witness.<a name=47:8></a>

		G.R.<a name=90:2></a>C.<a name=90:3></a> I thought we might consider new creation, as existing at the present time and how it stands relative to reconciliation.<a name=90:4></a> The scripture in Revelation gives the completeness of it, the One on the throne pronounced that "it is done".<a name=90:5></a> "Behold, I make all things new".<a name=90:6></a> So that that passage affords special help as to new creation, bearing in mind that we have there the external view of things.<a name=90:7></a> It refers to the holy city, new Jerusalem, and indicates that the same vessel is the tabernacle of God.<a name=90:8></a> The city retains the character of the bride, shewing that the heavenly relationships in which we find our life spiritually, belong to new creation.<a name=90:9></a> And the throne of God is there.<a name=90:10></a> This, of course, is not limited to new creation; in a way, it stands apart from creation, it is the throne of God; but it is still in evidence in the new creation scene, showing that rule remains.<a name=90:11></a> Then there is the word, "I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son".<a name=90:12></a> But the passage does not give us the inner life of the tabernacle.<a name=90:13></a> We have to go to John's gospel to get an idea of the inner life of the tabernacle of God, the Father's love for the Son, the Son's love for the Father and the place we have in that wonderful "dwelling".<a name=90:14></a> In his gospel John unfolds the inner life, but he is viewed as an onlooker in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>.<a name=90:15></a> He is seeing, from an external viewpoint, the features of new creation.<a name=90:16></a>
