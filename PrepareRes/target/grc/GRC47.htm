		G.R.<a name=34:2></a>C.<a name=34:3></a> In the eighth chapter of Romans it is Christ in the individual.<a name=34:4></a> "If anyone has not the Spirit of Christ <i>he is not of him</i>; but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness".<a name=34:5></a> In Colossians it is Christ in the local company: "to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=34:6></a> And coupled with that we have the teaching in Colossians that we profess to have put on the new man, where Christ is everything and in all; and that should mark every local company.<a name=34:7></a> We should be true to what we profess -- that we have put on the new man.<a name=34:8></a> And then in Ephesians, the prayer is "the Christ".<a name=34:9></a> In the other passages it is "Christ".<a name=34:10></a> In Ephesians it is that the Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=34:11></a> And "the Christ" refers to Him in the way we were speaking of Him yesterday, as the Head and Centre of things in heaven and earth -- holding in His own Person all the great offices, "the Christ" is the highest office in the universe -- He is God's Anointed, to rule over all things in heaven and earth -- angels and principalities and powers made subject to Him.<a name=34:12></a> So that in Ephesians, the Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith, means that He is Head over all things to each one of us as we apprehend Him as Head over all things in heaven and earth, and cherish Him in our affections <i>as such</i>.<a name=34:13></a> So that the passage goes on to show that if He, the Christ, has that place in our hearts, we shall be

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=35:9></a>C.<a name=35:10></a> The Spirit of Christ is that aspect of the Spirit that is often spoken of as the Anointing.<a name=35:11></a> Christ means the Anointed One; and what God says about Him calls our attention to Him.<a name=35:12></a> He says: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=35:13></a> I will put my spirit upon him", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a>.<a name=35:14></a> That is the anointing.<a name=35:15></a> So that for us to be marked by the Spirit of Christ means that the features of God's Beloved, in whom God's soul delights, are expressed in us.<a name=35:16></a> Is that so?<a name=35:17></a>

		G.R.<a name=36:16></a>C.<a name=36:17></a> Well, that is an important point, because Christ could not be in us if we were not in Him.<a name=36:18></a> "There is then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus".<a name=36:19></a> But really the two sides link together.<a name=36:20></a> You get much of it in John's gospel: "Abide in me and I in you", and so on.<a name=36:21></a> He speaks in his epistle about abiding in God and God in us.<a name=36:22></a> The two sides should be commensurate; if we are in Christ, Christ should be in us -- nothing else but Christ seen.<a name=36:23></a> What have you got in mind?<a name=36:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=37:5></a>C.<a name=37:6></a> Yes; so the first thing really is to make room for the Spirit.<a name=37:7></a> We apprehend that Christ has borne the condemnation for our wretched man.<a name=37:8></a> I cannot think why we want to revive him so much -- this wretched man!<a name=37:9></a> Paul was glad to get rid of him; and nobody had admired that wretched man more than Saul had; but he completely changed his outlook.<a name=37:10></a> He said: "O wretched man that I am".<a name=37:11></a> If only I can rid myself of Saul of Tarsus!<a name=37:12></a> Then he says, I have got rid of him, because I am now crucified with Christ, and I am not living any more but Christ is living in me.<a name=37:13></a> That is how he came to this; Paul's own experience is summed up in those words.<a name=37:14></a> Because the wretched man deserves only to be hanged upon a tree.<a name=37:15></a> It may take me a long time to come to it that I am so wretched by nature that I deserve to be hanged upon a tree, and Jesus took my place.<a name=37:16></a> He bore the condemnation so that there is no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus.<a name=37:17></a> But then he immediately brings in the Spirit: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free .<a name=37:18></a>.<a name=37:19></a>.<a name=37:20></a>".<a name=37:21></a> It is one thing to realise that He bore the condemnation and there is none for me from God's side -- because He has borne it -- it is another thing to be in the joy and liberty of that, and that is by the Spirit -- "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=37:22></a> The ideal thing for the Christian is to have nothing even to condemn himself about.<a name=37:23></a> God is not going to condemn me, but then if I am going about all the time with the sense of failure and the sense of condemnation, I am not a very happy man.<a name=37:24></a> I know that we often offend, and that we have to go back to root principles; but characteristically,
