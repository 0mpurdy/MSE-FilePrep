		I thought we might consider together the living water and to take account of the environment from whence it flows.<a name=1:2></a> We have to remember that God Himself is the source according to <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2">Jeremiah  2</a>where He speaks of the two sins that His people had committed; that they had forsaken Him, the fountain of living water, and had hewn out cisterns, broken cisterns, which hold no water.<a name=1:3></a> So that God Himself is the fountain of living water.<a name=1:4></a> And one of the final promises in scripture is that to him that thirsts, He will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.<a name=1:5></a> But while God Himself is the Fountain, the water becomes available to men from a certain environment and the features of this environment develop in scripture.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first passage we read, the environment is Eden; a river went out of Eden to water the garden.<a name=1:7></a> In the second scripture the environment is the sanctuary.<a name=1:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47:12">Ezekiel  47:12</a> we are told the waters issued from the sanctuary.<a name=1:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>the river of water of life, clear as crystal, flows out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.<a name=1:10></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>brings it down in a practical way to each one of us; it is out of the belly of a living believer, one who believes all the time and has a living state of faith, that rivers of living water flow.<a name=1:11></a> Anyone who is livingly believing in Jesus is continually coming to Him as glorified.<a name=1:12></a>

		"If any one thirst .<a name=2:1></a>.<a name=2:2></a>.<a name=2:3></a>" We soon get thirsty; even in natural things we need continually to drink, and the living believer in Jesus continually comes to Him in faith, coming to Jesus glorified, which in a spiritual sense, includes Eden and the sanctuary and the throne.<a name=2:4></a> So the living believer has access to the whole environment in coming in faith to Jesus glorified; and in coming, not only is he refreshed and satisfied, but he becomes a channel.<a name=2:5></a> "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=2:6></a> There is no doubt that in that scripture the Spirit of God has in mind <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>as well as the other scriptures.<a name=2:7></a> But the idea in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>is that the river went out first to water the garden.<a name=2:8></a> Then it divided into four heads and went out to water the earth in its various sections.<a name=2:9></a> Therefore when any one, livingly believing, comes to Jesus glorified as a <i>habit of soul, there is</i> refreshment available to satisfy his heart completely, and moreover the living waters can flow out from that man.<a name=2:10></a> The environment from which they come is Jesus glorified, and the source is God Himself as known in Jesus.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel this is an urgent matter for my own soul.<a name=2:12></a> One desires earnestly to find complete satisfaction of soul in God Himself in the environment in which we are permitted to approach Him.<a name=2:13></a> It is a satisfied soul who can be serviceable in a true sense and can become a channel to others.<a name=2:14></a>

		the most untoward circumstances, rivers of living water were flowing out of Paul and have come down to us today.<a name=3:1></a> We need to learn this.<a name=3:2></a> The psalmist says, "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God".<a name=3:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42">Psalm  42</a>.<a name=3:4></a>) God alone can satisfy the human heart and surely one of the lessons of present exercises is that we should each prove that.<a name=3:5></a> Our satisfaction is in God and if everything else fails, our souls will be restful and satisfied in Him.<a name=3:6></a> And if we have each learned that, how valuable we would be in the testimony!<a name=3:7></a>

		R.S.<a name=3:8></a> So the waters flow out to water the garden.<a name=3:9></a> What had you in mind as to that?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:11></a>C.<a name=3:12></a> Well, if you take <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, for instance, the woman had to be watered first.<a name=3:13></a> In a way she was the garden just then.<a name=3:14></a> She had to be watered first before she could water others, and that is the way true gospel testimony works.<a name=3:15></a> The Lord says to her "if thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says Give me to drink".<a name=3:16></a> She was in the presence of the Source, and then He says, "whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever".<a name=3:17></a> That is the garden watered.<a name=3:18></a> "But the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=3:19></a> Now the reason she would never thirst for ever is because the fountain would spring up into eternal life.<a name=3:20></a> That is the environment according to that passage; the environment in which the living water is known as flowing is eternal life and the Spirit is given to bring us into eternal life.<a name=3:21></a> This links very much with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=3:22></a> The conditions of life were there under God.<a name=3:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=4:5></a>C.<a name=4:6></a> That is just it.<a name=4:7></a> It seems to me the living water is what we need to prove first -- the value of the Spirit.<a name=4:8></a> You see, a man who is dying of thirst is not much good to anybody until he has revived, and in spiritual matters a man is not much good to anybody unless he is satisfied; not only that his thirst is quenched, but he is satisfied.<a name=4:9></a> I wonder whether this is a preliminary thing, an underlying matter, because it says, "We have all been made to drink of one Spirit", and is linked in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>with being baptised into one body and of being <i>active, useful in the power of the Spirit in the body</i>, and also being in the gain of the anointing, because, with reference to the body, it says, "So also is the Christ".<a name=4:10></a> That is the <i>saints viewed as anointed, relative to Christ Himself</i>.<a name=4:11></a> The precious oil is flowing down.<a name=4:12></a> The anointing is in view of activity and service, representing God, but if we have not first appropriated the Spirit as living water, how can we be available to Him relative to the anointing?<a name=4:13></a> It is to persons already satisfied that the Holy Spirit can distribute life and enjoyment of life, as resting upon the anointed.<a name=4:14></a>
