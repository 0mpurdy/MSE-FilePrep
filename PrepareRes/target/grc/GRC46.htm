		G.R.<a name=1:2></a>C.<a name=1:3></a> The sixteenth of Matthew brings forward the foundations on which the Lord Jesus Himself builds.<a name=1:4></a> The third of Corinthians gives us the foundation upon which the workman builds.<a name=1:5></a> Paul speaks of our being God's fellow workmen.<a name=1:6></a> The sixth of Luke speaks of the foundations on which we individually build in our lives and our minds, in our walk, relative to our own formation.<a name=1:7></a> I thought it might help to look at <i>foundations</i> in these three aspects.<a name=1:8></a> It may be that we shall dwell in a special way on the last.<a name=1:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is spoken of as the Rock, "They drank of a spiritual rock that followed them".<a name=1:12></a> So that the rock in any case indicates a Divine Person -- as here it refers to Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=1:13></a> While those expressions refer to Him in manhood, they could not be attached to a mere man; no mere man could carry the honour and the offices that belong to Christ.<a name=1:14></a> He must be a Man, but He must also be, as Paul says, "over all God blessed for ever".<a name=1:15></a> And so with "The Son of the living God": therefore the Lord Jesus says, "On this rock I will build".<a name=1:16></a> He Himself is the Rock.<a name=1:17></a> In passing, I might say that in the Bible recently published (The New English Bible) there is a very grave error; It says "thou art Peter the rock, and on this rock I will build my church".<a name=1:18></a> Those two words, thou art Peter 'the rock' are not in the original --

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=2:15></a>C.<a name=2:16></a> Well, the title "the Christ" means 'the Anointed'; it is the highest title in the universe, the highest office in the universe -- more than any angelic office.<a name=2:17></a> He has a Name which is above every principality, and authority and power and every name named.<a name=2:18></a> He is anointed as Head over all things in heaven and earth; and it covers the great offices of Prophet, Priest and King.<a name=2:19></a> We may think, to begin with, of the great office of prophets of old, but in the case of the Lord Jesus, He has brought forth the whole mind of God -- His very Name, "the Word" signifies that.<a name=2:20></a> Then He is the Priest.<a name=2:21></a> But what takes priority, in a way, is His Kingship; King of righteousness, King of peace, and Priest of the most high God -- that is the first intimation of the combined offices of King and Priest in the Old Testament.<a name=2:22></a> The Old Testament only takes account of earth; but in the New Testament, we know, He is Head of all things in heaven and earth.<a name=2:23></a> No mere man could fill that office.<a name=2:24></a> And so Paul speaks to Israel of Him in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>, "and of whom, as according to flesh,

		is the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever".<a name=3:1></a> That is what leads the church to worship Him.<a name=3:2></a> The church has the nearest place to Him, and she appreciates His person, more than any other company could in the whole universe.<a name=3:3></a> She is the "fulness of him who fills all in all" -- and no mere man could fill all in all.<a name=3:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> It is the line to which the Spirit often refers -- the Lord Jesus in His days of humiliation here; and all kinds of injurious things said against Him would be forgiven, as the "Son of Man".<a name=3:9></a> He came not to be ministered to -- He Whom we see in Daniel, "thousands upon thousands" ministering to Him, and "ten thousands time ten thousands".<a name=3:10></a> But, coming here, He says: "the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many".<a name=3:11></a> Coming on that wonderful mission, to save sinners, the most terrible statement against Himself could be forgiven, but no such statement against the Holy Spirit can be forgiven.<a name=3:12></a> That is a remarkable thing; this is one of the most powerful words stated in Scripture as to the Personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:14></a> We were seeing in the 16th of Matthew that the Christ is the Builder.<a name=3:15></a> I was thinking of <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>, where it says: "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious, yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=3:16></a> Would that refer to the building of the Christ at the present time?<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=3:18></a>C.<a name=3:19></a> I think so.<a name=3:20></a> Of course, we can look at what has been built here in public testimony and what has been built in a more hidden way which will be fully manifested in the world to come.<a name=3:21></a> But I think

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is a view in which the Son is the Builder both as to the house, which would link back with the structure that Solomon built, and also the Tabernacle; because Hebrews speaks of the Tabernacle and calls it the house -- "whose house are we", it says, "if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:6">Hebrews  3:6</a>.<a name=4:1></a> There it says that Christ is the Builder, whichever aspect of the house we take.<a name=4:2></a>

		But there is another important thing in what you say, and that is, we become living stones by apprehending Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=4:3></a> It was that which made Peter a living stone.<a name=4:4></a> And one loves to see that our apprehension is greatly increasing today -- that the young ones may get an impression of the greatness of Christ.<a name=4:5></a> He is God over all, blessed for ever, but He holds all the great offices of the universe -- they are all held by one Man -- the Prophet, the Priest, the King, the Shepherd; and they are held by the Man Who alone could hold them and adorn them; and He becomes the one Man of our hearts as we apprehend that -- the Man whom God has chosen to fill every office -- the Christ -- that is the title the church delights in.<a name=4:6></a> It is the title used relative to the church: Christ, "mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=4:7></a> I will put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the nations", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a>.<a name=4:8></a>
