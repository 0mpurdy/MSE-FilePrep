		I wish, dear brethren, to speak of sound teaching, sound words and a sound mind.<a name=42:2></a> The first passage we read refers to "sound teaching according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God".<a name=42:3></a> I would say, dear brethren, that this is the standard of sound teaching, and that whenever you get false teaching, it will mean a departure from the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=42:4></a> Paul speaks in this passage of those who desire to be law teachers, "not understanding either what they say or concerning what they so strenuously affirm".<a name=42:5></a> That idea is rampant in Christendom.<a name=42:6></a> Christendom is governed largely by law teaching.<a name=42:7></a> Nearly every sect has its rules and regulations.<a name=42:8></a> Paul refers in Titus to "commandments of men" and in Colossians "according to the teaching of men and not according to Christ".<a name=42:9></a> It is innate in our nature, if we are not under the control of the Spirit, to lay down the law; law teachers are always laying down the law for others.<a name=42:10></a> The Lord said in Matthew's Gospel that they tie on men burdens which are hard and grievous to be borne and they do not touch them with their little finger.<a name=42:11></a> They have plenty of excuses for themselves but they lay burdens on others.<a name=42:12></a> Paul refutes that by speaking of "sound teaching according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God".<a name=42:13></a>

		I think that <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>sets out in parable form, from the Lord's own lips, the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=43:16></a> The shepherd is seeking the sheep till he finds it, the woman is sweeping the house till she finds the lost piece of silver; the father is running to meet the repentant son and is covering him with kisses.<a name=43:17></a> As J.<a name=43:18></a>N.<a name=43:19></a>D.<a name=43:20></a> says, the chapter shows God's own joy in love.<a name=43:21></a> That is the idea in the term "<i>the blessed God</i>:" the God who finds His own joy in acting in love, in free-hearted giving, and free-hearted forgiveness to repentant ones.<a name=43:22></a> And all the various false teachings that have come in, including those that we have had experience of, are contrary to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=43:23></a> You can test all of them by bringing them up against the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=43:24></a> Are they in accord with that?<a name=43:25></a> If not, we must reject them.<a name=43:26></a> Whether it is law teachers or whether it is those who would teach that principles must be surrendered and would turn grace into licence; neither line of teaching is in accord with the glad tidings of

		the glory of the blessed God.<a name=44:1></a> When the son returned he returned on the basis of true repentance; and it says, "bring out the best robe and clothe him in it".<a name=44:2></a> There must be nothing in evidence but the best robe, as we might say in the language we used this afternoon, that which belongs to the sanctuary.<a name=44:3></a> The robe suggests that in which you appear publicly.<a name=44:4></a> The glory of the blessed God would clothe us in the best.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may say Ephesians is the best robe, and so it is -- "accepted in the Beloved" -- but the teaching of Ephesians does not suppose that you come out down here in any other character of garment than that in which you are before God; that is, that you come out here to display Christ.<a name=44:6></a> If you are accepted in the Beloved you want to display the Beloved in all your ways and movements here -- to walk as He walked.<a name=44:7></a> Christ upheld all that was due to God in every way during all His pathway.<a name=44:8></a> He expressed in fulness the kindness and love of our Saviour God to men, without surrendering a single principle, without in any way saying or doing anything that would come short of God's glory.<a name=44:9></a> He was perfect in every way.<a name=44:10></a>

		So if our teaching is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, it will not deviate to the right hand of legality nor to the left hand of licence.<a name=44:11></a> It will go straight forward and it brings men to God in the power of the grace which not only sets them up in His presence in perfect acceptance in the Lord Jesus Christ, but, by the gift of the Spirit, sets them up down here to display in their life and walk the character of the man in whom they are accepted above.<a name=44:12></a> James says in chapter 1 that the one who is a forgetful hearer of the word and not a doer is like

		Now in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4">2 Timothy  4</a>, it says, "But thou, be sober in all things".<a name=48:2></a> You will find that being sober means having a sound, clear mind.<a name=48:3></a> If you look at the note to verse 5, it says, 'a mind not muddled with the influence of what intoxicates'.<a name=48:4></a> It does not imply watching or being awake.<a name=48:5></a> Sometimes in scripture soberness implies vigilance, watchfulness.<a name=48:6></a> Of course, a drunken man cannot be vigilant; but this word, which is often used, is sober clearness of mind, resulting from exemption from false influence, not muddled with the influence of what intoxicates.<a name=48:7></a> Now you know, false teaching is very intoxicating.<a name=48:8></a> What stems from the human mind appeals to the human mind.<a name=48:9></a> It comes from man in the flesh and it appeals to man in the flesh, and Satan works on the flesh.<a name=48:10></a> He is behind these things.<a name=48:11></a> People get intoxicated.<a name=48:12></a> I have met people who are positively intoxicated with the present evil teaching that has come in amongst brethren.<a name=48:13></a> If you try to reason with them, you might as well reason with a drunken man.<a name=48:14></a> You put scripture before them and it means nothing.<a name=48:15></a> <i>They have lost their power of thinking</i>, in that sense.<a name=48:16></a> So we may not only get sick about questions but intoxicated in our minds with what is false.<a name=48:17></a>
