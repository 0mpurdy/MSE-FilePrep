		Timothy had taken effect so the house of God was seen in order at Ephesus.<a name=3:1></a> To an assembly in order the fullest blessing could be opened out, so it is a good thing for us to be orderly.<a name=3:2></a> If we read the epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians or even Colossians, there is something adverse or corrupting to be considered, but we do not get that in Ephesians; there is no adverse element present, so the fulness of all that is in the heart and mind of God can be brought out.<a name=3:3></a> The apostle turns to prayer on two occasions; it is only by prayer that we can get what he prays for.<a name=3:4></a> There are some things that can only be had by prayer; when things are put in the form of prayer, it suggests that is the way to arrive at them.<a name=3:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:9></a>C.<a name=3:10></a> The burnt-offering is connected with the walk of the saints there: "Walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (chapter 5: 2).<a name=3:11></a> It stands in relation to what the saints are on earth for the pleasure of God -- that is how it is presented in Scripture.<a name=3:12></a> It is the new ground of acceptance for a people on earth, and it was the supreme expression of love on the part of Christ as found here for the pleasure of God.<a name=3:13></a> The burnt-offering is to be perpetuated in the saints; they are to walk in the same character, a character of sacrificial love in which one is prepared to suffer and surrender for the benefit of our fellow saints.<a name=3:14></a> I should think the heavenly blessings are connected with the sin-offering, because its blood went into the holy place; the blood of the burnt-offering never did.<a name=3:15></a> The sin-offering meets the glory of God in such an absolute way as to leave the blessed God a perfectly free hand so that He can have a company for heavenly blessing or for earthly blessing.<a name=3:16></a>

		C.A.<a name=4:5></a>C.<a name=4:6></a> I think not.<a name=4:7></a> Of course redemption could not be apart from the sin-offering, but the apostle has developed the sin-offering in Romans, and it was not necessary to go over it again.<a name=4:8></a> He has set the blessedness of the sin-offering before us in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>; Christ is there set forth, a mercy-seat on God's behalf through faith in His blood -- that is the sin-offering.<a name=4:9></a> The character of the sin-offering is world-wide; it has a universal bearing because the blood is on the gold -- on the mercy-seat, the throne of God.<a name=4:10></a> The glory of God in all its fulness is met by the blood of the sin-offering -- that is the blood on the gold.<a name=4:11></a> The blood brought such eternal satisfaction to God of every claim necessitated by the condition which has come in through sin, so that God can carry out the good pleasure of His will, can justify sinners, can bring Israel into earthly blessing in the world to come, can bless the nations and in the assembly have a company in heavenly blessing.<a name=4:12></a> The blood of the sin-offering has met the glory of God, and based on it God can show Himself rich in mercy.<a name=4:13></a> In verse 7 it is the Person who is emphasised and though the blood is mentioned, it is in the Person that we have redemption.<a name=4:14></a> In verse 3 the blessings are <i>in Christ</i>, in verse 4 we are chosen <i>in Him</i>, and it is <i>through Jesus Christ</i> we are marked out for sonship, it is <i>in the Beloved</i> we are taken into favour, and we have redemption <i>in Him</i>.<a name=4:15></a> It is the greatness of Christ brought before us as the One by whom God can fill His own heart with delight and His universe with blessing; He has a Person great enough to do that.<a name=4:16></a> In this chapter we get faith in Christ in that character; not only as the Saviour who died to save poor sinners, but faith in Christ as the One great

		The first chapter is chiefly connected with "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory" (verse 17).<a name=32:13></a> I understand the use of this name conveys the thought that God is the Author and Originator of a circle of things characterised by glory.<a name=32:14></a> It is a scene of glory that is brought before us where everything is headed up in Christ.<a name=32:15></a> We are brought in according to God's eternal

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get the power by which all this is effected.<a name=33:4></a> There is no doubt that man has gone from the lowest place in God's universe to the highest place by "the working of the might" of God's strength.<a name=33:5></a> The Lord Jesus came into death for us to maintain the glory of God in respect of all that we had done and all that we were, and God's mighty power came in and raised Him from the dead and set Him in the highest place in the universe.<a name=33:6></a> It is that power that is "towards us who believe".<a name=33:7></a> Nothing less than that power could take us up from death and put us in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=33:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 we see that God has marked us out for sonship "to the praise of the glory of his grace", and we have obtained an inheritance in Christ that "we should be to the praise of his glory"; but in chapter 2 we see what God is doing for the satisfaction of His love.<a name=33:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"God, being rich in mercy" comes in because of our state and condition; nothing but the wealth of mercy could have met us, but on God's side it is "because of his great love wherewith he loved us".<a name=33:10></a> God has taken us up, not only in the depth of mercy, but to satisfy His own love.<a name=33:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three wonderful and blessed things stated in connection with this: He "has quickened us with the Christ" (verse 5), He "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" (verse 6).<a name=33:12></a> The object in view in all this is that we may be brought consciously into the presence of the holy love of God.<a name=33:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the love of God.<a name=34:1></a> I have no doubt the Old Testament saints knew something of God as being rich in mercy, but it was impossible they could know Him in the satisfaction of His love.<a name=34:2></a> The reason is simple: the Object which alone could furnish satisfaction to the love of God was not yet revealed.<a name=34:3></a> But when the Son of God came here "the heaven was opened .<a name=34:4></a>.<a name=34:5></a>.<a name=34:6></a> and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:21">Luke  3:21</a>, 22.<a name=34:7></a> The Father's love found its perfect repose in that blessed One, and He found His repose in the love of which he was the Object -- He was "in the bosom of the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=34:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the beloved Son was alone in the presence of the Father's love.<a name=34:9></a> If we were to be brought into it He must die; there was necessity for our sinful flesh to be removed.<a name=34:10></a> The death and judgment due to us have come upon Him.<a name=34:11></a> Sinful flesh could not be brought into the presence of God's love, but it has been condemned in the death of Christ; and another thing, that condition of being, human life in flesh and blood, with which in us sin and death have come into contact, has been brought to an end before God in the death of Christ.<a name=34:12></a> The end of all flesh has come before God.<a name=34:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And when Christ rose from the dead it was in an entirely new state -- quickened in the Spirit; it is a state with which sin and death never had, and never can have, any contact whatever, "In that he lives, he lives to God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:10">Romans  6:10</a>.<a name=34:14></a> He is for ever absolutely apart from every question of sin and death, having taken up all those questions once at the cross for the glory of God.<a name=34:15></a> He now lives in resurrection in the presence of God's holy love.<a name=34:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great thing for us is to see that God would bring us to live together with Him in the presence of that wondrous love.<a name=34:17></a> To be quickened together with Christ is to be made to live in spirit outside everything that has been

		"And to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" (verse 19).<a name=38:11></a> This is a far wider thought than His love to us, blessed as that is.<a name=38:12></a> It is the deep devoted love in which He has taken up all the Father's counsels and will give full effect to them for the Father's glory.<a name=38:13></a> We miss a great deal of the fulness of Scripture by attaching things so much to ourselves.<a name=38:14></a> The Father would have us to see the wonderful place that Christ holds in relation to a 'vast universe of bliss', and how He will pervade it all with His own love, so that it may be filled with what answers perfectly to the Father.<a name=38:15></a> The love of Christ will extend to the utmost bounds of the universe of bliss.<a name=38:16></a>

		C.A.<a name=89:7></a>C.<a name=89:8></a> It is noticeable that of the nine references to the assembly in this epistle, six of them come in the few verses that we have read, so that it is peculiarly an assembly setting of things that is before us here.<a name=89:9></a> And it seems to be worthy of note that what is brought before us in this section is brought out in an affectionate relation.<a name=89:10></a> It is rather remarkable that Paul did not bring out the truth of the assembly as the wife in the teaching part of the epistle; he does not bring it out until he comes to address wives and husbands.<a name=89:11></a> That is, he puts it in an affectionate setting and brings it out in connection with the most affectionate relations that are known to men.<a name=89:12></a>

		C.A.<a name=113:1></a>C.<a name=113:2></a> It is very striking how many precious thoughts are brought together in the christian household; it would seem to suggest to us that God intended every christian household to be a treasury of divine thoughts, so that we get in the husband and wife the thought of the headship of Christ and the place of the assembly as standing in relation to Christ as Head.<a name=113:3></a> Then we get the family idea, which is another most important part of the counsel of God.<a name=113:4></a> Then, finally, we get the thought of service, and that brings in another universal thought of God.<a name=113:5></a> I believe to get the scope of this scripture would bring us in view of all the great thoughts which God purposes to work out in His saints, and they are all enshrined in the christian household.<a name=113:6></a>

		C.A.<a name=113:10></a>C.<a name=113:11></a> Well, you see, principles that are established in the christian household would hold good universally, so it would appear that God establishes certain principles in a christian household which have universal scope, in keeping with the character of the epistle.<a name=113:12></a> The greatest principle in the moral universe is the headship of Christ, and it is set forth in every christian husband.<a name=113:13></a> These immense things are brought down and exemplified in that way, and so the wife represents the great principle of subjection to headship, not lordship, but subjection to headship, and I suppose that is an eternal principle.<a name=113:14></a> I think lordship will not be needed in eternity because everything will be in new creation setting, and it will be a matter of subjection to headship.<a name=113:15></a> Now that eternal principle

		is embodied in the assembly and illustrated in every christian wife.<a name=114:1></a> God's primary thought was headship, and the assembly is brought in as the subject vessel getting the gain of headship in subjection.<a name=114:2></a> The second great thought of God is the family thought, and I suppose the family thought is going to be established fully in the universe.<a name=114:3></a> It is brought out in this very epistle that God's thought is to have many families; that is, the family idea is an essential part of the counsel of God, and it is illustrated in every christian family, so that the saints are addressed in this epistle as of the household of God -- that is, they are in the children's place; they are of the household; and the saints are exhorted to be imitators of God as beloved children.<a name=114:4></a> That is the family thought and presently God is going to fill a universe with many families, heavenly families and earthly families, for there will be earthly families throughout eternity as well as heavenly.<a name=114:5></a> The family thought of God is going to be universal, and yet God has embodied it in every christian household; it is very interesting and profoundly instructive.<a name=114:6></a> Further, the principle of service is a universal principle of God and will be so eternally, everything being absolutely at God's disposal and at the disposal of Christ.<a name=114:7></a> Now you see that particular part of the counsel of God is set forth in servants, but it is a universal principle -- we all come in, every saint is a slave.<a name=114:8></a> So the three different relations are covered by the relations in which the saints stand.<a name=114:9></a> We stand as wife in relation to Christ as Head; we stand as children in relation to God as Father, the family thought, and we stand as slaves in relation to Christ as Lord; so the principles illustrated in the christian household are universal.<a name=114:10></a> It becomes the privilege of the husband to exemplify the great principle of headship and the privilege of the wife to exemplify the great principle of subjection in relation to headship; it becomes the privilege of the children

		Ques.<a name=115:3></a> Would you say a little more as to headship?<a name=115:4></a> C.<a name=115:5></a>A.<a name=115:6></a>C.<a name=115:7></a> Headship is a question of influence rather than authority, and that is very important as having its source in God Himself.<a name=115:8></a> I suppose the greatest truth in Scripture -- if we may venture to single out one truth and speak of it in that way -- is the truth of the headship of God: "The Christ's head God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:3">1 Corinthians  11:3</a>.<a name=115:9></a> David was in the light of the headship of God; he says, "Thou art exalted as Head above all; and riches and glory are of thee", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:11">1 Chronicles  29:11</a>, 12.<a name=115:10></a> He is in the presence of the headship of God.<a name=115:11></a> Now we see in Christ One who ever looked up with reverence and affection to God as His Head.<a name=115:12></a> He was always influenced by God, no other influence ever controlled Him; so every christian man is to look up to Christ as his Head, to be influenced by Christ, and if we look up to Him with reverence and affection we shall be influenced by Him.<a name=115:13></a> This principle comes down from God to Christ, and from Christ to the christian man, and from the christian man to his wife, so that a holy and divine influence is extended in that way.<a name=115:14></a> Influence is not exactly like law.<a name=115:15></a> For instance, the king of this country is the king and he has authority.<a name=115:16></a> If he gives an order it has to be obeyed -- that is authority.<a name=115:17></a> But the king is also the head of society in this country, and the way the king behaves influences the whole of the society of the country.<a name=115:18></a> If the king is a moral man and a religious man, his influence would pervade every part of society; if he is a licentious man, that influence would pervade society.<a name=115:19></a> Now it seems to me that these are the thoughts connected with headship -- influence that controls, not exactly by
