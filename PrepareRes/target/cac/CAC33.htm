	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the deepest interest to consider the state and happiness of departed saints.<a name=6:1></a> Countless thousands in the course of past centuries have "fallen asleep", and each day adds to their number.<a name=6:2></a> But the subject is not only of general interest as referring to the present state of millions of saints beloved of God, and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.<a name=6:3></a> It appeals to us on very close and personal grounds as we think of those we have known and loved, and with whom we have enjoyed christian intercourse and fellowship, who are no longer here.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in times of personal bereavement it is a very real and divine comfort to have distinctly before our hearts the character of the blessedness which our departed loved ones enjoy.<a name=6:5></a> The Lord has most perfect consideration and sympathy for us in these times of grief.<a name=6:6></a> And one very distinct form which His consideration for us has taken is that He has been pleased to tell us what the blessedness of the departed is, while they await the full and final triumph of divine love and power which will invest them with spiritual and glorious bodies like the body of Him who sits as a risen and glorified Man at God's right hand.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the Lord has seen fit to give us such a clear view of the happy state of those who are fallen asleep, we may be well assured that there is that in it which will prove of the greatest comfort to us in our sorrow.<a name=6:8></a> But I think we shall find that there is much more than this in it; we shall find it possessed of power to carry our hearts into a region where no sorrow can come.<a name=6:9></a> How blessed to be brought in mind and affection to such a region by the grace of the Lord, and by the power of the Spirit!<a name=6:10></a> That is, to be brought to taste and know in a deeper and fuller way what the Lord Jesus Christ
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is: and to know that we, and all His saints, are for ever bound up with Him, to possess and enjoy through Him and in Him and with Him the precious fruit of the love and victory of God!<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this which departed saints enjoy, without any hindrance from the flesh, or creature weakness, or circumstances.<a name=7:2></a> Their joy is not in its character different from that which is the present portion of saints; so that the more clearly we see <i>their</i> blessedness the better shall we apprehend <i>our</i> own.<a name=7:3></a> And this brings the true blessedness of christianity home to our hearts in a very simple and effective way, and shows that it lies completely outside this world.<a name=7:4></a> To enjoy it we have to be in spirit, as the departed saints are actually, quite apart from this world.<a name=7:5></a> And the more our affections entertain the thought of what <i>they</i> enjoy, the more shall <i>we</i> be drawn to the present good of that Person who is their portion and happiness.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are four passages of Scripture in the New Testament which speak of the state of departed saints.<a name=7:7></a> As to number of words, they are few, but as to significance, what they convey is blessed beyond expression.<a name=7:8></a> They are as follows:

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:43">Luke  23:43</a>).<a name=7:9></a>

		"We are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:8">2 Corinthians  5:8</a>).<a name=7:10></a> "Having the desire for departure and being with Christ, for it is very much better" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:23">Philippians  1:23</a>).<a name=7:11></a>

		"And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Write, Blessed the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth.<a name=7:12></a> Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:13">Revelation  14:13</a>).<a name=7:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How plainly do we see from these scriptures -- particularly from the first three -- that the blessedness of departed saints lies in the company of a Person!<a name=7:14></a> The full title of that Person is the Lord Jesus Christ, and these scriptures show

		us that each part of that title gives character to the divine felicity of those who are with Him.<a name=8:1></a> In the first scripture it is the blessedness of being with Jesus that is emphasised; in the second it is the thought of being with Him as the Lord; while in the third the "very much better" portion is to be with Christ.<a name=8:2></a> How great is the happiness thus brought before us!<a name=8:3></a> May our hearts burn as we consider it!<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise" was the word of Jesus to one who had only known and trusted Him for a few minutes -- one to whom infinite grace brought blessing in the last solemn hour of a sinful history.<a name=8:5></a> In his case, at any rate, there could be no question of human merit.<a name=8:6></a> Whatever he got in those last wondrous moments of his life on earth -- whatever happiness paradise itself could afford him -- was brought to him by the Person near whom he hung upon the cross, and secured to him in divine righteousness by the death of that blessed One.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of the One who was there!<a name=8:8></a> Think of Jesus, the blessed Vessel of divine grace, as the Holy Spirit presents Him to us in this gospel of Luke!<a name=8:9></a> He was God's salvation for sinful men; the One anointed to preach glad tidings to the poor; the One who said that He came not to call righteous persons but sinful ones to repentance!<a name=8:10></a> He was indeed the Creditor, but here to pronounce a frank forgiveness to all His debtors!<a name=8:11></a> The Samaritan freely expending divine wealth and resources in compassion upon the misery of man ruined by sin and Satan!<a name=8:12></a> The One who told of the great supper of grace, and of the blessed invitings and compellings of divine love!<a name=8:13></a> The Shepherd who would go after the sheep which was lost until He found it!<a name=8:14></a> The One who as the Vessel of all the grace of heaven told of the joy of God in receiving a repentant prodigal!<a name=8:15></a> The One who by the grace of God tasted death so that the river of that grace might flow forth for world-wide blessing through a channel of divine righteousness!<a name=8:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may consider that the penitent thief of Calvary knew but little of the fulness of grace that resided in Jesus.<a name=9:2></a> And there are many indications in the gospels that the disciples, and even the apostles, failed to realise that grace in its proper character and glory.<a name=9:3></a> But it was all there in Him.<a name=9:4></a> No dullness of apprehension on their part, no want of capacity to take it in, could make that grace one whit less than it really was.<a name=9:5></a> It was God manifest in flesh, not imputing trespasses, but winning men's hearts by presenting to them all that He was in grace, and all that His grace delighted to do for them, without looking for one scrap of merit or goodness on their part as the condition of blessing.<a name=9:6></a> Would that our hearts understood better what He was, for what He was is what He is and will be eternally!<a name=9:7></a>

		There are feeble believers today, but the question is, On <i>whom</i> do they believe?<a name=9:8></a> Is it Jesus, the blessed Son of God?<a name=9:9></a> Then their blessing is measured by what He is, and by the grace which He brought, and which He died to secure in righteousness for them -- lost, guilty and ungodly as they were.<a name=9:10></a>

		The mystery was made known to the apostle Paul by revelation, and it was bound up with the glad tidings which he preached, as we learn from <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a> and <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:2">Ephesians  3:2</a> - 12 and <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:19">Ephesians  6:19</a>.<a name=19:1></a> He spoke of it to the Corinthians (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:7">1 Corinthians  2:7</a>, 12, 13), and to the Colossians.<a name=19:2></a> This truth is universal, and is for the enlightenment of all.<a name=19:3></a> It is in no way limited to anything local.<a name=19:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another important part of Paul's teaching is that the assembly is the house of God (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=19:5></a> There is one foundation, one corner-stone, and in Jesus Christ "all the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord; in whom ye also [Gentiles] are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:21">Ephesians  2:21</a>, 22).<a name=19:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul speaks further of the saints as being called by God "into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>), and that their fellowship is set forth in the cup which we bless and the bread which we break (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>, 17).<a name=19:7></a> He assumes that all believers bless the cup and break the bread, for he says, "we".<a name=19:8></a> It is evident that there cannot be two divine fellowships.<a name=19:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, or the Spirit of God by him, gives no hint that the assembly, in a universal sense, was an invisible body.<a name=19:10></a> He regards it as one body on earth, gifts being bestowed with a view to its edifying, that it may work for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:1">Ephesians  4:1</a> - 16).<a name=19:11></a> The saints are called in one body to let the peace of Christ preside in their hearts.<a name=19:12></a> There is no thought of an invisible body.<a name=19:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I Corinthians gives us the truth as it is to characterise each local assembly, for it is addressed not only to Corinth, but to "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=19:14></a> The saints universally are set in the light of

		that epistle, which makes known that all saints are baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body (chapter 12: 12, 13).<a name=20:1></a> "The Christ" (verse 12) is clearly a corporate designation of the saints as one body, which could not be limited to one locality.<a name=20:2></a> The saints at Corinth were "Christ's body, and members in particular" (chapter 12: 27), but only in virtue of having part in the universal unity of chapter 12: 12, 13.<a name=20:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In that epistle we see that assembly administration is to be carried on locally.<a name=20:4></a> The saints at Corinth were directly responsible to the Lord to exercise discipline upon an evildoer in their midst.<a name=20:5></a> Such an act was to be done in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>it would be bound in heaven.<a name=20:6></a> If, after the Corinthian assembly had acted thus in discipline by the Lord's commandment, the assembly at Cenchrea had said that the act did not bind them, the latter assembly would have been marked by pure lawlessness.<a name=20:7></a> It was binding, if for no other reason, on the ground that there is "one Lord" who had entrusted responsibility to act for Him in such matters to the local assembly, and whose name was connected with their action.<a name=20:8></a> In apostolic times "the power of our Lord Jesus Christ" was formally associated with His name when the assembly dealt with evil (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:4">1 Corinthians  5:4</a>).<a name=20:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to pass from the days of the apostles to our own, we find that, in the revival of the truth over a century ago, what was prominent in the minds of the spiritual was the truth of the assembly.<a name=20:10></a> We have been told that the light broke into the soul of Mr.<a name=20:11></a> J.<a name=20:12></a> N.<a name=20:13></a> Darby that there was a Head in heaven.<a name=20:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, said he to himself, there must be a body on earth.<a name=20:15></a> If we read his early writings, such as <i>Considerations on the Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ</i> written in 1828, we find that it is the assembly which is before him, and its moral and spiritual features.<a name=20:16></a> The coming together of saints was to be in the light of those features which pertain to the assembly universally.<a name=20:17></a> The revival was definitely on the line of Paul's glad tidings, and of Paul's ministry of the assembly.<a name=20:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=21>[Page 21]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brethren who were spiritually instructed had no such thought as that it was the divine intent that the assembly in its universal aspect should be, or should become, invisible.<a name=21:1></a> On the contrary, they felt deeply the fact that it had become so; that 'the true Church of God has no avowed communion at all' was a grievous evil to be mourned over and confessed.<a name=21:2></a> They felt that the body is here as a substantive reality to be edified, and to increase with the increase of God.<a name=21:3></a> Christ is sanctifying and purifying the assembly, and nourishing and cherishing it.<a name=21:4></a> This is not in heaven, but down here on earth.<a name=21:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But alongside this revival of Paul's doctrine there was developing amongst the brethren an entirely different system of teaching.<a name=21:6></a> There were those who held that the assembly in its universal aspect had become invisible, and that nothing now remained but to set up local assemblies, each being a self-contained body, having no responsibility with reference to other such bodies, and free to receive any individual believer supposed to be personally sound in the faith and consistent in life, without taking any account of the associations in which he may have been previously.<a name=21:7></a> The truth of <i>the</i> assembly in its general unity, calling for recognition in a practical way by those who have the light of it, thus entirely lost its due place.<a name=21:8></a> According to this system of teaching, each separate meeting is an independent 'assembly', even if there are several in one town.<a name=21:9></a> Scripture never speaks of different assemblies in one city.<a name=21:10></a> At Jerusalem, where there were thousands of believers, and where they no doubt met in many different places, it is always "the assembly" -- in the singular.<a name=21:11></a> The idea of independent churches, without any recognition of a universal bond of <i>responsible</i> partnership, is quite foreign to Scripture.<a name=21:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are thus two different conceptions in the minds of brethren.<a name=21:13></a> One was governed by the thought of the unity of the whole assembly as one body, one house, one temple, and by the thought of all the saints everywhere being called
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to one universal fellowship.<a name=22:1></a> The other was based on the idea of each meeting being an independent 'assembly'.<a name=22:2></a> The moment was bound to come when these two different principles would be found to be entirely out of keeping with each other.<a name=22:3></a> It was not long before circumstances arose which brought this to light.<a name=22:4></a> But it is important to recognise that what happened at Plymouth did not bring about the difference of principles.<a name=22:5></a> It only served to expose what was there before.<a name=22:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=22:7></a> Darby and others separated from the original meeting at Plymouth in 1845 because clericalism was set up there, which they rightly judged was not of God.<a name=22:8></a> But the Lord in His wisdom did not allow this particular matter to become the general test.<a name=22:9></a> In 1847 it was discovered that Mr.<a name=22:10></a> Newton held and taught most serious error as to the Lord's personal relationships.<a name=22:11></a> This false teaching definitely raised the question as to whether <i>fellowship</i> involved a <i>responsible</i> partnership or not.<a name=22:12></a> The extreme gravity of false teaching as to the Lord's relationships ought to have helped the brethren to be very sensitive in their affections, as well as in conscience and intelligence.<a name=22:13></a> They ought all to have weighed well that fellowship (or partnership) with such error was most serious in the sight of God.<a name=22:14></a> The ground was taken eventually at Bethesda, that the error was condemned, but that fellowship with it by breaking bread with those who held it was no bar to communion, and that no individual believer was to be held responsible for what he might be walking in partnership with, unless he actually avowed the error himself.<a name=22:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus where this principle is adhered to, no assembly bond of partnership which involves saints in common <i>responsibility</i> is admitted.<a name=22:16></a> Each is regarded as an individual who is not to be held responsible for any associations he may have been in, but only for his personal views and conduct.<a name=22:17></a> There is no thought of <i>fellowship</i> in this, for fellowship means a common equal sharing, or joint participation, and this, when it is a question of breaking bread, in a most solemn way as before God.<a name=22:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that defilement is contracted by touching what is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		unclean is clearly laid down in the Old Testament, and the New Testament expressly says, "Touch not what is unclean" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>).<a name=23:1></a> It is also clear in Scripture that a much less thing than breaking bread with a person may involve one in responsibility for what he does, for John says that the one who gives a friendly greeting to a man who does not bring the doctrine of Christ "partakes [the verbal form of the word fellowship] in his wicked works" (<a href="../bible/2John.htm#11">2 John  11</a>).<a name=23:2></a> One is viewed as in fellowship with his wicked works if simply greeting him.<a name=23:3></a> This shows what a very small thing, as men would say, involves responsibility as before God for one's associations.<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If to break bread with an evil-doer does not, in the minds of believers, involve any complicity in his evil, neither does breaking bread with faithful saints involve the recognition that we are in the most intimate partnership with them.<a name=23:5></a> The sense of the divine bond is lost; persons break bread as so many individuals without any sense of responsible partnership.<a name=23:6></a> So that, according to these principles, the local assembly takes independent ground in declining to be bound by any assembly action other than its own, and the individual is held free of any responsibility, even in his own assembly, for anything that may have taken place there save his own views and his own conduct.<a name=23:7></a> This principle annuls responsibility in regard of associations, which Scripture so carefully maintains; it entirely sets aside the true thought of fellowship.<a name=23:8></a>

		Truth and divine principles do not change, but it has not been the way of God -- either when first giving the truth through the apostles, or in reviving it during the last century -- to give all the truth at once, or the full bearing of it.<a name=24:23></a> He has brought it out as the needs of the church required, according to the exercises of the time, and with regard to the conditions obtaining in relation to His testimony.<a name=24:24></a> It is well to inquire what the conditions were, under which J.<a name=24:25></a>N.<a name=24:26></a>D.<a name=24:27></a> and J.<a name=24:28></a>B.<a name=24:29></a>S.<a name=24:30></a> wrote as they did.<a name=24:31></a>

		Now I do not learn from Scripture that it has ever been God's way suddenly to disown, or break the link with, what has been, in its day, of Himself when He brings in further and greater light.<a name=25:7></a> He acts in patient consideration for His people.<a name=25:8></a> He respects, if one may so say, His former ways.<a name=25:9></a> He has regard to that which He may have been pleased to use even though it fell short of what was in His mind.<a name=25:10></a> It was so when judaism was superseded by christianity; there was a transition period during which the separation between the old and the new was not definite.<a name=25:11></a> The faithful remnant entered into the blessings of the new order without altogether severing themselves from the former system -- now really set aside by God.<a name=25:12></a> It was not until the epistle to the Hebrews was written that they were definitely called to "go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach".<a name=25:13></a>

		C.A.<a name=83:1></a>C.<a name=83:2></a> Questions often arise in the minds of young believers, and old ones too sometimes, as to the Spirit, and it is well for us to see how the Spirit is given and for what purpose.<a name=83:3></a> We find in this scripture that it is one great expression of the kindness and love of the Saviour God to man.<a name=83:4></a> There is not a feature on man's side which is commendable; Paul says, "We were once ourselves also without intelligence, disobedient", etc.<a name=83:5></a> (verse 3).<a name=83:6></a> That is the condition on our side, and the kindness and love of our Saviour God appeared in those conditions; and His mercy appeared, not on the principle of works which we had done, but it is all God's doing from first to last.<a name=83:7></a> God's doing and what we have done are plainly contrasted.<a name=83:8></a> God's object in appearing in kindness and love to man was to introduce an entirely new condition, which is spoken of here as the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.<a name=83:9></a> All is from God's side, and it is pure mercy; it is important to see that.<a name=83:10></a>

		In the first place we learn that it is the pleasure of God that the Son of man should be supreme over all His works (verse 7).<a name=112:4></a> Adam was a figure of this, for he was placed at the head of creation to exercise dominion, God thus setting forth at the very beginning the great thought of His own mind.<a name=112:5></a> But Adam was quickly cast down from his excellency, for he proved him self to be unable to stand against the power of evil.<a name=112:6></a> Evil could and did touch him, and he fell, we might say, at the first touch.<a name=112:7></a> But if the figure has thus broken down, it is that it may give place to the substance -- to that which cannot break down, to that which was in the mind of God when He created the figure.<a name=112:8></a> For I apprehend it would not be going too far to say that man in innocence was not morally suited to be set over the works of God's hands, and to have all things put under his feet.<a name=112:9></a> It was not suited to God that the universe should be set in order without every moral question having its perfect solution.<a name=112:10></a> With an innocent man at the head of creation the whole question of good and evil was necessarily in abeyance.<a name=112:11></a> Under such circumstances neither righteousness nor holiness could be displayed; the moral ordering of the universe would have been wanting in most essential particulars.<a name=112:12></a>

		We will now consider, briefly, how Christ as High Priest "by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the holy of holies, having found an eternal redemption" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:12">Hebrews  9:12</a>).<a name=143:10></a> The tabernacle figure is in the mind of the Spirit all through this part of the epistle, though it is "the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation)" (verse 11).<a name=143:11></a> Christ has entered the holiest "once for all"; there is no thought of His coming out again until He appears the second time without sin for salvation.<a name=143:12></a> This shows that His sacrificial work is completed for ever.<a name=143:13></a> He is in the holiest in the permanent value of it, and there will never be any other ground on which consciences can be purified or the eternal inheritance received.<a name=143:14></a> The thought of the holiest is taken up from the figure of the tabernacle, but later in the chapter He is said to have entered "into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us" (verse 24).<a name=143:15></a> The holy of holies suggests a place of approach to God marked by holiness in an intensified degree.<a name=143:16></a> The types of the tabernacle

		There is one more aspect of Christ's priesthood which stands in relation to that view of it which we have had before us.<a name=145:4></a> "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water" (chapter 10: 19 - 22).<a name=145:5></a> Boldness for entering into the holy of holies is in the value of the blood of Jesus.<a name=145:6></a> The reference is, no doubt, to the blood of the sin-offering which was sprinkled on and before the mercy-seat on the day of atonement.<a name=145:7></a> That blood, typically, cleansed the sanctuary "from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions in all their sins" (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16:16">Leviticus  16:16</a>).<a name=145:8></a> The cleansing was effected in all the value of the blood; it was a testimony on God's part that blood would be shed of such value that those called by Him might even enter the holy of holies without stain and without fear.<a name=145:9></a> Those who enter do so in the value of the blood of Jesus which has effected cleansing according to the holiness and glory of the blessed God.<a name=145:10></a> The nearer we come to God, the more are the value and cleansing of the blood of Jesus known.<a name=145:11></a> They are better known in the holiest than anywhere else.<a name=145:12></a> Divine glory has had to do with uncleanness and sin in such a way as to secure absolute cleansing according to the holiness of God's sanctuary.<a name=145:13></a> Saints have boldness to enter where all is most holy as knowing that they come there in the value of the blood of Jesus.<a name=145:14></a> Nothing could possibly add to that value in the estimation of God; it has

		Everything connected with our old state and history was dealt with and removed in the death of Christ, but that is not all.<a name=155:8></a> The declaration of God has come out in the death of His Son, who came into death, not only to banish every cloud and remove every spot, but in order that there might be a way paved with divine love over which our souls might travel adoringly into nearness to God.<a name=155:9></a> It is "the new and living way"; it lives in all the blessedness of divine love, and Christ is the One who has opened it up.<a name=155:10></a> He had to remove in holy judgment all that we were, but in the very place where He did so, He disclosed the depths of the heart of God that we might live in the love of God.<a name=155:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Difficulties are apt to discourage us if we do not see the true character of the race we are exhorted to run, and if we do not know the gracious use which God makes of the attendant exercises.<a name=157:3></a> The first thing we need is to be assured that we are in the right path, and then it is a great cheer to know that whatever opposition comes in the way is discipline for us, and is "for profit, in order to the partaking of his holiness" (verse 10).<a name=157:4></a>

		It has often been said that the first question with a soul is, 'Heaven or hell?<a name=158:3></a>' We can all understand John Bunyan's pilgrim running to the wicket gate with his fingers in his ears lest any voice should persuade him to turn back.<a name=158:4></a> It was heaven or hell with him; his eternal weal or woe was at stake.<a name=158:5></a> I dare say some us of ran rather fast at that stage of our experience.<a name=158:6></a> But farther on in his journey, when the pilgrim came to the hill Difficulty and found the arbour, he settled down and went to sleep.<a name=158:7></a> The second question with the soul is, 'Heaven or earth?<a name=158:8></a>' Many are glad enough to escape hell who are not at all anxious to get away from earth.<a name=158:9></a> They settle down and go to sleep instead of running.<a name=158:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course no one would <i>run</i> to a place he did not want to reach, but if we are partakers of the heavenly calling, and know the heavenly Priest, our hearts are attracted to heaven; we have links with heaven, and heaven is an attractive place to us.<a name=158:11></a> I do not believe anyone is in the race here spoken of who does not like heaven better than earth.<a name=158:12></a> The Son of God has come down from heaven that He might throw the golden chain of divine love round our hearts and link us with Himself for ever.<a name=158:13></a> And He is now in heaven to attract our affections thitherward.<a name=158:14></a> Heaven is a most attractive place to everyone whose affections are set upon Christ, and such are all eager to run the race which has heaven for its goal.<a name=158:15></a> This race is not, as some suppose, the race of life; it is a moral journey -- a race from earth to heaven -- and those who are in it have turned their faces to heaven, and they want to get morally away from the earth and nearer to heaven.<a name=158:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first indication that one has entered upon this race is the discovery that certain things are a hindrance to us; we begin to feel the "weights".<a name=158:17></a> Some believers do not seem to have any "weights"; you never see them laying anything

		aside.<a name=159:1></a> The fact is, they have never made a start in the race.<a name=159:2></a> A man who was sitting still might have a heavy weight in his pocket without being conscious of it, but if he began to run he would soon feel it and want to lay it aside.<a name=159:3></a> The longer and faster you run the more sensitive you become to "weights".<a name=159:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a close affinity between "weights" and "sin", but still there are things which we could hardly speak of as "sin" which may be serious "weights".<a name=159:5></a> For example, I could not say that to be on friendly terms with a half-hearted or worldly believer was exactly a <i>sin</i>, but it might become a heavy <i>weight</i> to anyone who really wanted to get on.<a name=159:6></a> So far as I have seen, companionship with undecided and half-hearted Christians is as spiritually injurious as friendship with unconverted people.<a name=159:7></a> "Go from the presence of a foolish man, in whom thou perceivest not the lips of knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#14:7">Proverbs  14:7</a>).<a name=159:8></a> 1 have known many Christians who have discovered that a tobacco-pipe was a "weight", and I have not yet met a believer who felt that he had been helped heavenward by reading the newspaper.<a name=159:9></a> Worldly literature is a heavy "weight" to many.<a name=159:10></a> There is nothing in it to attract the heart to Christ in glory; it drags the mind and heart down to the earth.<a name=159:11></a> And, what was, perhaps, specially in the mind of the Spirit, an earthly system of religion is a great "weight".<a name=159:12></a> Judaism had all the sanction of a divine origin and the splendour of an imposing ritual; it was invested with a halo of traditional glory which acted powerfully on human feelings of veneration for antiquity.<a name=159:13></a> Yet, for the Christian, all this was a "weight" to be laid aside, a useless encumbrance, a positive hindrance.<a name=159:14></a> And we have the same hindrance to lay aside today, for christianity has been perverted into a modified kind of judaism, in which people are occupied with religious things on earth, and thus hindered from running the race to heaven.<a name=159:15></a> It would be a great gain if all Christians were exercised to keep their hearts free from the influence of religious things on earth.<a name=159:16></a>

		At this point I may say that some believers make a mistake in fancying they are much hindered by things which are really a help to them.<a name=160:1></a> They complain of the opposition they meet with at home, and of the many trials they have in connection with their daily work, and so on, and they fancy they could get on much better if their circumstances were altered.<a name=160:2></a> But these things are not "weights" to be laid aside; they are part of God's helpful discipline, and it would be a spiritual loss to be without them.<a name=160:3></a> I have known Christians fret and chafe under their circumstances, and seek to change them, until God has given them their request, and the result has been leanness in their souls.<a name=160:4></a>

		of God's calling lays hold upon it, and it shakes itself free from its entanglements, and clears itself of its unholy links with the world, in order to enjoy its divine privileges.<a name=161:1></a> Shechem is the place of uncompromising decision.<a name=161:2></a> It is where Joshua said to the people, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; .<a name=161:3></a>.<a name=161:4></a>.<a name=161:5></a> as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:15">Joshua  24:15</a>).<a name=161:6></a> "Now therefore put away the strange gods that are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel" (verse 23).<a name=161:7></a> It is at Shechem, morally speaking, that the soul sets itself and strips itself for the race.<a name=161:8></a> And the tree mentioned in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35:4">Genesis  35:4</a> and again in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:26">Joshua  24:26</a> is very suggestive of the cross.<a name=161:9></a> The man who has been at Shechem, and has laid aside every weight and sin, can say, "Far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:14">Galatians  6:14</a>).<a name=161:10></a> Beloved friends, have we reached this point?<a name=161:11></a> To what extent are we really set for Christ and heaven?<a name=161:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The motive power for all this lies in "looking stedfastly on Jesus".<a name=161:13></a> If a Christian surrenders or lays aside anything without an adequate divine motive, he will either secretly hanker after it, and probably ere long return to it, or he will take credit to himself for having given it up, and will thus become self-righteous and spiritually proud.<a name=161:14></a> A certain school of religious teachers at the present day make much of 'surrender' as the way to attain blessing, but it ends in <i>self-sufficiency</i>, because the only motive that is presented for it is the acquisition of a better spiritual state, or power for service, or something of that kind.<a name=161:15></a> A <i>divine motive and attraction</i> is needed if souls are to be drawn into the race and prepared to surrender things in a truly spiritual way, and this divine motive and attraction is an Object outside ourselves altogether.<a name=161:16></a> It is <i>Christ in glory</i>.<a name=161:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it may be helpful at this point to consider for a few moments the great end which God has in view in every form of chastening.<a name=165:3></a> It is "for profit, in order to the partaking of his holiness"; although "no chastening at the time seems to be matter of joy, but of grief, but afterwards yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those exercised by it" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:10">Hebrews  12:10</a>, 11).<a name=165:4></a>

		I should like to point out what it is to be a partaker of God's holiness.<a name=165:5></a> I can only suggest the thought of it, and you may work it out for yourselves.<a name=165:6></a> It has often been said that Scripture gives the history of two men: Adam and Christ.<a name=165:7></a> And the whole history leads to the conclusion that <i>Adam</i> will not do for God, but <i>Christ will</i>.<a name=165:8></a> The summing up of the whole truth of christianity is that there is only one Man before God for His pleasure, and that Man is <i>Christ</i>.<a name=165:9></a> The holiness of God necessitates the absolute setting aside of man in the flesh, but finds its eternal rest and satisfaction in Christ.<a name=165:10></a> We see the condemnation of sin in the flesh at the cross, and God is bent upon His children being made partakers of His holiness.<a name=165:11></a> There is a necessity for the practical displacement in us of that which was judged and removed from before God at the cross.<a name=165:12></a> Chastisement is always "for destruction of the flesh" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:5">1 Corinthians  5:5</a>).<a name=165:13></a> It always has the effect of reducing and bringing to nothing the activity and energy of man's will and natural powers.<a name=165:14></a> How His chastening exercises us to this end we may learn in three typical cases which present illustrations of the three kinds of chastening to which the children of God are subjected.<a name=165:15></a> The three cases I refer to are those of Paul, Job and David.<a name=165:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul must have been a man of great natural energy, and yet he was brought to glory in his weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.<a name=166:5></a> He had to learn that if "a man in Christ" (verse 2) could be caught up to the third heaven it was a man "in Christ" who could go there.<a name=166:6></a> As a man in the flesh, he had to find himself still subject to the terrible buffetings of "a messenger of Satan".<a name=166:7></a> And the practical effect of the buffeting was that, as to himself, he was conscious of nothing but weakness.<a name=166:8></a> All the energy that belonged to him naturally was reduced.<a name=166:9></a> Do you think that any of us like this process?<a name=166:10></a> I am sure we do not.<a name=166:11></a> Nothing but the present "supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:19">Philippians  1:19</a>) -- the present ministry to our hearts of the grace of Christ -- will enable us to bear it.<a name=166:12></a> "My grace suffices thee" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:9">2 Corinthians  12:9</a>) said the Lord to His tried and devoted servant.<a name=166:13></a> The grace of the Lord is sufficient to make us willing to be weak and small.<a name=166:14></a> And when, by His grace, we are willing to be weak, we learn the blessed secret that "my power is perfected in weakness".<a name=166:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Discipline breaks down what is of the flesh, but when we are willing, through the grace of Christ, that it should be broken down, we find that instead of being spiritually weakened we have gained immensely.<a name=166:16></a> The knowledge of this enabled Paul to say, "Most gladly therefore will I rather

		boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me.<a name=167:1></a> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful" (verses 9, 10).<a name=167:2></a> Thus, conscious of nothing but weakness in himself, he found all-sufficient grace and strength in Christ.<a name=167:3></a> Often when a caravan is crossing the desert some member of the company will fall sick, and will at last become so feeble that they are obliged to leave him behind to die.<a name=167:4></a> And in such cases they will often stretch a little tent over the dying man, to shield him from the fierce rays of the sun until he breathes his last.<a name=167:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some such figure was present to the apostle's mind when he said, "Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me".<a name=167:6></a> He says in effect, 'I am just a mass of weakness, without a single pulsation of power in myself, but I accept this weakness with joy because it becomes the occasion for the power of Christ to dwell upon me'.<a name=167:7></a> It is perfectly lovely.<a name=167:8></a> The strength and energy of Paul as a man in the flesh were displaced by the grace and strength of Christ.<a name=167:9></a> He thus became a partaker of God's holiness -- the broken and reduced, but happy vessel of divine grace and power.<a name=167:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And we cannot read the epistle to the Philippians without seeing the gracious effect of a life of discipline in the school of God.<a name=167:11></a> The complete setting aside of his own will; the absorbing expectation and hope that Christ might be magnified in his body, whether by life or death; the lovely spiritual affections which shine out in so many ways; indeed, the whole epistle, so far as it presents the spirit and character of the writer, is one beautiful cluster of "the peaceful fruit of righteousness".<a name=167:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A second form of chastening comes to us in the way of things common to men, of which we get a full illustration in the history of Job.<a name=167:13></a> I think Job had to endure every kind of suffering that is common to men.<a name=167:14></a> He had to taste the sorrow of bereavement, of the loss of property, and of terrible

	<div class="paragraph">
		personal affliction.<a name=168:1></a> But God's end in it all was that Job might profit and become a partaker of His holiness.<a name=168:2></a> Job had a good deal of what we might call his own holiness before, but not until the end of the book do we find him really in the line of God's holiness.<a name=168:3></a> Like many others, he had connected the fruit of God's grace with himself, and in a certain way had taken credit to himself for that which divine grace had wrought in him.<a name=168:4></a> There had been much in him that was the fruit of grace, but it had turned into a kind of spiritual self-satisfaction.<a name=168:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with Job's history we learn a principle of the greatest importance.<a name=168:6></a> That is, he never got the good of the chastening until he found himself in the presence of the Lord.<a name=168:7></a> It was when Paul turned to the Lord that he got the profit and benefit of his chastening, and I believe it is ever thus.<a name=168:8></a> It is in the presence of the Lord that we get the good of chastening.<a name=168:9></a> One has seen people go through great sorrow and suffering without getting much good from it, and I think in such cases there is no real turning to the Lord about it -- no true recognition of His hand in it.<a name=168:10></a> Hence the Holy Spirit says, "Despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:5">Hebrews  12:5</a>, 6).<a name=168:11></a> It is of great importance that we should recognise the hand and heart of God in any chastening that comes upon us.<a name=168:12></a> This puts us, as it were, in His presence, to learn there the profitable lessons He would teach us.<a name=168:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Job, in the presence of God, says, "I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:6">Job  42:6</a>).<a name=168:14></a> Now he has learned his lesson; he has discovered that man after the flesh is an object to be abhorred; he is now a partaker of God's holiness.<a name=168:15></a> And the peaceful fruit of righteousness comes out, in that he prays for his friends.<a name=168:16></a> He conducts himself toward them according to divine grace, in spite of all their hard speeches.<a name=168:17></a> He thus becomes to them the practical exponent of grace -- a subject with which they were very little acquainted.<a name=168:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a third kind of chastening, which comes upon us in the form of correction for sin.<a name=169:1></a> For an illustration of this, and of its effect, I should like you to consider the history of David.<a name=169:2></a> You have, no doubt, noticed that the Spirit of God has brought together, in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#22">2 Samuel  22</a>and 23, two of David's songs.<a name=169:3></a> One belongs to his early days, for he "spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul".<a name=169:4></a> The other contains "the last words of David".<a name=169:5></a> What a contrast there is between the two!<a name=169:6></a> In the first it is all triumph, he is exulting in what God has done for him; but in the last, as he thinks of the character of the One who is to rule over men in the fear of God, he has to say sorrowfully, "Although my house be not so before God" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:5">2 Samuel  23:5</a>).<a name=169:7></a> Forty years of discipline come between these two songs.<a name=169:8></a> How suggestive is this contrast!<a name=169:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many of us have probably known what it was to rejoice in the grace of God without having apprehended very much of the true character of the flesh.<a name=169:10></a> It has often been noticed that where there is the greatest exuberance of joy in young converts, there is often a levity which fails to take into account that the flesh is unchanged.<a name=169:11></a> In such cases the grace of God is taken up in a self-confident way; there is very little self-distrust, or sense of weakness and dependence.<a name=169:12></a> And the inevitable consequence is a fall, or a succession of falls, that gradually bring home to the consciences of believers their utter weakness and incapacity as in the flesh.<a name=169:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We not only learn thus by our falls and backslidings, but oftentimes these become the occasion of direct chastening on God's part, and we may have to suffer under God's government for years, or for a lifetime, the consequences of our sin and folly.<a name=169:14></a> David fell into a sin, the consequences of which he had to suffer all his life.<a name=169:15></a> He repented, and his sin was put away, but he had to suffer its governmental consequences all his life.<a name=169:16></a> "The sword shall never depart from thy

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, when he numbered the people (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#24">2 Samuel  24</a>), he was not thinking of God, but of David.<a name=170:8></a> It was to make much of David that he would have his people numbered, even though their moral condition was such that they were not willing to pay the half shekel of redemption money, which was requisite to avert a plague (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#30:12">Exodus  30:12</a>).<a name=170:9></a> God would only have His people numbered on the ground of redemption, and it would appear from the result that the people were not in a moral condition to take this ground when David numbered them.<a name=170:10></a> As a consequence of the numbering of the people, a pestilence broke out amongst them, and seventy thousand people died.<a name=170:11></a> This was the terrible governmental consequence of David's sin and foolishness.<a name=170:12></a> It is true that the whole moral state of Israel was brought to light, and God's judgment came upon it, but the pride of David's heart was the thing that gave occasion to this solemn visitation.<a name=170:13></a>

		But it is perfectly lovely to see how all the chastening which came upon David had its blessed "afterwards".<a name=171:16></a> So that, though he had long years of affliction and sorrow, in which the governmental consequences of his sins came upon him in a terrible succession of calamities, yet, after all, his sun had a glorious setting.<a name=171:17></a> Instructed and humbled by all the chastening, he is found at the end of his days laying himself out for the building of the house of God (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:5">1 Chronicles  22:5</a>, 14; <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:2">1 Chronicles  29:2</a> - 5, 13 - 18).<a name=171:18></a>

		I trust we may be helped by what has been before us at this time to see the character and object and result of "the chastening of the Lord".<a name=172:2></a> It is a great thing for us to understand God's ways with us.<a name=172:3></a> I am sure there is great encouragement in the thought of divine chastening if we apprehend it aright.<a name=172:4></a> Hands often hang down, and knees are feeble, because we do not know the secret of God's ways with us.<a name=172:5></a> We get discouraged and depressed by things which are really most needful and profitable for us.<a name=172:6></a> If our hearts are set to run in the way of holiness, all the difficulties we encounter in the path of faith are the needed discipline to remove that which hinders our spiritual prosperity.<a name=172:7></a> And if we are passed through trials and sufferings such as are common to men, we must not suppose that they come to us by chance; too often such things are taken as a matter of course, the Lord's hand is not distinctly owned in them, and this is really despising the chastening of the Lord.<a name=172:8></a> Chastening does not profit us until we hear the voice of the Lord in it.<a name=172:9></a> Then, again, if we suffer, as many of us do in one way or another -- chastening for sin and folly -- let us not be discouraged and depressed by it, but rather let us rejoice that the love of God is set upon our "partaking of his holiness".<a name=172:10></a> After all, nothing is destroyed or weakened by chastening but the flesh.<a name=172:11></a> Regarding ourselves as subjects of the work of God, we are in no wise hindered or impeded by God's chastening; on the contrary, we are immensely and divinely helped by it.<a name=172:12></a> We cannot derive profit, and God cannot derive pleasure, from what is of the flesh; and God's holy discipline reduces that which is altogether unprofitable, so that we may not be hindered from true "profit".<a name=172:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My dear Brother,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In answer to your letter I am glad to send you a few remarks on the subject of divine healing, though it be simply to call attention to what Scripture sets before us.<a name=184:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The healing of the sick, accompanying the preaching of the glad tidings of the kingdom, was one of the great characteristics of the presence and service of the Son of God in this world.<a name=184:2></a> Every form and fruit of the power of evil had to give way before Him; every result of sin -- disease, and even death itself -- had to bear witness to the greatness of divine power which was active here in compassionate goodness to men.<a name=184:3></a> It could not be otherwise in the presence of God manifest in flesh.<a name=184:4></a> The power was present which could and did relieve men of every pressure, so that it was manifest that He was here who will in a coming day "swallow up death in victory" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#25:8">Isaiah  25:8</a>) and bring about such a state of things that the inhabitants shall not say, "I am sick" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#33:24">Isaiah  33:24</a>).<a name=184:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And not only was every act of healing a testimony of what was in God's heart in loving-kindness to His ruined creature, but it was a figure of an even greater deliverance by which men should be set free from every moral disease so as to be for God's pleasure, serving Him "without fear in piety and righteousness before him all our days" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:75">Luke  1:75</a>).<a name=184:6></a> The works of power of the age to come were illustrative of the moral healing by which alone man could answer to God's will as set forth in the teaching of the Lord, And it is very touching to see that every act of healing was at the cost of suffering to the blessed Healer, for, as the prophet had said, "Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:17">Matthew  8:17</a>).<a name=184:7></a> He did not remove any infirmity by His power without bearing the burden and sorrow of it in

		His spirit, and this was true of "every disease and every bodily weakness" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:35">Matthew  9:35</a>).<a name=185:1></a> He thus understands perfectly, and can sympathise with every form of bodily suffering, and this is a sweet comfort to all His "brethren" who are sick.<a name=185:2></a> For that such might be sick is clearly intimated in His own words, "I was ill, and ye visited me", explained by "Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:36">Matthew  25:36</a>, 40).<a name=185:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see Him giving the twelve, and then the seventy, power to heal diseases.<a name=185:4></a> They had not need to talk about the power, or to write books about it, or to try to make people believe they had it.<a name=185:5></a> They <i>had</i> it, and they exercised it in the simplest possible way.<a name=185:6></a> When we pass from the gospels to the Acts we find the same divine power accompanying the service of Peter and Paul, in testimony to the name of Him who was no longer here but glorified in heaven, though it may be noted that neither in the Acts nor in the epistles do we find any instance of a Christian being restored from bodily sickness by a miracle.<a name=185:7></a> Then we learn from 1 Corinthians that "gifts of healings" were set, amongst other gifts, "in the assembly".<a name=185:8></a> And James says, "Is any sick among you?<a name=185:9></a> let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.<a name=185:10></a> Confess therefore your offences to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#5:14">James  5:14</a> - 16).<a name=185:11></a>

		We are also told that "the body is .<a name=185:12></a>.<a name=185:13></a>.<a name=185:14></a> for the Lord, and the Lord for the body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:13">1 Corinthians  6:13</a>), and again, "He is Saviour of the body" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:23">Ephesians  5:23</a>).<a name=185:15></a> All this is to be weighed and valued as a blessed witness of what divine power and goodness can effect in the way of preservation or healing of the body.<a name=185:16></a> It has encouraged the faith of God's people to count upon Him in innumerable instances, so that I suppose there are very few of His children who have not known

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remarkable sign gifts, such as "tongues", "gifts of healing", "miraculous powers", existed in the assembly at the beginning; God bore witness with His servants to His great salvation "both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:4">Hebrews  2:4</a>).<a name=186:5></a> There was one blessed company presenting a united testimony on God's part in the midst of a hostile world, and He was pleased to accredit that testimony in a public and unmistakable way.<a name=186:6></a> But where might we expect such credentials to be found today, compelling the attention of men by manifesting His power miraculously, even to sight?<a name=186:7></a> It is a day of departure and ruin, and it could hardly be expected that God should accredit in a public way a condition of things which is contrary to His mind.<a name=186:8></a> If, on the other hand, sign gifts were bestowed on such saints as were individually approved of God, it would put such saints publicly in an extraordinary position, as being distinguished from the church generally -- from all other saints -- by the possession of miraculous powers.<a name=186:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think a heart that felt aright the true condition of the church would shrink from the idea of such a position.<a name=186:10></a> The assembly has departed from first love and is in a fallen state; Christ and the Spirit have lost Their place; and man's will and order (which is really confusion) are seen on every hand.<a name=186:11></a> We are in 2 Timothy days, and the Spirit shows us there the path of righteousness and faith for those who are found calling on the Lord out of a pure heart at such a time.<a name=186:12></a> There is no word of sign gifts being recovered or miraculous powers

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are in a day of ruin, with utter and final apostasy close at hand.<a name=187:4></a> There cannot be the smallest question as to God's power: He can heal the bodies of His saints today, as at any time, if it pleases Him to do so.<a name=187:5></a> But the condition of the assembly -- the vessel of testimony -- is such that faithful individuals would be concerned rather as to spiritual healing -- that the saints should be found walking together according to truth, and in holy separation from the world, and from everything that is not according to the will of the Lord; that full place should be given to the Holy Spirit and His ministry of the glory of Christ; that the relations of Christ to the assembly and of the assembly to Christ should be known and entered into; that the members of the body of Christ should recognise their corporate bond with one another, and be found acting happily and healthfully in their mutual relations as such; that the joints of supply should be in such living contact with the Head as to minister of His fulness continually so that the body may be united together and increase with the increase of God; that saints may hold the truth in love, and "grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:15">Ephesians  4:15</a>, 16).<a name=187:6></a>

		These are very great subjects for exercise and desire, and it is to be earnestly wished that saints were more concerned about them.<a name=188:1></a> There is a danger of missing the distinctive character of christian blessings -- of being diverted from the spiritual and the heavenly -- and we have to see to it that we do not lose our crown.<a name=188:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Any pretension to miraculous powers in such a day as this would need to be tested in every way by the Holy Scriptures: the spirit of those claiming to exercise such powers would need to be discerned to be as being of God, and their teaching judged by the truth.<a name=188:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are drawing near to the moment of apostasy, and we read of one to come "whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:9">2 Thessalonians  2:9</a>, 10).<a name=188:4></a> Alleged cases of healing have been found in connection with grave error as to the truth, and this renders it necessary that the children of God should exercise spiritual judgment, and apply the test of truth to those who assume to exercise healing powers.<a name=188:5></a> The desire for signs was one marked feature of Jewish unbelief (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:1">Matthew  16:1</a> - 4, etc.<a name=188:6></a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:22">1 Corinthians  1:22</a>).<a name=188:7></a> Man naturally loves the marvellous, without desiring in conscience or heart to be brought near to God; and in the last days the enemy will gain power over men by gratifying this desire (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:24">Matthew  24:24</a>).<a name=188:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering the scripture in <a href="../bible/James.htm#5">James  5</a>we have to remember that when he wrote the assembly was a distinct and united company, and the elders were known individually who could be sent for as being officially in a position to act administratively for the Lord.<a name=188:9></a> The assembly cannot be found today; it is fallen, scattered and submerged in the world.<a name=188:10></a> Elders, as of divine appointment officially, there are none.<a name=188:11></a> Does this tremendous change of conditions make no difference?<a name=188:12></a> The very first exercise of a sick saint brings

		It is clear from <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a> that bodily weakness and even death may be the discipline of the Lord upon that which is displeasing to Him.<a name=189:7></a> John also refers to this when he says, "If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death.<a name=189:8></a> There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:16">1 John  5:16</a>, 17).<a name=189:9></a> It would evidently be an exercise from the Lord as to whether sickness were of this nature or otherwise, and if a believer felt in his conscience that it was so, and was brought to repentance, it would be good for him to confess his wrongdoing.<a name=189:10></a> Such conviction and confession would lead to prayer for the sick one and his sins would be forgiven, and, generally speaking, he would be healed and raised up.<a name=189:11></a> There might indeed be the solemn case of sin unto death -- which would be spiritually discerned -- when there might be no faith to make request for recovery, but such a case would probably be exceptional.<a name=189:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How many thousands of saints have been happy to assert that they would not have missed for anything the exercises of prolonged sickness and suffering!<a name=190:5></a> They have so learned the grace and sympathy and succour of Christ as the living Priest, and they have been the subjects of so much precious and tender interest and consideration flowing from the spiritual affections of His saints, that they have become conscious of infinite gain and enrichment.<a name=190:6></a> And surely the development and exercise of such affections as these, eternal in their nature, though called into activity by circumstances connected with conditions of weakness and time, are a greater triumph of divine love and power than restoring the sick ones to health.<a name=190:7></a> I cannot but feel it is a real loss for the attention of saints to be turned from the spiritual dealings of the Lord with His saints, and from all that is the moral result of those dealings, to be concentrated upon the thought of bodily healing.<a name=190:8></a>

		It is deeply important that we should apprehend the thought of God to have His saints built up as "a spiritual house, a holy priesthood".<a name=197:1></a> It is not God's mind to have His saints as scattered units in this world, nor is it ever contemplated in Scripture that they should be found in sects of their own choosing.<a name=197:2></a> God has visited the Gentiles "to take out of the nations a people for his name" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:14">Acts  15:14</a>), and it should be the exercise of every believer to know the will and pleasure of God concerning His saints.<a name=197:3></a> Epaphras laboured fervently in prayer that the saints might "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God", and such a prayer is not less needful for us than for those at Colosse.<a name=197:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place it was needful that our sins should be put away, and Christ "bore our sins in his body on the tree" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>).<a name=197:8></a> But the putting away of our sins was not the end which He had in view, though it was necessary in order that the divine end might be reached.<a name=197:9></a> We read in another scripture that He "gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:4">Galatians  1:4</a>).<a name=197:10></a> Then in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:18">1 Peter  3:18</a> we read that "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God".<a name=197:11></a> Christ has put away our sins "that he should deliver us out of the present evil world", and "that he might bring us to God".<a name=197:12></a> I have no doubt that this latter expression would convey to the Jewish believers, to whom Peter was writing, the idea of

	<div class="paragraph">
		I can understand some believer saying, 'This is a very deep subject; it is beyond me'.<a name=198:7></a> But the apostle did not seem to think that it was an unsuited subject to bring before those whom he exhorted as "newborn babes" to "desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word".<a name=198:8></a> The fact is that many things which were simple at the first are difficult now because christianity has become a great religion in the world, and it takes us a long time to learn that the christianity we see around us is not at all the christianity of the New Testament.<a name=198:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1">1 Peter  1</a>) shows how "living stones" are formed; that is, it brings before us the different elements of God's gracious work by which His saints are prepared to occupy a place in His spiritual house.<a name=198:10></a> Of these different elements, none is more important than that of which verse 3 speaks: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead".<a name=198:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord Jesus was here, His disciples followed Him in expectation of soon seeing some signal intervention of God's power by which His kingdom should "immediately appear".<a name=199:7></a> They looked for some mighty act of God's power on behalf of Christ that should reverse everything, and turn His reproach and rejection into honour and glory.<a name=199:8></a> But God did not intervene, and instead of following Christ to the throne of His father David, they had to follow Him through deepening shades of sorrow and rejection to the cross.<a name=199:9></a> They had given up everything for Him in prospect of His having the kingdom, but as to this world He was cut off and had nothing.<a name=199:10></a> It may be said that their hopes were founded on Scripture, and this was perfectly true, but they had to learn that it was not God's purpose to establish anything in connection with man in the flesh.<a name=199:11></a> Even Christ after the flesh must be cut off and have nothing.<a name=199:12></a> God allowed every hope which attached to Christ after the flesh to come under the blight of death.<a name=199:13></a>

		Then came the amazing intervention of God's power in "the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead".<a name=199:14></a> God did not interfere with the order of things which existed in this world; He left everything here just as it was; but He wrought a mighty act outside the sphere of flesh and blood

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing that lies within the range of sin or death could be incorruptible, undefiled, or unfading.<a name=200:9></a> But in Jesus Christ risen from among the dead, things subsist which are beyond the reach of every corrupting and defiling influence.<a name=200:10></a> The inheritance in the mind of a Jew would include the fulfilment of all God's promises, and therefore all grace and glory of the kingdom.<a name=200:11></a> Everything that God had promised -- all His unnumbered thoughts of blessing towards men (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:5">Psalm  40:5</a>) -- has been made good in Christ risen on the ground of redemption.<a name=200:12></a> And now, as guarded by the power of God through faith, we await the revelation of it all from heaven.<a name=200:13></a> God's thoughts are not established here, but they are established in heaven; nothing has failed of His purpose of blessing, and it has all been secured where it cannot be corrupted or defiled.<a name=200:14></a>

		Thus though the believer may be put to grief by various trials, and have his faith proved by fire, this only causes him to exult the more in the mighty deliverance and grace which will be brought out of heaven when the One who is there shall be revealed.<a name=201:3></a> Outwardly the saint does not experience deliverance -- he may be poor, afflicted and persecuted -- but inwardly he has passed out of darkness into God's marvellous light.<a name=201:4></a> He is in the light of Christ risen and glorified, and is kept guarded by the power of God through faith for a salvation which is ready to be revealed.<a name=201:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the deepest importance that we should know what it is to come to Christ as the Living Stone.<a name=223:1></a> It is clear that this is something beyond the soul's first apprehension of Christ as the Source of blessing in grace, for those who come to Him as the Living Stone have already "tasted that the Lord is good".<a name=223:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case of the poor man who was befriended by the good Samaritan we see an illustration of what it is to taste that the Lord is good.<a name=223:3></a> The goodness of the Samaritan could not be measured by the need and distress which he relieved; it could only be measured by the fact that he expended all his own resources upon the subject of his grace.<a name=223:4></a> We can only measure divine goodness and grace by the greatness and resources of the Person who brings it to us; that is to say, it is infinite.<a name=223:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God came here to bring the infinite grace of God to man, at all cost to Himself.<a name=223:6></a> We learn the immensity of grace, not by thinking of our need, but by thinking of the One who has brought it from heaven in all His own greatness and wealth.<a name=223:7></a> It is a fine start for us if we have tasted that the Lord is good.<a name=223:8></a> There is One that we can count upon, even in our deep need, and destitute, as we are, of any claim upon His goodness.<a name=223:9></a> The Lord is good; He is great -- yea, supreme -- in grace.<a name=223:10></a> He exercises His mighty power and expends His infinite resources in the perfection of grace towards men.<a name=223:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having tasted that the Lord is good creates an appetite for "the pure mental milk of the word".<a name=223:12></a> Immediately following the parable of the good Samaritan in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>we are told of Mary, who, "having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word".<a name=223:13></a> She desired "the pure mental milk of the word".<a name=223:14></a> We first taste that the Lord is good, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=224>[Page 224]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that His inexhaustible resources have become the supply of our deep need.<a name=224:1></a> Everything to meet our necessities is in Him.<a name=224:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, having tasted this, we next desire to be nourished by that which will feed our souls in the knowledge of God, and make us acquainted with all that is in God's will.<a name=224:3></a> We desire the pure mental milk of the word, that by it we may grow up to salvation.<a name=224:4></a> It is by having our souls nourished in the knowledge of God that we grow up to deliverance from all that is evil and of man.<a name=224:5></a> We grow up to the apprehension of our place according to God's will, as those who are called to be in association with Christ.<a name=224:6></a> There could be no greater deliverance than to pass from the flesh, and the world, and all that is evil here, into a circle where our souls are nourished in the knowledge of God, and we become conscious of association with Christ in that new and divine world of which He is the Head and Centre.<a name=224:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very blessed to see that, in making Himself known to us in grace, the Lord establishes a personal link between Himself and our hearts.<a name=224:8></a> He puts the link there first from His side in the perfection of His grace.<a name=224:9></a> And then our hearts are tested as to how far we are affected by that infinite grace.<a name=224:10></a> The Lord looks for response to Himself; He looks for the awakening of "desire" in our hearts.<a name=224:11></a> The normal effect of having tasted that He is good is that we "desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word".<a name=224:12></a> This "desire" comes out beautifully in Mary (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>).<a name=224:13></a> The Lord could say of her, "Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her".<a name=224:14></a> Response was awakened in her heart, and this was very grateful to the Lord.<a name=224:15></a> She chose that good part, and He charged Himself with the maintenance for her heart of what she desired.<a name=224:16></a> He said it should not be taken away from her.<a name=224:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is immense encouragement in this for every heart in which the same holy desire and choice have been wrought, even though it be in feeble measure, by the grace of the Lord.<a name=224:18></a> The principle on which He acts is plainly stated in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=225>[Page 225]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#37:4">Psalm  37:4</a>, "Delight thyself in Jehovah, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart".<a name=225:1></a> If responsive desire and delight in Himself have been awakened in our hearts -- if the knowledge of God has become the choice of our souls -- we may be assured that the Lord will secure to us what we choose, in spite of all adversaries.<a name=225:2></a> He will give us the desires of our hearts.<a name=225:3></a> But, beloved brethren, let us not forget that we are continually tested as to whether we really desire and choose that which is of God and His beloved Son.<a name=225:4></a> We are tested as to whether we are prepared to come to Christ as the Living Stone -- as to whether we love Him enough to come to Him who is cast away indeed as worthless by men, but who is with God chosen and precious.<a name=225:5></a> This coming to Christ is not so much a matter of faith, but of love.<a name=225:6></a> It turns really upon our affection for Himself.<a name=225:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To illustrate what it is to come to Christ as the Living Stone, I will refer to several familiar scriptures.<a name=225:8></a> First, let us read <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#6:47">Mark  6:47</a> - 51 and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14:27">Matthew  14:27</a> - 31.<a name=225:9></a>

		I cannot enlarge much on the setting of this wonderful incident, but I may remark that the murder of John was at the moment the true index of coming events, little as the disciples -- full of the proclamation and powers of the kingdom -- thought so.<a name=225:10></a> The cities of Israel must be left for the present; the desert place, outside everything recognised by man, is the place where faith can rest, and grace can work.<a name=225:11></a> But even there, when grace works, man misinterprets all its designs and will make the Worker king.<a name=225:12></a> When He perceives this He departs into a mountain "himself alone" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:15">John  6:15</a>), having sent His disciples to "the other side".<a name=225:13></a> This indicates that nothing of God's will was going to be established in connection with men as in the flesh, or even with Christ after the flesh.<a name=225:14></a> There must be the crossing over to "the other side" -- a figure of resurrection.<a name=225:15></a> As risen from among the dead, Christ is outside the whole order of things connected with man in the flesh.<a name=225:16></a> We have a figure of this in His walking upon the water.<a name=225:17></a> He was introducing Himself to His own

		Mark that word, "He comes to them walking on the sea, and would have passed them by".<a name=226:2></a> He presented Himself to the little company in the boat.<a name=226:3></a> In His precious grace He approached them that He might establish a link between Himself and them.<a name=226:4></a> But in doing so He put them to the test, as to how far there was response to Him and desire after Himself in their hearts.<a name=226:5></a> He did not force Himself upon them, but He presented Himself in a new and wondrous way to them that the state of their hearts might be tested.<a name=226:6></a> He "would have passed them by".<a name=226:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is ever thus.<a name=226:8></a> The Lord is always the One to move first.<a name=226:9></a> Any desire or movement after Him which is awakened in our hearts is but the response to the love in which He graciously presents Himself to our souls.<a name=226:10></a> There are two lines of a well-known hymn which express the thought of His drawing and our response:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'Lord, Thou hast drawn us after Thee, <br>So let us run and never tire'.<a name=226:12></a><a name=226:11></a> (<a href=".<a name=226:13></a>.<a name=226:14></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=226:15></a>htm#361:1">Hymn 361</a>)</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sometimes we think we are seeking Him, and that He is slow to manifest Himself to us.<a name=226:16></a> We are like the bride in the Song, when she said, "I sought him, but I found him not; I called him, but he gave me no answer" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:6">Song of Songs  5:6</a>).<a name=226:17></a> But why was this?<a name=226:18></a> It was because He had knocked and sought admission without securing a suited response from her.<a name=226:19></a> She had said, "I have put off my tunic, how should I put it on?<a name=226:20></a> I have washed my feet, how should I pollute them?<a name=226:21></a>" When He drew near to her in love she was too indolent, too studious of her own ease and comfort, too satisfied with her own state and circumstances, to respond to Him.<a name=226:22></a> Then, when at last she did open to Him, it was only to find that He had withdrawn Himself and was gone.<a name=226:23></a> It was not that He was indifferent, but she had to learn the bitter consequences of her own indifference.<a name=226:24></a> She had to learn to judge the indifference with which she had slumbered and been at ease without

	<div class="paragraph">
		His company.<a name=227:1></a> If we have been indifferent, it may be for years, to every approach of the Lord's love, we cannot expect that the moment we begin to have a little desire after Himself, we shall be at once in the full blessedness of His company.<a name=227:2></a> He loves us too well to spare us the exercise and the humbling of heart in repentance that we need.<a name=227:3></a> That which has caused the cloud and the distance has to be judged.<a name=227:4></a> Often there is a kind of sentimental desire after the Lord, fostered by religious poetry and the like, where there is but very shallow exercise as to the true state of the soul, or as to worldly links and associations.<a name=227:5></a> Souls would like to have spiritual joys without self-judgment, or separation, or holy exercise, but it is never the Lord's way to vouchsafe this.<a name=227:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be assured that the Lord is never indifferent, and if there is the smallest germ of true desire after Himself in our hearts, it was He who originated it.<a name=227:7></a> Any exercise we may have to pass through is in the way of necessary self-judgment, or to detach us from things or associations that would hinder our spiritual prosperity.<a name=227:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord presented Himself to the little company in the boat, as I have said, to test their hearts.<a name=227:9></a> It is as though He would say to them, 'What place have I in your affections?<a name=227:10></a> Is there a heart amongst you that will choose to be with Me, even though it has to leave everything suited to nature and the flesh in order to reach Me?<a name=227:11></a>' And, beloved brethren, this is the great question at the present moment for our hearts.<a name=227:12></a> The Lord is outside everything here.<a name=227:13></a> On man's side, He has been utterly rejected -- cast away as worthless; and on God's side He has been raised from among the dead and is God's chosen and precious One in resurrection.<a name=227:14></a> Now, have we affection enough for Him to come to Him in His out-of-the-world place -- to come to Him as the Living Stone?<a name=227:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was but one in the boat who responded to the Lord in full and fervent affection, but in Peter we see an example of the affection which rightly pertains to those who are called to be "companions of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:14">Hebrews  3:14</a>).<a name=227:16></a> He said,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=228>[Page 228]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Lord, if it be <i>thou</i>, command me to come to thee upon the waters".<a name=228:1></a> He was prepared to leave the boat -- that is, to quit every natural support and every association according to the flesh -- that he might be with the Lord.<a name=228:2></a> And at the Lord's word, "Come", he went down out of the ship, and "walked upon the waters to go to Jesus".<a name=228:3></a> Affection for Christ in Peter caused him thus to respond to the grace in which the Lord had presented Himself.<a name=228:4></a> It was Christ who attracted him; his one thought was, "If it be <i>thou</i>, command me to come to thee".<a name=228:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Peter had to learn that his affection was not enough to sustain him in a path that lay altogether outside the sphere of man according to nature.<a name=228:6></a> We may start out with a measure of true affection for the Lord, and in the very consciousness of our affection for Him we may lose sight of the necessity for profound self-judgment.<a name=228:7></a> We may suppose that that which grace has wrought in us will sustain us, but we have to learn that nothing but the personal succour and grace of Christ can maintain our souls in conscious association with Himself.<a name=228:8></a> Our strength and resource in coming to Him as the Living Stone lie in Himself, and in the priestly grace wherewith He succours our weakness and need.<a name=228:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says of Peter, "Seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.<a name=228:10></a> And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?<a name=228:11></a>" Peter had not within himself grace or power for the path on the water, though he had affection for it.<a name=228:12></a> He had to learn the need for the outstretched hand of Christ to succour and sustain him.<a name=228:13></a> This is an important and blessed lesson, because it casts us continually upon the living grace of Christ.<a name=228:14></a> However fervent and devoted we may be, we have to learn that it is only by the succour and grace of Christ that we are maintained in true response to Him.<a name=228:15></a> And just as He charged Himself with the maintenance for Mary's heart of what she desired, so He charges Himself

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter walking on the water in the fervency of his affection for Christ is a blessed sight, but he was not allowed to return to the ship without having been made deeply conscious that the grace and power that sustained him on the water did not reside in himself but in Christ.<a name=229:5></a> The consciousness that we are thus dependent upon His priestly grace and succour keeps our souls in lowliness, and at the same time it binds up our hearts with Him in peculiar affection.<a name=229:6></a> He not only becomes attractive as the goal to which we press on, but we realise that His love is the strength of our hearts in the way to that goal, and the support of our souls when we have reached it.<a name=229:7></a> We cannot do without His priestly grace.<a name=229:8></a>

		God had taken His own way in infinite power and grace, though it was a way which not even the disciples appear to have anticipated, in spite of the plain words of the Lord on more than one occasion.<a name=230:2></a> Redemption had been accomplished, and now God was acting in His almighty power entirely outside the whole course of things in this world.<a name=230:3></a> God had begun the history of an entirely new world, by raising up Jesus from among the dead.<a name=230:4></a> He had thus laid the foundation for a vast structure of grace and glory that should subsist in the power of new creation entirely outside this world, and beyond the range of sin and death.<a name=230:5></a>

		LETTER BY C.A.C. @1 PETER 2: 1 - 25
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My dear E-,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am rejoiced to have your letter and I thank God for any exercise that has been awakened among the dear saints as to the assembly.<a name=236:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is a great mistake to look upon the truth of <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>as being objective.<a name=236:2></a> In fact a very superficial examination of the scripture is sufficient to convince one that this view of it is untenable.<a name=236:3></a> It is not a question of what believers are <i>according to divine purpose</i>, but of a spiritual structure which is being built up here and which takes the place of Israel and a material sanctuary.<a name=236:4></a> It is that in which God finds what He can appreciate -- "spiritual sacrifices" -- and it is that also which is here in testimony for God, that in which His character and excellencies are shown forth.<a name=236:5></a> This latter is in connection with the kingly priesthood.<a name=236:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ninety per cent of the difficulties in connection with <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>would be removed if souls were experimentally in the good of chapter 1.<a name=236:7></a> Very few believers have apprehended the two great truths of chapter 1: <i>soul salvation</i> and <i>redemption</i>.<a name=236:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Soul salvation is complete inward deliverance from all that is of man and connected with the earth by the knowledge of <i>Christ in glory</i>.<a name=236:9></a> If the glory is shining in my heart, and filling me with joy unspeakable in <i>Him</i> who is outside the whole sphere of sight, I am completely delivered, as to my affections, from the world and what is of man.<a name=236:10></a> This is what the Holy Spirit calls the salvation of the soul.<a name=236:11></a> That is, it is <i>inward</i> in contrast to <i>outward</i> deliverance.<a name=236:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then <i>redemption</i> is not, in Peter, from sins, etc.<a name=236:13></a>, but from "your vain conversation .<a name=236:14></a>.<a name=236:15></a>.<a name=236:16></a>".<a name=236:17></a> That is, the death of Christ has completely set us free from earthly religion.<a name=236:18></a> The whole history of man in the flesh has closed in the death of Christ,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and if this be the case it is very evident a system of religion which recognises man in the flesh is absolutely worthless.<a name=237:1></a> It is a religion for a man entirely rejected by God.<a name=237:2></a> When this is apprehended it gives complete deliverance from fleshly religion, and prepares the soul to understand that we can only be <i>for God</i> according to <i>His work in us</i>.<a name=237:3></a> All flesh is withered grass.<a name=237:4></a> Flesh cannot be built up a spiritual house!<a name=237:5></a> There must be an entirely new start -- "being born again", etc.<a name=237:6></a> But new birth is only the start -- the basis, so to speak, of the subsequent work.<a name=237:7></a> It is <i>morally</i> the entire displacement of flesh, and therefore in connection with it there comes obligation to lay aside all that is of the flesh (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:1">1 Peter  2:1</a>).<a name=237:8></a> These things, if retained, must prove an effectual hindrance to growth.<a name=237:9></a> Then notice, the growth is "up to salvation".<a name=237:10></a> That is, we have to grow up to the completeness of the divine deliverance, the measure of which is association with Christ, and this <i>consciously known in the soul</i>.<a name=237:11></a> It is thus that we are formed as "living stones" for the spiritual house, and prepared to come to the Living Stone -- the One cast away as worthless by men.<a name=237:12></a> In conscious association with Him who is outside man's world as the rejected One, we are built up a spiritual house.<a name=237:13></a> It is a pernicious self-deception for one to take it for granted that all this is true of him when he has not grown up to it, and in character and constitution he is not really a living stone.<a name=237:14></a> That it is true <i>for</i> every believer is blessedly certain, but we must grow up to it.<a name=237:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to failure, it is important to remember that, solemn as failure is, it does not undo the work of God in the soul.<a name=237:16></a> One might lose all the joy of association with Christ, but when the backslider was restored he would be restored to what he was before.<a name=237:17></a> That is, he would be restored to that which he truly is according to God's work in him.<a name=237:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your third question, I am sure that it is quite impossible that union with Christ could be known before deliverance.<a name=237:19></a>

		NOTES OF A READING @1 PETER 2: 4 - 10
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=239:1></a> What is the characteristic as to "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God"?<a name=239:2></a> In what do they consist?<a name=239:3></a> They would contrast with sacrifices of the old order.<a name=239:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=239:5></a>C.<a name=239:6></a> Yes, those of this dispensation are a contrast to the thought of the material house and the sacrifices of animals.<a name=239:7></a> I suppose the object of the Spirit of God was to show that these things of God introduced in the Old Testament have not been given up, but have taken on a new character of greater value.<a name=239:8></a> The thought of the common centre of worship was not new, was it?<a name=239:9></a> There was a centre which God chose and where He put His name, and all sacrifices were to be offered there, and it would have been an offence otherwise, showing God would bring His people into unity in their approach to Him.<a name=239:10></a> So the offering up of spiritual sacrifices is a collective thought, is it not?<a name=239:11></a> All the clean animals were types of Christ in different ways.<a name=239:12></a> I suppose every animal offered in sacrifice presented some thought of Christ.<a name=239:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought in offering was that God would be pleased with what was offered.<a name=239:14></a> So it says here, "Acceptable to God".<a name=239:15></a> It is a bringing of that to God which is pleasing to Him.<a name=239:16></a> In the Old Testament the offerer brought his offering because the sin question was not settled.<a name=239:17></a> It is not acceptable that <i>we</i> come to God under the burden of sins, because that question has been settled permanently, but we come as having a purged conscience, and we are on the footing of Christ before Him.<a name=239:18></a> We are never on any other footing.<a name=239:19></a> So now we can bring sacrifices of a spiritual order; we can speak to Him of Christ.<a name=239:20></a> What follows here confirms that.<a name=239:21></a> The cornerstone is elect, precious.<a name=239:22></a> "To you therefore who believe is the preciousness".<a name=239:23></a> God has given us the knowledge of One who is infinitely precious to Him.<a name=239:24></a> We were singing this morning of knowing 'His preciousness to Thee'.<a name=239:25></a> Whatever

		Peter speaks of putting off his tabernacle, and in doing so he is concerned that what had been carried in that tabernacle was so precious that it should be transmitted to others, that it might be carried on by them in this present tabernacle condition.<a name=302:2></a> Peter uses the word tabernacle in connection with his body being about to be put off in death, showing that his thoughts reverted to that moment in his history when on the holy mount in presence of the glorifying of the Son of God.<a name=302:3></a> He proposed at that time to make three tabernacles, and his thought was in measure right; he thought that the glory seen by them should be retained here; but he was wrong in thinking that Moses and Elias should be on a level with Jesus; but the three disciples on the mount were intended to be tabernacles themselves.<a name=302:4></a> For a number of years Peter's natural body had been the tabernacle in which what he had seen on the mount was enshrined.<a name=302:5></a> It was held in that frail tabernacle as precious as the golden vessels in the tabernacle of old.<a name=302:6></a> Believers today, in weak tabernacle conditions, contain such living things, and wonderful things have been carried in the tabernacle that is before us today.<a name=302:7></a> His tabernacle has been put off and there is going to be a worthy shrine provided soon, "a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:1">2 Corinthians  5:1</a>).<a name=302:8></a> At the present moment the testimony of the glory of Christ, the Son of God, is to be carried; and one who has carried in his heart that testimony, when he puts off

		I have suggested reading these portions of Scripture with the thought that we might have before us something of the precious ministry of the apostle John.<a name=337:1></a> I am sure we have all noticed that John speaks of "the beginning" in several different connections.<a name=337:2></a> The first two verses of his gospel contain what is probably the most profound statement in Scripture.<a name=337:3></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=337:4></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a> had stated that "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=337:5></a> But John wrote, by the Holy Spirit, of One who had been known by himself and others as Man here, One who had now ascended up where He was before.<a name=337:6></a> It was of that known Person that John declared, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=337:7></a> No one reading this could doubt for a moment that this statement refers to the Person concerning whom the whole gospel was written.<a name=337:8></a> Before anything was created, He was.<a name=337:9></a>

		"In the beginning" He had distinct personality, and was "with God": the Greek preposition used here implies activity of intercourse, but it was on the part of One who was Himself God.<a name=337:11></a> Ineffable greatness and majesty were His; whatever is true of that great Being whom no one has seen at any time is true of Him in the most absolute sense.<a name=337:12></a> He was, and is, 'of full <i>Deity possessed</i>'.<a name=337:13></a> But it is repeated in verse 2 that "He was in the beginning with God".<a name=337:14></a> The repetition of this statement shows its importance in view of all that John would present.<a name=337:15></a> He was "with God", and therefore could act according to the wisdom of the divine counsel to effect creation.<a name=337:16></a> For "All things received being through him, and without

		In speaking of the Lord as "the Word", John was using a well-known designation; he was not introducing it for the first time; it was a designation which Luke had applied to Christ probably at least thirty years before John wrote.<a name=338:8></a> See <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>.<a name=338:9></a> Every reader of Luke's gospel -- and by the time that John wrote his gospel this probably included saints in every assembly -- was familiar with the title, "the Word".<a name=338:10></a> It is perhaps the most comprehensive title of the Lord that can be used, apart from saying that He is God.<a name=338:11></a> For it conveys the wondrous thought that God is in expression so as to be known by intelligent creatures.<a name=338:12></a> There is thus a range and depth of meaning in this title which has a fulness perhaps beyond what is conveyed by any other that is applied to Him in manhood.<a name=338:13></a> Indeed this is directly affirmed by the scripture which says, "Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#138:2">Psalm  138:2</a>).<a name=338:14></a> "Word", as used in that verse, does not answer exactly to the Greek word "logos", but as it "fixes the mind more especially on what is expressed" (see note on the same word as used in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:11">Psalm  119:11</a> in the Darby Translation), it does bring out the exceeding greatness of what expresses God.<a name=338:15></a> So that we can understand how great is the thought conveyed when Luke speaks of some as having been "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>).<a name=338:16></a> It was a glorious designation, and was used

		Some of us were looking together the other evening at the truth of christian fellowship as Paul speaks of it.<a name=357:1></a> I thought it might be spiritually helpful to us tonight to look at fellowship as John presents it, because our happiness before God and our taking up our right relations with our brethren depend upon our understanding the character of the fellowship in which we are called to walk.<a name=357:2></a> There is nothing narrower in Scripture than the fellowship belonging to all the children of God, all saints.<a name=357:3></a> We can see that John was a happy man -- the apostles were happy men.<a name=357:4></a> It is our privilege to be in fellowship with the apostles, for they had no desire to keep their happiness to themselves.<a name=357:5></a> The great desire of John in writing his epistle is that all those who read it may be brought into the joy that he and all the apostles had, that we might have fellowship with men who had the most profound joy possible for creatures to have, that we might have fellowship with them and thus have fulness of joy.<a name=357:6></a> If we have not fulness of joy, we do not know the fellowship that belongs to us and we to it.<a name=357:7></a> There are many who ought to enjoy the fellowship who do not; it is a wonderful partnership.<a name=357:8></a> It is connected in John with the family of God.<a name=357:9></a> All the children are entitled to be partakers in this fellowship.<a name=357:10></a>

		It is often asked, 'But what about sins committed after conversion?<a name=380:1></a> How are they dealt with?<a name=380:2></a>' That this is a very important question no believer would deny, for "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:8">1 John  1:8</a>); and practically "we all often offend" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#3:2">James  3:2</a>).<a name=380:3></a> At the same time we must remember that there is no excuse for a Christian when he sins, for we read, "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh's lust" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:16">Galatians  5:16</a>).<a name=380:4></a> It is our privilege and responsibility to walk in the Spirit, and if we always did so we should not sin.<a name=380:5></a>

		In the first place let us recall the fact -- so clearly and fully presented in Scripture -- that there is but <i>one</i> efficacious sacrifice for sins.<a name=380:6></a> The Spirit of God draws a pointed contrast between the oft-repeated "sacrifices, which can never take away sins" and the "one sacrifice for sins" offered by Christ; and He asserts plainly that by God's will "we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once" and that "by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:10">Hebrews  10:10</a> - 14).<a name=380:7></a> The Son of God has by Himself purged our sins (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>).<a name=380:8></a> The work was accomplished centuries before the sins were committed, and in due time, when we believed the gospel, its efficacy was made known to us that we might have purged consciences, and be assured that God will not impute sin to us.<a name=380:9></a> Any repetition of the sacrifice is impossible, nor is it ever suggested in Scripture that there can be a reapplication of its cleansing virtue to our souls.<a name=380:10></a> On the contrary the believer is "sanctified" -- he is set apart for God in the unchanging value of the offering of Christ and is "perfected in perpetuity".<a name=380:11></a> He is continually before God in the efficacy of an eternal redemption.<a name=380:12></a> All his sins, whether committed before conversion or after, were borne by Jesus.<a name=380:13></a> If so much as one of them had

		THE EPISTLE TO PERGAMOS: THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AN "EAR"
	</div>

		To know what it means to have an "ear" we must look at Jesus in His holy, lowly path here.<a name=441:1></a> He ever had an "ear".<a name=441:2></a> He was ever attentive to the Father's voice, to the word of God.<a name=441:3></a> The spirit of obedience is the practical expression of love (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>).<a name=441:4></a> It is striking that "ears hast thou prepared me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:6">Psalm  40:6</a>) should be translated by the Spirit into "thou hast prepared me a body" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:5">Hebrews  10:5</a>).<a name=441:5></a> It shows that the characteristic member of man's body viewed as in relation to God is his <i>ear</i>.<a name=441:6></a> We might think the hand or the foot or the eye were more important, but God values man's ear.<a name=441:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One who has an ear does not shrink from the "two-edged sword" -- the penetrating and dividing power of that sword lays bare secret sources of weakness and departure, and brings them under judgment before they carry the heart away -- and this is welcomed by the one who desires to be influenced only by the Lord.<a name=441:8></a> There is no doubt that "the throne of Satan" is very much in evidence here; that is, his influence.<a name=441:9></a> But <i>we</i> have come under the influence of another throne, and the two-edged sword helps us in our allegiance to that throne by exposing to us all that in ourselves which would answer to Satan's throne, so that we may judge it and thus be delivered from its power.<a name=441:10></a> All this is needful if we are to be like Antipas, a faithful witness, and to be morally, as he was indeed actually, in the fellowship of Christ's death.<a name=441:11></a> This would preserve us from the ensnaring associations into which Balaam would seduce us, and we shall hate what Christ hates and thus be free from the Nicolaitanes.<a name=441:12></a> The reward to the overcomer is peculiarly sweet in Pergamos.<a name=441:13></a> The "hidden manna" and the "white stone" seem

		C.A.<a name=443:1></a>C.<a name=443:2></a> I have thought that the epistle to Philadelphia answers, in a way, to David blessing his house.<a name=443:3></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#16:43">1 Chronicles  16:43</a>.<a name=443:4></a> David had spread a tent for the ark and brought it in, and had established praise and testimony in connection with it, and then he returned to bless his house.<a name=443:5></a> I think his house speaks of his kindred, and of a circle in accord with him, and the Lord addresses Philadelphia very much in that character -- as being in accord with Himself.<a name=443:6></a> He speaks as having the key of David, and I think it is our privilege to be in the position of David's house at the present moment.<a name=443:7></a>

		David came in when all the order of the dispensation, as set up at the beginning, had broken down.<a name=443:8></a> The tabernacle was still in existence in the high place at Gibeon, but there was no ark there.<a name=443:9></a> For the sin of His people, God had forsaken the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent which He placed among men (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:60">Psalm  78:60</a>).<a name=443:10></a> The tabernacle represented the official system as set up at the beginning, and it was much in the same position as christendom today.<a name=443:11></a> God's lovingkindness is not withdrawn from it yet, just as before the tabernacle there was still the witness that "his lovingkindness endureth for ever", but Christ has not His place there.<a name=443:12></a> The present moment is thus peculiar, and it answers very much to the time of David.<a name=443:13></a> Christianity as set up in this world has lost its glory, it no longer gives Christ His place, and the time to build the temple, the world to come, has not yet arrived.<a name=443:14></a> Now David does a peculiar thing; he does not restore the ark to its place in the tabernacle, but he spreads a tent for it in the city of David.<a name=443:15></a> Zion speaks of sovereign mercy.<a name=443:16></a> I think that is very much what God is doing in these days -- spreading a tent for the ark.<a name=443:17></a>

		As to the "last trumpet" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:52">1 Corinthians  15:52</a>), Scripture makes it quite clear that there will be a trumpet which will sound after the trumpet spoken of in that verse.<a name=477:7></a> When "all the tribes of the land .<a name=477:8></a>.<a name=477:9></a>.<a name=477:10></a> see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:30">Matthew  24:30</a>), they will most unquestionably see the saints coming with Him.<a name=477:11></a> This is a matter of revelation, and the Scripture cannot be broken.<a name=477:12></a> "When the Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:4">Colossians  3:4</a>).<a name=477:13></a> "The Lord has come amidst his holy myriads" (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#14">Jude  14</a>).<a name=477:14></a> "And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee" (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#14:5">Zechariah  14:5</a>).<a name=477:15></a> It is clear that if the saints come with Him, as they undoubtedly do, the last trumpet of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>has already sounded to raise them and to give them their place on high with Him.<a name=477:16></a> Then, following upon His coming, "He shall send his angels with a great sound of trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect .<a name=477:17></a>.<a name=477:18></a>.<a name=477:19></a> from the one extremity of the heavens to the other extremity of them" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:31">Matthew  24:31</a>).<a name=477:20></a> It is clear that His sending His angels with sound of trumpet is subsequent to His being seen coming on the clouds of heaven, having His raised and changed saints with Him according to the unmistakable testimony of the above scriptures.<a name=477:21></a> Your contention that "the last trumpet" must be literally the last seems to be
