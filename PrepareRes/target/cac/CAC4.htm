		The book of Numbers has great spiritual value as bringing out, typically, the order and service of God's people viewed as the assembly in the wilderness.<a name=1:1></a> It also points out very clearly different forms of unbelief and rebellion by which many have been diverted from the truth, and which are a danger to us all.<a name=1:2></a> But as the history continues we are made to realise that divine grace and faithfulness cannot be frustrated by any device of the enemy.<a name=1:3></a> The many provisions made for abnormal conditions show that God has taken account of all that would come in, and that He has adequate resources in grace and wisdom to meet it all.<a name=1:4></a> This is very touching, and is especially encouraging to those who wish to be faithful amidst the weakness and departure of the last days.<a name=1:5></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time when Jehovah spoke to Moses about taking "the sum of the whole assembly" is to be noted as indicating the connection in which God would take account of His people for military service.<a name=1:12></a> The tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40:17">Exodus  40:17</a>).<a name=1:13></a> The speaking of Jehovah in Leviticus appears to follow immediately on this (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#1:1">Leviticus  1:1</a>).<a name=1:14></a> Then Numbers begins with His speaking to Moses "in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt" (verse 1).<a name=1:15></a> So that this book assumes that those who take it up are in the light of the teaching of Exodus and Leviticus.<a name=1:16></a> It has reference to a people with the knowledge of redemption, and of the covenant, and who are now identified with "the tabernacle of testimony".<a name=1:17></a> These are the three great subjects of the book of Exodus.<a name=1:18></a> This book also views the people of God as having divine light with regard to approaching God, and as knowing something of the exercises, and also the appreciation of Christ, which have place in that connection, and which are brought out typically in the book of Leviticus.<a name=1:19></a> All this is morally antecedent to being taken account of in a militant way as set for the defence of the testimony, or as engaged in levitical service in relation to it, which are the subjects of

		<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1">Numbers  1</a>- 10:28.<a name=2:1></a> It will be observed that there is hardly any reference to the testimony in Leviticus, though it is mentioned in chapter 16:13 and in chapter 24:3 in connection with the mercy seat and the veil, but it is prominent in Numbers.<a name=2:2></a> The testimony has its place in the assembly viewed as in the wilderness.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that only males were numbered, and "from twenty years and upward, all that go forth to military service in Israel" (verses 2,3).<a name=2:4></a> This reckoning is "the sum" of those who are strong and can quit themselves like men in spiritual warfare; no account is taken of either women or children.<a name=2:5></a> "The whole assembly" is viewed here as composed of those who are full-grown in Christ, and marked by spiritual vigour.<a name=2:6></a> The hallowed firstborn males of the children of Israel were numbered from a month old and upward, as also were the males of the Levites, showing that when it is a question of being hallowed through redemption, or of being called to holy service, God takes account of persons from the earliest stage of His work in them.<a name=2:7></a> But for military service in relation to His testimony He will only have those numbered who are competent to take it up by reason of being full-grown.<a name=2:8></a> So that something more than being a believer, or a redeemed one, is required to give one a place in this numbering.<a name=2:9></a> One has, indeed, to declare his pedigree to the satisfaction of Moses and Aaron, and also to the satisfaction of the princes, "the heads of the thousands of Israel", but in addition to this it must be evident that he is "twenty years old", and able to bear arms.<a name=2:10></a> This is not a numbering of the redeemed, or of believers as such, but of those who are competent to take up military service such as might be called for on the part of those who surround and accompany "the tabernacle of testimony".<a name=2:11></a>

		The last chapter of Leviticus shows that, "from twenty years old even unto sixty years old", is the period of full value.<a name=3:1></a> Before that period is reached, or after it has passed, valuation is much lower.<a name=3:2></a> What is immature, or declining in strength, has not full value with God.<a name=3:3></a> We may gather from this that carnal persons, being but babes in Christ (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a> - 3), or those who go back into the babe condition, as some of the Hebrew believers did (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:11">Hebrews  5:11</a> - 14), or as the Galatians did (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:9">Galatians  4:9</a>), would not be taken account of in such a "sum of the whole assembly" as is contemplated in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1">Numbers  1</a>.<a name=3:4></a> The assembly is viewed here in its competency for military service, and none are numbered in this connection but those who are full grown in Christ, and who can quit themselves like men (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:13">1 Corinthians  16:13</a>).<a name=3:5></a> Romans calls upon the saints to "put on the armour of light", so that they are seen in that epistle as of military age; they are able to "overcome evil with good".<a name=3:6></a> It is only such as are characterised by the presence in them of the Spirit of God who are competent for military service.<a name=3:7></a> A carnal person may be a believer, and may have the Spirit, but he is not characterised for testimony by the Spirit.<a name=3:8></a> It is very pertinent to ask, Are we children, or are we really MEN?<a name=3:9></a> Paul said, "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child".<a name=3:10></a> Is that really true of us in a spiritual sense?<a name=3:11></a> If not, we are not such as would be numbered by Moses and Aaron and the princes.<a name=3:12></a>

		Ceasing from warfare is not contemplated in this chapter, nor such decline as would unfit us for it.<a name=3:13></a> It is one of the perfections of Scripture that it should be said here repeatedly "from twenty years old and upward" without any mention of an age when exemption would be granted.<a name=3:14></a> In relation to "the wars of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance attached to the numbering in the mind of God may be gathered from the fact that it was not entrusted to any but Moses and Aaron and the twelve princes of the tribes.<a name=4:5></a> It was not a mere counting of heads, but, in type, a spiritual discrimination.<a name=4:6></a> Moses representing Christ as Lord, sets forth the rights and authority of God; Aaron typifies Christ as exercising priestly discernment; and the princes represent responsible oversight and leadership in the assembly.<a name=4:7></a> It is a high tribunal before which to appear, but it is necessary to stand there in order to be numbered.<a name=4:8></a> This is something entirely different from any other census that ever was taken; it indicates how God would have His people numbered according to what they are spiritually as Jehovah's host in the wilderness.<a name=4:9></a> It is not here a question of names being written in heaven, but of being taken account of as men competent for spiritual warfare down here.<a name=4:10></a> God loves to take definite account of His people, and if we love Him as in the bond of the covenant we shall love to be taken account of by Him.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For that we must be able to stand before Moses; we must be prepared to be tested by the commandments of the Lord (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>).<a name=4:12></a> The principle of subjection to the Lord's authority is a primary qualification, as it will also be the principle by which all who profess to serve Him will ultimately be judged.<a name=4:13></a> "Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Aaron represents priestly discernment such as we see exercised by the Lord in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>,3.<a name=5:7></a> He takes account of the assemblies in their actual moral state, and in each case He singles out the overcomer for approval and distinction.<a name=5:8></a> Only such as have military prowess are taken account of in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#1">Numbers  1</a>, and the overcomers alone are seen as having this character under the priestly judgment of the Son of man in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>,3.<a name=5:9></a> To be numbered in relation to the testimony under the all discerning eye of Christ as the true Lawgiver and Priest is not a distinction that can be secured without qualifications.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then "the princes of the tribes of their father, the heads of the thousands of Israel" having their part in the numbering indicates that the spiritual judgment of the brethren, represented by those who take the lead amongst them, has a place which must not be ignored.<a name=5:11></a> None are numbered for identification with the testimony save those who establish their claim in presence of those who have exercise and responsibility in relation to it.<a name=5:12></a> There is still that which answers to "the tabernacle of testimony", and it is the only

	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot be taken account of in relation to the testimony without the recognition of the brethren.<a name=6:5></a> If we are truly in subjection to the Lord, and our state will bear His priestly scrutiny, we shall not, shrink from submitting ourselves to the judgment of those who carry responsibility amongst His people; it is essential to fellowship that we should do so.<a name=6:6></a> It is our privilege to stand together by the testimony of our Lord, not only as recognised by Him, but also by those who are faithful to Him.<a name=6:7></a> It is according to divine principles that one wishing to be identified with the testimony of our Lord should be commended to the saints by responsible brethren who have their confidence.<a name=6:8></a> The true character of Christian fellowship as it is available in a day of ruin according to 2 Timothy is not simply that of baptised persons, professed believers, or even true believers, but of those who are identified in heart with the testimony of our Lord.<a name=6:9></a> It is, indeed, a privilege to be recognised by the Lord, and also by the brethren, as having that character; and to be taken account of by name as each numbered person was (verses 2,3).<a name=6:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The earnest longing of the youngest believer should be to be recognised by the Lord, and by the brethren, as having come to maturity in Christ, and as fully identified with the testimony of our Lord.<a name=7:7></a> A babe in Christ who walks in the Spirit will soon be a young man; he will be "twenty years old", in a comparatively short time.<a name=7:8></a> We may see an example of this in the assembly of the Thessalonians who were but a short time converted; and yet were addressed as soldiers who could put on breastplate and helmet.<a name=7:9></a> God does not expect babes to fight; and He graciously considers for them as we see in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:17">Exodus  13:17</a>, but when His people had eaten flesh and manna, and drunk of the water from the smitten rock, ability for conflict was developed, so that Moses could say to Joshua, "Choose us men, and go out, fight with Amalek".<a name=7:10></a> And as having entered into the covenant, and having the tabernacle in their midst, "the sum of the whole assembly" could be

		In order to be numbered, it was necessary that they should declare their pedigree (verse 18).<a name=8:3></a> They must all prove that they are of Israel.<a name=8:4></a> It would not suffice to prove kinship with Abraham; the sons of Lot could do that.<a name=8:5></a> Nor would direct descent from Abraham give one a place, otherwise the sons of Ishmael and of Keturah could come in.<a name=8:6></a> To be able even to prove descent from Isaac would be unavailing; an Edomite could do that.<a name=8:7></a> One must be able to declare his pedigree as of the children of Israel.<a name=8:8></a> There is much instruction in this; there are many today who say they are believers, and they may be truly so, but are they on the line of refusing the flesh and what is natural, and recognising only what belongs to the risen Man?<a name=8:9></a> Paul said to Timothy, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings, in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evildoer" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:8">2 Timothy  2:8</a>,9).<a name=8:10></a> Lot was kindred with Abraham, he was a believer, but he was not a separate man; he felt the state of things in Sodom, but he did not separate from it.<a name=8:11></a> 2 Timothy calls urgently for separation from iniquity and from vessels to dishonour.<a name=8:12></a> A people mixed with the world cannot be in identification with the testimony of our Lord.<a name=8:13></a> Then the sons of Ishmael were descended from Abraham; they represent those who look to the flesh as capable of being cultivated under law, or under Christian influence.<a name=8:14></a> Paul would tell the Galatians that in going back to law and circumcision they were really taking the place of being descended from Ishmael, but they could not be numbered as having such a genealogy.<a name=8:15></a> The sons of Keturah were also of Abraham's house; I take it that they represent believers who give place to the natural -- the mind of man and natural ability, such as we see

		The fellowship of the apostles in which believers persevered at the beginning (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>), was clearly a militant fellowship; it was a community of interests to which everything in the world was adverse, as we may learn from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:23">Acts  4:23</a> - 30.<a name=9:11></a> It is no light thing to take up a position which is so contrary to all human thoughts that every influence in the world and in the religious profession will be opposed to it.<a name=9:12></a> It calls for "military service"; such was, assuredly, the fellowship of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>and 4.<a name=9:13></a> Nor is Christian fellowship less so today on the part of all who take it up.<a name=9:14></a> The priests and Levites encamped in an inner circle around "the tabernacle of testimony" in connection with which they served, but the children of Israel who were numbered for military service encamped in an outer circle to defend the tabernacle and those who served it.<a name=9:15></a> The public position of saints today is one of military

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scripture before us draws a very distinct line between those of the tribes numbered for military service, and the tribe of the Levites as reserved for the direct service of "the tabernacle of testimony" (see verses 44 - 54).<a name=10:4></a> There is much instruction in this.<a name=10:5></a> We are called to take part in both services, but if we are not vigorous in the first we shall be disqualified for the second.<a name=10:6></a> If we are not right in the outer or militant circle we shall not be right in the inner and more spiritual circle of the tabernacle.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We thus have at the end of chapter 1 a very noticeable exception from the general numbering.<a name=10:8></a> The tribe of Levi was not to be numbered, nor the sum of them taken from among the children of Israel (verses 47 - 49).<a name=10:9></a> They were not called to go forth to military service, but were appointed "over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it" (verse 50).<a name=10:10></a> Their service was not the defence of the testimony in a military way, but keeping the charge of it in holy service so that all might be carried on in suitability to God.<a name=10:11></a> Theirs was a vigilant care that everything in the service of the tabernacle of testimony should be maintained for God's pleasure.<a name=10:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Their service was thus more distinctly Godward, and it was that death and wrath might not come upon the assembly.<a name=11:1></a> This is not a question of meeting assaults of the enemy from without, but of serving in holy things -- so that everything in the service shall be agreeable to Him who is served in it, and who is infinitely holy.<a name=11:2></a> The children of Israel in general were to encamp "round about the tent of meeting, afar off" (chapter 2:2), but the Levites were to encamp in an inner circle between the tabernacle and the tribes who encircled it "afar off".<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All saints are called to the defence of the testimony against hostile attacks to which it may be exposed in an evil world, but they are also called to maintain the testimony as in relation to the holy pleasure of God, and in doing so they render levitical service.<a name=11:4></a> It is not that any saints are precluded from being Levites; they may all be wholly for God, and separated to His service in relation to "the tabernacle of testimony", but, viewed as Levites, they are in a nearer and holier place and service than when they are viewed as the children of Israel generally, and numbered for military service.<a name=11:5></a> God calls our attention to the marked difference between the two positions by so definitely distinguishing the Levites from the twelve tribes.<a name=11:6></a> We are all called to be warriors in the Lord's host, and to stand against infidelity and evil teachings of all kinds, but this is not such a profound and heart-searching exercise, nor does it call for such intense separation or holiness, as seeking to carry out all the service connected with the testimony in such a way that it shall be entirely according to His mind and for His pleasure.<a name=11:7></a> It was part of the Levites' work to minister to the assembly, but in Numbers they are chiefly seen, not as ministering to men, but as cleansed and separated to be a wave-offering to Jehovah, to be wholly His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a wondrous and holy system of things which has been inaugurated, and which has to be maintained for God in the midst of adverse conditions here.<a name=12:3></a> The things in which God's glory and pleasure appear, and in relation to which His holy service is to be carried on, are known as matters of testimony.<a name=12:4></a> If they were in public display in power, everything that is contrary to them would have to give place to them, but as being introduced as matters of testimony they are a witness on God's part to what is approved of Him in the face of everything that is in the world.<a name=12:5></a> Levitical service, as seen in this book, is connected with this divine testimony.<a name=12:6></a> It has to be maintained in its true and holy character as corresponding exactly with God's mind, and this is a very hallowed service.<a name=12:7></a> "All the vessels thereof" and "all things that belong to it" have to be borne and served, and the charge thereof kept, so that in every detail things are just as God would have them to be.<a name=12:8></a> It is not a question of serving men, but of serving God in relation to His own testimony, so that nothing may be falsified or lowered in character, but all maintained in its true and divine perfection.<a name=12:9></a> Human or natural influences could have no place in such a service.<a name=12:10></a> Hence we read, "the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death" (verse 51).<a name=12:11></a> The danger of "wrath" is clearly intimated (verse 53), showing the necessity for an intense degree of separation and of moral purity such as attached typically to the Levites according to chapter 8; but we shall come to the service of the Levites later in the book.<a name=12:12></a>

		What is brought out here has an important bearing on how things have to be carried out for God's pleasure in His assembly and particularly with reference to matters which have to be taken up in local responsibility.<a name=13:3></a> This would seem to be indicated by the words, "every one by his standard, with the ensign of their father's house" (verse 2).<a name=13:4></a> There is a particular place assigned to each, which determines his relations to his neighbours, and to all Israel, and to "the tent of meeting".<a name=13:5></a> One cannot disregard with impunity the Lord's appointments in this way.<a name=13:6></a> There is no room for individual choice or preference; no option as to <i>where</i> we "encamp"; the <i>place</i> where we actually take up our relation to "the tent of meeting" is assigned in the providential ordering of God, and has to be accepted.<a name=13:7></a> The recognition of this would make it a serious matter to change one's locality without being assured that to do so was in the way of divine ordering.<a name=13:8></a> Our most important links are those which we have with the people and testimony of God, and it is well to take them up as recognising that we do so under divine regulation.<a name=13:9></a> We are not unattached units with liberty to do as we please.<a name=13:10></a> Where we "encamp" is always to have reference to "the tent of meeting"

		Everyone is to encamp "by his standard", and the "standard" is connected with the four "camps" rather than with each local tribe.<a name=14:2></a> The number <i>four</i> stands connected with what is universal -- the four camps occupying positions east, south, west and north of "the tent of meeting".<a name=14:3></a> The "tribe" would be, in each case, specially local, but no one tribe has a "standard" to itself.<a name=14:4></a> The "standard" and the "camp" to which it attached always included two other tribes; a definite testimony that even as viewed in the most local setting they encamped and journeyed as in unity with their brethren.<a name=14:5></a> This intimates that it is of God that saints in any locality should preserve close touch with brethren that are geographically adjacent.<a name=14:6></a> Fellowship meetings, now happily so common amongst the brethren, provide an excellent opportunity for this.<a name=14:7></a> It is not easy to realise directly in a practical way our universal links, but in recognising those in proximity to us we reach out as far as we are providentially permitted towards the universal fellowship.<a name=14:8></a> God would preserve us from being narrowed down to what is purely local.<a name=14:9></a> The assemblies are local, but they are never to regard themselves as independent units, or to think that they can either encamp or move according to God without regarding their brethren who are in proximity to them.<a name=14:10></a> There should be a moving together, not merely by arrangements or agreements, but as sharing spiritual exercises.<a name=14:11></a> Paul encouraged this by saying, "And when the letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans, and that ye also read that from Laodicea" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:16">Colossians  4:16</a>).<a name=14:12></a> The Lord would have any local exercise to be a concern to

		The priests and Levites were expressly excluded from the numbering of the tribes in chapters 1 and 2, that we might learn to clearly distinguish between the saints viewed as in "military service", and the same persons viewed as keeping "the charge of the sanctuary", or as performing the service of "the tent of meeting".<a name=21:9></a> We find the latter in the chapter now before us, and

		The death of Nadab and Abihu being spoken of here, and priesthood being exercised by Eleazar and Ithamar in the presence of Aaron (verse 4), has undoubtedly a bearing on present conditions.<a name=22:8></a> The priesthood has publicly come to grief, but there is a remnant left who are enabled with humble and chastened spirits to carry on priestly service in the presence of Christ.<a name=22:9></a> It is as conscious that this is the position of things today that we can profit by the instruction of Numbers.<a name=22:10></a> The system of holy things with which we have to do is altogether divine and spiritual; we can only serve in relation to it as being spiritual ourselves; and we serve with a humbling sense that what has had the prominent place in a public way has entirely broken down, and become a subject of divine judgment.<a name=22:11></a>

		The tabernacle was, as <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:5">Hebrews  8:5</a> and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:23">Hebrews  9:23</a> tell us, "the representation and shadow of heavenly things", "the figurative representations of the things in the heavens".<a name=23:9></a> It "represented the vast scene in which God's glory is displayed in Christ" (see note to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:1">Hebrews  9:1</a> in J.<a name=23:10></a>N.<a name=23:11></a>D.<a name=23:12></a>'s translation).<a name=23:13></a> As Levites we are brought near to God, "to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to minister to them" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16:9">Numbers  16:9</a>).<a name=23:14></a> Not a single detail in the tabernacle would have suggested itself to the mind of man if God had not made it known; all was to be made "according to the pattern which has been shown to thee in the mountain" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:5">Hebrews  8:5</a>).<a name=23:15></a> As Levites we are called to serve in relation to a system

		Then we learn from verses 11 - 13 that the Levites were taken instead of all the hallowed firstborn in Israel.<a name=24:2></a> They thus typify the saints as composing "the assembly of the firstborn who are enregistered in heaven" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>), having no earthly inheritance, but having a heavenly place and service.<a name=24:3></a> "Every male from a month old and upward" was to be numbered (verses 14 - 16).<a name=24:4></a> When it is a question of "military service" the numbering is "from twenty years old and upward", but when the saints are viewed as hallowed to God through the redemption value of the blood of Christ they are taken account of by the Lord (note that it is only Moses and Aaron who number the Levites) long before they can take account of themselves.<a name=24:5></a> Indeed, one could say, "God who set me apart even from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>), and of the same one the Lord could say when he was only three days converted, "this man is an elect vessel to me" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>).<a name=24:6></a> We may see from this that levitical service is a matter of divine sovereignty, and that what we are called to be as Levites is in view from the earliest period of our history.<a name=24:7></a> It is usually the case that there are early indications of an appointment to service; Timothy was clearly marked out by "prophecies as to thee preceding" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:18">1 Timothy  1:18</a>).<a name=24:8></a> The Levite was not matured as a servant until he was thirty years old, but all that he would be was in prospect from the beginning.<a name=24:9></a> What an impression would be made upon us if we understood that from the very outset of God's ways with us we were hallowed for His holy service!<a name=24:10></a> Satan will no doubt do what is possible to mar us for that service, both before

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We learn next (verses 17 - 39) that the tribe of Levi consisted of three families, from one of which Aaron and his sons were taken and consecrated as priests, so that they along with Moses, occupied a special place "before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising".<a name=25:2></a> The three families, apart from the priests, respectively encamped westward, southward, and northward of the tabernacle.<a name=25:3></a> So that the priestly and levitical encampings are seen to stand in relation to the tabernacle on all four sides, indicating the universality of priestly and levitical service.<a name=25:4></a> Levi means "united", and no family of his sons served independently of the other families, nor were any or all of them to serve apart from the priests who appointed them "every one to his service and to his burden" (chapter 4:19).<a name=25:5></a> In the divinely ordered system there are no gaps and no overlapping; every needed service is adequately provided for, and though there is great variety in the nature of the service it constitutes one whole, all directed in spiritual intelligence and contributing to a complete result.<a name=25:6></a> Each Levite would be conscious that he was doing something that was necessary to further the whole tabernacle system and its service.<a name=25:7></a> However small his bit might be, he would do it as having the universal thought before him, and as realising that he was one with all his brethren in the service.<a name=25:8></a>

		The things mentioned as constituting "the charge of the sanctuary", and committed to the care of the families of the Kohathites -- the ark, the table, the candlestick, the altar, the veil -- were all directly typical of Christ personally, and hence we can understand that the service of the Kohathites was "most holy" (chapter 4:4).<a name=27:3></a> The detail of it will come before us in chapter 4.<a name=27:4></a> Every spiritual apprehension of Christ which was given to the apostles and others at the beginning, and communicated by them to the saints in Spirit-taught words, has to be carried through by levitical service in such wise that it suffers no loss or damage.<a name=27:5></a> It is of vital importance that what we have heard from the beginning should abide in us; and the thought conveyed in the carrying of the holy things would seem to be that what they typify is preserved intact amongst the people of God, and carried through as the subject of testimony.<a name=27:6></a> This is not the direct service of God in the way of prayer, praise or worship; that would be priests' work; but this levitical service is to carry through everything that forms part of the testimony of God in such wise that it remains in its full original character amongst the people of God, and they remain fully identified with it.<a name=27:7></a> The very service supposes that the testimony will move, but it moves without losing one feature that had a place in it at the beginning.<a name=27:8></a> We know, alas!<a name=27:9></a> how great the failure has been as to this.<a name=27:10></a> The levitical service has broken down publicly as well as the priesthood, but the testimony remains what it was at the beginning, and true levitical service is just the same today as it was at the beginning, and true priesthood likewise.<a name=27:11></a> We have to return in our faith and affections to God's order, and to seek to be consistent with it, notwithstanding all the public departure from it.<a name=27:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The encamping of the children of Israel having been ordered in relation to the tent of meeting, and the service of the Levites appointed, we now learn that God dwells in the midst of the camps.<a name=45:5></a> This necessitates undefiled conditions, for if God dwells in the midst of His people their condition and their associations must be suitable to Him.<a name=45:6></a> So we read, "Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by a dead person".<a name=45:7></a> To put such out of the camp was not left to the priests or Levites; it was the solemn responsibility of all "the children of Israel".<a name=45:8></a> And we are told, "the children of Israel did so" (verse 4); there was no hesitation in carrying out the divine command.<a name=45:9></a> They realised at that moment that God dwelt in their midst, and that all must be suitable to Him.<a name=45:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And whosoever is defiled by a dead person" was also to be "put out of the camp".<a name=47:3></a> There is more reference to being defiled by the dead in this book than in any other.<a name=47:4></a> The Nazarite defiled the head of his consecration if he touched a dead body (chapter 6); those unclean through the dead body of a man could not eat the passover (chapter 9); any Israelite who did not purify himself after contact with one dead defiled the tabernacle of Jehovah (chapter 19).<a name=47:5></a> In each case it is "the dead body of <i>a man</i>" that defiles, not the carcase of an animal, showing that it is not death in itself that defiles, but man as being in that state.<a name=47:6></a> To touch a dead body would typify coming into moral contact with that in man which has no vitality Godward.<a name=47:7></a> There is an immense amount of this in the Christian profession, as it is said of Sardis, "thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:1">Revelation  3:1</a>), but such a state is defiling to the people of God who touch it.<a name=47:8></a> There is something actively offensive in the leper, and in the one with an issue; they represent the flesh in a wilful or unrestrained form.<a name=47:9></a> But the defilement which comes of contact with a dead person is more negative; it represents the effect on a living person of touching -- or coming under the influence of -- that which has no vitality Godward.<a name=47:10></a> Such is the flesh at its best estate.<a name=47:11></a> If man, as according to the flesh, yields nothing for God, to give that man any place in a religious way is to bring in what is essentially unclean.<a name=47:12></a> And if God dwells in the midst of His people, as He surely does, He cannot tolerate

		Another section of the chapter follows which provides for things being adjusted that may have been wrong amongst God's people.<a name=48:5></a> Any trespass against a brother is really "unfaithfulness against Jehovah" (verse 6), and it is to be confessed and recompense made.<a name=48:6></a> Only thus can God's people move together through the wilderness in faithfulness to Him as dwelling in their midst.<a name=48:7></a> The trespass being recompensed to Jehovah (verse 8) shows that any trespass against a brother is really an infringement of the rights of God, for which He requires to be recompensed even if there are no means of finding the brother trespassed against or his kinsman.<a name=48:8></a> The trespasser must, in any case, put himself right with God.<a name=48:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one in the camp where God dwells is to remain under the cloud of unfaithfulness.<a name=48:10></a> God looks for fidelity to Him in our relations with one another, and if there has been any breach of this He makes provision for it to be adjusted.<a name=48:11></a> And, in result, we find that the priest is enriched.<a name=48:12></a> Even a trespass becomes the means of enriching the priest, as well as "every heave-offering" and "every man's hallowed things" (verses 9, 10).<a name=48:13></a> Every trespass rightly dealt with increases what is spiritual amongst the saints.<a name=48:14></a> This is clearly the divine intent, and if we take God's way we shall reach God's end.<a name=48:15></a>

		The spirit of jealousy comes in when the rights of divine love have been owned, where a covenant has been entered into, but cause has been given to suspect that some corrupting influence is at work.<a name=49:5></a> How often is the conduct of God's people such as to provoke Him to jealousy!<a name=49:6></a> We see this both in the Old Testament and the New (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:22">1 Corinthians  10:22</a>).<a name=49:7></a> And when this is the case a divine testing will search the inward parts and discover the true state of the affections.<a name=49:8></a> At the present time it is always possible that there may be unfaithfulness, and therefore both the faithful and the unfaithful are constantly being brought under a process of testing which is searching enough to penetrate to the most secret thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=49:9></a> Such testing as this chapter sets before us in type is not required in the case of those who have manifestly got away from the Lord and gone into the world.<a name=49:10></a> <i>They</i> are exposed by their public course.<a name=49:11></a> But the woman who is subjected to the trial of jealousy is one who, if unfaithful, is so "in secret".<a name=49:12></a> There is "no witness against her"; she has "not been caught" in any delinquency (verse 13).<a name=49:13></a> Publicly all seems right.<a name=49:14></a> She is near to spiritual influences; she can be brought to the priest, and set by him before Jehovah; she can

		The first action is that the man upon whom the spirit of jealousy comes is to bring his wife to the priest, and also "her offering for her, a tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an oblation of jealousy, a memorial oblation, bringing iniquity to remembrance" (verse 15).<a name=50:5></a> No unfaithful woman in Israel could be taken by her husband to the priest without "her offering for her" being also taken.<a name=50:6></a> Nothing could be more wonderful than this.<a name=50:7></a> Christ is introduced at once, typified by "barley-meal".<a name=50:8></a> It is a gracious and yet a holy thought.<a name=50:9></a>

		In regard to the construction of the tabernacle every detail was to be "as Jehovah commanded Moses".<a name=78:2></a> All was set up after a heavenly pattern, and anointed by Moses; it was all exactly as God intended it to be.<a name=78:3></a> But in the offering of the princes we see another side.<a name=78:4></a> The people, as represented by their tribal "heads", came forward to offer; they contributed what was suitable to further the service of the tabernacle, both in regard to its wilderness movements and its altar service Godward.<a name=78:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter shows, as it seems to me, what God would have to mark His saints in every locality.<a name=78:6></a> For the twelve princes represented all the tribes; they typify a spiritual lead given in every part of the Israel of God.<a name=78:7></a> Some of the tribes were much larger, numerically, than others; they varied from 74,000 in Judah down to 32,000 in Manasseh, but the same lead was given by every one of the princes.<a name=78:8></a> God has been pleased to set His testimony in different localities, but, while the assemblies may be small or relatively large, the same character of spiritual leading is to have place universally.<a name=78:9></a> We should be concerned that in every local assembly there shall be an element of <i>spiritual</i> leading which is in correspondence with the divine system.<a name=78:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle of leadership has a great place in divine order; God would always provide those who are able to give a spiritual lead to His people.<a name=78:11></a> But it is important for us all to see that we follow a spiritual lead, for Christendom is full of Korahs, Dathans, and Abirams -- princes and men of renown -- who would lead us in a wrong direction.<a name=78:12></a> But such leaders as we see in chapter 7 can be safely followed, and we can gladly and thankfully recognise that God has raised

	<div class="paragraph">
		Two great features of spiritual leading are seen here.<a name=79:3></a> The first is a beautiful spirit of co-operation in the work of the Lord, and the second is that the altar is dedicated by receiving what it was intended to receive.<a name=79:4></a> These are two things which God would have to be secured in every locality where His people are found, whether the "tribe" is small or large.<a name=79:5></a>

		The tabernacle as a whole, and the altar in particular, are seen here as set up and anointed and hallowed by Moses.<a name=79:6></a> The true tabernacle, we are told, was pitched by the Lord, and not man (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:2">Hebrews  8:2</a>); it is not of the world; it is entirely apart from human imperfection.<a name=79:7></a> In the system set up by the Lord, and anointed, every detail has divine character, and can only be maintained as under the anointing of the Spirit.<a name=79:8></a> It was never in the mind of God that the great realities which He has set up should be preserved in any other way than in the power of the anointing.<a name=79:9></a> They were so set up at Pentecost, and so they still remain where-ever they are truly known.<a name=79:10></a> There is a remarkable expression in <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:15">Malachi  2:15</a>, "the remnant of the Spirit was his", attaching a remnant thought even to the Spirit, and suggesting that the Spirit remains true to what He began with.<a name=79:11></a> We have often been reminded that a "remnant" in Scripture does not mean a fag-end, but something which retains its original character in the midst of departure.<a name=79:12></a> There is that which remains still as anointed, something which is not of flesh or of man, but which expresses divine thoughts.<a name=79:13></a> It is not merely a little better than what is found in the Christian profession generally, but, something which is of God, and carries the anointing of His Spirit, and thus has a hallowed character.<a name=79:14></a> Now

		The "princes" who offered were men who realised the wonderful character of what had been set up in the tabernacle.<a name=80:4></a> As having an appreciation of it they could, without any specific instructions, act in relation to it; they could offer what was suitable.<a name=80:5></a> The spring of spontaneity in response to God lies in the fact that something is brought in which by its greatness and preciousness commands the heart.<a name=80:6></a> It was something having come in from God of surpassing excellence which called forth the choice offerings of the magi (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:11">Matthew  2:11</a>), the ministry of the women (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:3">Luke  8:3</a>), the anointings (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>), the praises of the children in the temple (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:15">Matthew  21:15</a>), the offerings laid at the feet of the apostles (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:35">Acts  4:35</a>,37).<a name=80:7></a> All were spontaneous, and all flowed from hearts which were commanded by something most precious.<a name=80:8></a>

		The "waggons" seem to represent what is not exactly spiritual in itself, but which furthers the work of the Lord.<a name=82:10></a> We have the privilege of seeing that the work does not bear heavily on those who are engaged in it; there are many ways in which we can give practical help.<a name=82:11></a> Mark was serviceable to Paul for ministry; Tertius wrote a long epistle to saints at Rome at his dictation; Phoebe helped him in some way not known to us; Gaius and Philemon entertained him; saints in Philippi sent him needful things; Onesiphorus often refreshed him; in all these services we may see what would answer to the "waggons" of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>.<a name=82:12></a> Such help as this, if administered under priestly direction-"under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest"-would be apportioned "to each according to his service" (verses 5,7,8).<a name=82:13></a> The <i>kind</i> of work in

		which each is engaged would be considered.<a name=83:1></a> Some services are more in need of accessory help than others.<a name=83:2></a> For example, some undertake long journeys, others make the distribution of books and tracts a great part of their service, while others again are in circumstances where temporal needs come much before them, and have to be met, if possible, that some practical expression of grace may go along with, and adorn, the ministry of grace.<a name=83:3></a> Help such as the "waggons" typify is not to be allotted indiscriminately, but with due regard to the service of each.<a name=83:4></a> No true Levite would desire to have more help of this kind than he actually needed, or could profitably use in the work of the Lord.<a name=83:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But "waggons" have no part in that spiritual ministry which is called "the service of the sanctuary", and which is allotted to the sons of Kohath (verse 9).<a name=83:6></a> This is a service in which nothing can have place but spiritual power.<a name=83:7></a> "Waggons" add nothing to the Kohathites; they bear "upon the shoulder"; no accessory help enters into this.<a name=83:8></a> The varied helps which Paul received from one and another in a material way added nothing to his Kohathite service.<a name=83:9></a> That was a matter for which he was a chosen vessel, and which was carried out in the grace and spiritual power for it which he had directly from the Lord.<a name=83:10></a> The saints might, indeed, help in this by prayer, but this is sanctuary support given to sanctuary service; it is in itself Kohathite service of a high and priestly order.<a name=83:11></a> It belongs to an altogether different range of things from the kind of help which is typified by "waggons".<a name=83:12></a> It is important that we should distinguish between what has "sanctuary" character, and which is sustained purely by spiritual means and power, indicated by bearing "upon the shoulder", and those accessory helps to the work of the Lord which are in view in the "waggons".<a name=83:13></a> There are holy ministries which are

	<div class="paragraph">
		borne only in personal spiritual power.<a name=84:1></a> For example, the writing of the Gospels, and the ministry of the apostles, was Kohathite service of a very high order; "waggons" could have no part there.<a name=84:2></a> But the copying and circulating by others of what the apostles ministered would greatly further the movements of the testimony, and such a service as this might correspond with the offering of "waggons".<a name=84:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The service of the sanctuary" is not facilitated by "waggons"; it depends on the personal spiritual power of those who render it, and on the spiritual service of prayer by the saints as the holy priesthood.<a name=84:4></a> When Paul said to Timothy, "fill up the full measure of thy ministry", and would have Archippus to "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it", I think he had before him a service which was to be carried on purely in spiritual power.<a name=84:5></a> But Paul said to the Corinthians, "Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I.<a name=84:6></a> Let not therefore any one despise him; but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:10">1 Corinthians  16:10</a>,11).<a name=84:7></a> In this he is giving the Corinthians the opportunity to provide "waggons"; that is, to do what they could to facilitate Timothy's service and movements.<a name=84:8></a> <i>All</i> can have part in this.<a name=84:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such an offering as the princes brought has its fitting place and value, but it does not extend to Kohathite service, the holy things of the sanctuary had still to be borne on the shoulders of the Kohathites.<a name=84:10></a> To put the holy things in a waggon would have been a breach of divine order which would have incurred God's displeasure, as David found to his cost (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#13:7">1 Chronicles  13:7</a> - 10; <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#15:2">1 Chronicles  15:2</a>,13).<a name=84:11></a> It is important to notice this; if any supposed offering of love set aside divine order, or practically

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While recognising the secondary place which "waggons" have in relation to the testimony we do well to note the beautiful evidence of co-operation which they afford.<a name=85:4></a> Two princes joined in the offering of each waggon, and each contributed an ox: Every part of the levitical service seems designed to emphasise the importance of practical co-operation in the work of the Lord, and this principle is also illustrated in a marked way in the offering of the princes.<a name=85:5></a> Co-operation is not quite the same thing as fellowship, though, of course, it must be in the light and bond of the fellowship.<a name=85:6></a> Partners in a business are in a fellowship determined by the terms of their partnership, but if they do not co-operate their business will most likely come to grief.<a name=85:7></a> We might say that as Israelites we are in the fellowship, but as Levites we have to learn to co-operate.<a name=85:8></a> Paul refers to "every one joined in the work and labouring" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:16">1 Corinthians  16:16</a>).<a name=85:9></a> This is the thought of co-operation; it signifies practical agreement and working together with a common end in view.<a name=85:10></a> Paul said of Timothy, "he works the work of the Lord, even as I" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:10">1 Corinthians  16:10</a>); "as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:22">Philippians  2:22</a>).<a name=85:11></a> He calls Epaphroditus his "fellow-work-man", and speaks of others as "fellow-labourers".<a name=85:12></a> This co-operation is what the Lord intends to mark every local assembly of His people.<a name=85:13></a> That we are not

		This is what is needed if the work of the Lord is to be furthered.<a name=86:3></a> It is indicated by the Lord sending out His disciples two and two.<a name=86:4></a> We see how Paul delighted to join Timothy and others with him in labour.<a name=86:5></a> An apprehension of the anointed system would bring about a holy blending of interest.<a name=86:6></a> The Lord had this in view when He said, "if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>).<a name=86:7></a> Each prince brings an ox -- a full measure of spiritual energy and steady purposeful labour -- but it is brought to pull in a yoke with another in a perfect uniting of labour.<a name=86:8></a> This is how "princes" offer.<a name=86:9></a> Many a one has energy, but is not sufficiently devoted to the anointed system to blend with others in furthering it.<a name=86:10></a> Paul was ready to blend with the twelve, and they were ready to blend with him, but Diotrephes could neither blend with John nor with other labourers.<a name=86:11></a> We might say, to speak according to the type before us, that one prince cannot supply a waggon; it needs two as a matter of divine adequacy.<a name=86:12></a> A real furthering of the Lord's work depends on the blending of interest and labour.<a name=86:13></a> There is not only mutual help in being yoke-fellows, but there is in it a wholesome check upon the tendency to become too individual in service.<a name=86:14></a> The "princes" evidently had no wish to individualise themselves; they thought it advantageous to co-operate.<a name=86:15></a> How important it is locally that those who work the work of the Lord should co-operate-that it should be manifest that there is a true pulling together!<a name=86:16></a> It may

		This is a unique offering, and therefore of special interest, and it is noticeable that the first things offered were silver and gold vessels.<a name=89:9></a> The first thought suggested to us in relation to the dedication of the altar is that of suitable vessels, involving spiritual value and weight.<a name=89:10></a> The weight of the vessels is given, not their size.<a name=89:11></a> God's balances are always in action to weigh us.<a name=89:12></a> One who does not say much may be a weighty vessel; a man of many words may be really a light vessel.<a name=89:13></a> And it is also evident that the material of which silver and gold vessels are made has been subjected to a refining process.<a name=89:14></a> It is only as the dross is taken from the silver that there "cometh forth a vessel for the refiner" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:4">Proverbs  25:4</a>).<a name=89:15></a> The silver vessels represent saints viewed as redeemed to God, and therefore having divine value.<a name=89:16></a> What we are naturally does not enter

		Then the princes also offered "one cup of ten shekels of gold, full of incense" (verse 14).<a name=93:3></a> Gold is a symbol of what is divine, so that a cup of gold would refer to a vessel which can be viewed as entirely God's creation in Christ.<a name=93:4></a> "If any one be in Christ there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of God" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a>,18).<a name=93:5></a> The new man, which saints are regarded as having put on, is a divine creation, and is "according to God".<a name=93:6></a> As in new creation the saints are of God, and only as thus viewed abstractedly -- that is, apart from all that we are naturally or as in the flesh -- could we be symbolised by a vessel of gold.<a name=93:7></a> But it must be remembered that what we are as a new creation in Christ Jesus is a great reality; it is that which is to subsist eternally; and it is our privilege to abstract ourselves by the Spirit's power from everything else, and to view ourselves according to what we are in new creation.<a name=93:8></a> It is only in nearness to God that we can truly do this, and it is not without significance that the cup of gold is only "of ten shekels".<a name=93:9></a> It seems to intimate that the more precious thoughts of God are not secured on the responsive side in a vessel of large dimensions.<a name=93:10></a> But they <i>are</i> secured in such a way that the fragrance of them is brought to Him.<a name=93:11></a> I think we might say that in the prayers of Paul in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>and 3 we have what corresponds with the incense in a vessel of gold.<a name=93:12></a> Paul could take up the most precious thoughts of God in regard to Christ and the saints, and present them in an intercessory way.<a name=93:13></a> But in so doing he views the saints as

		Then "from fifty years old" the Levite retires "from the labour of the service, and shall serve no more; but he shall minister with his brethren in the tent of meeting, and keep the charge" (verses 25,26).<a name=110:4></a> Three different thoughts come before the mind in this connection.<a name=110:5></a> First, it seems to indicate that levitical service is to be marked by full competency, and that no features of decline or decrepitude are to appear in it.<a name=110:6></a> It suggests the maintenance of a high standard of efficiency, in a spiritual sense, as being the only thing suitable in the service of God.<a name=110:7></a> Secondly, it conveys an impression of a time limit to active service.<a name=110:8></a> We should labour in the sense of this all the time.<a name=110:9></a> Even the Lord said, "I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day.<a name=110:10></a> The night is coming when no one can work" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#9:4">John  9:4</a>).<a name=110:11></a> Each of us has his "day" of service; it will soon be over; how important to fill it up rightly!<a name=110:12></a> The Levite had the sense all the time that he had a measured period in which to serve, and that the time was coming when it would close.<a name=110:13></a> J.<a name=110:14></a>B.<a name=110:15></a>S.<a name=110:16></a> said to me that he felt it to be a solemn moment when he realised that his active labours were over.<a name=110:17></a> Our allotted period of service here in the tent of meeting will soon be over, and we shall never have another opportunity for that service.<a name=110:18></a> How the Lord filled up His "day"!<a name=110:19></a> Mark's gospel presents Him in the unremitting service and devotion of the true Levite.<a name=110:20></a>

		Peter, knowing that the putting off of his tabernacle is speedily to take place, and Paul the aged, a prisoner at Rome, feeling that he has combated the good combat and finished the race, are both found, in a most devoted and diligent way, keeping the charge.<a name=111:7></a> It is really a very fine way for the individual servant to finish his course in the wilderness.<a name=111:8></a> We have known beloved servants in our own day who have reached years when active labour had to cease, but who continued to the very end to keep the charge.<a name=111:9></a> I was one of the last persons to hear C.<a name=111:10></a>H.<a name=111:11></a>M.<a name=111:12></a> pray.<a name=111:13></a> It was most touching to hear the aged and feeble Levite pouring out his heart to God, first for the whole assembly, and then for the little companies gathered everywhere to the Lord's Name.<a name=111:14></a> The Lord's interests were the great burden of his heart.<a name=111:15></a> Though he had been for a length of time incapacitated for any public service he was still keeping the charge.<a name=111:16></a>

		It is necessary to note the dates in this book, for they are important, and have spiritual significance.<a name=112:8></a> In point of time the people kept the passover according to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#9">Numbers  9</a>before they were numbered as in chapters 1 and 3.<a name=112:9></a> The tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in "the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt".<a name=112:10></a> Then followed the twelve days during which the altar was dedicated, according to chapter 7.<a name=112:11></a> Then the lamps were lighted, and the Levites cleansed and offered for the service of the tent of meeting.<a name=112:12></a> Then on the fourteenth day the passover was to be held.<a name=112:13></a> And on the first day of the second month the numbering took place.<a name=112:14></a> It is necessary to be with God in relation to His system, and to hold the Passover in that connection, before we can be taken account of for military service.<a name=112:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The passover enlarges according to the position from which it is viewed.<a name=113:8></a> When Moses first kept it it was "that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them", but we have seen in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#8">Numbers  8</a>that the firstborn, as represented in the Levites, have now become "a wave-offering" wholly for God, and for His service.<a name=113:9></a> I take it that the Passover as referred to in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>would be the passover in the wilderness aspect; that is, as held by the assembly of God in the midst of which He dwells.<a name=113:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a good sign when the conscience is tender as to what is suitable to God.<a name=114:4></a> I wonder how far that is our standard!<a name=114:5></a> There are a thousand things around us which are not considered evil by men of the world, or even by many professing Christians, which to a sensitive conscience are like the touch of a dead body.<a name=114:6></a> Evidently Moses recognised a fine sensitiveness in these men, and was assured that their exercises would have Jehovah's attention.<a name=114:7></a> "Stay, and I will hear what Jehovah commands concerning you".<a name=114:8></a> Their cam was really of immense importance, and particularly for ourselves, for it brought out that God could provide for abnormal conditions amongst His people, and secure, even with reference to such conditions, what was due to Himself, and what the faith and love of His people desired.<a name=114:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to admit that conditions amongst the people of God are very abnormal today.<a name=114:10></a> There is much that corresponds with the unclean state in which these men were found; what is required under such circumstances is the exercise of an honest and good heart.<a name=114:11></a> These men had sensitive consciences as to the uncleanness, but they had also true desire of heart to keep the passover.<a name=114:12></a> "We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not present the offering of Jehovah at its set time among the children of Israel"?<a name=114:13></a> (verse 7).<a name=114:14></a> I think we may say that they had been rightly affected by the covenant, and by the holy order of the tabernacle; they were impressed with the need for suitability, and they judged of it by a divine standard.<a name=114:15></a> It is a wholesome

		But then, on the other hand, they greatly valued the privilege of presenting "the offering of Jehovah at its set time among the children of Israel".<a name=115:2></a> Surely there was some divine way of meeting their disability, so that they might not be deprived of a privilege which they greatly desired as lovers of Jehovah?<a name=115:3></a> It was an appeal to the consideration of God which He would not disregard.<a name=115:4></a> It brought out a gracious provision which formed no part of the original order -- an excess of grace which could only appear under abnormal conditions.<a name=115:5></a> The exercises and desires of these men must have been peculiarly pleasing to God.<a name=115:6></a> They felt keenly their state of uncleanness, but they knew God well enough to rise above it into the greatness of His grace.<a name=115:7></a> "Why are we kept back?<a name=115:8></a>" Their hearts urged them on to "present the offering of Jehovah".<a name=115:9></a> Could He say that He had no provision for such a state of things?<a name=115:10></a> His whole course of dealing with His people had been the blessed witness that He <i>could</i> meet in grace the most abnormal conditions, and glorify Himself in doing it.<a name=115:11></a> Would He now be at a loss how to act for men who were unclean, but whose hearts, nevertheless, longed to present His offering?<a name=115:12></a> Surely not!<a name=115:13></a> One great lesson of this book is that God <i>can</i> meet every condition that arises amongst His people.<a name=115:14></a> He can give a defiled Nazarite a new start; He will cause the ark to go before His people if Moses in unbelief wants Hobab for eyes; He will make the murmurings to cease by setting up priesthood; He will provide for purifying uncleanness by the water of purification; He will answer the contention of the people by giving water from the rock when it was spoken to; He will meet the serpent's bite by the brazen serpent; He will answer the adversary of His

		The divine order, as presented in the preceding chapters, was perfect, but it called for continued subjection, and exercise in dependence, and this is never acceptable to the flesh.<a name=137:2></a> It is evident that very early in the history of the church there arose a spirit of discontent with the true order of God's house, and in Christendom generally a human order still prevails which relieves men of exercise, but robs them of spiritual privilege and joy.<a name=137:3></a> All sorts of excuses are made for disregarding divine order, but to do so is really to murmur against it.<a name=137:4></a> This is a very serious offence against God, however lightly men may think of it.<a name=137:5></a> We find here that "Jehovah heard it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed some in the extremity of the camp" (verse 1).<a name=137:6></a> The mind of the flesh is a subject of judgment, and here particularly in its discontent with divine orderings.<a name=137:7></a> We may see an example of this in the fact that many at Corinth were weak and infirm, and a good many had fallen asleep, because of the disregard of divine order in the assembly.<a name=137:8></a> The flesh in the people of God is no better than it is in the ungodly, and if we allow it to become active God has to bring home to us that He does not overlook evil in His people.<a name=137:9></a> His object is to purify us even "by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#4:4">Isaiah  4:4</a>).<a name=137:10></a> Many of the people of God have found themselves at some time or other at that place on the spiritual map which is called "Taberah", which means, Burning.<a name=137:11></a>

		The flesh is not only indisposed to move practically in a life that is pleasing to God, but it has no taste for such a life when presented in Christ as food.<a name=141:5></a> It is a deep and searching self-discovery to find that in our flesh there is no real appreciation of what delights God when it is seen in perfection in Christ.<a name=141:6></a> There is no relish for it <i>as food</i>.<a name=141:7></a> A people who feed on Christ will walk even as He walked according to the measure of their feeding upon Him, but if we do not care for Him as food it is impossible that His life should characterise us practically.<a name=141:8></a> Despising the manna brings out that the flesh has no inward appreciation of Christ; this is a far deeper lesson than to be made conscious that we have failed practically to walk like Him.<a name=141:9></a>

		We may conclude that the priesthood was very poorly nourished in the wilderness, for Jehovah asked long afterwards, "Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and oblations in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?<a name=240:4></a> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye had made to yourselves" (<a href="../bible/Amos.htm#5:25">Amos  5:25</a>, 26).<a name=240:5></a> What an awful thing that He should have had to say, "your Moloch", "<i>your</i> images", "<i>your</i> god", as though they had given Him up altogether!<a name=240:6></a> It is evident that the general state was such that offerings were not brought.<a name=240:7></a> In such conditions there would be little food for the priesthood.<a name=240:8></a> How prophetic is this of a prolonged period when what was idolatrous prevailed in the Christian profession!<a name=240:9></a> Not that it submerged everything, for God had those who loved Him even at such a time.<a name=240:10></a> We may depend upon it that Moses and Joshua and Caleb, and probably many others, were a reserved remnant for Jehovah who took no part in the worship of Moloch or Chiun, and there were such in the darkest period of church history.<a name=240:11></a> But as to the public history of the Christian profession there was a long time without very much to sustain or invigorate priestly conditions.<a name=240:12></a>

		Eleazar is a spectator in regard to the slaughter of the heifer and the burning of it.<a name=252:6></a> He typifies one who contemplates with priestly vision the death and judgment-bearing of Christ as the way of God's dealing with sin in the flesh.<a name=252:7></a> He contemplates it with affectionate reverence, and his actions indicate that he has understood its import and value.<a name=252:8></a> "And Eleazar the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of its blood directly before the tent of meeting seven times" (verse 4).<a name=252:9></a> It is figurative of faith's apprehension that the only ground on which God's people can go on with Him is the death and blood-shedding of Christ.<a name=252:10></a> All the saints, thank God!<a name=252:11></a> know something of the value and efficacy of the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son; they are assured that it "cleanses us from all sin" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:7">1 John  1:7</a>).<a name=252:12></a> But it is most important for us to understand that the shedding of blood means that the life of the flesh has been poured out (see <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#17:11">Leviticus  17:11</a>).<a name=252:13></a> In the case of Christ this was

		CHAPTER 32
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter shows that the people of God may get very near to what is in His purpose for them, and yet be diverted from it.<a name=368:4></a> I trust we have accepted as truth that there is a spiritual region of which the land over Jordan is a type.<a name=368:5></a> In the ministry of the apostle Paul, especially in his epistle to the Colossians, the truth of the saints having died with Christ and having been raised with Him is clearly presented as the mind of God.<a name=368:6></a> But for many long centuries this ministry was lost sight of; it could not be held by a church which had become practically an earth-dweller.<a name=368:7></a> If Jordan was referred to at all it was as typifying our own death, and Canaan was regarded as a type of heaven.<a name=368:8></a> The thought of being risen with Christ as a present faith position, and of being quickened together with Him so as to have present possession of "the land" as a spiritual region where association with Christ in life is known, was long lost to the faith and affections of the people of God.<a name=368:9></a> It was not even presented to them as light.<a name=368:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But through God's great mercy there has been a revival of Paul's ministry in these last days, and the attention of many thousands has been called to the true typical meaning of Jordan and the land.<a name=368:11></a> These great spiritual realities have come into view as a powerful divine attraction, but also as a searching test

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the state of our hearts Godward and Christward.<a name=369:1></a> Because going over Jordan largely depends on the place which divine Persons have in our hearts; that is, it depends on the spiritual state which knows how to appreciate the wonderful movements of God in relation to what He has before Him for us.<a name=369:2></a> What was in the mind of God has now taken form in Christ risen from among the dead, and now sitting as a glorious Man at the right hand of God.<a name=369:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think we may gather from the chapter before us that the nearer we come to these great spiritual realities the more powerful and persuasive will be the influences that tend to hold us back from the experimental acquisition of them.<a name=369:4></a> And perhaps nothing serves this end more efficiently than good things here, providential things which are in themselves the mercy of God, but which are not beyond death.<a name=369:5></a> We have often been reminded that it was not bad things that kept the invited guests from the great supper; it was things good and right in themselves, but of an entirely different order of enjoyment from what was proposed by the provider of the supper.<a name=369:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is a divine record of "the journeys of the children of Israel" from Egypt to "the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho".<a name=375:1></a> "And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys, by the commandment of Jehovah" (verse 2).<a name=375:2></a> It suggests that when God's people are ready to go into the land He loves to take account of the whole journey by which they have come to that point.<a name=375:3></a> And we may note that it is "their goings out"; all the wilderness journeys are regarded as having that character.<a name=375:4></a> Baptism -- typified at the Red Sea -- is a definite going out from the world, but all the wilderness journeys, as viewed in this chapter, are "goings out".<a name=375:5></a> Until we come to what is positive and permanent in connection with divine purpose, every exercise has the character of "goings out".<a name=375:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And all the journeys being written by Jehovah's commandment conveys that they are seen here from a divine view-point.<a name=375:7></a> Hence there is no reference to any failure on the part of the people, We are told that, they "went forth out of the land of Egypt according to their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron" (verse 1), and that "On the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians" (verse 3).<a name=375:8></a> They are seen all through this record as marked by energy for movement; it is "<i>their</i> journeys", how <i>they</i> "removed", and where <i>they</i> "encamped".<a name=375:9></a> God loves to put all that He can to the account of His people, and He commanded Moses to write this condensed history of the forty years to describe how they completed the whole series of movements which could be spoken of

		as "goings out".<a name=376:1></a> There are about forty encampments mentioned, suggesting the complete range of movements and exercises through which God's people accomplish their "goings out", and learn their wilderness lessons.<a name=376:2></a> It is happy to see that this is the last impression which God gives us of the wilderness in this book.<a name=376:3></a> Many of the places named here are not mentioned elsewhere, but we have here the full record of every movement.<a name=376:4></a> It is the past journeys of a people just about to go into the land which Jehovah had long purposed to give them.<a name=376:5></a> They were movements which all had, in some way, a liberating character; they were "goings out".<a name=376:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must remember that there was all through, from Egypt to Canaan, an elect Israel, represented in an outstanding way by Caleb and Joshua, but which included all who were the subjects of divine working.<a name=376:7></a> He had referred in the first year of their journeyings to "thousands of them that love me".<a name=376:8></a> That was the true Israel of God, and He could view it as having gone through the wilderness in a way which it pleased Him to have recorded.<a name=376:9></a> Each encampment had had its own lesson, and, without doubt, those who were really following Jehovah got some distinct spiritual gain from each.<a name=376:10></a> Those who have the land in view are the ones who get the greatest gain of God's wilderness ways.<a name=376:11></a> Actually it was the unbelief of the mass of the people that occasioned many of these movements and encampments, but Jehovah would have them all put on record as a consecutive series of movements which His people had made on their way to the borders of the land.<a name=376:12></a> Historically we are told very little of what transpired in the thirty-eight years from Kadesh to the Arnon.<a name=376:13></a> It would have been no pleasure to God to record a history of failure.<a name=376:14></a> But He had noted carefully how His elect people, His

		lovers, had been moving by definite stages all the time.<a name=377:1></a> He had seen how Caleb and Joshua and others had journeyed, and He would have it written as a permanent record of movements that had given Him pleasure.<a name=377:2></a> I believe this to be the point of view in this chapter.<a name=377:3></a> There is no reference here to the generation of unbelief that perished in the wilderness; it is the same "they" all through from Rameses to the Jordan.<a name=377:4></a> And it is not here that Jehovah led them, as in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:2">Deuteronomy  8:2</a>, but how <i>they</i> "went forth", how <i>they</i> "journeyed" and "removed" and "encamped".<a name=377:5></a> There had been movements all through which Jehovah loved to have recorded.<a name=377:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a comfort to know that there can be a wilderness history in which God finds pleasure.<a name=377:7></a> Such a history is marked by movement, each encampment having its distinctive experience and education.<a name=377:8></a> We may be sure that Caleb and Joshua learned something more of God at every encampment, and having learned it they were ready to remove to the next.<a name=377:9></a> From the time that the tabernacle was set up all their movements had reference to it; they were the movements of the divine testimony.<a name=377:10></a> We are apt to think of the wilderness as a place of trials and difficulties, and a place where the flesh is tested and exposed, and also where we experience divine resources and care.<a name=377:11></a> All this is true, but the lovers of Jehovah would think of it above all as the place where they are privileged to accompany "the tabernacle of testimony".<a name=377:12></a> It has pleased God to have a testimony here, and to have His people identified with it.<a name=377:13></a> And this book of Numbers shows us that it is marked by spiritual movement; it requires that those who are identified with it must be prepared to journey whenever the time comes to do so.<a name=377:14></a> And it should be noted that the movements referred to here were collective movements.<a name=377:15></a> They evidently do

		A ministry in spiritual power will always lead to movement.<a name=379:3></a> There will be more and more a going out, not only from what is of the world and of man after the flesh, but from restricted and partial apprehensions of the truth.<a name=379:4></a> There will be enlargement in what is of God, and in ability to serve Him according to His pleasure.<a name=379:5></a> There will be the consciousness of increasing freedom from what narrows and clouds the true knowledge of God, and of getting nearer to all that is in the purpose of His love.<a name=379:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have noted before that many of the types convey instruction that is specially valuable in the last days.<a name=379:7></a> Indeed, much of it seems to have been reserved in the wisdom of God for special help in the knowledge of His mind at the end of the church period.<a name=379:8></a> There was a long period of church history during which there was very little thought of moving through the wilderness assembly-wise as identified with God's testimony.<a name=379:9></a> The church took the place practically of a system set up in Egypt.<a name=379:10></a> But within the last century the divine thought of the assembly in the wilderness has been recovered, and it has been understood by many that God would have His people to move together universally in relation to His testimony, which is our true bond of unity as the tabernacle was for the twelve tribes.<a name=379:11></a> Until this is realised in some measure in a practical sense assembly movements in the wilderness will not be understood.<a name=379:12></a> But those who apprehend the divine thought see that it involves spiritual movement, because we have to learn how the testimony stands in relation to a variety of different circumstances and

		<a name=380>[Page 380]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		conditions.<a name=380:1></a> Saints walking in the truth find that new questions arise which have not had to be faced before, new difficulties have to be met, new exercises as to the truth are awakened by the current ministry of the word, and we have to learn how the testimony stands in relation to these things.<a name=380:2></a> It is not that the testimony changes, but it becomes known to us in new settings as we move from one encampment to another.<a name=380:3></a> And all the time it is a <i>going out</i> from what does not fully answer to the mind of God as we acquire ability to see His testimony in relation to one exercise after another.<a name=380:4></a> Those in true spiritual energy would not like to miss the lesson of one encampment, and we may be sure that the encampments as a whole would give a completeness of divine instruction for the Israel of God which would bring them to full liberty and preparedness to enter the land.<a name=380:5></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#33">Numbers  33</a>the wilderness journeys are over: the people are encamped by the Jordan in readiness to pass over into the land of Canaan.<a name=380:6></a> But Jehovah looks back, and He sees an Israel that "went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians", and that had moved with Him through the whole forty years until they had come to the Jordan.<a name=380:7></a> He would have every stage of that movement recorded by Moses, for it was the history of how they had followed Him.<a name=380:8></a> They had been marked by movements that were in correspondence with His own.<a name=380:9></a> So that it is not Israel after the flesh that is contemplated here, but the Israel of divine calling, marked by energy for movement, that elect Israel which could now pass over into the land.<a name=380:10></a>

		The typical bearing of all this is most important.<a name=380:11></a> God's thought is to have a people who move with Him and with His testimony, and who are prepared to take up every exercise in the way as they come to it.<a name=380:12></a> Not,

		in this connection, the exercises of our individual pathway, but exercises which we are called to take up collectively as "in the assembly in the wilderness".<a name=381:1></a> These movements set forth what God has in mind for us.<a name=381:2></a> He would have us to move by definite stages, facing each exercise that we come to, and, when we have gained the spiritual instruction of it, ready to move on to another encampment.<a name=381:3></a> Those who are following divine movements will always find themselves in the presence of some definite exercise or spiritual instruction.<a name=381:4></a> These exercises are not to be shirked.<a name=381:5></a> The natural tendency is to prefer a fixed position where we can settle down, and feel that there is no need to remove from it.<a name=381:6></a> Such is largely the character of organised Christianity; it does not encourage fresh and living exercises, or the energy of spiritual movement, especially assembly-wise.<a name=381:7></a> But in the wilderness ways of God with His people He would have them always to be prepared for movement.<a name=381:8></a> We are set together in relation to His testimony, and that testimony will always be in some particular setting.<a name=381:9></a> The Spirit will always be saying something definite to the assemblies, so that there will always be some definite assembly exercise present with those who are identified with the testimony of God.<a name=381:10></a> If we take that exercise up with Him we shall gain something definite which will prepare us for further movement.<a name=381:11></a> If we do not face the exercise that comes in our present encampment we shall be unprepared to go on, and our movement with God assembly-wise will cease.<a name=381:12></a> Many have journeyed to a point when some assembly exercise came in which they were not prepared to face, and from that point their spiritual progress in relation to the testimony has been arrested.<a name=381:13></a> It is very sad to drop out of movements which are really of the Spirit of God.<a name=381:14></a>

		But, on the other hand, the ranks of the defenders of the testimony are constantly being recruited, just as Israel was continually added to by the birth of children.<a name=382:1></a> Individuals who come in at certain points come in to be identified with the testimony in its present setting, with all that has been gained by past ministry and exercise.<a name=382:2></a> Those who come into the ranks of the testimony today have a great advantage because they come, in a certain sense, into the good of what has been secured by past conflicts and exercises.<a name=382:3></a> In taking up their part in current exercises they learn to value: the great gains of the past without which the testimony could not stand where it is today.<a name=382:4></a> They should certainly be interested in all its past movements, but thankful to come in to the light and instruction which has been gained thereby, and understanding that it is their privilege now to take up with their brethren the matters to which the Spirit's voice is calling attention at the present time.<a name=382:5></a> Many earnest Christians fail to take account of the movements of the testimony, to their own great spiritual loss.<a name=382:6></a> This chapter should be sufficient to stimulate our interest in those movements, for it is by Jehovah's commandment they are put on permanent record.<a name=382:7></a>

		The glorified Saviour spoke to Saul of Tarsus of "inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me" as something which would be received by Gentiles who believed the glad tidings.<a name=388:1></a> And Paul gave thanks to the Father, "who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:12">Colossians  1:12</a>).<a name=388:2></a> So that there is undoubtedly a present portion of which the Old Testament type is the land of Canaan, which is to be enjoyed "among them that are sanctified".<a name=388:3></a> This is not heaven after we die, but a portion in Christ which can be enjoyed now by the saints collectively, and which has definite "borders", so that it is clearly marked off from everything outside those borders.<a name=388:4></a> God would have us to understand this even before we enter upon it experimentally, so that this chapter is intended to be helpful to those who are drawing near to the land, but who have not yet passed over Jordan.<a name=388:5></a> God would have us to apprehend in a definite way what He has in mind for us.<a name=388:6></a> I have no doubt this is what Paul had before him when he prayed for the Colossians that they might be "filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:9">Colossians  1:9</a>).<a name=388:7></a> Epaphras, too, had it in mind when he agonised in prayer for the same saints to the end that they might "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:12">Colossians  4:12</a>).<a name=388:8></a> With such effectual and fervent prayers behind the epistle to the Colossians we can understand that it would give great intelligence as to the portion of the saints, and as to "borders" which must be accepted if we are to enjoy that portion.<a name=388:9></a> It would thus answer very definitely in the New Testament to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#34">Numbers  34</a>.<a name=388:10></a>
