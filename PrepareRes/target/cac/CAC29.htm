		Our Lord's precious designation, "the Word", brings out how the mind of God has been fully and intelligibly communicated in Him.<a name=1:1></a> "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>, 2.<a name=1:2></a> All was truly there in the divine mind from eternity but the wonder and glory of the present time is that it has come into expression.<a name=1:3></a> The Greek, 'Logos' (Word) signifies this.<a name=1:4></a> J.<a name=1:5></a>N.<a name=1:6></a>D.<a name=1:7></a> has defined its meaning thus, 'Whatever is the expression of a thought formed in the mind, and otherwise unknown; hence used for the thing expressed, or the expression of it .<a name=1:8></a>.<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a> .<a name=1:11></a> It is the matter and form of thought and expression, as well as the utterance of it .<a name=1:12></a>.<a name=1:13></a>.<a name=1:14></a> .<a name=1:15></a> Whatever expresses the mind is 'logos''.<a name=1:16></a> 'Nous' is the intelligent faculty; whatever expresses the thought formed in it is 'logos'.<a name=1:17></a> (See the note to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:5">1 Corinthians  1:5</a> in the Darby translation; see the whole note).<a name=1:18></a> What should arrest attention is that God, and all that is in His mind relative to men, has come into expression so as to be intelligently apprehended.<a name=1:19></a> Nothing could be more wondrous.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The title, "the Word", conveys to us what Christ the Son is as the glorious Person in whom is expressed the mind and heart of God.<a name=1:21></a> It is thus a very distinctive and comprehensive appellation, as perhaps covering a wider and more profound apprehension of Him than any other title that attached to Him.<a name=1:22></a> It is not a name of relationship like 'Son', not an official title like 'the Christ', but it is a designation which indicates the greatness of what is

		expressed in Him.<a name=2:1></a> The blessedness of God was in perfect expression in Him, and this is greater than anything else.<a name=2:2></a> It involves His full Deity in perhaps a more absolute way than any other of His titles.<a name=2:3></a> Who could be the full expression of God, and of God's mind, save One who was Himself an eternal divine Person?<a name=2:4></a> Hence John, writing by inspiration of the Spirit, selects this appellation to designate Him as existing from eternity.<a name=2:5></a> Some title must be used, and we may be sure that "the Word" was more suitable to be used in that connection than any other.<a name=2:6></a> But John writes, as Luke does also, from the standpoint that the Word had been known as having become flesh, and dwelling among men.<a name=2:7></a> Men had been privileged to be "eyewitnesses of and attendants on the Word", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Luke and John had not thus known "the Word", neither of them would ever have written gospels.<a name=2:9></a> Christ has become known as "the Word" to these two blessed men of God -- doubtless to thousands of others, but these two witnesses will suffice to prove that He was known to men, and spoken of by men, as "the Word".<a name=2:10></a> Now John has told us, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Person thus known, and thus spoken of, was an eternal Person, and was God.<a name=2:11></a> He was in the beginning, and was with God and was God.<a name=2:12></a> But it was One known to John, and many others, as "the Word" who was in the beginning, and who was with God and was God.<a name=2:13></a> This is the whole point of what is stated.<a name=2:14></a> It is the assertion in unmistakable terms of the eternal pre-existence and Deity of Him who is now known to us as "the Word".<a name=2:15></a> To say that He was "the Word" in eternity only raises questions as to what was expressed in Him in eternity, and to whom was it expressed; questions impossible to answer, for Scripture is silent on the matter.<a name=2:16></a> But the certainty that the One now known as "the Word" was eternally God is of the greatest and most vital importance.<a name=2:17></a> It bows the soul

		THE MINISTRY OF JOHN AS CONNECTED WITH "BEGINNINGS"

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is with the thought of having before us something of the precious ministry of the apostle John that I have suggested reading these portions of Scripture.<a name=4:1></a> I am sure we have all noticed how much John had before him the thought of "the beginning"; his whole ministry stands connected with certain beginnings.<a name=4:2></a> He commences his gospel by speaking of a beginning which is previous to time, previous to creation, and which goes back to the uncreated and eternally divine.<a name=4:3></a> Before anything was made God was; and "in the beginning" of <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> takes us back to what was antecedent to all creative acts of God.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of the Lord as "the Word" John was using a well-known designation; he was not introducing it for the first time; it was a designation which Luke had applied to Christ probably at least thirty years before John wrote (see <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>).<a name=4:5></a> Every reader of Luke's gospel -- and by the time that John wrote his gospel this probably included saints in every assembly -- was familiar with the title "the Word".<a name=4:6></a> It is perhaps the most comprehensive title of the Lord that can be used apart from saying that He is God.<a name=4:7></a> For it conveys the wondrous thought that God is in expression so as to be known by intelligent creatures.<a name=4:8></a> There is thus a range and depth of meaning in this title which has a fulness beyond what is conveyed by any other.<a name=4:9></a> Indeed this is directly affirmed by the scripture which says, "Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#138:2">Psalm  138:2</a>.<a name=4:10></a> "Word", as used in that verse, does not answer exactly to the Greek word 'logos', but as it fixes the mind

		more especially on what is expressed (see note on the same word as used in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:11">Psalm  119:11</a> in the Darby Translation); it does bring out the exceeding greatness of what expresses God.<a name=5:1></a> So that we can understand how great is the thought conveyed when Luke speaks of some as having been "eyewitnesses of and attendants on the Word", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>.<a name=5:2></a> It was a glorious designation, and was used because it was so.<a name=5:3></a> The marvel of all marvels was that a divine Person should be here as Man, and should be known to men as the Word.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been expressed here in the fullest possible way in His nature and character, and in His thoughts of love towards men.<a name=5:5></a> Jesus as the Word was the intelligible expression of all that was in the mind and heart of God to make known of Himself to men.<a name=5:6></a> Creation shows God's skill and wisdom, His eternal power and divinity, but it does not express Him morally, any more than a beautiful watch expresses the character and nature of the watchmaker.<a name=5:7></a> But a divine Person has become Man in order to express God to men.<a name=5:8></a> John was full of this, as well he might be.<a name=5:9></a> He was writing of a Person known to him and many others as One in whom had been expressed all that in which God could be known by men.<a name=5:10></a> And it seemed good to John, and to the Holy Spirit, to use this known title of the Lord (attaching to Him as here on earth, according to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>) when he referred to Him as in the past eternity.<a name=5:11></a> "The Word" was identified with His Person in the mind of John; it was of that known Person he was writing.<a name=5:12></a> He would have us to know the infinite divine greatness and majesty of the One concerning whom he was going to write.<a name=5:13></a> It had been reserved to him to bring out what that Person was as the Word much more fully than it had been brought out before.<a name=5:14></a> If we want to appreciate that wondrous title in its greatness and glory we must study John's gospel.<a name=5:15></a> We must see how Jesus expressed

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Word is, and was eternally, a divine Person.<a name=6:2></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> - 3 is intended to make us take our shoes off, and prostrate our souls in worship, as we see His eternal place in Deity.<a name=6:3></a> Seeing this we should read the whole gospel in the spirit of adoration, connecting every word and act of our Lord with His eternal Person.<a name=6:4></a> It is essential that we should do so.<a name=6:5></a> The names and titles by which we know Him in Manhood -- the Word, Jesus Christ, the Son, and many others -- do not cover all that is true of His eternal Person.<a name=6:6></a> But the intelligent affections of the saints, as taught by the Spirit, never disconnect His present names or titles from His eternal Person.<a name=6:7></a> Every Name which He bears attaches to One who is eternally divine, and now that they are known we can identify them with Him even when referring to Him before He actually bore them.<a name=6:8></a> It is the manner of Scripture to do so.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For example, John tells us that "every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God; and this is that power of the anti-christ, of which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:2">1 John  4:2</a>,3.<a name=6:10></a> The whole point of this lies in the fact that a divine Person has come in flesh.<a name=6:11></a> He did not actually bear the name "Jesus Christ" until He was here in manhood.<a name=6:12></a> But after He had "come in flesh" the name which He bore as incarnate was used by John to designate Him as having "come"; that is, as One who had pre-existed as a divine Person.<a name=6:13></a> This shows in a very distinct way that His eternal Person is identified with His present names and titles.<a name=6:14></a>

		way.<a name=7:1></a> He speaks of Christ Jesus as "subsisting in the form of God" before He took His place in the likeness of men (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:5">Philippians  2:5</a> - 7).<a name=7:2></a> This was a present known name of our Lord; it did not actually apply to Him as in Deity in the past eternity, though, of course, it was in divine purpose that He should take it up.<a name=7:3></a> But Paul used it when speaking of Him before incarnation; the One who is now known by that name is an eternal divine Person.<a name=7:4></a> It would be true to say, 'Jesus existed from eternity', but in so saying we should identify the name with the Person who bears it, though we well know that Jesus was His name as born into this world.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have the Lord's own authority for identifying His eternal Person with a title which clearly only applies strictly to Him as Man.<a name=7:6></a> He said, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?<a name=7:7></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:62">John  6:62</a>.<a name=7:8></a> And He spoke of the Son of man coming down out of heaven (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>).<a name=7:9></a> This is of the highest importance as instructing us in the precious truth that none of His present titles as Man are to be detached in our minds from what He was eternally before He became Man.<a name=7:10></a> The names and titles now attach to His Person, but His Person is eternal.<a name=7:11></a> Jesus spoke of Himself in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:40">John  8:40</a> as "a man who has spoken the truth to you" -- I believe the only time that He spoke of Himself as "a man" -- but He said in the same chapter, "Before Abraham was, I am".<a name=7:12></a> That man was the eternal God, but any intelligent child would understand that He was not a Man before Abraham's time.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us to recognise, too, that His names and titles as Man do not cover the whole truth of His Person.<a name=7:14></a> He is Himself greater than them all.<a name=7:15></a> The first three verses of John's gospel assure us of this.<a name=7:16></a> He is "the Word", and as "the Word" He is the intelligible expression of God to us.<a name=7:17></a> This is a title which corresponds with <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>,2:

		"God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son".<a name=8:1></a> It is soberly reverent to believe that whatever He has spoken to us He intends us to hear and understand.<a name=8:2></a> The speaking of God to us in the Son, who is also the Word, has to do with what He is pleased to express of Himself to men for their intelligent apprehension, and their infinite blessing and joy.<a name=8:3></a> When we perceive this we become concerned to understand what He has expressed and spoken to men.<a name=8:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Word" -- signifying what is intelligible -- does not cover all that attaches to the great and glorious Person who is known by that designation.<a name=8:5></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>tells us how God has spoken to men "in Son", but it also says of that glorious One, "by whom also he made the worlds".<a name=8:6></a> This is inscrutable, for the act of creation is beyond the compass of the creature mind, though understood by faith.<a name=8:7></a> The next sentence also refers to what is inscrutable: "Who being the effulgence of his glory, and the expression of his substance" (Clearly 'substance', 'essential being', not 'person'.<a name=8:8></a> Note in the Darby Translation).<a name=8:9></a> This is beyond us, for the Being of God is beyond our finite capacity, though we can own adoringly that the Son is the expression of it.<a name=8:10></a> But what He is as "the Word" does come within our apprehension.<a name=8:11></a> Indeed the great object of John in writing is to show that it has done so.<a name=8:12></a> "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us .<a name=8:13></a>.<a name=8:14></a>.<a name=8:15></a> full of grace and truth; .<a name=8:16></a>.<a name=8:17></a>.<a name=8:18></a> for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a> - 16.<a name=8:19></a> The fulness of grace and truth in "the Word" is there to be received by men; the declaration of God by the only-begotten Son is not inscrutable; it makes God known to us most fully in grace and truth; the speaking of God in Son is not to be refused, but heard and understood.<a name=8:20></a> The Lord's precious title, "the Word", relates to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory which belongs to Christ as "the Word" is infinitely great, and such as could only attach to a divine Person, but it is a glory which is apprehensible by the creature -- a fulness of grace and truth of which we all have received.<a name=9:3></a> But, while rejoicing in this, we remember with deep reverence that there is a greatness in Him which in inscrutable.<a name=9:4></a> John speaks of this inscrutable greatness when he tells us that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=9:5></a> <i>He</i> was in the beginning with God".<a name=9:6></a> The expressions 'eternal Word', 'everlasting Word', have been used with pious intent to assert the eternal character of the Person, but they tend to obscure the difference between what He is as "the Word", expressing God to men in fulness of grace and truth, and what He was, and is, in the inscrutableness of eternal Deity.<a name=9:7></a> To distinguish between these two things takes nothing from the Lord.<a name=9:8></a> It is no derogation from His Person or glory.<a name=9:9></a> It gives full place to all that He is as "the Word", and enhances it by connecting it in our minds and hearts with His eternal Person.<a name=9:10></a> It is due to Him that both aspects of His glory should be before us, and intelligently distinguished.<a name=9:11></a> The Incarnation was necessary for the intelligible expression of God, and this is obscured if we think that Jesus was actually "the Word" in the past eternity.<a name=9:12></a> God would have our minds and hearts filled with what we know of Him as having come now into full expression.<a name=9:13></a> This important matter is that Jesus, God's beloved Son, should be to us "the Word".<a name=9:14></a>

		We read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a>,"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=10:4></a> It is of that beginning that John speaks when he tells us that "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being".<a name=10:5></a> The One who is the theme of John's gospel is the Creator-God of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, the eternal supreme Being.<a name=10:6></a> His Personality, as distinct from the other Persons in the Godhead, was not declared in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, but it is now made clearly known in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>.<a name=10:7></a> We bear it in mind all the time as we read the gospel of John.<a name=10:8></a> It gives a profound sense of the greatness of the Person in whom, as Man on earth, God has been expressed.<a name=10:9></a>

		The Lord refers to another wondrous "beginning" when He says, "But I did not say these things unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.<a name=10:10></a> But now I go to him that has sent me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:4">John  16:4</a>,5.<a name=10:11></a> God would have us to attach great importance to the point of time which the Lord here referred to as "the beginning".<a name=10:12></a> It clearly refers to the commencement of His public ministry.<a name=10:13></a> Peter speaks of "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>,22.<a name=10:14></a> The first two chapters of Matthew and of Luke give us an account of what preceded His baptism and public service, but Luke tells us that he composed his discourse "concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=10:15></a> The Lord's public ministry was his theme; he spoke of matters "as those who from the beginning

		The great thing before the mind of the Spirit in this book is that we should understand the mediatorial glory of the Son of God, and therefore the gospel opens with a statement that introduces Him in His mediatorial glory -- that is, "the Word".<a name=18:3></a> "The Word" is a mediatorial title.<a name=18:4></a> It is a most precious title of the Lord because it sets Him forth as the One who has expressed God to us.<a name=18:5></a> And those for whom this gospel is written are persons who have apprehended Him in that character.<a name=18:6></a>

		conclude at once that it is in a mediatorial connection.<a name=33:1></a> The relations that subsist between the Sender and the sent One are not relations of absolute equality; they imply authority on the part of the Sender and subjection and obedience on the part of the sent One; so the word "sent" is mediatorial.<a name=33:2></a> You could not connect the word "sent" with the essential and eternal glory of the Son of God; it belongs to His mediatorial glory.<a name=33:3></a> The Lord's own words make it clear; He says in this gospel, "the bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:16">John  13:16</a>.<a name=33:4></a> There is a similar relationship between the sender and the sent as there is between the lord and the bondman.<a name=33:5></a> There is subordination to the will of another in the idea of the word "sent".<a name=33:6></a> Now the Lord as in that place is in the mediatorial place; it is not the place of His proper personal and eternal glory, but the place of His mediatorship as the sent One.<a name=33:7></a> I take that to be of vital importance to apprehend.<a name=33:8></a> "Whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world"; such statements bring out the mediatorial glory of the Lord in a wonderful way.<a name=33:9></a> They bring out the place into which He has come, not to do His own will, but to declare God -- the place of service and obedience.<a name=33:10></a> Whenever you read the word "sent", think of the Lord's words in chapter 13 that the sent One is not greater than He who sent Him.<a name=33:11></a> As the sent One He could say, "My Father is greater than I", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:28">John  14:28</a>.<a name=33:12></a> He would not say that in regard to His eternal personality; He was co-equal in glory and majesty with the other Persons in the Godhead.<a name=33:13></a> This lies at the root of a great deal that is in controversy at the present time.<a name=33:14></a> We need to be exercised to understand the difference between His Personal glory which never changes, and never can change; "who is over all, God blessed for ever" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>), and His mediatorial glory as the sent One; the subject One who came to do the will of the One who sent Him.<a name=33:15></a>

		Then as we pass on through the chapter we learn how the gracious purposes and the glory of God have an eternal basis in righteousness, and have been secured by redemption.<a name=40:6></a> "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (verse 29).<a name=40:7></a> Here was a Person capable of taking up the whole question of sin, and of bearing its judgment so as to glorify God fully.<a name=40:8></a> The purposes of God rest upon this secure foundation, and in virtue of an accomplished redemption not only can they all be carried out but the Holy Spirit can be given to bring the light and joy of those purposes into the hearts of the children of God.<a name=40:9></a> "He who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=40:10></a> It is only in the power and unction of the Holy Spirit that we can enter into the wondrous thoughts and purposes of God.<a name=40:11></a> Baptism by water introduces us into a new position on earth, but the baptism of the Holy Spirit introduced the believer to a circle of things connected with heaven, and gives him capacity to enter into heavenly things.<a name=40:12></a> The Spirit carries our affections into the region of eternal life.<a name=40:13></a> He is "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>.<a name=40:14></a> He brings us into the circle of heavenly things and is the present power by which we can appropriate and enjoy our privileges.<a name=40:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A letter by C.<a name=43:1></a> A.<a name=43:2></a> Coates
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After reading your letter this morning, I opened my Bible on these words.<a name=43:3></a> "There was a man sent from God, his name John.<a name=43:4></a> He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:6">John  1:6</a>,7.<a name=43:5></a> This set me thinking of some of the marks of a true servant, as we see them in John -- marks, which I trust, may be more and more imprinted on our lives and service.<a name=43:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, <i>he comes from God</i>.<a name=43:7></a> In order to do this, we must first be <i>with God</i>.<a name=43:8></a> Alas!<a name=43:9></a> this is the weak point with so many.<a name=43:10></a> The excitement of <i>service</i> has an attraction for the natural tastes which the holy calm of the <i>sanctuary</i> does not possess.<a name=43:11></a> In one way service makes something of us, but in the presence of God we find that we are nothing.<a name=43:12></a> Men are needed who are really <i>with God</i>.<a name=43:13></a> There is no real freshness or power if we are not with God.<a name=43:14></a> Our hearts lose their divine sensibilities, we drop down to the level of things around us, and service becomes more or less formal.<a name=43:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The most glorious and soul-stirring realities are soon held as mere doctrines, and of course are preached as they are held.<a name=43:16></a> Then very soon the servant begins to feel a complacent self-satisfaction as to his service, which is not disturbed even by the lack of any manifest blessing, and this is the mark, I think, of an awfully backslidden state.<a name=43:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, if we are <i>with God</i>, we are in spiritual reality as to our own experience.<a name=43:18></a> We do not deceive ourselves as to the measure of our progress, gift or faith.<a name=43:19></a> We think soberly as we ought to think.<a name=43:20></a> Then it is <i>with God</i> that we learn His <i>love</i>, His unmeasured <i>grace</i>,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=44>[Page 44]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His glorious <i>purposes</i> His great thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly, the reality of the Spirit's power, and many other things which are accepted in theory by many but known as realities by few.<a name=44:1></a> Then having been <i>with God</i> in the secret of His presence, we can come <i>from God</i> in the power of what we have learnt within, to serve in a world like this.<a name=44:2></a> We do not then measure the enemy's power against our own weakness, but against God.<a name=44:3></a> We do not put on the armour which others have worn, or follow in the beaten track where other servants have trodden.<a name=44:4></a> We do not confer with flesh and blood as to the scope or character of our service.<a name=44:5></a> There is an <i>originality</i> about every servant who comes from God.<a name=44:6></a> God does not fashion two servants in the same mould -- that is man's work -- and just in proportion as we are formed in the sanctuary, each will have his own peculiar fitness for his own service, and such stamp will be upon it that faith will recognise that it comes <i>from God</i>.<a name=44:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second mark of a true servant is that he is <i>consciously nothing</i>.<a name=44:8></a> John could speak of himself as only a "voice", and a greater than John was consciously "less than the least of all saints".<a name=44:9></a> The moment we think ourselves to be anything, we are out of the servant's true position and spirit.<a name=44:10></a> There is a beautiful contrast between John's account of himself, and the Lord's description of him (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:22">John  1:22</a> - 27, with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:20">Luke  7:20</a> - 28).<a name=44:11></a> The more worthy we are of the Lord's commendation, the less do we think of ourselves.<a name=44:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third mark of a true servant is that he is a <i>witness</i>.<a name=44:13></a> He speaks of that which he has seen and known for himself.<a name=44:14></a> It was said to Paul that he was to be "a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in".<a name=44:15></a> We may <i>minister</i> things which we have never entered into ourselves, but we cannot be <i>witnesses</i> of them.<a name=44:16></a> Hence the deep importance of cultivating communion with God,

		and increased intimacy with Christ.<a name=45:1></a> Instead of this weakening our gospel testimony, I believe it would make it fuller, richer and more simple.<a name=45:2></a> We would be in touch with the grace that can stoop to the lowest point to win a sinner's heart.<a name=45:3></a> Our preaching often lacks weight because we have so little realised the things of which we speak.<a name=45:4></a> Whether it be the terror of the Lord, the love of God, the value of Christ's work, or the blessings which faith enjoys, we must ourselves have entered into that which we press upon others or we became <i>lecturers</i> rather than <i>witnesses</i>.<a name=45:5></a>

		The question at once arises, How does the soul reach the knowledge of the Son of God?<a name=115:3></a> This inquiry has been anticipated, and a divine answer to it furnished, in the chapter before us.<a name=115:4></a> Here we see a wonderful picture of "the works of God" (verse 3) in man, preparing him for the reception of divine light, and leading him on in a path of growing light to that which is the crown and consummation of all blessing -- the knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=115:5></a>

		This being the case, it is clear that if man is to be brought to know God there must be a work of God in him and it seems to me that the nature of that work is set before us in the significant action of washing in the pool of Siloam.<a name=116:4></a> I have no doubt this is a figure of man coming under the application of death in his own spirit so as to be morally cleansed from everything that is of himself.<a name=116:5></a> All christians admit that they can only be cleansed before the eye of God by death.<a name=116:6></a> I mean, of course, the death of Christ.<a name=116:7></a> But if all that we are morally has had to be judged and set aside before God in the death of Christ, in order that we might have infinite blessing from God on the ground of what Christ is, it is certain that we shall only really enter into that blessing after death has come into our spirits upon all that we are as in the flesh.<a name=116:8></a> God will not bring man as in the flesh into blessing, but will entirely set him aside in judgment.<a name=116:9></a> God will not link the blessings of christianity with such a moral ruin as man after the flesh.<a name=116:10></a> Nor will He leave the subject of His grace under any misapprehension on this point.<a name=116:11></a> He will bring in death upon what we are as in the flesh and this not only at the cross, but in our own spirits.<a name=116:12></a>

		This is the divine preparation for an entirely new order of things.<a name=117:11></a> For the one who has realised that there is no good in himself is prepared to understand that all good must come from God -- it must be SENT.<a name=117:12></a> The Holy Spirit expressly calls our attention to the interpretation of Siloam as "Sent", a characteristic word of John's gospel -- the gospel which more definitely than any other takes the ground of man's utter blindness and incapacity Godward, but which unfolds in the fullest way what has been sent from God into the world in the person of His beloved Son.<a name=117:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, he is made acquainted with a divine Saviour.<a name=118:7></a> The first confession of the man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>was, "A man called Jesus .<a name=118:8></a>.<a name=118:9></a>.<a name=118:10></a> .<a name=118:11></a>" Jesus means Saviour.<a name=118:12></a> This is the first great acquisition of one who is brought into the light; he has a God-provided Saviour.<a name=118:13></a> I remember well the first thought I had of Jesus as a Saviour <i>from God</i> -- One sent to be my Saviour.<a name=118:14></a> I had had questions and difficulties of various kinds, but they all melted away in the presence of this fact, that Jesus was sent by God as Saviour.<a name=118:15></a> This presented Him as so supremely worthy of all the confidence of my poor heart, that to believe on Him seemed the most natural thing in the world.<a name=118:16></a> One lost sight of all one's difficulties and perplexities in the presence of such a Saviour.<a name=118:17></a> I believe that if preachers would set forth the greatness, glory, and grace of the Son of God as Saviour, instead of labouring so much to meet particular difficulties of souls, people would more quickly get clear of their difficulties, and, what is more, they would begin their christian life with a divine thought of that blessed Person.<a name=118:18></a> I have seen a good many souls get relief and a certain measure of blessing by having their particular difficulties met, but I never saw one really brought into peace with God by this process, or distinctly and personally linked with Christ.<a name=118:19></a> This can only be as we take in the thought of what He is.<a name=118:20></a> It is not this or that difficulty that I want meeting; I am altogether lost; I must have a divine Saviour.<a name=118:21></a> If there is no such Person, mine is a hopeless case.<a name=118:22></a> If there is such a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in answer to further interrogation, our friend of <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>gives evidence of having travelled another stage of his wonderful journey of light.<a name=119:3></a> He says, "He is a prophet".<a name=119:4></a> This is the second step in the knowledge of Christ; He becomes known to the believer as the Communicator of the mind of God.<a name=119:5></a> We must remember that in saying this the man said a great deal.<a name=119:6></a> There was certainly no other "prophet" in Israel at the time.<a name=119:7></a> The scribes and Pharisees had taken, in a way, the prophet's place, and pretended to make known the mind of God.<a name=119:8></a> Would this man look to <i>them</i> for divine light?<a name=119:9></a> No, to him Jesus is the "Prophet".<a name=119:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are first taken outside man for salvation, and then for divine revelation.<a name=119:11></a> The saved one comes under the influence of Christ as the One by whom is communicated all the mind of God.<a name=119:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>the Samaritan sets forth what He is as Saviour, and the following verses present Him in Martha's house as the Prophet.<a name=119:13></a> One who had known what it was to sit at His feet and hear His word would hardly care to return to the teaching of the scribes.<a name=119:14></a> Indeed, the mark of one who has known the blessedness of this is perfect liberty from the influence and teaching of men.<a name=119:15></a> He is prepared to be an Antipas against all, (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:13">Revelation  2:13</a>), and to take a course entirely independent of the countenance of man.<a name=119:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we stop with the knowledge of Jesus as "Saviour" we may go on with the religious world, but the recognition of Him as "Prophet" involves a clean break with every kind of religious authority here.<a name=119:17></a> It was at this point the line was definitely drawn between the once blind man and the Pharisees.<a name=119:18></a> It is as we grow in the knowledge of God that we are delivered from the religious opinions of men, and it is the Son who reveals Him.<a name=119:19></a>

		But it is evident that we shall not enter much into what Jesus reveals as Prophet, if we have not known what it is to come under His Lordship.<a name=120:1></a> We must be commanded and controlled by Him.<a name=120:2></a> When the once blind man asks, "Do ye also wish to become his disciples?<a name=120:3></a>" he plainly confesses his own discipleship -- he acknowledges Jesus as Lord to him whatever He might be to them.<a name=120:4></a> The thought of His Lordship is that He commands the blessing of God for us, and He commands us for the blessing.<a name=120:5></a> The man of <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>had proved the blessedness of the Lordship of Christ in his own experience.<a name=120:6></a> Christ had commanded the blessing for him, and had commanded him for the blessing.<a name=120:7></a> He was in the good of the Lordship of Christ, and it is this which makes a soul bold to confess Him.<a name=120:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole vast range of divine blessing, from forgiveness of sins right on to eternal life, is at the disposal of His hand; He is the Administrator and Dispenser of it all.<a name=120:9></a> It is a great thing to prove that He is Lord in blessing.<a name=120:10></a> Many have a legal thought of the Lordship of Christ as if it was merely authority exacting submission and obedience.<a name=120:11></a> They make Christ a greater Moses with a more exacting claim.<a name=120:12></a> But Christ, as Lord, exercises authority in the way of blessing.<a name=120:13></a> The reason why we are not filled to overflowing with divine blessing is that we have come so little really under the Lordship of Christ.<a name=120:14></a> If we were more simple in the sense of grace, and gave ourselves up to Him, if I may so say, we should find that He would bring us into infinite blessing.<a name=120:15></a> Mary was commanded by Him, and found "the good part"; Martha was devoted to His service, but not commanded by Himself.<a name=120:16></a> Hence, instead of being happy, she was only conscious of the deficiency of the service.<a name=120:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an immense thing when a soul comes to the apprehension of Christ in this way, because in doing so he gets the idea of an entirely new beginning of things.<a name=121:4></a> Many look at Christ as coming in on the line of promises and prophecy, taking up the Old Testament links.<a name=121:5></a> But in John's gospel this is not at all the way in which He is presented.<a name=121:6></a> It is an entirely new beginning in One who comes forth from God and from the Father, One who was altogether different from John the Baptist or any prophet, the thong of whose sandal the greatest of them was not worthy to unloose.<a name=121:7></a> Christ is here presented to us as coming from above, and out of heaven, as being One who had not His origin in the earth, neither was He of the earth.<a name=121:8></a> Such a One was necessarily "above all", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:31">John  3:31</a>).<a name=121:9></a>

		In venturing to suggest the consideration of the joy of the Son one is conscious of very limited capacity, and this creates a great sense of dependence.<a name=210:1></a> But there is something peculiarly attractive in the subject itself, and especially when we see how the Lord's words to His own, and even His words to the Father, were uttered for the purpose of making His joy known to us so that it might be in us.<a name=210:2></a> This applies particularly to what fell from His lips after the Supper, as recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>to 17.<a name=210:3></a> No doubt the company amongst whom He was were the assembly representatively.<a name=210:4></a> And what the Lord said in their midst He said as having the assembly in view, so that we see here the kind of spiritual impressions which would accompany the presence of the Lord in the assembly.<a name=210:5></a> An honoured servant of the Lord used habitually to read these chapters previous to being found with his brethren in assembly.<a name=210:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we see that the Lord's intent in what He said was that His joy might be in the saints of the assembly it gives a distinctive character to all His utterances, and concentrates all the varied rays of divine light which shine in those utterances in one bright focus.<a name=210:7></a> They are all to make known to us the joy of the Son, and to put it in us -- that is, in those who compose the assembly.<a name=210:8></a> One wonders whether we have quite seen it all as centring in this?<a name=210:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This stands in very intimate relation to our knowledge of the Father.<a name=210:10></a> These chapters bring out clearly that the joy of the Son is to take a place with the Father outside the world in which His own can have part with Him.<a name=210:11></a> It is the joy of His love to have our companionship in that place.<a name=210:12></a> He 'came to

		earth to make it known, that we might share His joys'.<a name=211:1></a> The true blessedness of our place with the Father is wonderfully enhanced as we see it to be the joy of the Son to go and prepare it for us.<a name=211:2></a> All is looked at in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a>, 3 as the Son's doing -- the place prepared, the coming again, the reception to Himself, the being with Him -- all is done by the Son, suggesting that the Father's house and what is there, and the persons who are there, all is a matter of what is brought about by the Son, and He would have us to know that His joy consists in having brought it about.<a name=211:3></a> There would be no Father's house without the Son, and no revelation of God as Father without the Son.<a name=211:4></a> The Son's joy will be to have His own in the place in the Father's house which He has Himself prepared, and to which He Himself will receive them.<a name=211:5></a> If it is the Son's joy to do it all how great the Father's joy in it all!<a name=211:6></a> Everything in His house speaks to Him of the One whom He loves, and into whose hand He has given all things.<a name=211:7></a> In all this there will be full joy for the Father and the Son.<a name=211:8></a>

		Then He speaks (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a> - 11) of the Father having been seen in Him.<a name=211:9></a> This, too, was His joy.<a name=211:10></a> He was in the Father, drawing all from Him, so that we might say He was filled with the Father who was in Him for revelation.<a name=211:11></a> He would have us to believe <i>Him</i> that this was so, but if not, to believe Him for the works' sake themselves.<a name=211:12></a> This would lead us to consider the works done by Jesus -- particularly in this gospel -- as the Father's works.<a name=211:13></a> The Father would bring in fulness of joy where it had to be admitted that there was no wine (chapter 2).<a name=211:14></a> The Father would answer a heart in sorrow by relieving it of its distress (chapter 4).<a name=211:15></a> The Father would relieve man of all his weakness (chapter 5), and satisfy his hunger (chapter 6), and give him sight (chapter 9), and bring him out of death's domain (chapter 11).<a name=211:16></a> The conditions here brought out what the Father was in a way it could not be known in heaven.<a name=211:17></a> All that was the Son's joy.<a name=211:18></a> We learn the

		Father here in Jesus.<a name=212:1></a> We must not look at the varied conditions which He met in His blessed pathway here merely as the result of man's sin -- though that they surely were -- but as opportunities for the Son to have joy in expressing the Father.<a name=212:2></a> His purposes of love were not seen in the works, but in giving men a part and place with the Son in the Father's house.<a name=212:3></a>

		But His revelation in grace as the Father was seen in Jesus here, so that the gospels stand alone in a peculiar glory which will never be seen in the same way again.<a name=212:4></a> There were three and a half years during which the Father was seen in Jesus, and did works which brought out His blessed nature and character in presence of all the evil conditions here.<a name=212:5></a> The Father was seen by mortal eyes.<a name=212:6></a> The immense character of the revelation may be gathered from the fact that if all the things Jesus did had been written one by one John supposed that not even the world itself would contain the books written.<a name=212:7></a> My impression is that it is all written in heaven in the hearts of those who saw the works done.<a name=212:8></a> We have only a very small part recorded of what Jesus did as having the Father abiding in Him to do the works.<a name=212:9></a> But not a bit of the mighty volume will be lost, and all went to make up the joy of the Son.<a name=212:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then His doing whatsoever we shall ask in His name that the Father may be glorified in the Son (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:13">John  14:13</a>, 14) is another element in His joy.<a name=212:11></a> And it is part of His joy that His obedient lovers should have the Comforter.<a name=212:12></a> Then He has joy in coming to His saints so that they are not left orphans during the time of His absence from the world, and He has joy in manifesting Himself to faithful hearts.<a name=212:13></a> Then in chapter 15 His joy lies in the fact that He becomes the Source of fruit for the Father.<a name=212:14></a> The vine being used in this connection suggests that the fruit which the Father delights in is the joy of His saints; this is the new wine which cheers God and man (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#9:13">Judges  9:13</a>).<a name=212:15></a> That the fruit is on this line

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another element in the Lord's joy is the delight He has in loving His own complacently.<a name=213:3></a> "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:9">John  15:9</a>).<a name=213:4></a> This is clearly a complacent love, for it is <i>as</i> the Father has loved Him.<a name=213:5></a> It is therefore conditional; it was so even in His case.<a name=213:6></a> "If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love" (verse 10).<a name=213:7></a> He has a peculiar joy in His saints as those who keep His commandments: obedient lovers are the only ones who afford Him this joy, or who really abide in His love.<a name=213:8></a> Nothing ought to affect our hearts more than to think we can minister to His joy, and, in so doing, have His joy in us.<a name=213:9></a> He looks that we shall be powerfully affected by the thought of His joy, and that it shall be in us as a mighty influence, bringing about that our joy is full.<a name=213:10></a> It must be admitted that very few saints know what it is habitually to have their joy full.<a name=213:11></a> Our feebleness in service and testimony largely results from our lack of this.<a name=213:12></a> All believers have <i>some</i> joy, but God's thought is that our joy should be <i>full</i>, and that it should be consequent on the joy of the Son being in us.<a name=213:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord would have us to regard His wonderful words to the Father in chapter 17 as an utterance of joy, having for its object that His joy may be fulfilled in us.<a name=213:14></a> "And these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them" (verse 13).<a name=213:15></a> One would not think of attempting to compass all that constitutes the joy of the Son as referred to here, but we may note some of its deep springs.<a name=213:16></a>

		There are four great desires in the prayer.<a name=225:6></a> First, that His own might be kept in the Father's name: "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we".<a name=225:7></a> The Son was here to declare the Father's name.<a name=225:8></a> That name had been given to Him that He might make it known to men.<a name=225:9></a> This was the work which the Father had given Him to do.<a name=225:10></a> The thought of the Father's name was the last thing before Him ere He went to the cross (verse 26), and it was the first thing before Him as the risen One (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=225:11></a> The Father gave His name to the Son that He might reveal it.<a name=225:12></a> The depths of infinite divine grace and love and holiness -- for it is "Holy Father" -- are in that name, and all was given to the Son that He might make it known.<a name=225:13></a> In going into death the Lord had before Him the unspeakable suffering of that hour when sin must be dealt with according to divine holiness, but it was from <i>the Father's hand</i> that He took the cup, and He took it that the glory of <i>the Father's name</i> might appear.<a name=225:14></a> His great thought was, "Father, glorify thy name" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:28">John  12:28</a>).<a name=225:15></a> Sin was to be put away, reconciliation effected; but, above and beyond all, <i>the Father's name</i>

		was to come out in its glory of grace.<a name=226:1></a> This was the supreme thought in the heart of the Son of God as He drew near to death.<a name=226:2></a> Do we think enough of this, beloved brethren?<a name=226:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God went into death that we might know the blessedness of the Father's name.<a name=226:4></a> The goodness, grace, love, and glory of that name are all told out, and the One who made it known is the One who can instruct our hearts in it.<a name=226:5></a> His desire is that we should be kept in the Father's name.<a name=226:6></a> How wonderful and blessed to think of being kept in that name!<a name=226:7></a> What rest, what peace, what joy!<a name=226:8></a> An Old Testament saint could speak of being hidden in Jehovah's pavilion, and in the secret of His tent (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:5">Psalm  27:5</a>), but our pavilion is the Father's name!<a name=226:9></a> The Son would have us enclosed in all the blessedness of the Father's name, kept in the grace of that name, kept in the love of which it speaks!<a name=226:10></a> That is our "secret place".<a name=226:11></a> The apostles were kept in the Father's name, and hence in perfect unity of testimony.<a name=226:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as to the world the desire of the Son of God is, "I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil" (verse 15).<a name=226:13></a> How does the Father keep us out of evil?<a name=226:14></a> I am assured that it is by filling us with what is supremely good.<a name=226:15></a> "Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth".<a name=226:16></a> The truth is in a living Person and the Father would make that Person to our hearts the embodiment of everything worth knowing.<a name=226:17></a> The taint of evil is upon the best things in the world, but <i>good</i> in absolute perfection -- even the perfect setting forth of the blessed God -- is in Christ.<a name=226:18></a> There is preservative power in the knowledge of Him to keep us out of all the evil here.<a name=226:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth".<a name=226:20></a> He was ever morally separate from the evil of the world, but now He has taken a place, as the risen and glorified One, entirely apart from it.<a name=226:21></a> His death, in that sense, was the moment of His entire separation from the scene and circumstances where sin was.<a name=226:22></a> He is wholly apart

		Then in verse 21 there is a third desire: "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that <i>they</i> also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=227:2></a> I trust that we may know more of that blessed unity in the divine nature in which the Son of God would have all His own to be.<a name=227:3></a> These are feeble days, and the practical realisation of unity is much hindered, but there <i>is</i> unity in the divine nature.<a name=227:4></a> In every bit of true knowledge of the Father and the Son there must be unity.<a name=227:5></a> It is "that they also may be one in us".<a name=227:6></a> If believers know the Father and the Son they come into this unity, for wherever the knowledge of the Father and the Son is there must be unity of a profoundly real nature.<a name=227:7></a> It is the knowledge of divine Persons that brings about unity, for it gives saints a common portion of joy and blessedness in which there is no element of discord.<a name=227:8></a>

		"Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" (verse 24).<a name=227:9></a> In the first desire of the Son of God the prominent thing is <i>the Father's name</i>, in the second it is preservation from the evil of the <i>world</i>, in the third it is unity amongst <i>saints</i>, but in the fourth it is <i>the Son of God Himself</i>.<a name=227:10></a> He desires His own to be with Him where He is, that they may behold His glory.<a name=227:11></a> Think of the glory that has been given to the Son by the Father!<a name=227:12></a> It has been given to Him to bring to pass every purpose of love and blessing that was in the Father's heart from eternity.<a name=227:13></a> This is His peculiar and distinctive glory.<a name=227:14></a> He will give effect to all the Father's purpose.<a name=227:15></a> In the midst of a universe of bliss where every thought of "the Father of glory" will be accomplished we shall behold the glory of the Son.<a name=227:16></a> If not one trace of evil is to be found in that blessed and holy universe it is

		I am bringing before you some very familiar scriptures; indeed, they are so familiar that it is well if our very familiarity with them has not hindered us from realising the importance and blessedness of that of which they speak.<a name=229:1></a> We have often been reminded that the first day of the week -- the resurrection day -- imparts its own peculiar character to Christianity; nor does it close without presenting in pattern the assembly -- the saints gathered, the Spirit given, and the Lord in the midst.<a name=229:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My object in adverting now to this day is to bring briefly before you the activities of the Lord in resurrection.<a name=229:3></a> Does it not awaken at once a lively interest in our hearts when we ask how was the blessed Lord engaged on that memorable day?<a name=229:4></a> We have often, it may be, meditated with profound delight on His activities in the days of His flesh.<a name=229:5></a> We have followed Him through the day of His activity as Jehovah's Servant on earth, from its sunrise at the baptismal waters of Jordan to its sunset in that awful hour of the power of darkness, when the night came of which He spake when he could no longer work.<a name=229:6></a> Blessed, indeed for us to know that the night did not overtake that peerless Servant until His work was done!<a name=229:7></a> I speak not -- for the moment -- of atonement, but of all those ceaseless activities of grace, in which He was the Servant of Jehovah's pleasure, and the Son of His Father's love as a Man upon the earth.<a name=229:8></a>

		The glory of the Lord's eternal Person appears in a wonderful way in John's gospel, perhaps more fully than anywhere else.<a name=254:6></a> Our spirits are impressed, as we read that gospel, by many statements which bring out the personal greatness and glory of the Sent One: -- "He who comes from above is above all .<a name=254:7></a>.<a name=254:8></a>.<a name=254:9></a> .<a name=254:10></a> He who comes out of heaven is above all" (3:31), "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (5:17), "Before Abraham was, I AM" (8:58), "I and the Father are one" (10:30), "All things that the Father has are mine" (16:15).<a name=254:11></a> Had He not been truly God as to His Person, He would not have been great enough to take up the work which He came to do as the Sent One, the obedient One.<a name=254:12></a> The essential truth of His Person is interwoven with His mediatorship throughout John's gospel.<a name=254:13></a> His Person is unchanged, whatever place, service, or relationship He might be pleased to take up for the effectuation of the purposes of divine love.<a name=254:14></a>

		We will look first at the scriptures which refer directly in a prophetic way to Christ as Son.<a name=259:6></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a> is the most explicit of these, and therefore we do not wonder to find it quoted three times in the New Testament (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:33">Acts  13:33</a>, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:5">Hebrews  1:5</a> and 5: 5).<a name=259:7></a> Sonship in relation to men naturally is invariably connected in Scripture with the thought of being begotten, and it is definitely connected with this thought in relation to the Son of God.<a name=259:8></a> "Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; <i>I</i> this day have begotten thee".<a name=259:9></a> He is also called "a son" in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#7:14">Isaiah  7:14</a> and 9:6, and the Spirit of God applies <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:1">Hosea  11:1</a> to Him (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:15">Matthew  2:15</a>).<a name=259:10></a> Each of these scriptures gives Him the title of Son as begotten through the power of the Highest overshadowing the virgin (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>), in which miraculous way a divine Person became incarnate, and was found in man's condition here in holy flesh apart from sin.<a name=259:11></a> To apply the words "begotten" or "only begotten" to Him as in eternal Deity in the past is simply a traditional error, for which Scripture does not furnish the slightest ground.<a name=259:12></a> John's use of the words (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>, 18; and <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>) is manifestly in reference to Him as the Object of faith in manhood, and the One sent into the world that we might live through Him.<a name=259:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add, at this point, that the two great types of Christ as Son in the Old Testament are Isaac and Solomon.<a name=260:7></a> Isaac is, typically, Christ as the Son of His Father's love, begotten and conceived in a power altogether above nature; afterwards, in figure, offered up as a burnt-offering, and raised from the dead, to have a wife of His own kindred.<a name=260:8></a> This is Christ viewed particularly, but not exclusively, as saints of the assembly know Him.<a name=260:9></a> Solomon is, typically, the anointed King of glory, beloved by Jehovah (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:24">2 Samuel  12:24</a>, 25), and having His kingdom established for ever (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:12">1 Chronicles  17:12</a> - 14; <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:10">1 Chronicles  22:10</a>).<a name=260:10></a> This is particularly how Israel and the nations will know "the Son" when He takes the kingdom, and the kings and judges of the earth are called upon to kiss Him (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:12">Psalm  2:12</a>).<a name=260:11></a> Rich and full as is the spiritual teaching connected with these types -- a teaching deeply valued by all lovers of Christ -- it is manifest that they both clearly apply to Christ as Man, and not as in the form of God.<a name=260:12></a> They do not furnish any suggestion that He bore the title of Son when He was in Deity in the past eternity.<a name=260:13></a>

		Theologians, feeling that the word "begotten" implied the posteriority of the One begotten to the One who begot Him, but not seeing that it referred to Him as born of the virgin in time, tried to escape the difficulty by inventing the unscriptural phrase, 'eternal generation', which involves the

		No scripture could bring out more distinctly than <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:14">Hebrews  9:14</a> the place that Christ was in here as not acting by His own will, or by His own power as a divine Person.<a name=277:3></a> His offering of Himself to God was the supreme act of His self-sacrificing devotion, but it was performed through the eternal Spirit, and was thus connected with the eternal thoughts of God.<a name=277:4></a> It stood in relation to what was in God's mind long before the types of the Old Testament set it forth in a figurative way.<a name=277:5></a> Compare <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:20">1 Peter  1:20</a>.<a name=277:6></a> "The eternal Spirit" was long prior to the offering of goats and bulls.<a name=277:7></a> The latter only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, but what was done by Christ through the eternal Spirit effected what was in accord with the mind of God, and therefore was of an eternal character.<a name=277:8></a> It has long been recognised that the use of the word "eternal" in the epistle to the Hebrews contrasts what God has brought in now, through Christ and by His death, with what was known in Judaism.<a name=277:9></a>

		The Spirit is not a name of relationship like Father or Son.<a name=277:10></a> The Holy Spirit has not been manifested like the Son, or revealed like the Father; He remains in His eternal character as an unseen Spirit, and can therefore be spoken of as "the eternal Spirit".<a name=277:11></a> But Scripture does not speak of 'the eternal Father', or 'the eternal Son', because the Father and the Son are names which give character to our <i>present</i> knowledge of God.<a name=277:12></a> They are names which could only be known through the incarnation.<a name=277:13></a> They give a character to the present time which no other period ever had.<a name=277:14></a> The peculiar blessedness and supreme favour of the present time is that we know the Father as revealed in the Son.<a name=277:15></a> Let the saints of

		<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:4">Proverbs  30:4</a> is another of the passages which are supposed by some to support the idea that the sonship of our Lord goes back into eternity.<a name=278:2></a> But this verse forms part of an utterance which is distinctly spoken of as a "prophecy" (verse 1).<a name=278:3></a> It may be, like other Old Testament scriptures we have referred to, a prophetic intimation of the sonship of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=278:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>had probably already found its place in inspired Scripture before Agur's prophecy was uttered; at any rate it was another utterance by the same prophetic Spirit.<a name=278:5></a> And <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:4">Proverbs  30:4</a> no more proves that the title "Son" applied to Christ <i>then</i> than <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a> proves that He was the Son begotten, and anointed as King upon Zion, at the time when the psalm was written.<a name=278:6></a> It would make nonsense of Scripture to assume that prophetic statements as to what Christ would be could be taken as setting forth facts subsisting as actualities at the time when they were written.<a name=278:7></a>

		The inquiry, "What is his son's name; if thou knowest", was, indeed, designed to awaken in the heart of every reader deep interest in the fact that One who could be spoken of as God's Son was in the view of the prophetic Spirit.<a name=278:8></a> And I think we should be justified in saying that the same divine Spirit who inspired the question has answered it in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>.<a name=278:9></a> "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace".<a name=278:10></a> But it is obvious that nothing whatever is said in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:4">Proverbs  30:4</a> about His being Son in the past eternity.<a name=278:11></a>

		As much has been made of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>as being alleged to prove the eternal sonship of Christ, it is important to consider the scripture carefully.<a name=278:12></a> It is clear that Wisdom is

		personified here, and so also is Prudence.<a name=279:1></a> But the thought of Wisdom being the Son is in no way suggested in the chapter, for Wisdom is personified as a woman.<a name=279:2></a> This is striking as being in a book which <i>does</i> give prominence to the thought of sonship in the saints.<a name=279:3></a> But Wisdom is always in the feminine; it is "her" and "she" all through.<a name=279:4></a> The son -- "my son" -- is to get wisdom; he is to say to wisdom "Thou art my sister"; intelligence is to be his kinswoman (chapter 7:4).<a name=279:5></a> An attempt has been made to evade the force of this by pointing out that wisdom is a feminine word in Hebrew.<a name=279:6></a> But no one could believe that the Spirit of God would use a feminine word, and a feminine figure throughout, if His object had been to give in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>an unquestionable proof that the Lord Jesus Christ bore the title of 'Son' in the past eternity.<a name=279:7></a> There are feminine types of Christ in Scripture such as the red heifer and other female offerings, and the import of these must be sought in the general idea which is conveyed typically by the female.<a name=279:8></a> That idea is certainly not the thought of sonship.<a name=279:9></a> The Holy Spirit has emphasised the sonship of Christ in one remarkable passage by speaking of Him as "a male son" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12:5">Revelation  12:5</a>), and if <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>had been intended to be one of the strongest proofs that Scripture contains of the eternal sonship of Christ we may be sure that the chapter would not have carried throughout the feminine impress.<a name=279:10></a>

		The fact is that Wisdom is viewed in the chapter in a very abstract way; she dwells with prudence, and she is intelligence; by her kings rule, rulers make just decrees, and princes and nobles rule.<a name=279:11></a> She dispenses honour to those who love her, and fills their treasuries.<a name=279:12></a> Jehovah possessed her in the beginning of His way; she was set up from eternity, brought forth before the hills, and was present when Jehovah did the work of creation.<a name=279:13></a> The language used -- "set up", "brought forth" -- is clearly inapplicable to a divine Person in eternal Deity, but it is beautifully in keeping with the thought of wisdom as a personified quality brought into

		being, and existing beside Jehovah, His hand-maid, as it were, in all His workings.<a name=280:1></a> She is not said to be created; that would make her a concrete entity; but she is "set up" and "brought forth" so as to be contemplated as possessed by Jehovah.<a name=280:2></a> It is obviously an abstract conception of wisdom, but personified, so that it is represented as crying, instructing, loving, being loved, conferring benefits, and as rejoicing before Jehovah and in the habitable parts of His earth, and as having delights with the sons of men.<a name=280:3></a> In all this I have no doubt there was in the mind of the Spirit a certain reference to Christ, for it was He who would be God's wisdom as well as His power, even as the crucified One, and who would be "made to us wisdom from God" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:24">1 Corinthians  1:24</a>, 30).<a name=280:4></a> But to make wisdom in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>, to be definitely Christ personally is going beyond what is written.<a name=280:5></a> Indeed, as we know, Christ the Son was really Jehovah the Creator in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>, and wisdom was with Him in all His works of old.<a name=280:6></a> To see this is manifestly to exalt Him infinitely; it is impossible for any one to say that it is a derogation from His glory.<a name=280:7></a>

		I do not think that <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>can be understood, consistently with the whole truth, except by seeing that it is the voice of wisdom abstractly viewed, but personified as a female who can speak, love, bestow favours, and have delights.<a name=280:8></a> It has pleased God to so present it, and it is for us to seek understanding as to it.<a name=280:9></a> It must be admitted by all that the thought of Son is simply not to be found there.<a name=280:10></a> <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>does not call wisdom a divine Person, and some of the language used precludes this thought of her.<a name=280:11></a>

		I do not think that any scripture can be adduced that applies the title "Son", or "Son of God", to our Lord Jesus Christ as in Deity in the past eternity.<a name=281:12></a> Scripture teaches unquestionably that His <i>Person</i> is eternal, but it invariably attaches these <i>titles</i> to Him, whether prophetically or actually, as in manhood.<a name=281:13></a> This is, I believe, indisputable.<a name=281:14></a>
