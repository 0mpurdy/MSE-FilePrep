		The wide-spread interest amongst the children of God in the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament, is a feature of the present time which one recognises with deep thankfulness.<a name=1:1></a> It may be regarded as the divine answer in the saints to the infidelity now so current in the religious world.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This "Outline" is largely the substance of a series of readings on the book of Genesis during the years 1919 - 20.<a name=1:3></a> It is sent forth in this form with the desire and earnest prayer that, through the blessing of God, it may be spiritually helpful to those who are of the household of faith.<a name=1:4></a>

		It may be remarked that quotations from Scripture are generally, throughout this book, from the New Translation, by J.<a name=1:5></a> N.<a name=1:6></a> Darby.<a name=1:7></a> <br>C.<a name=1:8></a> A.<a name=1:9></a> C.<a name=1:10></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the book of Genesis we have brought before us the beginning of those things which work out in result in the Revelation.<a name=1:11></a> It is a most important book as the basis of all Scripture, and as presenting in principle most of the great subjects of Scripture.<a name=1:12></a> Creation, sin, judgment, promise, sacrifice, resurrection, God's election of grace and His covenant, the separation of His people from the world, the pilgrim life of faith, translation, the final bringing of Israel and the nations into blessing under Christ as typified by Joseph, all have a place here.<a name=1:13></a> And there are many precious types of Christ and the church.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is especially important that we should be established in the truth of this first chapter in an infidel age like the present, when all kinds of theories as to the origin of things are abroad.<a name=1:15></a> We need to be in the faith of God's creative wisdom and power.<a name=1:16></a> It is "by faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>).<a name=1:17></a> I doubt whether it lies in the power of man's mind to conceive <i>creation</i>; it is a thought which can only be entertained really by faith.<a name=1:18></a> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the

		earth".<a name=2:1></a> Man's mind leaves God out, and wearies itself in endless speculations; faith brings Him in, and everything is simple.<a name=2:2></a> No one need be afraid that discoveries of geology, or any other science, will ever shake the truth of this chapter.<a name=2:3></a> It is God's record, and all true science will be found in harmony with it.<a name=2:4></a> Any theory which definitely conflicts with the account here given is certainly wrong.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=2:6></a> That is all we get about the original creation.<a name=2:7></a> Then in the second verse we find things fallen into a state of ruin.<a name=2:8></a> "And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep".<a name=2:9></a> This was certainly not as it was created -- for we are expressly told that "not as waste [the same word as in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:2">Genesis  1:2</a>] did he create it" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#45:18">Isaiah  45:18</a>).<a name=2:10></a> The same words 'waste' and 'empty' are used of Edom (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#34:11">Isaiah  34:11</a>), and of Israel (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#4:23">Jeremiah  4:23</a>), when those nations have come under Jehovah's vengeance and fierce anger.<a name=2:11></a> So that a solemn change had come about between the first and second verses of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=2:12></a> We do not know what length of time elapsed between those two verses; possibly the long periods of which geologists speak might come in there.<a name=2:13></a> In verse 2 we find the earth a scene of disorder and darkness.<a name=2:14></a> It is in such a scene that God's movements and activities are presented as taking place -- activities which come to an end on the sixth day, so that on the seventh day God rested.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This indicates at the very outset the whole subject of Scripture.<a name=2:16></a> It is the unfolding of how God has worked, and will work, in a scene of moral disorder to bring about a state of things in which He can rest -- a scene of order and life and fruitfulness where all will be

		under the dominion of Man in His image and after His likeness.<a name=3:1></a> This blessed end will be reached in the world to come, when God will "head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth".<a name=3:2></a> This is the "good pleasure which he purposed in himself for the administration of the fulness of times", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:9">Ephesians  1:9</a>, 10.<a name=3:3></a> Thus <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>has in view the ordering of the world to come, and the different elements which are essential to it.<a name=3:4></a> God had the end before Him from the very beginning.<a name=3:5></a> So that we have here, not only a divine account of how the earth was prepared to be the dwelling-place of man, but, underlying that, much that is of spiritual import.<a name=3:6></a> I think we might expect that it would be so, that there would be some correspondence or analogy between God's material works and His actings in the spiritual sphere.<a name=3:7></a> This chapter makes us acquainted in a perfect and divine way with the ordering of the present material creation, but it also suggests typically great principles which are of the deepest interest and importance.<a name=3:8></a>

		In "the earth .<a name=3:9></a>.<a name=3:10></a>.<a name=3:11></a> waste and empty", and "darkness .<a name=3:12></a>.<a name=3:13></a>.<a name=3:14></a> on the face of the deep", we behold a scene in which God could find no pleasure or rest -- a striking figure of the state of man as fallen under the power of sin, Satan, and death, and without the knowledge of God.<a name=3:15></a> But it is blessed to see that, though God could not rest in such a state of things, He did move and work there.<a name=3:16></a> "The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters".<a name=3:17></a> The word used is suggestive of affectionate interest, for it is the same as in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:11">Deuteronomy  32:11</a>, "As the eagle stirreth up its nest, hovereth over its young".<a name=3:18></a> It has something to say of the solicitude of divine love which

		would put forth its activities where all was ruin in order to bring about conditions which could be pronounced 'very good', and in which God could rest.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before the work of the six days began there was this primary movement of the Spirit of God.<a name=4:2></a> In a fallen and ruined world, where all have come under sin and death, there must be a movement of the Holy Spirit in the souls of men as the starting point of any result for God.<a name=4:3></a> The new birth must be effected; otherwise divine light would shine in vain.<a name=4:4></a> In all ages and dispensations this has been essential, and ever will be.<a name=4:5></a> We read that "Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man", <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:24">John  2:24</a>, 25.<a name=4:6></a> There is nothing in man that God can trust until men are born anew.<a name=4:7></a> Of the natural man it is said, "There is not a righteous man, not even one; there is not the man that understands, there is not one that seeks after God .<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a>.<a name=4:10></a> There is no fear of God before their eyes", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:10">Romans  3:10</a> - 18.<a name=4:11></a> Therefore God has to prepare the way for divine light to come in by that mysterious operation which cannot be traced.<a name=4:12></a> "It is needful that <i>ye</i> should be born anew.<a name=4:13></a> The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes: thus is every one that is born of the Spirit", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:7">John  3:7</a>, 8.<a name=4:14></a> The preaching of the gospel would effect nothing if God did not move sovereignly in the souls of men by His Spirit causing them to be born anew.<a name=4:15></a> Man, the fallen sinner, is, as such, hopelessly lost, for he does not desire God, and when the light of God in Christ is brought to him he hates and rejects it.<a name=4:16></a>

		The photographer's plate has to be put into a bath of solution to make it sensitive to light, and it is by new birth that man becomes sensitive to divine light, so that when that light shines for him it stirs his conscience and moves his heart in an effective way God-ward.<a name=5:1></a> But apart from new birth even the shining of divine light would effect nothing, for there would be nothing in man to appreciate or respond to it.<a name=5:2></a> So that the new birth is a fundamental necessity.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the first day "God said, Let there be light.<a name=5:4></a> And there was light".<a name=5:5></a> God commanding light is very significant of the bringing in of Christ, for all true light that has shone for man has been the light of Christ.<a name=5:6></a> He shone in promise four thousand years before He appeared in Person.<a name=5:7></a> All through the Old Testament the light was shining more and more in promise, but now that Christ has come, and has died and risen, and been glorified at God's right hand, there is perfect day.<a name=5:8></a> "It is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=5:9></a> That is the full glory of the light.<a name=5:10></a> But the light was 'good' from the very outset: how good, for example, was the light of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:15">Genesis  3:15</a> and chapter 22: 18!<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When light was brought in "God divided between the light and the darkness".<a name=5:12></a> This is a fundamental principle; light and darkness could not go on together.<a name=5:13></a> Satan is always trying to mix them.<a name=5:14></a> But Paul says, "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness?<a name=5:15></a> or what fellowship of light with darkness?<a name=5:16></a> and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part

		for a believer along with an unbeliever?<a name=6:1></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:14">2 Corinthians  6:14</a>, 15.<a name=6:2></a>) And in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#5:20">Isaiah  5:20</a> we read, "Woe unto them who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness".<a name=6:3></a> It is important to call things by their right names.<a name=6:4></a> "God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night".<a name=6:5></a> As Christ becomes light to our hearts we discern that whatever is not according to Christ is darkness, and therefore we cannot have fellowship with it.<a name=6:6></a> The rejection of Christ has left the world, as such, in darkness, but He is coming again, and will bring in the day.<a name=6:7></a> In the meantime believers are of the day -- sons of light.<a name=6:8></a> Hence they are to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<a name=6:9></a> People in the world may talk of progress and increased light, but the sons of light regard it as darkness because Christ is not in it.<a name=6:10></a> They confess Christ, and stand in separation from the moral darkness around them.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The words, "There was evening, and there was morning", are six times repeated in this chapter, but there is no mention of 'evening' in connection with the seventh day.<a name=6:12></a> This is in keeping with the fact that in the millennium there is no evening lamb (see <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#46:13">Ezekiel  46:13</a> - 15).<a name=6:13></a> The thought of evening drops out.<a name=6:14></a> On the other hand <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#8:14">Daniel  8:14</a> has the remarkable expression 'evening mornings' (see margin to A.<a name=6:15></a>V.<a name=6:16></a>) in reference to the time of apostasy.<a name=6:17></a> All those mornings have really the shade of evening upon them, for there is no divine light in them.<a name=6:18></a> Indeed all man's mornings are really evenings.<a name=6:19></a> Every now and then men think they are going to have a new day by some new form of government, new legislation, education, a league of nations, or something of that kind.<a name=6:20></a> But

		man's new days are all evening-mornings; they are mornings which have the shade of evening on them from their very dawn.<a name=7:1></a> The true Light is absent from them.<a name=7:2></a> But a day is coming whose morning will be without clouds, ushered in by the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and there is no evening to that day.<a name=7:3></a> It passes, so far as the saints are concerned, into the endless day of eternity.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the second day God brings in the firmament, or expanse, and it becomes a division between what is under it and what is above it, and God calls it Heavens.<a name=7:5></a> It is, I suppose, really the atmosphere; a sphere quite distinct from the 'waters' which it divides.<a name=7:6></a> It speaks morally, one would suggest, of a heavenly character of things brought in, which becomes the native air in which faith can breathe freely.<a name=7:7></a> We have remarked how God gave the light of Christ in precious promises, but He also gave from very early days to His saints the thought of what was heavenly, and this became a very separating principle, as we see in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:8">Hebrews  11:8</a> - 16.<a name=7:8></a> Abraham waited for the city which has foundations, and that city is a heavenly one.<a name=7:9></a> Isaac and Jacob were heirs of promise with Abraham, and they sought a heavenly country.<a name=7:10></a> They breathed, we might say, the atmosphere of heavenly hopes, and its separating power made them "strangers and sojourners on the earth".<a name=7:11></a> This dividing principle between what is 'under' and what is 'above' has made its power known from that day to this, and has marked off the saints as heavenly in hope and character.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we really have the light of the knowledge of God in Christ we need a new atmosphere.<a name=7:13></a> There is no one in the world to share or to sympathise with our joys or our exercises; we can only find our suited

		atmosphere in the circle of the brethren.<a name=8:1></a> How could a man truly converted to God breathe in an atmosphere made up of idolatry, hatred, and lawlessness?<a name=8:2></a> He longs to be with his own company; he loves the brethren, and thus has evidence that he has passed from death unto life.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the third day the dry land appears.<a name=8:4></a> In the dry land I think we may see a figure of what subsists in stability, and becomes fruitful for God.<a name=8:5></a> It may be taken as typical of the special place which Israel had as divinely called, separated from the nations around them, and ordered by God.<a name=8:6></a> We cannot fail to see in Scripture how distinctive was the place of Israel, and how it was God's thought that they should be a divinely ordered and fruitful people, so as to show forth His praise before the nations.<a name=8:7></a> As the custodian and cherisher of the promises, and partaking morally of the stabilities of those promises, and as ordered by the divine law and testimony, Israel would answer to the 'dry land'.<a name=8:8></a> This was only true, however, in reality in a small remnant; Israel after the flesh failed to answer to the divine thought.<a name=8:9></a> They were under sin and death as other men were, and were law-breakers also.<a name=8:10></a> The consideration of this prepares us to appreciate the fact that the third day has often in Scripture a reference to resurrection.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The promises given to Abraham brought in the light of an order of things which will be established in the world to come, and which is dependent -- man being what he is -- on the coming in of Christ, and His death and resurrection.<a name=8:12></a> Abraham had to learn that the God whom he believed was One who quickens the dead.<a name=8:13></a> The promise came to one whose own body

		was already become dead so that he might learn at the very outset the character of the power which would substantiate the promise.<a name=9:1></a> That he had learned the lesson was plainly seen when he offered up Isaac.<a name=9:2></a> The promises which he had received to himself he held in the faith of God's resurrection power, so that he could offer up Isaac, and receive him, in a figure, from among the dead.<a name=9:3></a> Thus faith was taught to look for the establishment of all that was in the thought and promise of God by a power that could act where, on man's side, all was death.<a name=9:4></a> It was not only that a man and his seed were separated from the confusion and idolatry of the Babel world, but they were taught something of the fact that death was upon themselves, and that therefore all divine promise and blessing must be substantiated in resurrection power.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Later on, at a new starting-point of Israel's history, Jehovah gave them the passover -- a plain typical lesson as to their own state under death and judgment, and that Jehovah's promises and covenant could only be established on the ground of the death of Christ for them.<a name=9:6></a> And just as all that they were in the past was based typically upon this, they will have to come to the apprehension of it in moral reality in a future day before they will be truly seen as a divinely ordered and fruitful people.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ has come in infinite grace into the death that lay upon man, but He has emerged from death to become the stable and imperishable foundation of an order of things marked by fruitfulness and life.<a name=9:8></a> We have come to 'sure mercies' now, to things which are ordered in all things and sure.<a name=9:9></a> We can be to Another now, even to Him "who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear

		fruit to God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>.<a name=10:1></a> Consequent upon the, 'dry land' appearing, we find "herb producing seed", and "fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth".<a name=10:2></a> Nothing but what stands in relation to Christ is really stable or fruitful for God.<a name=10:3></a> The assembly is in relation to Him now; Israel will be in a future day; then as having the sure mercies of David in a risen Christ they will be stable and fruitful for God's pleasure.<a name=10:4></a> Meanwhile the saints of the assembly have that place.<a name=10:5></a>

		Then on the fourth day lights are set in the expanse of the heavens "to give light on the earth .<a name=10:6></a>.<a name=10:7></a>.<a name=10:8></a> the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night, and the stars".<a name=10:9></a> This seems clearly to intimate the thought of God that the earth should be in the light of what is set in the heavens, and under heavenly rule or influence.<a name=10:10></a> Jesus glorified is 'the great light' in the heavens.<a name=10:11></a> When He was here "the dayspring from on high" visited men, and He was "the light of the world", but the moral darkness in which He appeared was so dense that it did not apprehend the light.<a name=10:12></a> He is now as a risen and glorified Man in heaven, and in the world to come He will shine forth publicly as the Sun of righteousness.<a name=10:13></a> But in the meantime those who believe on Him are in the light of His shining.<a name=10:14></a> "The world sees me no longer; but ye see me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:19">John  14:19</a>); "We see Jesus .<a name=10:15></a>.<a name=10:16></a>.<a name=10:17></a> crowned with glory and honour", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:9">Hebrews  2:9</a>.<a name=10:18></a> What will be true in another day of Jerusalem, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come", is true spiritually for His saints now.<a name=10:19></a> "Wherefore he says, Wake up thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a>.<a name=10:20></a>

		The fact that it is mentioned that Seth was in the image of Adam suggests that what came in on the natural side was on the line of fallen man, and this brings out that it is through the activity of God's electing mercy and love alone that a seed is found in which His testimony can be continued.<a name=51:18></a> The fact that Adam could only beget a son in his own likeness and image casts all on God.<a name=51:19></a> If God did not act in His own sovereignty there could be no seed for Himself.<a name=51:20></a> It emphasises the fact that God works according to His

		The interest in these men, and almost all we know of their exercises, lies in the names which they gave their sons.<a name=52:5></a> I do not know that we can trace them all out, but the fact that this chapter is the history of the line of God's testimony for more than 1500 years gives it an importance not to be overlooked.<a name=52:6></a> I think an outline may be seen here in type of the divine testimony from the resurrection of Christ right on to the bringing in of the rest of God.<a name=52:7></a> The Spirit who led these men to give names to their sons, and who inspired Moses to place them on record, had before Him the whole scope of things which would come in consequent on Christ being slain, prefigured in the death of Abel.<a name=52:8></a> The chapter ends by the suggestion of the removal of the curse, and the bringing in of rest to the wide creation in connection with Noah.<a name=52:9></a> The typical bearing of this is clear.<a name=52:10></a>

		In Enosh there is the recognition that man in the flesh is under death; therefore nothing of blessing depends, or could depend, on that man; the cross sets him aside forever; what is of God, and for man's blessing, comes in in Another Man -- even in Christ.<a name=52:11></a> When we see this clearly we are ready for Cainan, which is practically the same name as Cain; it means acquisition.<a name=52:12></a> Eve made a mistake in naming Cain; she

		eternal life; and now in connection with Noah the truth of salvation.<a name=62:1></a> He prepared an ark for the saving of his house.<a name=62:2></a> Salvation involves complete deliverance and preservation from all the evil of this world.<a name=62:3></a> If you think only of going to heaven you do not want salvation there, and a man who has justification and acceptance can go straight to heaven, but to be down here where there is so much evil salvation is most necessary.<a name=62:4></a> Noah wanted his house for another world, and not for the world that then was; that is exactly what Christ wants His house for; so salvation comes in as complete deliverance from this world, so that in heart and spirit, and walk and ways, we might be completely apart from the world of lawlessness, and that we might live to God.<a name=62:5></a> We have to see that the world is under judgment; we see it, as Noah did, before the judgment actually comes.<a name=62:6></a> It is Christ, the true Noah, who said, "Now is the judgment of this world", and the Spirit has come to convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.<a name=62:7></a> Christ has condemned the world (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:7">Hebrews  11:7</a>).<a name=62:8></a> Have I?<a name=62:9></a> If I follow and allow what is of the world I am approving it, not condemning it.<a name=62:10></a> If I love it I am not condemning it; I am not practically in the ark.<a name=62:11></a> It is in coming into line with Christ and the Spirit that we come into salvation in a practical sense.<a name=62:12></a> Have we definitely passed out of the world?<a name=62:13></a> That is what baptism means.<a name=62:14></a>

		Many people's idea of salvation is that they are fit for heaven through the Saviour's work.<a name=62:15></a> But that does not give the true idea of salvation; salvation is "that we being saved out of the hand of our enemies might serve God without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life".<a name=62:16></a> We are

		Baptism means that you go out of the world that is under judgment, and that you are never to go back into it; you are buried with Christ by being baptised to His death.<a name=63:7></a> Those true to their baptism are in the ark and they condemn the world.<a name=63:8></a> Each baptised person is in the position of subscribing to the total condemnation of the world and of man in the flesh.<a name=63:9></a> If I am not true to my baptism, I fall under the power of some influence which is not of God, and if I am under the power of sin or any evil influence, how can I talk of being saved?<a name=63:10></a> It used to be said that many were fit for heaven who were not fit for earth!<a name=63:11></a> A justified man has righteousness, but to fit him to be on earth according to God's will he needs salvation; he needs to come into the ark.<a name=63:12></a>

		The ark was to be pitched within and without.<a name=63:13></a> The word 'pitch' is the same word as 'atonement'; it indicates that those in the ark came in figure under cover of the death of Christ; that is where baptism puts us, not for heaven but for earth.<a name=63:14></a> We come under

		When we come into the ark we get divine light; there is a window there.<a name=64:8></a> I was struck by seeing that the word translated 'window' is used twenty-four times in the Old Testament, and in every other instance but this it is translated 'noon' or 'noonday'.<a name=64:9></a> It evidently suggests the full light of day.<a name=64:10></a> Such an expression shows that the language used by the Spirit is selected in view of typical teaching.<a name=64:11></a> It suggests that in the ark we come into the place where divine light is found.<a name=64:12></a> In coming into the good of salvation, in accepting baptism in its spiritual import and being true to it, we come into divine light, into the light of the covenant.<a name=64:13></a> "With thee will I establish my covenant" (verse 18); that is noonday light -- the light of what God is as pledged in grace and love to man.<a name=64:14></a> Christ is to us the covenant; all God's love and thoughts of blessing man-ward are secured and confirmed to us in Him, and as being with Him in the ark -- in the separation of His death from this present evil world -- we enjoy the light of it, we live in the light of it.<a name=64:15></a> The ark sets forth the place which Christ has prepared for the saving of His

		Then, as remarked before, Noah and the saved family in the ark typify Christ in connection with the remnant by-and-by.<a name=66:2></a> The remnant will see that the end of all flesh has come before God, so that they will turn away from all the thoughts of men, and will refuse the mark of the beast, and the covenant of Antichrist.<a name=66:3></a> As baptised in the Name of the Lord they will own no other name, and will make Him their Sanctuary, and will be found in complete separation from the world of the ungodly.<a name=66:4></a> All will be judgment around, but there will be -- to speak in the language of the type -- an ark where every divine element will be preserved.<a name=66:5></a> I do not suggest that the saints will escape suffering, or even death, but every element of faith and testimony will be carried through into the new world.<a name=66:6></a> In principle this is the case today.<a name=66:7></a> All Israel's hopes and promises are preserved in the faith of the assembly, and, indeed, the blessing of all families of the earth.<a name=66:8></a> Every divine element of the world to come is being preserved and carried through in the faith and affections and testimony of the assembly.<a name=66:9></a> This is an aspect of the typical significance of the ark which is greater than its reference to individual salvation.<a name=66:10></a>

		Everything that is of God and for God's pleasure has to be preserved and carried through to take its place in the world to come.<a name=66:11></a> Just as every element of natural life was preserved in the ark, so every element of piety, faith, and divine testimony has to be preserved and carried through.<a name=66:12></a> It suggests something more than our personal deliverance; it suggests that everything that God values is preserved alive and carried through.<a name=66:13></a> We have to take account of the fact

		that God has drawn us to Christ, and given us to appreciate Christ, not simply for our personal blessing, though that is perfectly secured, but God has connected us with Christ that we might be identified with His testimony.<a name=67:1></a> What is in my mind is, that "every living thing" that God values is preserved in the ark.<a name=67:2></a> There is in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>a wonderful collection of living things.<a name=67:3></a> My impression is that every feature of piety, faith, and divine testimony seen in that chapter is preserved today in the assembly, and will be preserved in the remnant by-and-by, and will be carried through into the rest and blessing of the world to come.<a name=67:4></a> Every living element of divine testimony that God introduced into this world in connection with Abel's faith, and Enoch's, and Noah's, and Abraham's, and all the rest, will never perish.<a name=67:5></a> It is preserved, and will be preserved, and carried through to the world to come.<a name=67:6></a> What was precious to Abel's faith is in the world today, in the hearts and testimony of thousands of saints.<a name=67:7></a> Think of Enoch, too, who apprehended God's complete victory over death; think of that being carried through a scene of death in living testimony!<a name=67:8></a> All that was of God in the world was under cover of the ark, and every living thing is preserved for God today in the ark.<a name=67:9></a> We think of the ark as a means of salvation for us, but it is really the place where everything is preserved for God and for another world.<a name=67:10></a> The then world was under judgment, and God had another world before Him; all the elements that will fill that world to come are in the assembly now, and when the assembly has gone these elements will be preserved in the remnant.<a name=67:11></a>

		When we come to chapter 8, we see what God had in view; the world of lust and lawlessness had all perished; it had gone under judgment; and now we see the new world coming into view, the world that was going to be filled with what God had preserved in the ark.<a name=69:6></a> The first words are very touching "God remembered Noah"; His covenant was with him.<a name=69:7></a> How could God forget Christ?<a name=69:8></a> He was the Man of God's pleasure who had found favour with Him, the One with whom God's covenant is.<a name=69:9></a> The world has forgotten Christ; it has no idea that Christ and His family are going to be brought in, and that they will fill the earth.<a name=69:10></a> But God remembers Christ, and He is going to fill the earth with Christ and His family.<a name=69:11></a> The world does not want Christ to come in, it wants to enjoy things in a state that is under judgment.<a name=69:12></a>

		The next thing is that the tops of the mountains are seen.<a name=70:5></a> It suggests that before the conditions of kingdom blessing are secured, before the scene is yet clear for the kingdom, faith sees all greatness and eminence and authority centring in Christ.<a name=70:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14">Revelation  14</a>we have the 144,000 standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb; they apprehend Him in His royal glory, and stand with Him there before the kingdom is set up; they stand with Him in the faith of His glory, greatness, and power.<a name=70:7></a> We see Christ now in His greatness and glory as Head of all principality and power.<a name=70:8></a> In Scripture mountains are symbolical of great powers; we see now the tops of the mountains, the glorious eminence of Christ, long before the waters subside.<a name=70:9></a> Everyone will see it by-and-by, but the saved family can see it now.<a name=70:10></a> Compare <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:22">1 Peter  3:22</a>; "He is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him"; all the greatness is seen connected with Christ.<a name=70:11></a> We do not yet see everything put under Him; the waters are still on the earth; but these wonderful mountain tops have appeared.<a name=70:12></a> We see the glory and greatness of Christ; we see Him

		We see in this chapter the beginning of a new age or dispensation.<a name=75:10></a> The world that then was had disappeared under the flood, and there was a new beginning.<a name=75:11></a> Before the flood there does not seem to have been any special dealing of God with men.<a name=75:12></a> There was a testimony; Enoch was a prophet, and Noah was a preacher; but there was no restraint upon man in the way of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very blessed to see the divine character of the new system; it began in the savour of the burnt offering.<a name=76:2></a> The instruction that comes out in this chapter is founded on that, and it will be characteristic of the world to come.<a name=76:3></a> At the end of the chapter we come back to what is historical; but we see the elements here that make up God's world -- the fact that man is to live on the result of death; that he is to be preserved in the dignity of being in the image of God; and the covenant and the sign of the covenant.<a name=76:4></a> All these are elements that constitute the world to come; they follow on what we have been seeing in the previous chapter.<a name=76:5></a> Then there is also the setting up of government, and committing it to man.<a name=76:6></a> This will be fully realised in the world to come; man will be in his proper place then in the exercise of government, and everything will own his place.<a name=76:7></a> I do not think "the fear and dread of you" implies suffering necessarily; it rather gives the thought of the place man is put in.<a name=76:8></a> The fact that man was made in the image of God is recalled, and this determines his place as to the animal creation, and it is also the ground on which government is set up.<a name=76:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The animal creation is also given for food to man instead of green herbs; that shows an entirely new departure.<a name=76:10></a> We noticed in chapter 1 that the principle of life -- the seed principle -- was to characterise man's food.<a name=76:11></a> Now there is an entire change; man is privileged to feed on that which is the result of death.<a name=76:12></a> It is wonderful how death is presented to us in the early chapters of Genesis.<a name=76:13></a> It is first seen as the judgment of God: "In the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt

		It is a striking fact here that the blood is reserved.<a name=78:11></a> The blood is not spoken of sacrificially in Genesis, but its being reserved leaves room for all the precious teaching as to it in Exodus and Leviticus.<a name=78:12></a> God develops the efficacy of the blood very much there; here it is only a hint; God says, as it were, It is for <i>Me</i>.<a name=78:13></a> All the offerings in Genesis are burnt offerings.<a name=78:14></a> God gives a hint to Cain of a sin offering, but there is no record in Genesis of a sin offering being offered; it is always the burnt offering.<a name=78:15></a>

		Then we come to what is most blessed -- the covenant.<a name=79:1></a> It is in connection with Noah that we first get the thought (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>); God says to him: "With thee will I establish my covenant".<a name=79:2></a> Christ is Himself the covenant, as we see plainly in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:6">Isaiah  42:6</a> and 49: 8.<a name=79:3></a> The burnt offering is the ground on which God can carry out the purposes of His love and enter into covenant.<a name=79:4></a> How marvellous to think of God making a covenant!<a name=79:5></a> The covenant conveys the idea of definite and perpetual relations between God and man, the terms and conditions of which are proposed and established by God and into the blessedness of which man can enter.<a name=79:6></a> We see this idea of covenant all through Scripture.<a name=79:7></a> As to the actual provisions of this particular covenant the terms of it do not go very far; they are merely that the world should not be destroyed by flood any more.<a name=79:8></a> A covenant is something stable; it cannot be altered, especially if God makes it.<a name=79:9></a> Even man's confirmed covenant no one adds to or disannuls; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:15">Galatians  3:15</a>.<a name=79:10></a> If you make a covenant you have to stand to it even if you were very foolish in making it.<a name=79:11></a> And we may be sure that if God makes a covenant the thing is certain and abiding.<a name=79:12></a> It is perfect contrast to the idea of curse.<a name=79:13></a> God rejects what He curses, but if He enters into covenant He binds Himself to the persons or things in whose favour the covenant is made.<a name=79:14></a> In this covenant He binds Himself to all creation.<a name=79:15></a> And it is instructive to see the abidingness of it -- 'Perpetual generations' and 'everlasting covenant' speak of this.<a name=79:16></a>

		Abram "built an altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him".<a name=103:5></a> His approach and communion took character from the divine favour which he had experienced.<a name=103:6></a> Our altar must be according to the measure of our knowledge of God.<a name=103:7></a> Now the revelation of God in His Son is complete and immeasurable, but we have to take account of our capacity to appreciate it.<a name=103:8></a> No one can approach beyond his measure, but we should learn to think even of our side according to the measure of divine grace; that is, the Spirit given, priesthood, and sonship.<a name=103:9></a> So that, according to the truth, our altar is very great, and of a high and holy character.<a name=103:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very blessed to build an altar; it suggests taking a priestly place with God, and ministering to His pleasure.<a name=103:11></a> It has often been pointed out that all the offerings in Genesis are burnt offerings.<a name=103:12></a> Amongst believers, speaking generally, the Levite has been more thought of than the priest.<a name=103:13></a> That is, the thought of serving and ministering to man is greater in minds generally than the thought of priestly service Godward.<a name=103:14></a> It is said of Aaron, "that he may serve me as priest", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:1">Exodus  28:1</a>, 4.<a name=103:15></a> The moment we think of taking a priestly place with God it raises the question of suitability, which is indicated in the priestly

		Then we find that Abram "called on the name of Jehovah".<a name=104:13></a> This seems to be suggestive of that spirit of dependence in which one is cast upon God for everything, and particularly for all that is connected with His service and testimony.<a name=104:14></a> "Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name: they called unto Jehovah, and he answered them", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99:6">Psalm  99:6</a>.<a name=104:15></a> Prayer is the expression of weakness and dependence on man's side, but also of confidence in God.<a name=104:16></a> So that we get here three things which are very characteristic of those identified

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking that immediately after Abram takes a priestly place with God Bethel is mentioned for the first time -- the thought of the house of God is introduced.<a name=105:2></a> The time had not yet come for the bringing out in detail of what Bethel meant; we see that more in Jacob's history; but it was already the place where faith dwelt and worshipped.<a name=105:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We ought to think more of serving God in a priestly way.<a name=105:4></a> We often come together with hardly a further thought than to get comfort, or to be edified or refreshed, but the principal thing is the service of God.<a name=105:5></a> In relation to this it is essential to preserve the pilgrim character outside.<a name=105:6></a> If we do not walk in the pilgrim character individually there will not be much of a priestly character when we come together.<a name=105:7></a> The 'tent' suggests also a household thought.<a name=105:8></a> I often think when young Christians are married that it is the pitching of another tent, and one's exercise is that it should be a 'goodly' tent.<a name=105:9></a> "How goodly are thy tents, Jacob, and thy tabernacles, Israel!<a name=105:10></a>" God connects His testimony very much with households; and it is a poor household where there is not a morning and evening sacrifice.<a name=105:11></a> Job took a priestly place on behalf of his household, and put everything on the ground of the burnt offering.<a name=105:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Satan first tried to detain Abram from entering the land, and then when he was there he moved him to go on further to the south, and then to Egypt.<a name=106:4></a> But in leaving Bethel Abram departed from the place of blessing, and it is at that point the thought of famine is introduced.<a name=106:5></a> There could be no famine in the house of God; there is always bread there; the prodigal knew that even the hired servants in that house had "bread enough and to spare".<a name=106:6></a> God said in another day that if His people had hearkened to Him and walked in His ways He would have fed them with the finest of the wheat, and satisfied them with honey out of the rock; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#81">Psalm  81</a>.<a name=106:7></a> If you find a shortage of spiritual food you may be sure that you have been moving in the wrong direction.<a name=106:8></a> There is hardly any better test of where you are than the food test.<a name=106:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The shortage of food is a very serious matter, because it leads to souls going down to Egypt; it is hungry people who go there.<a name=106:10></a> If you are nourished by spiritual food you do not want the world's food, but if you do not get the former you will soon crave the latter.<a name=106:11></a> If you are conscious of a shortage let it wake you up as to where you are moving, and get back to the neighbourhood of Bethel.<a name=106:12></a> Every step in the wrong direction is not only lost time, but it leads to all true testimony being given up.<a name=106:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of going in that direction is that we become afraid to be true to our spiritual relationships.<a name=107:4></a> As soon as Abram got near Egypt he began to be afraid; the very shadow of Egypt before he got there made him afraid to be true to the relationship in which he and Sarai stood.<a name=107:5></a> He thought only of himself; it is like "all seek their own things".<a name=107:6></a> His proper place surely was to protect Sarai, but he was prepared to sacrifice Sarai to protect himself!<a name=107:7></a> Abram represents the responsible side, and in Sarai we see a type of the relationship in which the church stands to Christ.<a name=107:8></a> Abram ought to have had the most jealous care that she should remain true to her relationship and the confession of it.<a name=107:9></a> But instead of that he was full of himself -- "They will slay <i>me</i>, and save thee alive.<a name=107:10></a> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with <i>me</i> on thy account, and <i>my</i> soul may live because of thee".<a name=107:11></a> Here is a man seeking his own things; that is the effect of the shadow of Egypt.<a name=107:12></a> You will find that if you come down to the level of the world -- if you get on to terms with the men of the world -- you become very shy of confessing your true relationship to Christ.<a name=107:13></a> The result of this denial of relationship was that Sarai got into Pharaoh's house.<a name=107:14></a> What a contrast to God's house!<a name=107:15></a> "The princes of Pharaoh saw her and praised her to

		There was nothing in his house that he could bring out to meet the difficulty.<a name=116:7></a> But Abram had a good army -- trained, too -- all able men for conflict.<a name=116:8></a> It is very instructive to see this moral result of dwelling in the right place.<a name=116:9></a> Hebron means 'company', and is suggestive of fellowship; Mamre is 'firmness' or 'vigour'; Eshcol is 'cluster of grapes'; and Aner means 'waterfall'.<a name=116:10></a> These names seem to speak of spiritual vigour, and the joy and freshness resulting from being in the good of the presence of the Spirit and of the fellowship.<a name=116:11></a> The result is strength for conflict, for the saint has to be both a son of peace and a man of war.<a name=116:12></a> All these things become strengthening 'allies'; Lot in Sodom had no allies, but with such confederates there is no lack of military power to overcome.<a name=116:13></a>

		I think we may see in chapter 18 certain things which are suggestive of privileges which now pertain to the assembly.<a name=148:1></a> There was a divine visitation, and then ministry to the Lord; then faith was greatly confirmed as we see in verses 10 and 14; then there were confidential communications, and finally intercession.<a name=148:2></a> A wonderful group of privileges which are now to be realised in the assembly.<a name=148:3></a> It is blessed to be in a state to receive divine visitations; and such visitations are the privilege of the assembly, as we see very distinctly in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=148:4></a> "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>; "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him" (verse 21).<a name=148:5></a> "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him" (verse 23).<a name=148:6></a> These verses speak clearly of a divine visitation, a divine manifestation, and then there is something even greater, an abiding of divine Persons with a faithful lover.<a name=148:7></a> The three things are clearly distinguishable.<a name=148:8></a> We do not get the latter in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18">Genesis  18</a>; we could not possibly get it; it is in one sense the greatest privilege of all.<a name=148:9></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a> is the privilege of the assembly: the Lord comes to those who miss Him; and that is why the Supper prepares the way for a visitation from the Lord, because if we take it rightly, it shows we miss Him.<a name=148:10></a> If we came together to eat the Supper according to its true character, the Lord would be able to say, There are hearts there who miss Me.<a name=148:11></a> And the fact that they missed Him would attract Him to them.<a name=148:12></a>

		(like that to Mary in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>); it is "<i>He</i> that has my commandments".<a name=149:1></a> It is the individual lover who has His commandments and keeps them, to whom the Lord gives a new apprehension of Himself: I understand that to be a manifestation -- an apprehension of Christ which the soul has not had before.<a name=149:2></a> Then <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:23">John  14:23</a> is granted in connection with keeping His <i>word</i>.<a name=149:3></a> That is, it is not simply having <i>His commandments</i> and keeping them (as verse 21), but keeping that which expresses <i>Himself</i>.<a name=149:4></a> It is the most intimate exercise and activity of affection towards the Lord personally.<a name=149:5></a> It is bridal affection, and might be put along with <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:8">Philippians  3:8</a>.<a name=149:6></a> Hence it secures a peculiar and unique divine companionship, that which is more than a visitation; an <i>abiding</i> of the Father and the Son with the one whose heart is set on Christ Himself.<a name=149:7></a> A heart that cherishes Him becomes very attractive to the Father and the Son.<a name=149:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the way divine visitations are spoken of in the New Testament.<a name=149:9></a> We see in Abraham's case that there was a suitable response; Abraham ministered to the Lord.<a name=149:10></a> That is like <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>, "They ministered to the Lord", and like <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "They made him a supper".<a name=149:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a difference between the spiritual significance of washing the Lord's feet and anointing Him.<a name=150:6></a> Washing His feet means that He is so precious to me that I delight to minister to Him.<a name=150:7></a> But the anointing means that He is precious to God, and God's Anointed has become our Anointed; we have come into communion with God's thoughts of that Blessed One.<a name=150:8></a> The anointing goes further than the feet-washing, and the house is filled with the fragrance.<a name=150:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We ought to take account of the wonderful privilege we are called to.<a name=150:10></a> The Supper is really provided for affection: the Lord gathered around Him not only those He loved but those who loved Him.<a name=150:11></a> He put them in the place of a household who had lost their parent.<a name=150:12></a> We may gather from <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#16:7">Jeremiah  16:7</a> that it was a practice with the Jews to break bread in memory of parents who had gone, and the Lord took up this ancient custom when He instituted the Supper.<a name=150:13></a> Do we miss Him?<a name=150:14></a> Do we like to let Him know that we miss Him?<a name=150:15></a> The Supper should be a testimony to all that we miss Him, and if we eat it with right affections, we should have His presence; He would come to us.<a name=150:16></a> In this world we are orphans because we have lost Him.<a name=150:17></a> If that is true and we feel it, He says, "I will

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we find Abraham's faith confirmed (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:10">Genesis  18:10</a>, 14).<a name=151:5></a> "Is any matter too wonderful for Jehovah?<a name=151:6></a>" It seems to suggest a blessed confirmation of faith.<a name=151:7></a> In the assembly love is cherished and gratified, but faith is also confirmed.<a name=151:8></a> Everything that faith has gained is continually confirmed; everything in a sense becomes more real.<a name=151:9></a> Peter speaks of the prophetic word being 'made surer'; certainly not more sure in itself, but more sure in the heart of the believer.<a name=151:10></a> In the section from verses 9 - 15 the promise is repeated, and, as it were, confirmed, and we see the unbelief of Sarah.<a name=151:11></a> There is often a great deal of practical unbelief with us.<a name=151:12></a> But God would have everything connected with the seed -- whether viewed as Christ personally, or as the heavenly seed or the earthly -- confirmed in our souls.<a name=151:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, further, from verse 17 there are confidential communications.<a name=151:14></a> How wonderful for God to be on confidential terms with men!<a name=151:15></a> He speaks of "Abraham, my friend" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#41:8">Isaiah  41:8</a>); God would not hide from Abraham what He was going to do.<a name=151:16></a> Judgment was coming on Sodom, and before it came Jehovah took Abraham into His confidence about it.<a name=151:17></a> That is another privilege of the assembly: we know what is coming; we know Christ is Heir of the world, and that He will inherit all things, and that before He can

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham interceded on the ground first that there might be fifty righteous, and then he came down to ten.<a name=152:4></a> We go further than that: we come down to <i>One</i>.<a name=152:5></a> Abraham did not go far enough!<a name=152:6></a> We know <i>one</i> righteous Man for whom the city can be spared!<a name=152:7></a> We can intercede in the full knowledge of the blessed fact that one righteous Man has glorified God about the whole question of sin, and in bearing its judgment, so that God's attitude to all men is one of perfect grace.<a name=152:8></a> Later on in regard to Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#5">Jeremiah  5</a>) God said, "Seek .<a name=152:9></a>.<a name=152:10></a>.<a name=152:11></a> if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justice, that seeketh fidelity; and I will pardon it".<a name=152:12></a> But one righteous Man has been found in Jerusalem and in this world, and He has so glorified God that God's attitude to the world is now one of perfect grace: and in the knowledge of that we intercede for all men.<a name=152:13></a> In Abraham's case it was 'peradventure'.<a name=152:14></a> In the Old Testament, however precious the typical instruction may be, we are always reminded that some better thing was reserved for us.<a name=152:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		While there is to be prayer and intercession for all men there is also to be thanksgiving.<a name=152:16></a> We cannot think of divine grace to men without thanksgiving: we give thanks because of God's attitude to men; we give thanks on their behalf, though they do not give thanks for themselves.<a name=152:17></a> God is a Saviour God for every man, and I ought to give thanks for that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us look briefly at the contrast in the next chapter.<a name=153:9></a> Lot sits in the gate of Sodom in contrast to the tent door; he gets a place of honour in the world, but he gets no divine visitation there.<a name=153:10></a> Two <i>angels</i> come to him, speaking of providential care; he gets the care of divine Providence, but no visitation.<a name=153:11></a> It is to be noticed that he had unleavened bread, which suggests that he was personally apart from the corruption around him.<a name=153:12></a> He had a righteous soul.<a name=153:13></a> He did his best to honour the divine Providence represented in the angels, when the men of Sodom would have dishonoured it, but he had no power to maintain what was divine.<a name=153:14></a> Providence protected and delivered him, but his testimony was of no use; it was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They made him a magistrate; that is the meaning of sitting in the gate; he got a certain show of honour in the world, but no real honour, and he had no power for testimony.<a name=154:3></a> What is very sad, too, is that he dreaded the place of faith's security.<a name=154:4></a> He was told to flee to the mountain, but he could not live without a city; he says, "This city is near to flee to, and it is small: I pray thee, let me escape thither -- is it not small?<a name=154:5></a>" His taste was vitiated; he must have something of the world; he pleads for a city, just a little one!<a name=154:6></a> How solemn for a saint to get into such a state as that!<a name=154:7></a> The down grade is terrible, and it is a marked contrast to chapter 18.<a name=154:8></a> Then Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt; her heart was in Sodom and she shared in Sodom's judgment.<a name=154:9></a> She stands to this day in Scripture as a warning monument -- a warning to professors who have never known the separating power of the call of God.<a name=154:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally Lot went up to the mountain, but it was through fear, not through faith; and instead of being like Abraham, the father of a multitude of the seed of faith, he became the father of Moab and Ammon, who were always snares and scourges to the family of faith.<a name=154:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 18 we have seen faith's privilege; divine visitation; ministration to the Lord; faith confirmed; the man of faith taken into divine confidence; and interceding for the world.<a name=154:12></a> We see, too, the moral character of Abraham; he was on a line suited to God's blessing, and would command his children on the same line.<a name=154:13></a> God says, "I know him that he will command his children and his household after him".<a name=154:14></a> Abraham had not only faith, but moral suitability to

		inherit the promises; and he would see that his children went on the same line.<a name=155:1></a> Now God says, as it were, You have looked at that; now look at Lot!<a name=155:2></a> It is a solemn contrast all through, and is full of divine instruction.<a name=155:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Lot's wife abides as a solemn warning; the Lord calls on us to "remember Lot's wife".<a name=155:4></a> She did not die to be buried and forgotten.<a name=155:5></a> She was a woman who had been close to the people of God, and shared outwardly with them, and yet had no inward part with them; her heart was in the world.<a name=155:6></a> She stands in Scripture as a pillar of salt -- a warning to everybody to beware of looking back.<a name=155:7></a> It is in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>, when the Lord is speaking of judgment coming on the world, that He says, "Remember Lot's wife".<a name=155:8></a> We have to remember that this world is under judgment, and to look forward to that scene of glory that is coming.<a name=155:9></a> God forbid that we should look back on the world or anything that it has got!<a name=155:10></a>

	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTERS 20, 21

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen in chapters 18 and 19 the contrast between the privilege of faith enjoyed by the truly circumcised, and the loss suffered by unbelief even when found in a righteous person, but one with whom circumcision has no place; that is, one who walks practically after the flesh.<a name=155:11></a> Lot was providentially cared for in the faithfulness of God, but he did not enjoy privilege.<a name=155:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		In chapter 20 the same weakness and failure that appeared in Abram in chapter 12 comes out again.<a name=156:2></a> That is, he denies his true relationship with Sarah; but this time the failure comes out in a worse form.<a name=156:3></a> This is generally the case when any working of unbelief is not really judged.<a name=156:4></a> It keeps on appearing, and each time it is worse than before.<a name=156:5></a> In chapter 12 it was in connection with giving up the heavenly position -- leaving Bethel and going down to Egypt.<a name=156:6></a> But in chapter 20 it was after the promise of chapters 17 and 18 that Sarah would be the mother of a son with whom God's covenant should be, and who should inherit the promises.<a name=156:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The special testimony in chapter 12 was the inheritance; in chapter 20 it was the heir; and in each case the effort of the enemy was against the special testimony of the moment.<a name=156:8></a> If Abraham had been in the practical faith of the promise he would have realised that the maintenance of the true relationship was of the utmost importance; it was <i>the</i> essential thing in relation to God's testimony at the moment.<a name=156:9></a> Unbelief, weakness, or fear always lead to the giving up of the best thing at the moment.<a name=156:10></a> "The top shoot goes first".<a name=156:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a solemn warning, that one so privileged -- one who had enjoyed such nearness to God -- should so depart from faith as to his public testimony.<a name=156:12></a> Perhaps many of us can understand it as we review our own history!<a name=156:13></a> Have <i>we</i> not known what it was to use language, and walk in steps, that were not those of faith, even after having tasted the joy of spiritual

		We see Abraham here on the ground of mere nature, thinking of himself; "they will kill me"; but the root of it all comes out in verse 13, "God caused me to wander from my father's house".<a name=157:4></a> What a low and natural view of the call of the God of glory!<a name=157:5></a> The call, the inheritance, the privilege of a heavenly man, all lost sight of for the moment.<a name=157:6></a> "God caused me to wander from my father's house!<a name=157:7></a>" Was this the thought of faith?<a name=157:8></a>

		How often we find language that does not rise above the level of the natural man on the lips of true believers!<a name=157:9></a> In the storm the disciples very quickly said, "We perish".<a name=157:10></a> In the wilderness they said, "Whence should we have so many loaves as to satisfy so great a crowd?<a name=157:11></a>" When the Lord warned them against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, they said it was "because we have taken no bread".<a name=157:12></a> When He told them He had meat to eat which they knew not of, they said, "Has anyone brought him anything to eat?<a name=157:13></a>" Peter did seem to rise to the thoughts of faith when he said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God"; flesh and blood had not revealed it to him.<a name=157:14></a> And yet almost immediately, when the Lord spoke of His death, he said, "This shall in no wise be unto thee".<a name=157:15></a> It just shows how quickly the thoughts of faith can be departed from; and when they are, there is sure to be a denial of the relationships in which we stand spiritually.<a name=157:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a chapter of profound interest because it is a divine picture of what is going on at the present moment -- the wondrous fruit of the Father's thoughts and purposes.<a name=174:1></a> The true Isaac has been offered up, and now the blessed work of securing a bride for Him is going on.<a name=174:2></a> In chapter 23 we have the death of Sarah, the vessel of promise; and now what comes to light is the purpose of the Father, and an object for the love of the Son -- the bride.<a name=174:3></a> Sarah's death typifies the passing, for the time, of Israel and the promises in relation to the earth, in order that heavenly blessings and relationships may come in.<a name=174:4></a> The Son, in figure, has gone through death and taken up a heavenly position, and He gets the bride.<a name=174:5></a>

		In the beginning of this chapter we read that "Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac" (verse 5); and after the death of Abraham, "God blessed his son Isaac" (verse 11).<a name=185:6></a> This suggests that all promise and blessing is substantiated in Christ, the risen One.<a name=185:7></a> The typical significance of the death of Abraham is that promises give place to the One in whom they are all made good.<a name=185:8></a> We have something more than promise now.<a name=185:9></a> We have every promise of God substantiated; the yea and amen of every promise is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God; positive blessing is in Him, and there is a full revelation of God.<a name=185:10></a> Isaac dwells at Beer-lahai-roi -- the well of the living One who reveals Himself.<a name=185:11></a> The great spring of all blessing is the revelation of God; He is the living One who reveals Himself.<a name=185:12></a> "Thou God seest me" is a solemn truth, but it is a much greater thing for me to see God as revealed in Christ, and that is the thought here.<a name=185:13></a> It is not that He sees me, but that I may see Him as revealed in perfect grace.<a name=185:14></a> Isaac came from this well when Rebecca met him, and he dwelt there; it was the south country; there is plenty of sunshine there!<a name=185:15></a>

		The next thing is that Ishmael dies in the presence of all his brethren.<a name=186:1></a> No doubt Ishmael and his brethren set forth Israel after the flesh; there are twelve princes spoken of here.<a name=186:2></a> There is a day coming when all the legal and servile elements of Israel's relation to God will pass out: that is typified by the death of Ishmael.<a name=186:3></a> We are in the time when the energy of faith casts Ishmael out of the house, because the spirit of sonship alone can have place there; Christ only can have place there.<a name=186:4></a> We are privileged to see now that man in the flesh and under law must pass out; no thought of divine blessing can be introduced on that line.<a name=186:5></a> But the time is coming when Israel will have to see Ishmael die; they will have to learn that blessing must come in on new covenant terms, and in connection with Isaac, and the well of the living One who reveals Himself.<a name=186:6></a> Ishmael is a figure of man as in the flesh and under law, but in connection with Isaac we have the covenant and the well; the springing up of all God can be for man on new covenant terms, and of what man can be for God as blessed in Christ.<a name=186:7></a> What a moment it will be in Israel's history when they discover that as in the flesh and under law they are under death, and that they can only cry out in deep need.<a name=186:8></a> As soon as they do so God will open their eyes and they will see the well.<a name=186:9></a> They will see all divine blessing secured for them in Christ, and through the revelation of God in grace.<a name=186:10></a> They will "change their man", and as God says, "They shall all know me".<a name=186:11></a>

		This chapter gives us the end to which Jacob was all along being led.<a name=213:1></a> The chapters from 29 give his history and experiences in Padan-Aram.<a name=213:2></a> No doubt that history is a type of the position of Israel as away from the land of their inheritance, and without an altar; suffering the consequences of their own conduct, reaping the fruit of their natural character and of their unbelief.<a name=213:3></a> It is a sorrowful and humiliating history on Jacob's side, yet we see Jehovah's faithfulness, and grace, and providential care on the other side.<a name=213:4></a> God does not leave him, but deals with him, and exercises him, and speaks to him, and protects him again and again, until after twenty years he is ready to come to the place of blessing -- Bethel.<a name=213:5></a>

		Jacob is viewed from the outset as representing the elect of God, and I think faith had appeared in him before this, for he desired God's blessing.<a name=214:4></a> There was an exercise of faith that caused him to differ essentially from Esau.<a name=214:5></a> He was typically the elect of God, and his heart was set on the blessing; doubtless with a great mixture of human infirmity, expediency, and unbelief; but there was an element of faith that desired to be in the line of the birthright and blessing.<a name=214:6></a> Esau, on the other hand, had no interest in the birthright; he was profane and afterwards lawless, and in the end we see Edom destroyed for ever.<a name=214:7></a> Jacob's history was very different: it began in God's election, and he pursued the line of faith -- though with a mixture of many motives and things incongruous with faith -- and in the end finished his course as a worshipper.<a name=214:8></a> It is important to see that God was pledged to Jacob from the outset.<a name=214:9></a> The truth of election comes out here; it is a marked feature in connection with Jacob's history.<a name=214:10></a>

		We come now to a deeply interesting type, or rather a series of types, in the history of Joseph.<a name=221:7></a> As we have seen already, Joseph was born of Rachel in Padan-Aram while Jacob was away from his place and his country (chapter 30: 22 - 25).<a name=221:8></a> This seems to speak of the fact that Christ came in at a time when Israel was not really in the possession or enjoyment of the land of their inheritance.<a name=221:9></a> They had lost the kingdom, and, although they were under God's providential care, they were not in possession of the inheritance.<a name=221:10></a> The fact that a remnant of two tribes was in Palestine was owing providentially to the action of a Gentile monarch, and they were there as a subject people to the Roman empire.<a name=221:11></a> The very circumstance which providentially brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem that Christ might be born

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was under such circumstances that Christ came in, and in the subsequent history of Joseph we have a striking series of types which speak of Him as loved and honoured by the Father, but found serving amongst His Jewish brethren, and hated and killed by them, and subsequently exalted amongst the Gentiles.<a name=222:2></a> It is there where, after repentance, they find Him to be their salvation, and are nourished by Him in the best portion He can give.<a name=222:3></a> This is where the Jews have to find Him today; and they do not get Canaan now, but Goshen.<a name=222:4></a> That is, if blessed of God at all they get blessing in the kingdom as it is known today, they get church blessing.<a name=222:5></a> They participate in that greater good which is known now amongst the Gentiles.<a name=222:6></a> So that there is added blessing (Joseph -- he will add) now, though the earthly kingdom and inheritance are not restored to them.<a name=222:7></a> Then, of course, Joseph being made known to his brethren looks on typically to a yet future day when God's distinctive dealings with the Jews will be resumed.<a name=222:8></a>

		Benjamin is Christ viewed from a rather different standpoint.<a name=222:9></a> He is born at the royal city in the land of promise, and thus comes in with all the rights of the kingdom.<a name=222:10></a> But He is the Son of His mother's sorrow, and I think this has in view the cutting off of all the hopes of Israel in His death.<a name=222:11></a> He was cut off and had nothing, and in His cutting off every hope that Israel cherished was forfeited according to the flesh.<a name=222:12></a> The fulfilment of promise was presented in Him to Israel, only to be met by the definite refusal expressed by His rejection and crucifixion.<a name=222:13></a> The godly remnant had to go through the profound sorrow of

		But if He is the Son of His mother's sorrow, He is the Son of His Father's right hand.<a name=223:3></a> He is the Man of God's right hand, made strong for Himself, who will yet deliver Israel from the wild boar of the wood (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>), and set up the kingdom in due time.<a name=223:4></a> But His power is not acting at the present time in any public way for Israel; she has died, as seen typically in Rachel, and Benjamin is hidden, as it were, for the time, at God's right hand.<a name=223:5></a>

		Joseph at the age of seventeen years is found feeding the flock with his brethren, and doing service with them (chapter 37: 2).<a name=223:6></a> But he could have no fellowship with their evil discourse, and he brought to his father an evil report of them.<a name=223:7></a> The true Joseph was ever here in the spirit and activity of service, and Joseph, like other types of Christ, was found feeding the flock, serving in shepherd care.<a name=223:8></a> Moses was a shepherd before he was king in Jeshurun, and David was taken from the sheep-folds "to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance".<a name=223:9></a> It shows that the One who can care for the flock is the One competent to rule; He rules in the spirit of shepherd care, as having established His title by the service of love.<a name=223:10></a>

		But the evil course of those around Him was ever a grief to His spirit; He was wholly apart from it morally.<a name=223:11></a> We see this very plainly in the Psalms personal to Christ, and also in those which give prophetically the utterance of the Spirit of Christ in the remnant; we hear Him speaking to Jehovah with

		In this remarkable prophetic utterance we get a comprehensive view of what has come out, and what will yet come out, in the history of the sons of Jacob.<a name=246:1></a> And their history is really that of man, whether looked at as he is naturally, or as regards the different features that come out in him after the intervention of God in Christ.<a name=246:2></a> For we get that intervention prophetically in this chapter, particularly in connection with Judah and Joseph, and in Benjamin we see a type of the power in which Christ will finally deal with all His enemies.<a name=246:3></a> Moses's blessing in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32">Deuteronomy  32</a>is more on the line of purpose; but here it is lessons learned experimentally in the history of the people.<a name=246:4></a> It is more on the moral line in connection with God's ways.<a name=246:5></a>

		It might be helpful at the outset to see that the chapter is divided into four parts, and that there are three tribes in each part.<a name=246:6></a> In Reuben, Simeon and Levi we get the natural condition of man; it came out in the sons of Jacob, but it is really the natural condition of man.<a name=246:7></a> In Zebulun, Issachar and Dan we see the influences that lead to departure even after God has brought in blessing.<a name=246:8></a> Then in Gad, Asher and Naphtali we see the power and effect of God's salvation as waited for and known by faith when man's state is truly discerned, and also when it is seen how man falls under perverting influences even after Christ is brought in.<a name=246:9></a> The remaining three tribes -- that is, Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin -- speak of Christ in different ways.<a name=246:10></a> The chapter is thus divided very distinctly into four parts, and it contains a great deal of important instruction.<a name=246:11></a>

		Benjamin is spoken of as a ravening wolf (verse 27), because he is a figure of Christ as coming in power to destroy all His enemies, and the enemies of His people Israel.<a name=258:2></a> If He has been rejected, it is inevitable that His enemies must be dealt with.<a name=258:3></a> Joseph gives us a thought of the wonderful character of blessing that is connected with Him as separated from His brethren; that is, while He is at the right hand of God, and the Spirit is given to His co-sufferers and co-heirs.<a name=258:4></a> But Benjamin is Christ coming in to destroy his enemies.<a name=258:5></a> He tears in pieces, devours the prey, and divides the booty.<a name=258:6></a> I have connected it with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80">Psalm  80</a>.<a name=258:7></a> We find Jehovah addressed there as the "Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock".<a name=258:8></a> Then in verse 8 Israel is spoken of as a vine brought out of Egypt and planted by Him.<a name=258:9></a> But in verse 13 the boar out of the forest wastes that vine, and the beast of the field devours it.<a name=258:10></a> Then there is a call in verse 14, "O God of hosts, return, we beseech thee; look down from the heavens, and behold, and visit this vine".<a name=258:11></a> That is the state of things in connection with which Benjamin comes in.<a name=258:12></a> God's vine, His pleasant plant -- Israel -- has been devoured and destroyed by the boar out of the wood and the beast of the field.<a name=258:13></a> Then in verse 17 we get Benjamin, "Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself".<a name=258:14></a> That is Benjamin, the Son of His Father's right hand: He will come in to destroy the boar of the forest and the beast of the field, and to restore the fruitfulness of the vine and

		The time for that has not yet come, so we pray for men -- even wicked men and persecutors -- to be converted and blessed.<a name=259:4></a> But a day is coming when 'sudden destruction' will come on the adversaries, and the saints will be in accord with what God does in that day, even as they are in accord with what He is doing today.<a name=259:5></a> They will say, "Amen, Hallelujah", when Babylon is thrown down, for God will then be acting in destructive judgment.<a name=259:6></a> His arrows will be sharp in the heart of the king's enemies.<a name=259:7></a> If we may use the figure, His arrows are being discharged in grace today.<a name=259:8></a> They carry conviction, but are tipped with healing balm.<a name=259:9></a> They are piercing the joints of the armour of many, bringing down self-importance and leading men to look to Him for blessing, which He never fails to grant.<a name=259:10></a> But by-and-by the arrows will have another character; they will be discharged on His enemies who will fall under Him in destruction.<a name=259:11></a> It must be so; divine power must intervene; a world of rebellion and lawlessness cannot be perpetuated.<a name=259:12></a> God's claims are set at defiance, and His Name covered with blasphemies all the day long.<a name=259:13></a> He could not allow it to continue; there will come a time when divine power must assert itself, However great God's patience and long-suffering, He is never indifferent to evil.<a name=259:14></a> He bears long, but there is always a limit.<a name=259:15></a> Methuselah lived very long as a witness to the long-suffering of God; but when the limit was reached God intervened

		Now for a moment we may touch on the last chapter.<a name=260:3></a> The coming in of Christ in the Benjamin character which we have spoken of clears the way for the fulfilment of all God's promises in reference to the land of promise; so the book closes with the faith of Jacob and Joseph in regard to Canaan.<a name=260:4></a> Jacob would be buried there with his fathers, and Joseph would have his bones carried there.<a name=260:5></a> This indicates the faith of these two men as to the fulfilment of all God's promises in regard to the land.<a name=260:6></a> After Benjamin comes in, and the adversaries are all dealt with, there will be deliverance in Zion, and all the promises in relation to Israel's possession of Canaan will be fulfilled.<a name=260:7></a>
