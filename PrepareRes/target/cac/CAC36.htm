		REMARKS ON A PAMPHLET BY A. J. POLLOCK ENTITLED THE ETERNAL SON
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no wish to enter into controversy on the great and holy subject of which this pamphlet treats, but a public charge of serious evil in doctrine concerning the Person of Christ, brought against certain brethren, puts upon all to whom it comes the responsibility of enquiring whether the charge of "levity", "folly", and "blasphemous", as applied to certain teaching, can be substantiated.<a name=3:1></a> "Thou shalt not accept a false report".<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let it be distinctly understood, at the outset, that the subject under consideration is not the eternal Personality of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<a name=3:3></a> Scripture makes clear that His Person is eternal and changeless, whether as in the form of God in the past eternity, or as come in flesh, or as glorified as Man at God's right hand, or as the subject Son in eternity to come.<a name=3:4></a> He is

		for ever "THE SAME" -- a Divine title conveying the thought of eternal immutability.<a name=4:1></a> He was God, and was with God, from eternity; He subsisted in the form of God; He was "I AM".<a name=4:2></a> His "goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity" (<a href="../bible/Micah.htm#1:2">Micah  1:2</a>).<a name=4:3></a> There is no question at issue as to this.<a name=4:4></a> Our present subject of enquiry is as to the conditions and relations in which the title SON is applied to our Lord in Scripture.<a name=4:5></a> Does Scripture apply the title SON to Him as in the form of God in the past eternity?<a name=4:6></a> Will the reader please note carefully that <i>this</i> is the subject of consideration.<a name=4:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The readers of Mr.<a name=4:8></a> P.<a name=4:9></a>'s pamphlet are told (page 8) that certain teaching (contained, as the "Foreword" to the pamphlet informs them, in the published notes of readings at Barnet in June, 1929) "means" that the Three Persons in the Godhead "are not distinguished for us in Scripture, and their relationship One to the Other is unrevealed".<a name=4:10></a> The readers are expected to accept this astounding statement without question, on the sole ground that Mr.<a name=4:11></a> P.<a name=4:12></a> says it is so.<a name=4:13></a> For no evidence is produced to show that any one, either at Barnet or elsewhere, has given expression to such a foolish and unscriptural thought.<a name=4:14></a> The simplest reader

		of the Bible knows that it does carefully distinguish the Persons of the Godhead, both as known now, and as in the past eternity.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In keeping with the above statement there is a note at the bottom of the same page referring to the heretic Sabellius, and asserting that the teaching in the Barnet Notes is "pretty close to Sabellianism".<a name=5:2></a> Such a charge may have weight with persons who neither know what Sabellius taught nor what is held by the brethren to whom Mr.<a name=5:3></a> P.<a name=5:4></a> refers, but it will mislead no one else.<a name=5:5></a> Sabellius denied the Trinity; he refused the truth that there are Three distinct Personalities in the Godhead.<a name=5:6></a> The charge of Sabellianism, or approximation to that heresy, as brought against the brethren who were at Barnet in June, 1929, is so utterly groundless that it could only be honestly brought by one who did not know what he was writing about.<a name=5:7></a> I am sorry that Mr.<a name=5:8></a> P.<a name=5:9></a> has permitted himself to give wide publicity to such a grave charge against brethren in the Lord.<a name=5:10></a> There is ample proof in the Barnet Notes, which Mr.<a name=5:11></a> P.<a name=5:12></a> had read, -- to say nothing of much other printed ministry of the same brethren -- that the charge is wholly false.<a name=5:13></a> Such statements

		On page 13 of the pamphlet we come to the "proof texts" which Mr.<a name=6:2></a> P.<a name=6:3></a> says "directly affirm the truth of the eternal Sonship of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=6:4></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:17">John  3:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>; and <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:36">John  10:36</a> are quoted.<a name=6:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That the Lord was here as the Sent One is oft-repeated in John's Gospel; indeed the word "sent" is a characteristic word of that Gospel, occurring many times.<a name=6:6></a> But it will be obvious to any careful reader that Scripture does not speak of the Lord as "sent" until He was actually here.<a name=6:7></a> Even such prophetic scriptures as <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:19">Isaiah  42:19</a>; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61:1">Isaiah  61:1</a> manifestly refer to Him as here.<a name=6:8></a> Let any reader look at the scriptures which speak of the Lord as being "sent", and ask himself if there is one of them that could apply to Him <i>before</i> He was actually here?<a name=6:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory of the Lord's eternal Person appears in a wonderful way in John's Gospel, perhaps more fully than anywhere else.<a name=6:10></a> Our spirits are impressed, as we read that Gospel, by many statements which bring out the Personal greatness and glory of the Sent One.<a name=6:11></a> "He who comes from above is above all.<a name=6:12></a>.<a name=6:13></a>.<a name=6:14></a> He who comes out of heaven is above all" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:31">John  3:31</a>).<a name=6:15></a> "My Father worketh

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as we have already said, He is often spoken of in John's Gospel as the SENT ONE, and this is clearly a mediatorial designation.<a name=7:12></a> The word "sent" implies a relative position which is not one of absolute equality.<a name=7:13></a> It implies authority on the part of the sender,

		subjection on the part of the one "sent".<a name=8:1></a> In the past eternity the glory of Divine Persons was equal, Their majesty co-eternal.<a name=8:2></a> To think of our Lord as in Deity in the past eternity being in a place of subjection is derogatory to Him.<a name=8:3></a> It is assigning to Him an inferior or subordinate place in Deity, and this is not only contrary to Scripture, but it is inconceivable to any one who believes in His true and full Deity.<a name=8:4></a> In eternal Deity He was on absolute equality with the Other Persons of the Godhead.<a name=8:5></a> But as the SENT ONE He was under authority; He was in a subordinate relation to the One who sent Him.<a name=8:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Shall we be told, as Mr.<a name=8:7></a> P.<a name=8:8></a> suggests on page 13 of his pamphlet, that this is a "gloss" upon Scripture?<a name=8:9></a> Are the words of the Son of God in this very Gospel a "gloss"?<a name=8:10></a> Did He not say Himself, "Verily, verify, I say to you, The bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:16">John  13:16</a>).<a name=8:11></a> There is correspondence between the relations in which the bondman stands to his lord and those in which the sent one stands to the sender.<a name=8:12></a> If we do not clearly distinguish between the mediatorial glory of the Lord as the Sent One and the glory proper to His

	<div class="paragraph">
		Person as in Deity from eternity we shall lose something of the true character of both.<a name=9:1></a> His mediatorial glory derives its lustre from His Personal glory, but to make His mediatorial glory the full measure of His Personal glory is really derogatory to Him.<a name=9:2></a> He was here as the Sent One to do the will of the One who sent Him.<a name=9:3></a> He disclaimed coming of Himself; He was the obedient One, carrying out His God-appointed mission here.<a name=9:4></a> The very word "sent" indicates His mediatorial place as in Manhood.<a name=9:5></a> How we delight to look upon Him and recognize Him as the Father's Sent One, the God-given Object of faith for "whosoever"!<a name=9:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we contemplate the Son of God in His mediatorial position the more shall we perceive the infinitude and blessedness of the love of God expressed in the gift of such a Person.<a name=10:5></a> He has come within the range of men's apprehension as given by God in love to the world (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>).<a name=10:6></a> Nothing else could account for His being here.<a name=10:7></a> And inasmuch as men were sinners and under death He did not stop short of laying down His life for us.<a name=10:8></a> Love would have been ineffective if He had not done so, and this could not be when the love was GOD'S love.<a name=10:9></a> "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<a name=10:10></a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>,10).<a name=10:11></a> Our hearts engage themselves believingly and adoringly with the glorious Person of the Son of God; we view Him in holy Manhood, and going

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Does this in any way obscure the thought of God giving and sending His Son?<a name=11:6></a> On the contrary, it brings out fully the wondrous and blessed fact that the love of God is made known to men in the only way in which it could be made known, that is, mediatorially in His beloved Son as Man on earth.<a name=11:7></a> The whole point of the statements of Scripture is to show that the love of God has come into tangible expression.<a name=11:8></a> It has been <i>manifested</i>.<a name=11:9></a> It could not be known by something taking place in the inscrutable depths of Deity, but it was known by the gift, mission and death of the Son of God.<a name=11:10></a> He was in the presence of Nicodemus when He spoke of Himself as given by God in love; He was before men's eyes all through John's Gospel as the Sent One.<a name=11:11></a> He was here by the
