		THE KNOWLEDGE OF GRACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to say a little about the knowledge of grace.<a name=5:1></a> It is a great object with God to build up the knowledge of His grace in our souls, and this work of God is often presented to our minds in Scripture under the figure of a structure.<a name=5:2></a> The familiar words "edify" and "edification" suggest the thought of a building -- a structure in the soul.<a name=5:3></a> We read of being "built up" and of "building up" ourselves, and so on.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a fact that a wonderful work is being carded on by God in the souls of His people.<a name=5:5></a> God is building up in human hearts the knowledge of Himself in His own infinite and blessed grace.<a name=5:6></a> And it is of vital moment that we should know what God is working for, and that we should not hinder His work either in ourselves or in others.<a name=5:7></a> There is a solemn word in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:19">Romans  14:19</a>, 20 as to this.<a name=5:8></a>.<a name=5:9></a> "Let us, therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.<a name=5:10></a> For meat destroy not the work of God".<a name=5:11></a> Edification is "the work of God", and it is a very solemn thing to hinder or destroy it.<a name=5:12></a> That which is built up in the souls of God's children is the knowledge of Himself and His infinite grace.<a name=5:13></a> I hope to he enabled to present this to You from the chapter we have read.<a name=5:14></a> But it will he necessary first of all to clear the ground a little.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If a structure of any importance or magnitude is to be reared, the first essential is a good foundation, and to secure that it is necessary that everything that is worthless or unstable should he cleared away.<a name=5:16></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes!<a name=6:9></a> this is the solemn truth.<a name=6:10></a> Whether man appears in open profligacy, or in the guise of a moralist, or invested with high religious privileges or pretensions, he is the same naked exposed sinner before the eye of God, and the heart-knowing God pronounces that "there is no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God".<a name=6:11></a> Such is man -- the child of Adam.<a name=6:12></a> He is corrupt and condemned, and must he removed in judgment if God's thoughts of blessing are to take effect.<a name=6:13></a> The ground must be cleared.<a name=6:14></a>

		If souls honestly faced this at the outset, they would escape many subsequent exercises and difficulties.<a name=7:1></a> They would secure a good foundation, for they would get down to what builders in some parts of the country call the "bed-rock".<a name=7:2></a> They would come to realise the meaning and value of the death of Christ as that in which the righteousness of God is declared, and as that which alone clears the ground for the blessing of man.<a name=7:3></a> The death of Christ has cleared the ground.<a name=7:4></a> He has died for all, and this is the most solemn testimony that all were under death as the judgment of God.<a name=7:5></a> But this has been made known in grace.<a name=7:6></a> The terribleness of man's condition, and of the judgment under which he lies, has been set forth in the way of infinite grace in the death of Christ.<a name=7:7></a> For He has come under our judgment in perfect grace that the ground might be cleared for our blessing.<a name=7:8></a> It is not that we deserve a thousand stripes and that Christ has borne them.<a name=7:9></a> The truth goes far deeper than this.<a name=7:10></a> We were condemned to <i>death</i>.<a name=7:11></a> Tie extreme penalty had passed upon us.<a name=7:12></a> The vilest sinner on earth cannot go beyond this, and the most moral and religious man that ever lived cannot stop short of it, or evade it.<a name=7:13></a> Death is upon us as the judgment of God, and if we are to he blessed the ground must he cleared by death.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That this is unspeakably solemn would not be questioned by any right-minded person, but at the same time it is most blessed to see that God has Himself cleared the ground.<a name=7:15></a> In the death of Christ we see the sentence executed in such a way that, while the righteousness of God is most completely declared, the ground is perfectly cleared for the blessing of man.<a name=7:16></a> The death of Christ is the "bed-rock".<a name=7:17></a> It is that on which the whole structure of grace and glory can he securely reared, for it is that in which everything unsuited to God has been removed in righteous judgment.<a name=7:18></a> I recognise that I am under the sentence of

		death, but "through faith" I know that the sentence has been executed in the way of infinite grace.<a name=8:1></a> There never was such an exhibition of grace as when Jesus tasted "death for every man".<a name=8:2></a> If you how to the truth you must own that God has searched you, and that you justly lie under sentence of death.<a name=8:3></a> But then you learn the grace of God in the wondrous fact that Christ has died for you.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ground was cleared for God when Christ died, and we apprehend it by faith.<a name=8:5></a> The young convert who exclaims, in words which have just acquired meaning and power in his soul, "Jesus died for me", is coming to the apprehension that the ground is cleared.<a name=8:6></a> When a man gives himself up as lost and condemned, and realises that nothing will meet his case but the death of Christ, the ground is cleared in the apprehension of his soul.<a name=8:7></a> He thinks no longer of good self or bad self -- the death of Christ is his only hope.<a name=8:8></a> He finds the true expression of his heart in such words as --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>"just as I am, without one plea, <br>But that Thy blood was shed for me, <br>And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee; <br>O Lamb of God, I come".<a name=8:10></a><a name=8:9></a> (<a href=".<a name=8:11></a>.<a name=8:12></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=8:13></a>htm#446:1">Hymn 446</a>)</blockquote>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Where this is truly the heart's language the ground is cleared of self-confidence and self-righteousness, and God can proceed with His blessed work of building up the knowledge of His grace in the soul.<a name=8:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The grace of God is all administered "through our Lord Jesus Christ", and we can learn it and have it built up in our souls as <i>He</i> is before us.<a name=8:15></a> He not only administrates the grace of God, but it is all set forth in Him.<a name=8:16></a> If we have bowed to the solemn truth that we are guilty and condemned, and have realised that nothing but the death of Christ could shelter us from the just judgment of a holy God, we have thought long

		I should like to borrow an illustration from the Old
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Testament in connection with the building of the temple, but I only refer to it as an illustration and not in the way of interpretation.<a name=9:11></a> "And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a>.<a name=9:14></a>.<a name=9:15></a> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any toot of iron heard in the house, while it was in building .<a name=9:16></a>.<a name=9:17></a>.<a name=9:18></a> So he built the house, and finished it" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#5:17">1 Kings  5:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#6:7">1 Kings  6:7</a>, 9).<a name=9:19></a> I think these stones may illustrate the greatness, preciousness, and divine suitability of Christ as the One in whom all the thoughts of God's grace are established and set forth .<a name=9:20></a> And God would lay this

	<div class="paragraph">
		down in the apprehension of our souls as a divine basis upon which the whole superstructure of the knowledge of His grace might be reared.<a name=10:1></a> "I have laid the foundation", says the apostle to his Corinthian children in the faith, "and another buildeth thereon.<a name=10:2></a> But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<a name=10:3></a> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ".<a name=10:4></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:10">1 Corinthians  3:10</a>, 11).<a name=10:5></a> The foundation had been well and truly laid at Corinth, but there were those who were building worthless material upon it -- who were occupying the saints with what was of man, and thus hindering the work of God in their souls.<a name=10:6></a> The whole structure must correspond with the foundation.<a name=10:7></a> If the foundation is of God the super-structure must also be of God; if the foundation is "Jesus Christ" the whole building must be of the same material.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no human effort or noise connected with true edification; all is the quiet and blessed work of God by His Spirit.<a name=10:9></a> But there is need of exercise on our part lest we hinder and grieve the Spirit and stay His work.<a name=10:10></a> We are in danger of being like the people in Haggai's day, who said, "The time is not come, the time that the Lord's house should be built", but who were dwelling in their own "ceiled houses".<a name=10:11></a> That is, we may put our own things in the first place, and if we do they will soon shut out God's things.<a name=10:12></a> Many a man makes his spiritual interests secondary to his business interests, and the result is soul-starvation.<a name=10:13></a>

		"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a>).<a name=10:14></a> We have not peace with God through feeling happy, or through having lived a holy life, or through being obedient.<a name=10:15></a> But we believe on God as the One who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead for our justification, and we have peace with Him through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=10:16></a> We apprehend the Lord Jesus

		Then through our Lord Jesus Christ "we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:2">Romans  5:2</a>).<a name=11:5></a> The favour in which we stand can only be measured by Christ.<a name=11:6></a> He has become Man, and through death and resurrection He has reached the right hand of God in unbounded favour and acceptance.<a name=11:7></a> We can say of Him, "Behold, O God, our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84:9">Psalm  84:9</a>).<a name=11:8></a> Death has passed upon us; we, as in the flesh, have gone from God's sight in the death of Christ, that we might be in the favour of God according to the perfection of Christ.<a name=11:9></a> So that if we wish to know the favour in which we stand we must learn the preciousness of Christ -- the beauty and acceptance of God's Anointed.<a name=11:10></a> Our history as children of Adam -- the dark pages of which were filled with sins, imperfections, and inconsistencies -- has been closed in Christ's death.<a name=11:11></a> And a new volume is now opened before our faith in which every page records the perfections of Christ, and the blessedness of God's favour through Him.<a name=11:12></a> God would have our souls filled with a sense of this favour in His presence.<a name=11:13></a> When that blessed One was here a voice from the opened heaven declared, "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=11:14></a> The Father could look down upon Him with inexpressible delight.<a name=11:15></a> And now that He is risen and glorified the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has "made us accepted in the beloved" to the praise of the glory of His grace.<a name=11:16></a> He has marked us out for sonship through

		Nothing can separate the believer from the love of God, and under no circumstances whatever can he come under an infliction of wrath from God.<a name=12:11></a> God may have to correct His saints for their sins, and where there has been no failure He may chasten them for their profit, that they may become partakers of His holiness; but all this is in love, not in wrath.<a name=12:12></a> The Corinthians had been behaving badly, and yet the salutation addressed to them was, "Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:3">1 Corinthians  1:3</a>).<a name=12:13></a> There is ever grace and peace from God towards His saints.<a name=12:14></a> Even to Laodicea the Lord says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:19">Revelation  3:19</a>).<a name=12:15></a> Every action of God toward His saints is in grace and blessing; it is ever

		"We also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:11">Romans  5:11</a>).<a name=13:3></a> There can be nothing greater than this.<a name=13:4></a> Everything that God is has come out through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=13:5></a> We may see something of God's power and wisdom in creation, and many of His moral perfections come out in connection with the law and the prophets, but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ that the full glory of all His attributes and the blessedness of His nature has been revealed.<a name=13:6></a> And to the saint everything that is made known of God is a source of satisfaction and joy.<a name=13:7></a> Through grace the saint appreciates God.<a name=13:8></a> The psalmist said, "Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#43:4">Psalm  43:4</a>).<a name=13:9></a> He thought of going to God much as a schoolboy would think of going home for the holidays.<a name=13:10></a> How much more can <i>we</i> make our boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ!<a name=13:11></a> One could say --

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, it is by the Lord Jesus Christ that we have now received the reconciliation.<a name=13:14></a> When all the blessedness of God has been brought to light, we could not be happy without suitability to Him.<a name=13:15></a> We may see an illustration of this in the case of the prodigal.<a name=13:16></a> When his father kissed him there was clearly nothing between them.<a name=13:17></a> The full grace of his father was made known to him.<a name=13:18></a> But this in itself did not give him

		If we make our boast in God as having manifested Himself to us in full grace and blessing through our Lord Jesus Christ, we have also the consciousness of receiving the reconciliation through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=14:6></a> We are not only kissed, but the best robe is put upon us.<a name=14:7></a>

		Everything that is not Christ belongs to the "old things" which have been touched by sin.<a name=14:8></a> "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature [or, there is a new creation]: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<a name=14:9></a> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a>, 18).<a name=14:10></a> As made the righteousness of God in Christ, the joy of reconciliation is ours.<a name=14:11></a> But if we accept that Christ alone is our suitability for God's presence, it commits us to the practical refusal of everything that is not Christ.<a name=14:12></a> There can he no allowance of the flesh.<a name=14:13></a> The soul who has truly apprehended reconciliation sees that Christ is everything and in all.<a name=14:14></a> Everything that is not Christ is displaced in the estimation of his heart.<a name=14:15></a>

		I have, read these scriptures to bring before you three things of great importance.<a name=15:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>we see that Abraham's faith was counted to him for righteousness.<a name=15:2></a> And "it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed [or counted] to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed [or counted], if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=15:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 5: 19 we read, "For as by one man's disobedience many were made [or constituted] sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made [or constituted] righteous".<a name=15:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 6: 12 - 14 brings before us the practical righteousness of the believer.<a name=15:5></a> He yields himself to God as alive from the dead, and his members as instruments of righteousness unto God.<a name=15:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that three things are before us: (1) The believer's faith is counted to him for righteousness; (2) he is constituted righteous; and (3) he becomes practically righteous, not as under the law, but as under grace.<a name=15:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To reach the first we have to come to the point that we are as good as dead.<a name=15:8></a> Abraham was "as good as dead" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:12">Hebrews  11:12</a>) when he became the father of Isaac according to God's promise.<a name=15:9></a> God said to him that his seed should be "as the stars of the sky in multitude" when, according to nature, he was beyond the possibility of having seed.<a name=15:10></a> Abraham did not consider himself, or the natural circumstances; he well knew that it was "God, who quickeneth the dead", who alone could effect what was promised.<a name=15:11></a> He "believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:3">Romans  4:3</a>).<a name=15:12></a>

		We have to come to this point, that we cannot move hand or foot in the matter of our justification.<a name=16:1></a> We are guilty before God, and as helpless to clear ourselves as if we were dead.<a name=16:2></a> An old believer told me that for years she had prayed and devoted herself to an earnest religious life in hope of getting the assurance of forgiveness some day.<a name=16:3></a> But this did not bring the desired blessing, and eventually she became conscious that she was as helpless in the matter as if her head had been struck off on the executioner's block.<a name=16:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Have you ever put your head down on the block?<a name=16:5></a> The moment you do so, God points you to One who came under the stroke of justice for you.<a name=16:6></a> One who was "delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=16:7></a> A person with his head upon the block gives up considering himself, and he begins to consider God.<a name=16:8></a> As long as we are trying and striving it is clear that we have not laid our heads on the block.<a name=16:9></a> We have not found out that we are "as good as dead".<a name=16:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I ask your attention to four things which are made known as to God.<a name=16:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, He has shewn forth His <i>righteousness</i>.<a name=16:12></a> He has set forth Christ Jesus "a propitiation [or, mercy-seat] through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a>, 26).<a name=16:13></a> God has maintained everything that was due to Himself in relation to sin and sins.<a name=16:14></a> The blood of Christ is the witness that He has died for sins, and as made sin for us.<a name=16:15></a> It was right that sins should be visited with their due reward, and that judgment should come upon sin.<a name=16:16></a> It was right that the sentence of death should he executed on man the sinner.<a name=16:17></a> It was also right that God should shew Himself superior to all the power of evil, and able to justify the ungodly in a

		<a name=17>[Page 17]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		way worthy of Himself.<a name=17:1></a> And all this is shewn forth in the death of Christ.<a name=17:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Did God pass by the sins of men in times before the cross?<a name=17:3></a> Then the blood of Christ shews forth His righteousness in doing so.<a name=17:4></a> Is God now just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus?<a name=17:5></a> The same precious blood shews forth His righteousness as to this also.<a name=17:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, God's <i>love</i> is commanded "toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:8">Romans  5:8</a>).<a name=17:7></a> There are three persons mentioned in verses 7 and 8: the righteous man, the good man, and the sinner.<a name=17:8></a> The righteous man pays twenty shillings in the pound, and will have twenty shillings in the pound from others.<a name=17:9></a> It is hardly possible that anyone would die for him.<a name=17:10></a> The good man is marked by benevolence, and gracious consideration for others.<a name=17:11></a> Perhaps someone might be found to die for him.<a name=17:12></a> But who would die for one whose only characteristic is that he is a <i>sinner</i>?<a name=17:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in the fact that Christ has died for us when sinners that God commends to us a love peculiar to Himself.<a name=17:14></a> For love like this cannot he found in any creature.<a name=17:15></a> Human love is often used as an illustration of divine love, but in truth human illustrations utterly fail to set forth the quality and character of God's love.<a name=17:16></a> To apprehend that love one must realise the relative positions of God and His creature man; one must take into account what sin is before God and the state into which it has brought man; one must see the greatness of the blessed Person, who came here in flesh that He might die for ungodly sinners.<a name=17:17></a> Christ has come under all that to which we were liable that the love of God might reach us in blessing, and His death is the commendation of that love to us.<a name=17:18></a> Love has expressed itself in the utmost self-sacrifice, and this in a divine Person who has died to remove from before God in

		judgment all that we were as sinners.<a name=18:1></a> Who would not praise this perfect and holy love?<a name=18:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third, God's <i>power</i> is displayed in the fact that He has raised Jesus our Lord from among the dead (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:24">Romans  4:24</a>).<a name=18:3></a> Death having come in by man's sin, and having passed upon all men for that all have sinned, it became the terrible witness of man's state, and of his utter helplessness in presence of that power of evil which had brought destruction upon him.<a name=18:4></a> But where man was impotent and resourceless God has shewn Himself in supreme might, and in wisdom that no power of evil could baffle.<a name=18:5></a> Christ has come in perfect goodness into death on man's behalf, and God has raised Him from among the dead.<a name=18:6></a> Thus death has been annulled, and the power of God displayed in perfect goodness toward man.<a name=18:7></a> Death coming upon God's creature seemed to say that evil had prevailed over good, but when the Son of God comes into death on man's behalf, and God raises Him from among the dead, it becomes manifest that good is mightier than evil, and God is known in the power of resurrection.<a name=18:8></a> We are probably so accustomed to hear of the resurrection of Christ that our minds do not consider the greatness of the power displayed therein.<a name=18:9></a> Men have wonderful powers and resources within a certain sphere, but where are all men's powers in presence of death?<a name=18:10></a> If the science, wealth, and force of the whole world are viewed in relation to death, they are so utterly powerless as not to he worth a thought.<a name=18:11></a> Yet men think much of their powers, and very little of that wondrous power in which God has raised from among the dead the One who came there on man's behalf!<a name=18:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourth, God has made known His <i>grace</i>; He has manifested Himself in the most unmistakable way as a Saviour God.<a name=18:13></a> This is the attitude in which He stands towards men.<a name=18:14></a> He is just and the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus; He justifies the ungodly.<a name=18:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=19>[Page 19]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a man believes on God in this character, as the One who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, his faith is counted to him as righteousness.<a name=19:1></a> It is not that we believe something about ourselves, but we believe on God who has made Himself known by the Lord Jesus Christ in righteousness, love, power, and grace as a Saviour God.<a name=19:2></a> Many have not peace with God because they want to have some evidence of blessing in themselves.<a name=19:3></a> One day they think they may he God's children, and the next they are in the dungeons of Doubting Castle.<a name=19:4></a> They say, We must be humble; we must take a low place; we must not be presumptuous!<a name=19:5></a> When people talk like that you may depend on it they have not laid their heads on the block.<a name=19:6></a> They are considering themselves.<a name=19:7></a> They have not really learned their own worthlessness, or they would be glad to turn from themselves to the Saviour God.<a name=19:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is the believer's righteousness.<a name=19:9></a> God would not give less and He could not give more.<a name=19:10></a> The true humility of faith is to accept the fulness of grace in which God makes Christ to be righteousness for every one that believeth.<a name=19:11></a> We are worthless sinners, but God has approached us in grace that is worthy of Himself.<a name=19:12></a> The true humility of a repentant sinner is to receive with profound thankfulness the riches of grace which are made known in the gospel.<a name=19:13></a> What would be thought of a man who, having been invited to dine with the King, continually protested that he was a very humble individual, and not worthy to receive such good things, and on this ground declined to partake of what was provided for him?<a name=19:14></a> Would it not be said that he was wanting in humility, and in the feelings proper in a subject towards his sovereign?<a name=19:15></a> And in man as a creature of God -- a sinful creature too -- it is true humility to receive by faith the full grace in which God has made Himself known.<a name=19:16></a> It is thus that we honour God.<a name=19:17></a> The falsely-called humility

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which refuses to accept the riches of God's grace on account of its own unworthiness is really self-importance which puts a slight upon God.<a name=20:1></a> God's grace is set forth in Christ, and He becomes the righteousness of those who believe.<a name=20:2></a> May it be ours to cast every doubt to the winds, and to constantly sound forth the praise of grace so infinitely rich, so absolutely free!<a name=20:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:19">Romans  5:19</a> we come to a further point.<a name=20:4></a> "For as by one man's disobedience many were made [or constituted] sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made [or constituted] righteous".<a name=20:5></a> This is evidently a step further than faith being counted to us as righteousness.<a name=20:6></a> We had to begin with that -- to receive the gift of righteousness by faith -- but that was in order to set us free to "follow after righteousness" and to learn righteousness so as to he formed in moral suitability to God.<a name=20:7></a> A man would hardly he fit to go to court unless he had court manners.<a name=20:8></a> It would he a strange thing to see a man in court dress, but with the mind and manners of a ploughboy!<a name=20:9></a> Many a believer feels assured that every question is settled, and that Christ is his righteousness, who is not much formed in mind and affection in accord with God.<a name=20:10></a> He has court dress, but he is not yet instructed in court manners!<a name=20:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The teaching of grace inclines our hearts to "follow after righteousness" and to "seek the Lord"; it awakens the desire to "know righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51:1">Isaiah  51:1</a>, 7).<a name=20:12></a> We become such as "do hunger and thirst after righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:6">Matthew  5:6</a>).<a name=20:13></a> The effect of grace being known is to make us long to he in moral accord with God, and this prepares us to see that God has set forth righteousness in the fullest way, so that we might learn it and he formed in it.<a name=20:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:18">Romans  5:18</a> we read of "one offence towards all men to condemnation", and of "one righteousness towards all men for justification of life".<a name=20:15></a> Adam's one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		offence was towards all men to condemnation, but Christ's own righteousness is towards all men for justification of life.<a name=21:1></a> The "one righteousness", as I understand it, refers to what He accomplished on the cross when all that had come in by Adam -- sins, sin, condemnation, and death -- was dealt with in holy judgment, and man in the flesh (to whom these things attached) was removed sacrificially from before God.<a name=21:2></a> In this wondrous work there has been a perfect setting forth of righteousness.<a name=21:3></a> Men may not perceive it -- they may be indifferent to it -- but righteousness has been set forth towards all men.<a name=21:4></a> The death of Christ is the great and solemn act in which God has set righteousness forth towards all men.<a name=21:5></a> Have we known what it was to sit down in the presence of that "one righteousness" and learn what it means?<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The man of the world will not accept that he is under condemnation, root and branch.<a name=21:7></a> He will not admit that his goodness and religion avail nothing before God.<a name=21:8></a> If you tell him so he regards it as the most UNrighteous thing he ever heard of.<a name=21:9></a> He will not learn righteousness, nor submit to it, because it makes nothing of him but a lost and condemned sinner.<a name=21:10></a> But God has set righteousness forth in the death of Christ, and the believer learns it and submits to it.<a name=21:11></a> In presence of that death we realise that man in the flesh is rejected by God; we see that all that we are, morally is under judgment, and has been set aside in the death of Christ.<a name=21:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this is the negative side of righteousness; the positive side comes in when we think of "the obedience of the one".<a name=21:13></a> It is not only that Christ has removed sinful flesh by His death to the glory of God, but in that act all His own moral perfection in obedience has come into view.<a name=21:14></a> We see Man devoted in love to the will of God; we see One who could and did maintain everything for God's good pleasure at all

		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:2">Matthew  5:2</a> - 11 gives us a suggestive epitome of the characteristics of those who are constituted righteous.<a name=22:10></a> It is not what they do, but what they are and what they suffer.<a name=22:11></a> The unconverted man can go a long way in imitating good works, but he cannot produce in himself this entirely new moral character.<a name=22:12></a> It can only be formed in us as we feed upon Christ.<a name=22:13></a> The blood was for shelter from judgment, but the lamb roast with fire was for food.<a name=22:14></a> We must feed upon Him in order to be formed after Him.<a name=22:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God brings us to see that all that we are as in the flesh must go in judgment.<a name=22:16></a> Then He forms our souls in the appreciation of all that moral perfection which has been set forth in Christ, and of which the beatitudes speak.<a name=22:17></a> We thus learn righteousness; we learn it in Christ and by the cross; we get a new and divine estimate of everything; we are "constituted righteous".<a name=22:18></a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we get the practical result.<a name=22:19></a> In the first place we are able to speak of "our old man" as having been crucified with Christ.<a name=22:20></a> Everything that constituted our life morally according to the flesh is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The totality of sin is found in the life of "our old man", but in the light of the cross we look upon that life as a condemned thing, not to be gratified or ministered to in any way.<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I often think of Mephibosheth as illustrating this.<a name=23:5></a> Ziba said of him, "Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father".<a name=23:6></a> But was it so?<a name=23:7></a> Not at all.<a name=23:8></a> When he met David he said, "For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did cat at thine own table".<a name=23:9></a> He recognised the fact that as of the house of Saul he was a dead man.<a name=23:10></a> He wanted no exaltation or gratification as of that house.<a name=23:11></a> If we recognise that as Adam's children we are dead men we shall not want the pleasures, honours, and gratifications that the world can offer.<a name=23:12></a> In this way we come to take account of ourselves as dead to sin.<a name=23:13></a> The actings of our own will do not yield us pleasure; we find the life of our hearts in another system of things altogether.<a name=23:14></a> Whatever Mephibosheth esteemed to be life was connected with David; all connected with the house of Saul was death.<a name=23:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, the believer is brought to partake of the abundance of grace on David's table.<a name=23:16></a> Our hearts live in that which has been administered to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=23:17></a> The practical outcome of all this is that we do not let sin reign in our mortal body.<a name=23:18></a> Sin is there, but it is dethroned.<a name=23:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 13 we read, "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield ourselves unto God, as those that are alive

	<div class="paragraph">
		from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God".<a name=24:1></a> The thought suggested by this verse is full of moral beauty.<a name=24:2></a> Our members were once instruments of unrighteousness through which the horrid discord of sin found expression, but now they are to be yielded unto God as brought into harmony with His will.<a name=24:3></a> To be yielded to God as those who have been brought, through grace, into subjection to Him, is practical righteousness.<a name=24:4></a> We are then in our right place in relation to God, and the effect of this must be to adjust and regulate our behaviour in every relationship and responsibility in which we are set by His will.<a name=24:5></a> Our members become "instruments of righteousness unto God".<a name=24:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I should like to read two scriptures in connection with this.<a name=24:7></a> "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:11">Titus  2:11</a> - 14).<a name=24:8></a> "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23:3">Psalm  23:3</a>).<a name=24:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Grace teaches us to live "righteously" in this present world, and the Shepherd leads us in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.<a name=24:10></a> The honour of His name is bound up with His saints.<a name=24:11></a> In the tabernacle there were 280 cubits of beautiful curtains within, and 280 cubits of white linen around the court.<a name=24:12></a> This seems to suggest that while we are invested with the beauty of Christ before the eye of God, we are also called to display His moral excellence in testimony here.<a name=24:13></a> May it be so increasingly with each one of us!<a name=24:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		precious things spoken of in this chapter.<a name=25:1></a> I desire now to bring before you the end which God has in view in making known His grace to us.<a name=25:2></a> We are told that, "they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ".<a name=25:3></a> Then again, in the last verse of the chapter, we read of grace reigning "through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=25:4></a> It seems to me that these two statements give us the end towards which grace works, viz.<a name=25:5></a> that believers should reign in life, and be brought into eternal life.<a name=25:6></a> I hope to he able to set before you, in some measure, what is conveyed by these statements.<a name=25:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must, in the first place, dwell a little on the blessedness of the grace that has reached us.<a name=25:8></a> This grace may be divided into two parts: (1) that which meets our need as sinners, and (2) that which enriches us with spiritual blessing in the favour of God.<a name=25:9></a> The "gift of righteousness" meets and settles everything connected with our guilty state as sinners.<a name=25:10></a> Then the "abundance of grace" is the excess of God's rich bounty which goes far beyond the meeting of our need.<a name=25:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may see these two things, in picture, in connection with the Queen of Sheba.<a name=25:12></a> In coming to Solomon she first got her need met -- her hard questions answered, and all her desires gratified.<a name=25:13></a> But there was an excess above all this which "Solomon gave her of his royal bounty" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#10:13">1 Kings  10:13</a>).<a name=25:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Man's terrible state as a lost sinner is graphically described by Jehovah's words through the prophet Jeremiah: "For thus saith the Lord, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.<a name=26:5></a> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines .<a name=26:6></a>.<a name=26:7></a> .<a name=26:8></a> thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#30:12">Jeremiah  30:12</a> - 15).<a name=26:9></a> Man left to himself is utterly helpless and hopeless.<a name=26:10></a> But in such an extremity as this lies the opportunity of a Saviour God.<a name=26:11></a> He is not without compassion or resource in the presence of man's desperate case.<a name=26:12></a> He says, "For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord" (verse 17).<a name=26:13></a> It may he said that this refers to Israel.<a name=26:14></a> That it does so only makes the depth of man's ruin, and the riches of God's grace, more apparent.<a name=26:15></a> If the people to whom God had vouchsafed so much divine light, and so many divine privileges, could only he described in such language as this, does it not prove conclusively that no amount of light and privilege can make man other than what he is -- a guilty and lost sinner?<a name=26:16></a> Indeed, "there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:22">Romans  3:22</a>, 23).<a name=26:17></a>

		On the other hand, if grace is rich towards those who have sinned against light, and who have abused every divine privilege that God could confer upon man in the flesh, none need despair.<a name=26:18></a> The grace in which God says, "I will restore health unto thee, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to a chapter in which Christian privilege and state is presented in a very blessed way.<a name=39:1></a> And it is important to see that we must, in measure, have apprehended what comes out in the previous chapters before we can enter into what is unfolded here.<a name=39:2></a> Young converts are often told to read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>-- and it is a good chapter for them to read, for it sets before them their privilege according to God's mind -- but no one can really enter into it except in the light of what is in the previous chapters.<a name=39:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God has put things in divine order in Scripture.<a name=39:4></a> Every link in the chain hangs morally on the link that precedes it.<a name=39:5></a> And in learning to take things up in spiritual intelligence we have to travel along the line in which it has pleased God to present them.<a name=39:6></a> No doubt believers get a certain amount of individual comfort and help from Scriptures taken up in a very disconnected way.<a name=39:7></a> They have their favourite texts and chapters -- <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>is an attractive chapter to all Christians -- but to learn the mind of God in Scripture we have to take things up in their proper order.<a name=39:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we take the first verse in the chapter -- "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus" -- the question is raised at once, "What is it to he in Christ Jesus?<a name=39:9></a>" No one could give a very clear answer to this question except in the light of what has gone before in the epistle.<a name=39:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, the believer is justified; he has received the gift of righteousness (chapter 5).<a name=39:11></a> But his righteousness is not in himself, it is in Another.<a name=39:12></a> In him, "all that believe are justified from all things" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:39">Acts  13:39</a>).<a name=39:13></a> CHRIST is the believer's righteousness.<a name=39:14></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer has also received abundance of grace "for divine satisfaction.<a name=40:1></a> This abundance of grace" is all treasured up in CHRIST, and administered through Him.<a name=40:2></a> The one who enters into the blessings spoken of in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>is really sitting down under the shadow of Christ with great delight, and finding His fruit sweet to his taste (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#2:3">Song of Songs  2:3</a>).<a name=40:3></a> He eats of the fatness of God's house, and is abundantly satisfied.<a name=40:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we come to the practical result which is, in a word, sanctification.<a name=40:5></a> Christians, as such, are dead to sin, and having got their freedom from sin, have become servants to God, and have their fruit unto holiness.<a name=40:6></a> But how is this brought about?<a name=40:7></a> It is by coming under the influence and attraction of CHRIST that the believer is practically set apart from the whole scene which is filled with the working of man's lawless will.<a name=40:8></a> He is thus prepared to take account of himself as being identified with Christ.<a name=40:9></a> He parts company with his own will, if one may so say, and becomes characterised by obedience.<a name=40:10></a> He takes character from the Second Man.<a name=40:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, further, as we have seen on a former occasion, we have "become dead to the law by the body of Christ" that we "should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>).<a name=40:12></a> All power and grace for fruit-bearing flows from CHRIST Himself.<a name=40:13></a> Without Him we can do nothing.<a name=40:14></a> We have all, in some measure, proved this experimentally.<a name=40:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have had to learn that we have neither righteousness, satisfaction, sanctification, nor power in ourselves.<a name=40:16></a> As Christians we have learned, by the grace of God, to find righteousness, satisfaction, sanctification, and power in another Man, even in CHRIST.<a name=40:17></a> We have nothing outside Him, but everything in Him.<a name=40:18></a> In learning this we come into the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a> this is looked at from God's side, and as the outcome of His work.<a name=41:5></a> Hence we get wisdom first.<a name=41:6></a> Christ is the wisdom of God by whom His whole counsel and purpose of blessing is brought about.<a name=41:7></a> "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption".<a name=41:8></a> The Christian is not under law, he is not in the flesh, he is in Christ Jesus.<a name=41:9></a> He has everything in the Man of God's counsel and purpose.<a name=41:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ground on which we can be brought, by the Spirit, to apprehend that every blessing is given to us in Christ Jesus is set forth in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>.<a name=41:11></a> God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=41:12></a> No flesh can glory in God's presence; it has been condemned and set aside in the holy judgment of the cross.<a name=41:13></a> The law could neither correct the flesh nor remove it; but God's Son having become a sacrifice for sin, all that we are morally as in the flesh has been condemned.<a name=41:14></a> And on that ground the Spirit has been given to us as "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus".<a name=41:15></a> The Spirit is given to maintain in the believer the consciousness that he has nothing in himself as a man in the flesh, but that he has everything, by the grace of God, in Christ Jesus.<a name=41:16></a> A man going about to establish his own righteousness is not in the line of the Spirit.<a name=41:17></a> One who seeks satisfaction in the world is altogether out of the current of the Spirit.<a name=41:18></a> If I am striving to make my flesh holy and pleasing to God, I shall not have the Spirit's help; He will rather seek to convince me of the impossibility of any success in this direction.<a name=41:19></a> If I am making legal efforts to be what I feel I ought to be, and to bring forth fruit to God in this way, the

		The man in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>has found out that sin is the controlling principle of the flesh.<a name=42:13></a> "I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.<a name=42:14></a> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:21">Romans  7:21</a> - 23).<a name=42:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		An unconverted man thinks that all that he needs in order to lead a perfectly righteous life is to know what is right and to be willing to do it.<a name=42:16></a> It never occurs to him that he is quite incapable of good; he has no idea of his own weakness -- no idea that sin is the controlling principle of his flesh.<a name=42:17></a> The man in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>knows what is right, and is willing -- nay, most anxious -- to do it, but finds he has no power.<a name=42:18></a> Sin is the controlling principle of his flesh.<a name=42:19></a>

		It is a truth of universal application that power for good does not reside in the creature; it has its direct outflow from God Himself -- Father, Son, and Spirit.<a name=43:1></a> The apprehension of this makes a man say, in thinking of himself, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=43:2></a>" but in turning to God he is able to say, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=43:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian, having received "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus", comes under the influence of the "law" of that Spirit.<a name=43:4></a> The operating principle of "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" ever works in the direction of profound self-judgment, and of the consciousness that we have in Christ not only righteousness, but a divine Source of satisfaction and strength.<a name=43:5></a> This "law" operates not to give a sense of claim, but of divine gift and resource and support.<a name=43:6></a> And thus it makes the one in whom it operates free from "the law of sin and death".<a name=43:7></a> It gives the consciousness that divine goodness is an unfailing resource for our hearts, and that all the treasures of that goodness are stored up in Christ Jesus, that we may learn them there, and use them, and find the life of our spirits in the growing knowledge of Him.<a name=43:8></a> This brings us morally into an entirely new region where, in the presence of God's goodness and love, we are free from the controlling power of sin, and the condemnation that attaches to the flesh in which sin works.<a name=43:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical effect of this is that the Christian is set free to walk "according to Spirit", and as he so walks "the righteous requirement of the law" is fulfilled in him.<a name=43:10></a>

		Verse 5 comes in as a serious test for all who take Christian ground.<a name=43:11></a> "They that are after the flesh [or, according to flesh] do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit for, according to Spirit], the things of the Spirit".<a name=43:12></a> The Christian is "according to Spirit", and the proof of this is that he

		"The mind of the flesh is death".<a name=44:8></a> Solemn words!<a name=44:9></a> The mind of the flesh gives no place to God.<a name=44:10></a> It will play with a thousand vanities, it will explore with delight the whole domain of natural science, it will entertain systems of philosophy and schemes of philanthropy, it will keep itself in touch with every human interest, but it will give God no place, and hence it is death.<a name=44:11></a> Death is the state out of which nothing comes for God.<a name=44:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, "the mind of the Spirit [is] life and peace".<a name=44:13></a> The mind of the Spirit is ever upon God and His blessed things.<a name=44:14></a> His grace, His faithfulness, His love, His wonderful works, His counsels and purposes are ever before the mind of the Spirit.<a name=44:15></a> As these things become attractive to us and are the food and joy of our hearts, we prove that the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.<a name=44:16></a> When one is minding the things of the Spirit one is perfectly conscious of a satisfaction and tranquillity of soul that is not to be described.<a name=44:17></a>

		And this is not to be a mere sentiment awakened by reading a book, or the passing impulse of religious fervour roused by a stirring address; it is the "intelligent service" of the Christian.<a name=60:9></a> It is the sober and deliberate action of spiritual intelligence energised by the Holy Spirit.<a name=60:10></a>

		"And be not conformed to this world".<a name=60:11></a> Let us dwell a moment upon this!<a name=60:12></a> This world [age] is in many respects more seductive now than in the days of the apostles.<a name=60:13></a> The whole course of things in Christendom, has to some extent, become coloured by Christianity.<a name=60:14></a> Certain ideas of propriety affect most people, more or less.<a name=60:15></a> This makes it very easy for believers to drop down to the level of things here without coming in contact with any gross form of evil which might affect their consciences.<a name=60:16></a> For example, people give a Christian flavouring to politics, or try to do so, and many believers think it their duty to exercise political rights.<a name=60:17></a> But politics certainly belong to this age, and form perhaps one of its most prominent characteristics.<a name=60:18></a> There will be no politics, as we understand the term today, in the age to come, or in heaven.<a name=60:19></a>

		Take the ordinary social life of the world.<a name=61:4></a> It has its pleasing amiabilities, its many devices to pass smoothly the hours of leisure, its entertaining intelligence of everything that is done under the sun, and, it may be, a pinch of religious flavouring thrown in.<a name=61:5></a> But it all belongs to "this world", to which the Christian is not to be conformed.<a name=61:6></a>

		"But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind".<a name=61:7></a> The renewing of the mind is that gracious operation of God whereby saints become capable of entering intelligently into the apprehension of things which lie altogether outside this age.<a name=61:8></a> The Christian has a new kind of intelligent faculty by which he apprehends things that are outside the sphere of sight and the range of the senses.<a name=61:9></a> He becomes intelligent in the actings and ways of God, and familiar with that resurrection world which is the scene of "the wonderful works of God".<a name=61:10></a>

		The effect of apprehending these things is that the Christian is transformed; he comes out here in a new way, with new traits and characteristics.<a name=61:11></a> He thinks soberly of himself (verse 3); he does not mind high things but goes along with the lowly; he is not wise in his own conceit (verse 16); he does not avenge himself, but overcomes evil with good (verses 19 - 21); he is subject to the powers that be (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:1">Romans  13:1</a> - 7); he puts on the Lord Jesus Christ, and makes no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:14">Romans  13:14</a>); he bears the infirmities of the weak, and does not please himself (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:1">Romans  15:1</a>).<a name=61:12></a> If we think of what we are naturally, this is indeed a wondrous transformation.<a name=61:13></a>

		Then as to the world we are passing through (chapter 13) it is the will of God that we should be subject to the powers that be, paying tribute and paying to all their dues.<a name=62:15></a> It is no part of the Christian's business to control the powers that be, or to choose his own

		In our individual responsibility as in the kingdom of God (chapter 14), we have to be careful not to despise a brother because he does not feel free in conscience to eat or drink or do certain things which to us seem perfectly lawful.<a name=63:3></a> On the other hand, the brother with a conscience as to certain things must be careful not to judge the one whose conscience is in greater liberty.<a name=63:4></a> The great thing is not to put any stumbling-block or occasion to fall in any brother's way.<a name=63:5></a> An earnest care for one another's welfare and prosperity would regulate all this, and in thus seeking one another's good we should truly serve Christ and become acceptable to God and approved of men.<a name=63:6></a>
