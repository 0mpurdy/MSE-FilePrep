		The Song of Songs is a book for the heart.<a name=1:1></a> It is a choice part of the Holy Scriptures, and has ever appealed to the affections of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:2></a> Its voice was probably never more needed than it is today, for nearly all the influences of modern life combine to hinder the development of such emotions as find expression in this book, and to chill them even after they have been awakened.<a name=1:3></a> Our Lord's words are true of the present time: "Because lawlessness shall prevail, the love of the most shall grow cold" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:12">Matthew  24:12</a>).<a name=1:4></a> May God be graciously pleased to use it to stimulate holy affections in the hearts of His saints!<a name=1:5></a> The reader will please notice that quotations from Scripture are, throughout this book, from the New Translation by J.<a name=1:6></a> N.<a name=1:7></a> Darby.<a name=1:8></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book does not bring before us the first movements of the work of God in the soul.<a name=1:9></a> The first exercises of a creature who has sinned against God are in the conscience.<a name=1:10></a> Conviction of sin and repentance must have their place; the answer to Job's question, "How can man be just with God?<a name=1:11></a>" must be found.<a name=1:12></a> The forgiveness of sins and justification in Christ are great necessities.<a name=1:13></a> But these primary questions are not raised in this book; they are supposed to have been raised, and settled in a divine way.<a name=1:14></a> And the very way in which these moral questions have been settled for those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ has given us the knowledge of God as moving according to His own nature, that is in love.<a name=1:15></a> "God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us".<a name=1:16></a> There was an immense depth of need on our part, but on God's part a movement of love in that Christ, His beloved Son, has died for us.<a name=1:17></a> In the light of this we make the wondrous discovery that God is love, and, that being so, He can only be satisfied with love on the part of His loved creature.<a name=1:18></a> God is known to us as set forth in a blessed Man, His beloved Son, who in love has gone into death for us, and who is now, as risen and exalted, the King of glory.<a name=1:19></a> A Divine Person is brought before us in this book as <i>The King</i>,

		as the true Solomon who is, typically, the King of glory.<a name=2:1></a> But the Spirit of God, who has brought out His glory in many and varied ways throughout the Holy Scriptures, engages our hearts with Him in this incomparable book as a Lover.<a name=2:2></a> He is seen here as manifesting His love to those who appreciate it, and to whom it is more precious than all else.<a name=2:3></a> He is God's Anointed; all divine and kingly rights are His; but He is known here as a personal Lover, and as having come into Manhood to be appreciated and responded to in ardent affection.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The inspired title of this book, <i>The Song of Songs</i>, indicates its surpassing excellence, in contrast with the "vanity of vanities" which could alone be experienced in the world "under the sun".<a name=2:5></a> Solomon's songs were "a thousand and five"; he was conversant with every subject of song, as he was with all trees and living creatures (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4:32">1 Kings  4:32</a> - 34), but this song has been selected as of greater value than all the others.<a name=2:6></a> No subject could be greater or sweeter than the love of Christ, and those responsive movements which it awakens in the hearts of those who know it.<a name=2:7></a> To have the personal enjoyment of the love of Christ transcends all other joys.<a name=2:8></a> The principle of selection marks the whole of Scripture; not everything that saints, or servants of God, or even the Son of God, said or did, has been recorded, but all that was adequate to make known the mind and heart of God.<a name=2:9></a> And this song has been selected by the Spirit of God as of supreme worth because it delineates in a figurative way the affections that are in the heart of Christ towards His own, and the affections which have place in their hearts towards Him.<a name=2:10></a>

		The love of Christ is a precious reality.<a name=3:1></a> The Spirit would never allow us to lose sight of His greatness and majesty -- He is the King, the supreme One, in this book -- but He would impress our hearts with a sweet and tender sense of His love.<a name=3:2></a> He was once here in humiliation and suffering and death for us, and He has now gone on high as the exalted and glorified One; He is "the Lord of glory", but He loves each one of us with a real and personal love.<a name=3:3></a> We can ask with confidence, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=3:4></a> tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?<a name=3:5></a> .<a name=3:6></a>.<a name=3:7></a>.<a name=3:8></a> But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:35">Romans  8:35</a> - 37).<a name=3:9></a> God would put the assurance of that in our hearts by His Spirit.<a name=3:10></a> Then Paul could say, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>, 15).<a name=3:11></a> As held in the embrace of the love of Christ we arrive at the judgment that it is due to Him that we should live to Him, not only in service but in affection.<a name=3:12></a> This is not a matter of mere sentiment, but of sober and considered judgment; it is a well weighed and deliberate conviction.<a name=3:13></a> And we should approach "The Song of Songs" in the light of this.<a name=3:14></a> The theme of the "Hong" is such a consciousness of the love of Christ that the heart lives to Him.<a name=3:15></a> We shall find, indeed, that there are deviations from that blessed state, which have to be the subject of movements of recovery, but the true normal state of heart, as presented in the first section

	<div class="paragraph">
		We all profess to have the light of the love of Christ, and I trust there is a real, even if feeble, sense of it in our hearts.<a name=4:2></a> Now it would be strange if we knew about the love of Christ, and did not desire to have some personal token of it!<a name=4:3></a> The Song begins with this.<a name=4:4></a> "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth".<a name=4:5></a> There is desire for the direct and personal expression of His love, some evidence of it that shall be, like the name written on the white stone (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:17">Revelation  2:17</a>), known only to the one who receives it.<a name=4:6></a> Such an intimacy is to be sought and enjoyed in reality.<a name=4:7></a> It is an experience corresponding with the Lord's own words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>: "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him".<a name=4:8></a> One feels humbled by the consciousness that one knows so little of personal intimacy with Christ.<a name=4:9></a> Such men as John and Paul knew what it was to be in nearness to Him with not a shade of reserve to cloud the consciousness of His love, and thousands of saints through the centuries have known it in their measure, and it is open to us to know it too.<a name=4:10></a> If we have to own that we have not known much of it in the past, it is open to us now if we have hearts to appreciate it.<a name=4:11></a>

		The tokens of His love are asked for on the ground that they are valued.<a name=4:12></a> "For thy love is better than wine".<a name=4:13></a> When His love is valued more than all earthly or natural joys its manifestations will be given, If that is our estimation of it we shall get "the kisses of his mouth".<a name=4:14></a> Orpah kissed Naomi but left her,

		There is a nearness to Him in <i>His</i> circumstances in the first section of this book, ending at the seventh verse of chapter 2, that does not appear in the rest of the book.<a name=5:3></a> "The king hath brought me into his chambers" (chapter 1: 4);"while the king is at his table" (chapter 1: 12);"He hath brought me to the house of wine" (chapter 2: 4).<a name=5:4></a> We find in this section a satisfaction and restfulness in nearness to Him which is not found later on.<a name=5:5></a> The experiences that follow are more varied, more mixed in character, and they he in different scenes.<a name=5:6></a> They are all deeply instructive, but they do not come up to what we have in the first section.<a name=5:7></a> I believe we have in the first section the love of Christ in its preciousness and satisfying power, as known, if we may so say, in <i>His</i> circumstances; and the affections of His own are seen as in full appreciation of, and response to, His love.<a name=5:8></a> So that the mutual relations between Christ and His loved ones are pictured here as in normal, or spiritual, conditions.<a name=5:9></a> The spouse is here marked by pure, unflagging, and fervent affection, and she is seen as occupying the best place which the King's love could give her in His own chambers and at His table.<a name=5:10></a> The affectionate relations between them are normal, and just what they should be to satisfy love.<a name=5:11></a> In the rest of the book there are experiences and exercises which are consequent upon a different state of things.<a name=5:12></a> From chapter 2: 8 to 3: 3, the spouse is not seen in His chambers, but as found in conditions where He has to seek her, or where she has to seek Him, and there are evidences

		of waning affection on her part, from which she has to be recovered through experiences which are not happy.<a name=6:1></a> This is seen also in chapter 5: 2 - 8.<a name=6:2></a> In those parts of the book desire is more prominent than satisfaction.<a name=6:3></a> But the first section brings before us in, a figurative way normal and spiritual conditions.<a name=6:4></a> It is God's way to begin by setting forth things according to the height and perfection of His own thoughts, though He may afterwards have to shew us how prone we are to deviate from them.<a name=6:5></a> The Psalms often begin by giving the goal to be reached, and then describe the way which may have to be traversed in order to reach it.<a name=6:6></a> What a height of blessing is brought before us in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>and 2 and yet He has afterwards to tell us not to steal, or tell lies, or use filthy language!<a name=6:7></a> But God loves to begin at the full height of His own thoughts; there is power and leverage in them to elevate us, and to preserve us from defection.<a name=6:8></a> Chapter 1 - 2: 7 is suggestive of first love.<a name=6:9></a> As we know the love of Christ, and respond to it, and love one another as He has loved us, there is love which is fist in quality, and not merely in time; it is a quality of love which cannot be surpassed.<a name=6:10></a> If we see what is spiritual, and normal according to God's mind, we have a divine standard by which defection or departure can be judged and adjusted.<a name=6:11></a>

		There are reasons given in verse 3 why the virgins love Him.<a name=6:12></a> His ointments savour sweetly, and His Name is an ointment poured forth.<a name=6:13></a> I think verse 3 is perhaps the most important verse in the book, as giving the secret of the love for Christ which is found in virgin hearts, that is, hearts uncorrupted by the influences of the world.<a name=6:14></a> Such hearts can appreciate

		the sweet savour of His ointments, and the fragrance of His Name.<a name=7:1></a> It is to be noted that this is the only mention of His Name in the book.<a name=7:2></a> How often is it found in Scripture that the key hangs, as might be said, at the door; the first few verses of a book give a clue to its contents.<a name=7:3></a> His Name is something more than His kingly office, something more than all the graces and moral perfections which were manifest in Him; it is Himself -- His personal renown and greatness.<a name=7:4></a> We may admire different qualities in a friend, but it is the Person to whom they attach whom we love.<a name=7:5></a> His Name conveys all that <i>He</i> is in Himself, and if we do not know <i>who</i> He is we cannot rightly estimate the qualities and features and excellencies which may be seen in Him, and on which this book dwells with such a wealth and variety of figurative detail.<a name=7:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gospel of Matthew corresponds with the Song of Songs, for it presents Christ as the King, and His moral perfections are delineated there, particularly in the Beatitudes, but before the Evangelist speaks of Him as the King, or of His moral beauty and worth, he brings before us His Name.<a name=7:7></a> His Name is greater than any office which He fills; it is greater than the human excellencies and graces which shone forth in Him.<a name=7:8></a> It gives lustre, and character, and fragrance to every perfection that was seen in Him.<a name=7:9></a> "Thou shalt call his name Jesus" -- Jehovah the Saviour -- "for <i>he</i> shall save his people" -- Jehovah's people -- "from their sins" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:21">Matthew  1:21</a>).<a name=7:10></a> Then again, "They shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us" (verse 23).<a name=7:11></a> The Evangelists tell us what He did, and what He said, but it is who

		merely Man He would have no title to attract or claim the love of all virgin hearts, but as Emmanuel He is entitled to a love which would be purely idolatrous if bestowed upon a creature.<a name=9:1></a> The quality of that love is supremely elevated because of the greatness of the Person loved.<a name=9:2></a> It is a reverential adoring affection that never loses the sense of <i>who</i> He is.<a name=9:3></a>

		The thought of ointments and fragrant spices and sweet odours suggested in this book and in other parts of Scripture as connected with Christ, and also with His saints, reminds us that the sense of smell has its spiritual counterpart as well as the other senses.<a name=9:4></a> There are characteristics of Christ which can only be appreciated in this way; they are not to be discerned by seeing or hearing or feeling or tasting, but by scent.<a name=9:5></a> This is a distinct quality of spiritual apprehension clearly recognised in Scripture.<a name=9:6></a> It is said of the Lord in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11:3">Isaiah  11:3</a> "And his delight (literally scent: see margin of New Translation) will be in the fear of Jehovah", There was an ability with Him to perceive the odour of all that was in accord with the fear of Jehovah; He pursued that as a dog will follow up the scent of his master.<a name=9:7></a> It is most important that we should have this spiritual faculty unimpaired.<a name=9:8></a> As natural men we had keen perceptions of what was agreeable to us; we followed up the scent of things that appealed to us.<a name=9:9></a> Now we have this faculty in a renewed way by the grace and work of God, and it is also developed under His disciplinary ways.<a name=9:10></a> For we are told of Moab that he "hath been at ease from his youth, and hath settled on his lees; he hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore

		The second and third verses are the basis of the book.<a name=10:8></a> They shew that the Lord has pleasure in giving personal tokens of His love, and that His love is better than all earthly or natural joy.<a name=10:9></a> They also shew what a supreme claim He has to the affections of His own, and how He presents Himself in wondrous grace so as to win the love of virgin hearts.<a name=10:10></a> All this will be as true for the Jewish remnant as it is for us, and it is as true for us as it will be for them.<a name=10:11></a>

		The first evidence of true revival is when she says, "I will rise now, and go about the city; in the streets and in the broadways will I seek him whom my sod loveth".<a name=58:4></a> How different this from being in His chambers, and in His house of wine!<a name=58:5></a> Still it shews that she is arousing herself to increased diligence of heart, and this is something.<a name=58:6></a> But the streets and broadways of the city were not the place to find Him.<a name=58:7></a> She has again to say, "I sought him, but I found him not".<a name=58:8></a> Her love, not being regulated by His voice and leading, and moved by its own sense of loss rather than by the constraint of His love, brought her into circumstances which were quite unsuitable to His spouse.<a name=58:9></a> The watchmen that went about the city found her.<a name=58:10></a> A woman abroad at night was not orderly, whatever her motives might be, and she came under the scrutiny of the watchmen as being in a questionable position.<a name=58:11></a> In normal conditions they would never have found her; it was their business to keep a lookout for evil-doers and enemies -- for those who would disturb the peace of the city.<a name=58:12></a> The very fact that she came under their notice at all was a reproach and rebuke to her.<a name=58:13></a> They did not at this time say or do anything to her, but she was found by them as one who was not enjoying the

		It has pleased God in His wisdom to give us valuable instruction in this form.<a name=62:3></a> Each of these first two sections ends with a charge that her Love is not to be disturbed.<a name=62:4></a> That is a normal exercise; when we are in the enjoyment of nearness and intimacy with the Lord, the dominant desire of the heart is that nothing shall interfere with it.<a name=62:5></a> I suppose we have all known moments of happiness in which we have felt a real dread lest anything should come in that would disturb it.<a name=62:6></a> That is a normal exercise of love.<a name=62:7></a>

		The lessons we learn in connection with actual failure in walk are not nearly so searching and humbling as those which arise from the inward discovery that our hearts have failed to respond to the love of Christ, The one is external and perhaps more public, but the other arises from the consciousness of a decline which is only known to ourselves and to the Lover of our souls.<a name=62:10></a> Such is the exercise of the second section of this book.<a name=62:11></a> There is decline in her affections.<a name=62:12></a> It comes into evidence, but the real

		Hair, as in Nazariteship, carries with it also the thought of consecration.<a name=85:4></a> "He hath consecrated himself to Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow".<a name=85:5></a> And we read of "the hair of the head of his consecration" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#6:5">Numbers  6:5</a>, 18).<a name=85:6></a> How beautiful in the eyes of Christ is this feature!<a name=85:7></a> As constrained by His love we no longer live to ourselves but to Him.<a name=85:8></a> "For both if we should live, it is to the Lord we live; and if we should die, it is to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:8">Romans  14:8</a>).<a name=85:9></a> Spiritual perceptions governing the heart would lead to consecration; it is the normal fruit of grace, and it is a peculiar glory to be thus distinguished in the sight of our eternal Lover.<a name=85:10></a>

		In the descriptions given in this book of the spouse and of Him who is her Beloved, certain of her or of His features are mentioned which are then compared with other things.<a name=85:11></a> It would appear that the features are figurative while the comparisons are symbolical.<a name=85:12></a> For example, the "head" would be figurative of intelligence, but if it is said to be "like Carmel" a comparison is instituted which is of a symbolical nature and indicates the character of the intelligence.<a name=85:13></a> Another example may be given from another part of Scripture.<a name=85:14></a> We read, "And his feet like fine brass,

	<div class="paragraph">
		as burning in a furnace" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:15">Revelation  1:15</a>).<a name=86:1></a> His "feet" are figurative of His movements, but when we are told that they are "like fine brass, as burning in a furnace" this is symbolical language.<a name=86:2></a> It is of the nature of a figure that it is comparatively easily understood; a child would understand that the feet represent how one moves.<a name=86:3></a> But a symbol requires more mature consideration: the language of symbols has to be learned from their use in Scripture, and by divine teaching.<a name=86:4></a> Any simple person would know that a door or gate indicated the way into something, and might mean access or exclusion according as it was open or shut.<a name=86:5></a> This is the language of figure.<a name=86:6></a> But if we read that the doors of the temple were of olive-wood, carved with cherubim and palm-trees and half-open flowers, and overlaid with gold, this is the language of <i>symbol</i>, into which we have to be initiated before we can understand it.<a name=86:7></a> So if we read that Jerusalem's gates are of carbuncles, and that the twelve gates of the heavenly city are twelve pearls, these are symbolical statements.<a name=86:8></a> There is no natural resemblance between a gate and a pearl: such a description has to be understood symbolically.<a name=86:9></a> There may, or there may not, be some kind of natural correspondence between a figure and the symbols which are used in connection with it.<a name=86:10></a> Very often there is none; but whether there is or not the symbols have their own significance.<a name=86:11></a> This applies to the interpretation of all Scripture symbols; a symbol in every case adds something to the figure which in itself it would not have.<a name=86:12></a> It will be helpful to bear this in mind as we look at the comparisons and similitudes which we shall meet with in the Song of Songs.<a name=86:13></a>

		For the spiritual understanding of such language, as used by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, we have to get away from material or literal thoughts, and seek to gather the moral ideas which are presented in a symbolical way.<a name=87:1></a> I do not say that we can always interpret them aright; for there is real difficulty in many of the figures and symbols.<a name=87:2></a> We need the Lord to give us understanding, and He does not fail those who seek Him.<a name=87:3></a> And if we do not know, it is a very safe and wholesome thing to admit our ignorance.<a name=87:4></a>

		The hair of the spouse being "as a flock of goats, on the slopes of mount Gilead" connects the thoughts of unity, and an exceedingly favourable position, with the features attaching to hair in Scripture.<a name=87:5></a> True subjection and consecration on the part of individual saints will inevitably bring them into unity.<a name=87:6></a> It will bring about a collective state of things which will have true "flock" character.<a name=87:7></a> The "flock" is a precious designation of the saints viewed collectively, because it conveys the thought that not only has each individual a place under direct Shepherd care, but that all move together under one control.<a name=87:8></a> This is the practical evidence that we are beautified under the eye of Christ with that true glory of which the hair is a figure.<a name=87:9></a> Subjection to Christ as Head will secure unity.<a name=87:10></a> This is not agreeing to differ, but moving together without a divergent thought because all have one Head.<a name=87:11></a>

		Subjection to one Shepherd, as knowing and confiding in His love, will lead to our being found in most favourable pasture.<a name=87:12></a> "The slopes of mount Gilead" would indicate this.<a name=87:13></a> (See <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#1:19">Jeremiah  1:19</a>; <a href="../bible/Micah.htm#7:14">Micah  7:14</a>)

		If we are not enjoying rich pasture, or not moving in unity with our brethren in the enjoyment of it, the question arises whether grace has been allowed to bring about in us those features of spiritual beauty and glory which are set forth in the hair of the spouse?<a name=88:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The frequent use of the goat as a sin-offering suggests that, the saints viewed as "a flock of goats" are regarded as being in holy separation from everything that was judged in the death of Christ.<a name=88:2></a> We shall not otherwise move in unity as one flock, nor shall we feed in green pastures.<a name=88:3></a> If we have really apprehended Christ in Sin-offering character we are under obligation to maintain, through grace, a holiness that is in keeping with it.<a name=88:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next feature brought before us in the King's description of the spouse is her teeth, and this would set forth ability to avail oneself of spiritual food, for it is by the teeth that food is masticated.<a name=88:5></a> Under grace we acquire ability to feed, and this is attractive to the Lord.<a name=88:6></a> He furnishes food supply in abundance, but His pleasure is found in seeing us able to make use of it.<a name=88:7></a> There are many forms of spiritual food typified by the passover lamb, by manna, flesh, corn, bread, etc.<a name=88:8></a>, but unless we have ability to feed on them they do not sustain or strengthen us.<a name=88:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The comparison instituted here: "Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, which go up from the washing; which have all borne twins, and none is barren among them" -- would suggest to us the conditions which accompany spiritual ability to feed.<a name=88:10></a> "Sheep" represent those who are partakers of the divine nature.<a name=88:11></a> If we are to feed on Christ -- and all

	<div class="paragraph">
		spiritual food is Christ in some form -- there must be a nature suitable to appropriate such food, and to grow by it.<a name=89:1></a> If there is not something morally kindred to Christ in the soul there is nothing which can possibly feed on Him.<a name=89:2></a> Those born of incorruptible seed are evidenced by the desire which they have for that which is nourishing and strengthening in a spiritual sense.<a name=89:3></a> (See <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:23">1 Peter  1:23</a> - 2: 3) There is correspondence between the food and the one who feeds, so that the one is suited to the other, The natural man cannot feed on Christ; there is nothing in him to which such food appeals.<a name=89:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the sheep here are shorn; their nature has been in activity, and has yielded something at personal cost for the One to whom they belong.<a name=89:5></a> We may not always think so, but it is a fact that ability to feed depends to a large extent on what we have yielded.<a name=89:6></a> If I find that I get nothing out of my reading of Scripture, or out of ministry that is evidently food for others, it is time to ask whether the grace of God has had its way in producing something for His praise, or for the comfort of His people?<a name=89:7></a> The more we yield the more we shall be able to appropriate as food.<a name=89:8></a> If there has been nothing produced, the grace of God has been received in vain.<a name=89:9></a> It could not be absolutely so in anyone born of incorruptible seed, but a small yield often accounts for small capability to feed.<a name=89:10></a> Of course if we do not feed we cannot expect to yield wool, so that it works both ways.<a name=89:11></a> The normal course is that as nourished by grace we produce something for God; then fresh supplies of grace are forthcoming, and there is a further yield.<a name=89:12></a> But if we are unproductive there will

		Wool is the natural product of a sheep's life, but it is grown to be yielded under shearing.<a name=90:3></a> How everything was yielded, even life itself, by our blessed Lord, and this without opening His mouth in complaint!<a name=90:4></a> And Peter tells us that He has left US a Model that we should follow in His steps.<a name=90:5></a> AS we pursue this line there will be no lack of ability to enjoy spiritual food.<a name=90:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is a further thought of the sheep going up "from the washing".<a name=90:7></a> Many wonder why they do not get more at the meetings, or in private reading, but the secret is that they do not come up from the washing.<a name=90:8></a> "The washing of water by the word" is for cleansing from all that is unsuitable to Christ or uncomely in His sheep.<a name=90:9></a> If we do not submit ourselves to this sanctifying and purifying process our ability to feed will be seriously impaired.<a name=90:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, these sheep are presented as marked by fruitfulness; all have borne twins and none is barren.<a name=90:11></a> It would be good for every believer to desire to bring at least two souls to Christ; it might well be a distinct object with each one of us.<a name=90:12></a> Think of the increase of the flock for Him!<a name=90:13></a> Andrew first found his own brother Simon and led him to Jesus.<a name=90:14></a> I do not believe the Lord would have any of us to be barren in relation to the increase of the flock.<a name=90:15></a> And if there were more fruitfulness of this kind there would be more real ability to enjoy spiritual food.<a name=90:16></a>

		CHAPTER 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to a part of the book which has a special voice for us, and which is very exercising, because it shews that even when grace has been known in a very full way, and its spiritual fruits have been produced, a state of self-complacency may come about in the saints which does not yield to the Lord what His heart looks for.<a name=124:1></a> The contrast between the previous section and this one corresponds with that which may be noted between the first epistle to the Ephesians and the second (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:1">Revelation  2:1</a> - 7).<a name=124:2></a> That which is the full fruit of grace and of the presence of the Spirit is seen in the one; an assembly fallen, as having left her first love, is seen in the other.<a name=124:3></a> Many fruits of grace remained which the Lord refers to in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:2">Revelation  2:2</a>, 3, 6, but the spring was gone which could alone yield to Him what His heart looked for.<a name=124:4></a> We have seen in chapter 4, of the Song that the spouse is spoken of as "a spring", "a fountain", "a well of living waters"; there is a flow of spiritual energy in her affections which is lacking in chapter 5: 2, 3.<a name=124:5></a> She can still say, "my heart was awake"; He has not ceased to be her Beloved, nor has she lost ability to recognise His voice and His knock.<a name=124:6></a> There is true affection for Him, but it has ceased to be an energetic motive.<a name=124:7></a> The wakeful and watching spirit that had all its desires and hopes centred in the Beloved was no longer there.<a name=124:8></a> "I slept"

		To bring Christ into comparison with others is not the highest way to view Him, for He is, indeed, beyond comparison, but it is one blessed means of arriving at a true and affectionate appreciation of Him.<a name=134:4></a> The Psalmist had taken account of Him thus when he said, "Thou art fairer than the sons of men" (Psalm 45: 2).<a name=134:5></a> The officers sent to take Him compared Him with all others when they said, "Never man spoke thus, as this man speaks" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:46">John  7:46</a>).<a name=134:6></a> It is good when our hearts learn to compare Him with others; it is one way to learn His exceeding preciousness and beauty.<a name=134:7></a> We might say that in a certain way the blessed God has compared Him with others, for it is written, "I have exalted one chosen out of the people" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:19">Psalm  89:19</a>).<a name=134:8></a> God has singled Him out from all others as the One who answered perfectly to His will and to every desire of His heart.<a name=134:9></a> So at His baptism He was singled out from "all the people" who had been baptised.<a name=134:10></a> The Holy Spirit descended on <i>Him</i>, and the voice out of heaven said, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:21">Luke  3:21</a>, 22).<a name=134:11></a> The thought of Christ being God's "chosen" or "elect" One suggests His being singled out as the one precious Object of divine complacency and delight.<a name=134:12></a> And God is now teaching His people to give Him the place of unrivalled honour -- the place of supremacy in their affections.<a name=134:13></a>

		There is not in the first four verses of this chapter the same sense of nearness and intimacy in the language of the spouse.<a name=196:1></a> There is intense desire for the Beloved, and to be on terms of intimate affection with Him, but no present conscious possession.<a name=196:2></a> She speaks of what she would do if she had opportunity.<a name=196:3></a> The very fact that she wishes He were near of kin to her indicates some sense of disparity, and this we find is particularly in her consciousness as something which might be observed by others.<a name=196:4></a> "<i>They</i> would not despise me".<a name=196:5></a> It does not occur to her that <i>He</i> would despise her, but the sense that others might is upon her spirit as a cloud.<a name=196:6></a> I do not think this is an uncommon exercise in regard to the liberty which love would desire to enjoy.<a name=196:7></a> I believe that if our walk and spirit have not been what we feel they ought to have been there is often a feeling that in the eyes of others we are not entitled to be in nearness of intimacy with Him.<a name=196:8></a> This is a humbling experience, but there is a blessing in it if the exercise be fully faced.<a name=196:9></a> If I have manifested something that was unworthy of Christ I can free myself righteously from it by acknowledgement.<a name=196:10></a> There would be much more liberty for spiritual intercourse in Christian families, and amongst believers generally, if there were greater readiness to confess faults.<a name=196:11></a> The pride of the flesh thinks this would lower us, but it would really greatly exalt us in the esteem of our friends and brethren.<a name=196:12></a> We all
