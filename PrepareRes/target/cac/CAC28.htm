	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:9></a>C.<a name=1:10></a> Matthew is written specially to help the Jewish believers and all is linked with the Old Testament.<a name=1:11></a> The ancient promises are all taken account of but yet it was intended to lead them on to the new thing   --  the assembly.<a name=1:12></a> This is the only gospel that speaks of the assembly.<a name=1:13></a>

		Ques.<a name=1:14></a> "The generation of Jesus" would look backwards and forwards.<a name=1:15></a> Would it refer to a new generation coming in?<a name=1:16></a> These three titles of Christ (Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham) are all promise titles.<a name=1:17></a>

		C.A.<a name=2:1></a>C.<a name=2:2></a> It is David the king in this chapter (verse 6); all the royal promises were connected with David.<a name=2:3></a> It was what pious Israelites looked for chiefly, that the Son of David should come in to exercise kingly power.<a name=2:4></a> It involves dealing with everything adverse to God and to His people, which has to come in first before the universal dominion and power that was connected with Abraham.<a name=2:5></a>

		C.A.<a name=3:4></a>C.<a name=3:5></a> It is all known to faith and love and is what appeals to us very touchingly.<a name=3:6></a> At the present time Christ is only known to faith and love, and it is in the faith and love of His people that He is, so to speak, preserved.<a name=3:7></a> Though so great (He is Emmanuel), yet He is pleased to take a form in which He is cared for, preserved and guarded, and those divinely taught are able to take up this privilege.<a name=3:8></a> It is most important in view of assembly service and Joseph takes up the responsible side.<a name=3:9></a> How wonderful that God should have made known these great secrets, that we should be told that the coming into human form of this blessed Person is a matter of the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:10></a> I suppose the Holy Spirit never undertook so great a service as when He became the medium by which a divine Person came into human form; it is expressly said to be of the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:11></a> We are permitted to contemplate this great objective fact.<a name=3:12></a> While it was the will of God, of the Deity, that one divine Person should come into human form (and He came into it of His own will too, for He came down from heaven), yet the Holy Spirit is the mighty Actor in the matter.<a name=3:13></a> Joseph was told that "that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit".<a name=3:14></a> I think we should recognise the Holy Spirit's place in the incarnation.<a name=3:15></a> Joseph was evidently a man that could be trusted to hold such a secret; it was in safe keeping with him.<a name=3:16></a>

		things that appear difficult to the human eye; this was shrouded in darkness and mystery.<a name=4:1></a> But Joseph does not come hastily to the conclusion of the matter; he gives it consideration and as he ponders he gets divine illumination.<a name=4:2></a> And you see the consideration that belongs to a man, not a gracious man, not a merciful man, but a <i>righteous</i> man.<a name=4:3></a> It led him to consideration of the matter; he made no hasty conclusions.<a name=4:4></a>

		C.A.<a name=4:7></a>C.<a name=4:8></a> There is a divine solution to every matter that seems difficult with relation to divine things.<a name=4:9></a> God always has one but His people are not always in the quiet sober condition of mind in which they can get it.<a name=4:10></a> But here was a man who could get it.<a name=4:11></a> No doubt Joseph represents the responsible side, while Mary presents the subjective side.<a name=4:12></a> That is our exercise, to be able to have to do with the greatest wonder in the universe.<a name=4:13></a> Here is the greatest thing that ever happened, or ever will happen in the universe of God, and here was a man suited to have the handling of it and its very deep instruction.<a name=4:14></a> So that it is Joseph who is to call his name Jesus.<a name=4:15></a> Joseph is the actor; it raises the question whether we are prepared as divinely taught, to handle the matters connected with the incarnation of Christ.<a name=4:16></a> Joseph handles them in such a way that they could not have been better handled; he did everything that was comely and suitable at the moment.<a name=4:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose the very name Jesus would show itself that a divine Person was coming in.<a name=5:6></a> It means 'Jehovah the Saviour'.<a name=5:7></a> It is really a divine name; Jehovah or Jah really is 'a Saviour' and the reference to His people is suggestive.<a name=5:8></a> A Jew in reading this would have no difficulty to understand what is meant; it is all connected, Jah, 'the Saviour' as having a people and His name being called 'Emmanuel'.<a name=5:9></a> It indicates He has certain rights, kingly rights in relation to His people.<a name=5:10></a> We need carefully to consider that the coming in of Jesus here is God taking up His rights, not asserting them from heaven but taking them up here.<a name=5:11></a> That side of the truth is important.<a name=5:12></a> That is really the meaning of the word we so often come across in the New Testament -- 'Kingdom'.<a name=5:13></a> No power of evil can deprive God of His rights and everything for us depends upon God asserting them.<a name=5:14></a> If He did not every one of us must perish eternally.<a name=5:15></a> The very fact that they are taken up in Him that bears the name of Jesus indicates to us how God has taken them up.<a name=5:16></a> They are the essential basis of the moral universe.<a name=5:17></a> The stability of the universe depends upon the power of God to maintain His own rights.<a name=5:18></a> When Adam and Eve disobeyed the command of God all men's rights perished at once and all that remained were God's rights and He at once came in to assert them in the promise to Eve's seed and in the clothing of Adam and Eve.<a name=5:19></a> That is God asserting His rights.<a name=5:20></a> Whatever men or Satan could do, God maintained His rights to sovereign mercy.<a name=5:21></a> It comforts me greatly to think that all my blessing depends upon God asserting His rights.<a name=5:22></a> So Paul went about preaching the kingdom of God.<a name=5:23></a>
