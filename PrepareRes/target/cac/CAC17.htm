		This volume of ministry consists of notes of addresses, summaries of readings, and private meditations by our beloved brother, covering a period of approximately fifty years.<a name=1:1></a> Some have already appeared in the form of booklets or in monthly periodicals, but it has been felt that these, in addition to the matter hitherto unpublished, should be made available in a more permanent form for those who are interested in the truth.<a name=1:2></a> The first paper, from which the title of this volume is taken, was composed by our beloved brother not long before his departure to be with Christ.<a name=1:3></a> The remaining items have been arranged so far as possible in the order of the scriptures to which they refer.<a name=1:4></a>

		THE FOOD OF LIFE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord used the simplest figures to express the greatest and most profound thoughts of God in relation to men.<a name=1:5></a> "Bread" is universally known as human food, but when we think of it as given by the Father out of heaven to be life for the world it assumes a spiritual character of the deepest interest.<a name=1:6></a> The Father has brought into this scene of death something that is altogether new as being out of heaven, and He has brought it in that His creatures here on earth might live on it in a spiritual way.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite certain that the fallen creature, if left to itself, would never desire this heavenly Bread.<a name=1:8></a> It is those whom the Father gives Him who come to Him; He says, "no one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" (verse 44).<a name=1:9></a> It is not that the Father hinders anyone from coming, but the state of the fallen creature is such that he cannot come because of his own perversity.<a name=1:10></a> But the Father would not provide heavenly Bread without securing that there should be some who would feed upon it.<a name=1:11></a> He gives some to the Son and they come; He draws and He teaches; otherwise there would be none to value what is so precious in His sight.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus says that the one who comes to Him will never hunger, and the one who believes on Him will never thirst (verse 35).<a name=1:13></a> Coming to Him implies that He is seen in His own distinctiveness as having no possible rival.<a name=1:14></a> No other ever came down from heaven; no other was ever the Object to whom the Father drew, and concerning whom the Father spoke; no other ever ascended up to the Father in his own personal right.<a name=1:15></a> We come to Him as appreciating the all-surpassing glory which is found in Him alone.<a name=1:16></a> In our hearts we leave all others: we say with Peter, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=1:17></a>" In this attitude of heart it is impossible to hunger; we are feeding upon One who infinitely surpasses every other kind of satisfaction.<a name=1:18></a> Believing on Him means that, as having come to Him, He is the abiding Object of our faith; we live, as Paul says, by the faith of Him.<a name=1:19></a> On that line we do not thirst.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If one eats of the Bread which comes down out of heaven he will not die (verse 50); he will live for ever.<a name=1:21></a> But with a view to this being opened to us the Lord said further, "But

	<div class="paragraph">
		the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world" (verse 51).<a name=2:1></a> His flesh must be given; that is, He must go into death.<a name=2:2></a> Those whom He would bring into life eternal were in death as to their state Godward.<a name=2:3></a> So He must needs give His flesh to furnish the food of life for us.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up at the last day" (verse 54).<a name=2:5></a> He adds, "for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink".<a name=2:6></a> We may gather from this something of the divine value of that holy flesh and blood which can now be fed upon to life eternal.<a name=2:7></a> It is not here the Lord's death as making atonement or propitiation to meet the holy claims of God so that we might be justified and accepted.<a name=2:8></a> This is the flesh and blood of the Son of man as the food of life eternal, that by which we enter into what is wholly new, and outside the whole range of sin and death.<a name=2:9></a> It is the result of a divine Person coming down out of heaven and entering into the condition of death so that we might feed upon Him as having come into that condition, and by so doing acquire a life which is far more blessed than any creature had before.<a name=2:10></a> All believers think thankfully and adoringly of what the death of Christ has removed, but we should also open our hearts to take in what it is for us as the food of life.<a name=2:11></a> The Son of man being found in death is the most marvellous thing that has ever been in the universe of God.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 51 the Lord speaks of giving His flesh, and in verse 53 He adds the thought of drinking His blood, and the two actions of eating His flesh and drinking His blood are spoken of three times in the following three verses.<a name=2:13></a> The One who came down out of heaven took part in blood and flesh.<a name=2:14></a> It was a sinless condition, for in it He was the Holy One of God, as Peter confessed Him in this chapter (verse 69).<a name=2:15></a> Indeed, the fulness of Godhead dwelt in Him in that condition.<a name=2:16></a> So that there is an infinitude of meaning in His being able to say, "my flesh", "my blood".<a name=2:17></a> Yet it was that which He could give, so that His flesh can be eaten and His blood drunk by those given to Him by His Father.<a name=2:18></a> His flesh and His blood were most intimately together in the days of His flesh, and while they were together they could not be eaten or drunk by anyone.<a name=2:19></a> But the time came when they were separated, and the wonderful spiritual reality of the present time is that they are truly food and drink for us now, and we only have eternal life as we eat and drink them.<a name=2:20></a>

		This connects spiritually with <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>.<a name=3:1></a> "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him".<a name=3:2></a> The love of God would have us to live for His pleasure through the death of His Son, but for this His flesh must be eaten, His blood drunk.<a name=3:3></a> His flesh and His blood must be assimilated into our moral being if we are to have life in ourselves.<a name=3:4></a> If the Son of man gives His flesh to be eaten and His blood to be drunk it speaks of death in an entirely new way of which I believe there is no type in Scripture.<a name=3:5></a> It is a new starting point in the ways of God with men, intended to bring in life according to the full thought of God.<a name=3:6></a> It is death as the starting point of a blessedness which is wholly of God.<a name=3:7></a> This takes the form of food and drink for us so that we may be nourished and invigorated and caused to live in an entirely new way.<a name=3:8></a> The flesh and blood of the Son of man show the length to which the love of God would go in order that we might have our part in the life in which Christ now lives as risen from among the dead, and ascended up where He was before.<a name=3:9></a> The eating and drinking emphasises the intensely personal nature of the appropriation -- the inwardness of it.<a name=3:10></a> It is Christ as in death that we feed upon, but as we feed upon Him He becomes ours in a most intimate and personal way; His death becomes ours as the God-provided way for us into participation in His life.<a name=3:11></a> We could only participate in His life through His death, and we take this into our most inward being as before God.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this ground we dwell in Him and He in us.<a name=3:13></a> But, for this we must be characteristically eaters and drinkers; we must take this on as a characterising feature, and the dwelling in Him and He in us correspond.<a name=3:14></a> We have reached what it is to be in Christ, as Paul would say, and He is in us; we are all of one with Him.<a name=3:15></a> It is from Christ in that condition of death that the "much fruit" is brought forth of which He speaks in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>.<a name=3:16></a> The reality of this is to be assimilated into our spiritual being.<a name=3:17></a> We derive all from His having been in that state of death, and this is maintained in us spiritually as we eat His flesh and drink His blood; we are to continue to do so.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we derive life from the Son of man having been in death it is obvious that this life is altogether new and different from any life we could have naturally.<a name=3:19></a> It is life according to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the blessed thought of the love of God.<a name=4:1></a> It is the life which the Son of man has as risen from among the dead.<a name=4:2></a> Hence we read, "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him" (verse 56).<a name=4:3></a> If we dwell in Him His place is our place; we are brought to live in the blessedness of what He is as having gone to the Father.<a name=4:4></a> His saints are in Him, and He is in them, the Holy Spirit giving the knowledge of this, as we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:20">John  14:20</a>.<a name=4:5></a> Indeed, we may be assured that it is by the Spirit that any are able to eat the flesh or drink the blood of the Son of man.<a name=4:6></a> For the Lord says, "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" (verse 63).<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The flesh of the Son of man and His blood are now to become, by our eating and drinking, the source of our true life.<a name=4:8></a> They are divine love in manifestation, but now appropriated and assimilated as the way by which that love reaches its own end.<a name=4:9></a> We are thus brought truly to live through and in Him.<a name=4:10></a> This is our abiding place; we dwell in Him; but this is only maintained as a spiritual reality as we eat and drink.<a name=4:11></a> His flesh and His blood must be as much our regular sustenance spiritually as our ordinary food is naturally.<a name=4:12></a>

		THE HISTORY OF GOD'S WAYS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:1">Genesis  49:1</a> - 28
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need hardly say that this scripture primarily applies in a very distinct way to Israel, but the scope of any scripture often goes far beyond its particular interpretation.<a name=5:1></a> The Spirit of God takes occasion in many scriptures to set forth great principles which have a wide range of application.<a name=5:2></a> This is one of the most striking evidences of the inspiration of Scripture.<a name=5:3></a> If we find thus in the first book of the Bible a prophetic statement which not only has its particular application to Israel, but which indicates the whole history of man in ruin and failure, and alongside that the whole history of God's ways in grace, it makes us very conscious that the Scriptures are divinely inspired.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place we get a group of three -- Reuben, Simeon, and Levi -- in connection with whom is set forth the state of man as fallen under the power of evil.<a name=5:5></a> What characterises Reuben is the impetuosity of lust -- "impetuous as the waters" in lust and self-will.<a name=5:6></a> Then Simeon and Levi are marked by cruelty and anger; so that we get in these three the two great elements of the energy of evil -- corruption and violence.<a name=5:7></a> These are the characteristics of the natural man.<a name=5:8></a> It has been true of us all that we have been to a large extent characterised by lust -- that is the desire to gratify ourselves without reference to the will of God.<a name=5:9></a> The ruling thought with us was to give effect to our own will.<a name=5:10></a> Then if anything comes in to interfere with this it awakens anger.<a name=5:11></a> Many a man seems very amiable as long as he is getting his own way, but if something comes in to cross his purpose he becomes angry, and, so far as he has opportunity, cruel.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man, the fallen sinner, having become thus characterised by lust, anger, and cruelty, has forfeited God's favour, and become liable to death and judgment.<a name=5:13></a> If blessing comes in for man it must be in pure grace.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with Judah we see foreshadowed the One by whom God's grace has brought in every blessing for man in victorious power.<a name=5:15></a> It is by "the Lion of the tribe of Juda" that God has brought in blessing for those who had forfeited everything.<a name=5:16></a> "Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies".<a name=5:17></a> That is victorious power.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have fallen under the power of evil and unless that power could be completely overthrown we must have remained under it for ever.<a name=6:1></a> But the power of God in grace, through our Lord Jesus Christ, has proved itself to be infinitely greater than the power of evil.<a name=6:2></a> The Lord said, "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: but when <i>a stronger than he</i> shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:21">Luke  11:21</a>, 22.<a name=6:3></a> Before the Lord began His ministry of grace in this world He met every temptation that the devil could present, and proved absolutely victorious.<a name=6:4></a> No power of evil could touch that Holy One of God.<a name=6:5></a> Satan could find no point of weakness in that Blessed One; he was obliged to retire vanquished and weaponless from the contest.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is very striking to see that having met and overcome the power of the devil in this way the Lord Jesus could go into the synagogue at Nazareth and open the book of God's grace for man.<a name=6:7></a> Morally speaking, no one had ever been able to open that book before.<a name=6:8></a> Never before had there been one on earth who could say, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; .<a name=6:9></a>.<a name=6:10></a>.<a name=6:11></a> he hath sent me .<a name=6:12></a>.<a name=6:13></a>.<a name=6:14></a> to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a>, 19.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that in this we get a kind of foreshadowing of Christ's full victory over Satan's power, and of its results in blessing to men.<a name=6:16></a> It was at the cross that Satan's power was completely annulled.<a name=6:17></a> It was there that the Lion of the tribe of Judah "prevailed".<a name=6:18></a> When John wept because no man was found worthy to open the book (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5">Revelation  5</a>), one of the elders said to him, "Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, <i>hath prevailed</i> to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof".<a name=6:19></a> Not that this is the book of grace.<a name=6:20></a> Far from that, it is a book the opening of which brings judgment upon those who have neglected Christ.<a name=6:21></a> The point I draw attention to is that it is opened by One who has "prevailed".<a name=6:22></a> He is entitled to give effect to all the mind of God whether brought about in grace or through judgment.<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the present time all is pure and infinite grace, established for men in victorious power.<a name=6:24></a> Divine grace has visited this earth in power for the overthrow of all the power of evil, so

		that full blessing might come to the children of men.<a name=7:1></a> Christ has bruised the serpent's head.<a name=7:2></a> Though it is true that He was crucified through weakness, yet that weakness was the mighty power of God for the overthrow of the power of evil.<a name=7:3></a> He could say, 'I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again'.<a name=7:4></a> He has broken the might of evil, and annulled him who had the power of death.<a name=7:5></a> As David prevailed over Goliath so has Christ prevailed by His death.<a name=7:6></a> So that in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>we see Him opening the book of grace -- expounding in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<a name=7:7></a> He had "prevailed" that He might open out all the grace of God for man's blessing.<a name=7:8></a> "It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:46">Luke  24:46</a>, 47.<a name=7:9></a>

		"Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies".<a name=7:10></a> Every evil principality and power has been spoiled.<a name=7:11></a> Christ is victorious and triumphant.<a name=7:12></a> And He is exercising His power now from the right hand of God to subdue to Himself in grace those who have been His enemies.<a name=7:13></a> He subdued His great adversary Saul of Tarsus and led him in triumph.<a name=7:14></a> And He has done the same for tens of thousands who once refused to bow the knee at His Name.<a name=7:15></a> We may well say, 'Hallelujah!<a name=7:16></a> What a Saviour!<a name=7:17></a>'

		"He stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?<a name=7:18></a>" (verse 9).<a name=7:19></a> The thought of <i>unchallenged supremacy</i> seems to be suggested in these words.<a name=7:20></a> At this moment Christ is in unchallenged supremacy at "the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:22">1 Peter  3:22</a>.<a name=7:21></a> The only creature who does not own the supremacy of Christ is fallen and lost man.<a name=7:22></a> Hence that solemn word: "He that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:36">John  3:36</a>.<a name=7:23></a> But ere long every knee will have to bow at His Name.<a name=7:24></a> The supremacy of the Lord Jesus will have to be owned by every heavenly, earthly, and infernal being, <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:9">Philippians  2:9</a> - 11.<a name=7:25></a>

		There may seem to be a good deal of similarity between this portion of Scripture and <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>, but really there is a great difference between them.<a name=15:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>it is really more a history than a blessing, though it is said in verse 28 that "he blessed them".<a name=15:2></a> Judah represents the victorious power by which blessing is brought in, and Joseph is a type of Christ as the one in whom all blessing is established.<a name=15:3></a> It is true that we see in Gad, Asher, and Naphtali a figure of the blessing of those who are brought into the good of what God has brought to pass by Christ as the victorious accomplisher of His will (Judah) and in Christ as the risen and glorified One -- the Administrator of all His blessing to men (Joseph).<a name=15:4></a> But, along with this, the moral ruin of man, and his entire failure even in presence of the grace of God, are fully developed -- the first in Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, and the second in Zebulun, Issachar, and Daniel.<a name=15:5></a> All this gives <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>the character of a history -- a history, indeed, of God's perfect and blessed ways in Christ on the one hand, but of man's ruin and failure on the other.<a name=15:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>it is all blessing; every tribe gets a distinct blessing, and it is important to notice that it is "the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel", (verse 1).<a name=15:7></a> There is a great contrast between Jacob and Moses.<a name=15:8></a> Jacob was the man of experience -- the man of ups and downs -- the man who had proved in his own experience what the flesh was and also the recovering power of God's salvation.<a name=15:9></a> He was just the man to give the whole history of how the responsible man breaks down so that everything has to be established in Christ.<a name=15:10></a> But the man of experience cannot give the full and proper blessing of the saints; it needs the man of God to do that.<a name=15:11></a> Solomon was a man of experience, and he could write the book of Ecclesiastes to show that everything under the sun is vanity.<a name=15:12></a> But it needs a man of God like Paul to unfold a Person whose glory eclipses the brightness of the mid-day sun, and scenes of heavenly blessing which are above the sun.<a name=15:13></a> It is the man who is with God, and who knows God's thoughts, who can unfold those thoughts in all their blessedness.<a name=15:14></a> We see something of this in the chapter before us.<a name=15:15></a>

		Verse 3 is the standpoint from which everything is viewed in this chapter.<a name=16:9></a> "Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words".<a name=16:10></a> From such a standpoint as this the saints can only be viewed as in full blessing.<a name=16:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, God loves His people.<a name=16:12></a> Nothing can change that sovereign love.<a name=16:13></a> We may have to learn what poor things we are -- breaking down at every point -- but the love of God knows no change.<a name=16:14></a> That love is not only the source but the security of our blessing.<a name=16:15></a> God is working to gratify His own heart, and will not fail to accomplish His purpose.<a name=16:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, "all his saints are in thy hand".<a name=16:17></a> Christ has secured every blessing for the saints by His death, and all the blessing He has secured is established in Himself, but He also holds every saint of God in His mighty hand; and in this way we are kept for the blessing.<a name=16:18></a> He not only holds the blessing for us, but He also holds us for the blessing.<a name=16:19></a> God has One to whom He has entrusted the maintenance of everything that is for the satisfaction of His own heart.<a name=16:20></a> If you have proved that everything fails in your hands, it will be an immense comfort to you to see how everything is maintained in the hand of Christ.<a name=16:21></a>

		Reuben comes first among the tribes, as in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>.<a name=17:3></a> There his wickedness is in view, but here we get the thought of sovereign mercy which would put away the sin.<a name=17:4></a> "Let Reuben live, and not die".<a name=17:5></a> When David was brought to repentance and confession after his great sin, the prophet's word to him was "The Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:13">2 Samuel  12:13</a>.<a name=17:6></a> So that it seems to me we get the thought of forgiveness in what is said of Reuben.<a name=17:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32:1">Psalm  32:1</a> - 5 forgiveness is presented in a very blessed way, and also the exercise through which the soul passes on the way to it.<a name=17:8></a> Then in verse 6 we see that a man is forgiven that he may be godly.<a name=17:9></a> No one leads a godly life in this world until he knows that his sins are forgiven.<a name=17:10></a> "There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared".<a name=17:11></a> The one whose transgression is forgiven comes out in a new character in this world as a "godly" man.<a name=17:12></a> He is set free in conscience to take this new course.<a name=17:13></a> The epistle to the Romans develops this very fully.<a name=17:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads on to the blessing of Judah (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:7">Deuteronomy  33:7</a>).<a name=17:15></a> "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies".<a name=17:16></a> This corresponds with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32:6">Psalm  32:6</a>, 7.<a name=17:17></a> Dependence becomes characteristic of the one whose sins are forgiven, and this finds expression in prayer, in answer to which God comes in with deliverance from all our spiritual enemies.<a name=17:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The soul is then ready for service and priestly approach to God, the thought of which is suggested in the blessing of Levi (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:8">Deuteronomy  33:8</a> - 11).<a name=17:19></a> Not only are our sins forgiven in view of a godly walk in this world, but in view of approach to God: This comes out in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#6">Psalm  6</a>.<a name=17:20></a>5: 3 - 5, which is very much on the line of the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=17:21></a> In Romans the believer is cleared according to the righteousness of God, that he may walk in a godly way in this world; in Hebrews he is purged according to the holiness of God that he may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Three things are connected with Levi which might almost be spoken of as three notes of the assembly -- intelligence, edification, and worship.<a name=18:5></a> The Thummim and Urim represent intelligence in the mind of God; He made known His mind and pleasure in the Thummim and Urim.<a name=18:6></a> Then as being intelligent in God's mind they were to teach His people (verse 10), and this answers to edification.<a name=18:7></a> And, finally, they put incense before God, and whole burnt-offerings upon His altar, and in this we get the thought of worship.<a name=18:8></a> These three things are intimately connected with approach to God.<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many do not care to go beyond the thought of forgiveness, and a godly walk in the world, but it is God's pleasure to bring us as priests into His presence.<a name=18:10></a> In approaching God we get the knowledge of His mind, and then there is edification.<a name=18:11></a> This is a great comfort.<a name=18:12></a> All may not enter into the privilege of priestly approach, but those who do are fitted to edify the whole company.<a name=18:13></a> Thus all are helped on in the same direction.<a name=18:14></a> One may be used to present God's blessed things in such a way that all are attracted and encouraged to draw near with true hearts.<a name=18:15></a>

		THE RIGHT OF REDEMPTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are no more precious words in Scripture, if we apprehend all that is involved in them, than the words, "the right of redemption".<a name=21:1></a> They are words which derive value from peculiar and unhappy conditions, because they imply that things and persons have got away from being pleasurable to God.<a name=21:2></a> But they are glorious words, because they bring out that God has a right to act under such circumstances in a way that will secure all that is due to Him, and all that is completely for His pleasure.<a name=21:3></a> Creation has not, in itself, secured God's pleasure, though it had that in view, for we know that both in heaven and earth things have come to pass that are far from pleasing God.<a name=21:4></a> But redemption provides a new ground, a new moral basis, on which God secures all that is in His own mind and heart.<a name=21:5></a> "All the counsel of God" as to the inheritance and the heirs can take effect because of this great and glorious right which is vested in God Himself -- the right of redemption.<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what comes out in the Old Testament is that the right of redemption could only be taken up by a near kinsman.<a name=21:7></a> So that God in taking up this right had in mind to do so in Man, because redemption involved purchase -- it involved that a title should be acquired of indisputable validity to take out of any hands that might hold it that which in truth belongs to God.<a name=21:8></a> But both redemption and purchase imply that the full price is paid.<a name=21:9></a> Whatever obligation has been incurred, whatever liability has come on the property or persons involved, it has to be taken up by the Redeemer.<a name=21:10></a> So that if sin and death had come in, as they have, and the pronounced sentence had gone forth, as it has, the purchase price cannot be less than will secure a full discharge from all that divine righteousness has imposed.<a name=21:11></a> A Kinsman alone can meet this -- One who as Man can pay all that is due from man, so as to be entitled to claim for God's pleasure what has become subject to dreadful liabilities.<a name=21:12></a> But it is God's right of redemption that has been taken up by Christ as Man -- one divine Person acting in this wondrous way on behalf of the Godhead.<a name=21:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this is of vast importance if we bear in mind that the right of redemption in the Old Testament had to do with the inheritance.<a name=21:14></a> And the inheritance in the New Testament covers all that is in the purpose of God's love to bestow on His sons and children, who are said to be His heirs.<a name=21:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In suggesting this scripture it is as having in mind that it is God's way to bring out His thoughts in greater fulness in a day of departure.<a name=22:1></a> The book of Joshua gives typically the beginning of our dispensation -- a people going into the land as risen with Christ, able to overcome all their enemies by the power of God, and take possession of their inheritance.<a name=22:2></a> That was verified in the early days of the assembly, particularly in the apostles.<a name=22:3></a> But God reserved for a very dark day the bringing out of His great thought to take up a Man into the heavens, and to have Him represented here by those who have a double portion of His Spirit.<a name=22:4></a> And with that in view He would show that the power by which the Jordan could be crossed was still amongst His people.<a name=22:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives Elijah a most important place in the ways of God.<a name=22:6></a> No other man in Old Testament times was ever taken into the heavens.<a name=22:7></a> Of Enoch the account in Genesis is that "he was not, for God took him", and the comment of the Spirit in the New Testament is that he "was translated that he should not see death", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>.<a name=22:8></a> God's victory over death was set forth in him; as I understand it, he sets forth the truth of eternal life rather than the thought of being taken to heaven.<a name=22:9></a> But Elijah is distinctly a pattern of Christ as taken into heaven, and known there in a day of apostasy, while Elisha sets forth that there is a vessel of testimony here with a double portion of His Spirit.<a name=22:10></a> "And it came to pass when Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens".<a name=22:11></a> So that Elijah is more than a type of Christ; he is a pattern, for he was actually taken into the heavens, the only such man in the Old Testament.<a name=22:12></a> There are scriptures which speak prophetically of Christ as ascended and at the right hand of God; and types of Him as the heavenly One, such as Melchisedec, Isaac, and, to a certain extent, Aaron, but the only man actually taken into the heavens in the Old Testament is Elijah.<a name=22:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This took place in a very dark day, for it was soon after the death of Ahab, and Jezebel was still alive, so that it distinctly refers to what may be known in a day of great departure; it indicates precious light reserved in the mind of God for a day of apostasy.<a name=22:14></a> However dark the day, God is not diverted

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that the first verse of this chapter tells us that Elijah went with Elisha, intimating to us that Elisha's spiritual education is the great point in the chapter, and this makes it very distinctly applicable to ourselves.<a name=23:2></a> God would show in that dark period of Israel's history that the power in which the Jordan was crossed was still available for His people, and God would impress us in our day that all the power that was evidenced in the resurrection and ascension of Christ is available to be known in spiritual reality by the saints today in spite of the apostasy around.<a name=23:3></a> It shows how Christ is to be learned today, so that it is very cheering.<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:51">Luke  9:51</a>, "And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled".<a name=23:5></a> Those days had not yet fully come, but they had come in the mind of the Spirit.<a name=23:6></a> God would have the gospel history to be viewed as standing in relation to the One who was to be received up, and we must ever bear in mind that it is a Christ received up into heaven that we know, and in whom is all our blessing.<a name=23:7></a> Exercise as to this is to go on continually, for every saint in this dispensation has to learn for himself Christ as in heaven, and the Spirit as here, if he is to be in the mind of God.<a name=23:8></a> It is most important that we should learn the Christ thus, and be instructed in Him.<a name=23:9></a> Paul's great desire was, "that I may know him".<a name=23:10></a> We must know Him in heaven, and then as having a double portion of His Spirit we become competent to represent the heavenly Man down here.<a name=23:11></a> This is the great divine instruction for a dark day like the present.<a name=23:12></a> Someone has said that nothing will do for the darkest day but the brightest light.<a name=23:13></a>

		Our spiritual education in view of knowing Christ in heaven proceeds on the lines suggested by the four places visited by Elijah and Elisha.<a name=23:14></a> The starting point of this journey was Gilgal -- the place of circumcision, where the flesh is seen to be absolutely cut off.<a name=23:15></a> However feeble we may be in our apprehension of it, the circumcision of the Christ is a great divine reality; it is what was effected in His death.<a name=23:16></a> So that it is viewed in Colossians as a completed thing; in Christ we are circumcised; it is, as Paul says, the putting off of the body of the flesh.<a name=23:17></a> This has been effected in the death of Christ, and it is applied to us by a divine operation -- a circumcision not done by hand.<a name=23:18></a> Circumcision, as often noticed,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Elisha was tested at every stage of the journey, and in the Lord's way with us we are all tested as to how far we are prepared to go with Christ.<a name=24:3></a> Elisha here is representative of those who in remnant conditions come to know Christ as in heaven, and to have a double portion of the Spirit here.<a name=24:4></a> It is evident that Elisha got something which was unknown in Israel generally, and not even known personally by the sons of the prophets, though they had some light as to it.<a name=24:5></a> There are those today who have descended from men who had light from God, but they are now unbelieving as to Christ in heaven, and the Christian profession generally is about as dark as Israel was in Elisha's day.<a name=24:6></a> I trust we have spiritual desire to have something which will distinguish us from what surrounds us.<a name=24:7></a> If we love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption we shall be prepared to go all the way, but we may expect to be tested.<a name=24:8></a> As the work of God proceeds in us we are prepared to go from stage to stage; we would like to go all the way as Elisha did.<a name=24:9></a> God would stir up any heart that has become slack to go in heartily for the knowledge of Christ in heaven, and the full virtue of a double portion of His Spirit here.<a name=24:10></a> These things have to be gone in for.<a name=24:11></a> The sons of the prophets did not go in for them.<a name=24:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we have learned the lesson of Gilgal then we can go on to Bethel.<a name=24:13></a> When man after the flesh is shut out God comes in, and He delights to come in wherever there is room for Him.<a name=24:14></a> Bethel would suggest to a spiritual mind the thought of divine faithfulness.<a name=24:15></a> God pledged Himself there not to leave Jacob until He had done what He had spoken to him of.<a name=24:16></a> It was there that Jacob had his name Israel confirmed, and Jehovah talked with him.<a name=24:17></a> At the present time God's house is the assembly of the living God; He is active there, and He speaks.<a name=24:18></a> The inner shrine of the temple was called the oracle; the great thought was that God spoke there.<a name=24:19></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35:10">Genesis  35:10</a> - 15 it is mentioned several times that God "talked with him".<a name=24:20></a> Bethel was the place where divine communications were made; God dwells in His house so as to communicate His mind.<a name=24:21></a> So that Bethel has a most important place in relation to our knowing Christ in heaven.<a name=24:22></a> If God talks to us now, it will be about a risen and heavenly Christ, and the assembly

	<div class="paragraph">
		The greatest thing in the assembly is what God says to us.<a name=25:8></a> We are apt to think that worship is the greatest thing, but surely what God is pleased to say to us is greater than what we can say to Him.<a name=25:9></a> If we listen to His speaking we shall be detached from human thoughts and sentiments; we shall be filled with what is of God, and this will produce worship.<a name=25:10></a> In all our meetings we should be exercised to hear what God is saying in His house.<a name=25:11></a> Any saint is truly glorified if he becomes the vessel through whom God communicates.<a name=25:12></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>speaks of a member being glorified, and all the members rejoicing with it.<a name=25:13></a> It is a great glory to be a suited vessel for divine communications in the house of God.<a name=25:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then they go on to Jericho, which answers, I suppose, to "the gates of hades" in the New Testament; it was where the great power of the enemy was overthrown.<a name=25:15></a> God would remind us that the gates of hades cannot hinder Him; He will deal with every power that obstructs His way of blessing.<a name=25:16></a> Jericho represents the world on the intellectual side as marked by reasonings and high things that lift themselves up against the knowledge of God.<a name=25:17></a> The overthrow of Jericho means that the world is judged in all its dark thoughts of God.<a name=25:18></a> In John's gospel and in Colossians we move with Christ as to all this.<a name=25:19></a> Then we prove that there is power resident in Christ to overthrow in our souls every element of the world that would obstruct spiritual prosperity and progress.<a name=25:20></a>

		Finally, they came to Jordan.<a name=26:6></a> Death has to be learned in all the intensity of its power, and that can only be learned in the death of Christ.<a name=26:7></a> This is, perhaps, the deepest lesson of all.<a name=26:8></a> It is death viewed as bringing out all the power that is inherent in Christ so that He may have His own in association with Himself.<a name=26:9></a> The Lord, at the end of the gospels, led His own to Jordan.<a name=26:10></a> He was risen, and they could be risen with Him.<a name=26:11></a> What a sense they must have had of the power of life in Him by which He could bring them over Jordan with Him!<a name=26:12></a> They had not the doctrine of it as yet, but they experienced the reality of it, and when they had the Spirit, and learned Christ as in heaven, they could interpret their experience.<a name=26:13></a> The great lesson for us now is to learn Christ as in heaven.<a name=26:14></a> All the preciousness of what there is in Christ in heaven is for us to learn now.<a name=26:15></a> He knows how far we are prepared to go in for this.<a name=26:16></a> He would have us all to move together in continuous exercise on this line.<a name=26:17></a> These movements cover the ground of spiritual education in a day of apostasy, the result being that we are qualified to represent Christ here as having a double portion of His Spirit.<a name=26:18></a>

		The ark of the covenant is the most remarkable symbol to be found in Scripture, for, though it was a material thing, it was the actual seat of Jehovah's presence amongst His people.<a name=28:1></a> He is repeatedly said to dwell between the cherubim, and He said to Moses, "And there will I meet with thee, and will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, everything that I will give thee in commandment, unto the children of Israel", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:22">Exodus  25:22</a>.<a name=28:2></a> The ark is said to be God's strength and glory (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>), and it is called "the ark of thy strength", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=28:3></a> But the history of the ark shows us that the greatest privilege that can be conferred upon man only becomes the occasion to bring out the evil that is in man's heart.<a name=28:4></a> When Israel had the ark in their midst they dishonoured it by their high places and graven images, and yet they assumed that it would help them against their enemies!<a name=28:5></a> This only resulted in the ark itself being given into captivity.<a name=28:6></a> This shows that, apart from His sovereignty in mercy, the nearer God comes to men the more will He be dishonoured, and this was fully proved when He was manifested in flesh in the Person of Jesus.<a name=28:7></a> If His glory and His thoughts of blessing are to be known He must undertake the whole matter Himself.<a name=28:8></a>

		It is instructive to consider the difference between the place which David prepared for the ark in Zion and the place to which Solomon brought it in the most holy place in the house.<a name=29:4></a> The first was a provisional place of rest, but the house was a permanent resting-place, for the staves being drawn out indicated that the ark was not to be carried again.<a name=29:5></a> We learn from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>that Zion contemplates need in man, for it is written, "I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy ones with bread".<a name=29:6></a> "Life for evermore" comes in on this line as relieving men from the pressure of death.<a name=29:7></a> The true David has taken the stronghold of Zion, and made it His own city; He has overcome every power that stood in the way of God's grace being made known to men.<a name=29:8></a> The kingdom is set up, and all its benefits are available, and God can rest in what Christ has done, and in what He has brought in for men, and all this answers to Zion.<a name=29:9></a> It is made known in the glad tidings to men, and those who believe the glad tidings can be said to have come to mount Zion.<a name=29:10></a>

		Blessed as Zion is, it is not the culmination of God's thoughts.<a name=30:11></a> David was right in desiring that the ark should not remain "under curtains", for Jehovah said to him, "Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#6:8">2 Chronicles  6:8</a>.<a name=30:12></a> But the house was to be built by one of whom Jehovah said, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:13">1 Chronicles  17:13</a>.<a name=30:13></a> This was a prophetic declaration that the full thought of God could only be brought in and established by One in the relationship of Son to Him.<a name=30:14></a> The Spirit of God has greatly magnified in recent years amongst the saints the truth of the Lord's sonship, and this has been in view of God's great and blessed thoughts being brought out in their completeness and finality.<a name=30:15></a> Solomon bringing the ark up to its place in the house indicates typically that the full thought of God is reached.<a name=30:16></a> The ark being brought into "the oracle of the house", verse 7, suggests the full revelation of God's mind; it is very much Christ as seen in the gospel of John.<a name=30:17></a> For His body being spoken of as "the temple" in that gospel links on with what is before us in the type.<a name=30:18></a> Then Paul speaks of

		Paul's announcement of "all the counsel of God" in the epistle to the Ephesians answers in the New Testament to the ark being brought to its rest in the most holy place.<a name=31:4></a> For there is nothing beyond, or more holy than, what we have presented there.<a name=31:5></a> God is bringing the saints of the assembly by Paul's ministry into the most blessed nearness to Himself with regard to Christ's place before Him.<a name=31:6></a> For the ark in the "oracle of the house" is where God's mind is most fully made known.<a name=31:7></a> Paul speaks of completing the word of God, and the full thought of the oracle is reached by the revelation of the mystery to him, and by his ministry of the assembly.<a name=31:8></a> Now the crowning point is to see Christ's blessed place in relation to it all, and this seems to be typified by the bringing of the ark into the most holy place.<a name=31:9></a> This brings about that the saints are filled even to all the fulness of God.<a name=31:10></a> There can be no further movement beyond this; it brings us to the permanent resting-place of divine love; we touch what is eternal.<a name=31:11></a> So that we can but exclaim, "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages.<a name=31:12></a> Amen".<a name=31:13></a>

		The hallowing of all the priests without observing the courses (verse 11), seems to intimate that a much more extended and expanded service is in view at this point.<a name=34:3></a> When the ark is brought into its place, the idea of "courses" gives place to the general or universal service of the assembly.<a name=34:4></a> "All saints" are brought in in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, and the climax of all is glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus".<a name=34:5></a> This regards the assembly as moving Godward in its completeness and unity.<a name=34:6></a> This is the divine ideal, and it should be ever before us.<a name=34:7></a> It is seen typically in the levites, the singers, and the priests and trumpeters being "as one".<a name=34:8></a> "It came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving kindness endureth for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud, and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God", verses 13, 14.<a name=34:9></a>

		I ventured to suggest the reading of this scripture, dear brethren, because in the types we are considering in Chronicles we are brought to a point when the Spirit of God tells us that there was nothing in the ark save the two tables, suggesting that it is possible to reach a point spiritually when Christ is regarded only from the standpoint of the will of God.<a name=35:1></a> I thought that was the teaching of it for us.<a name=35:2></a> That is, that the will of God has been fully and permanently secured in Christ, and by means of Christ He is going to displace everything else; so that even those matters which are essential for us as regarded in the wilderness, and in responsible service, are no longer in view.<a name=35:3></a> The golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod that budded are no longer found in the ark; they are there in Hebrews in the wilderness setting, but not in the ark when it is brought to rest -- nothing remains there but the will of God.<a name=35:4></a> I read the New Testament scriptures to develop that.<a name=35:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was evident that manna was the provision of grace for the wilderness, and we all know how essential that is from day to day; and the rod that budded was the token of Christ's blessed priesthood, and we know our need of it, especially in any service Godward, for we could not possibly do without it.<a name=35:6></a> But the Spirit of God suggests a point when they both go out of sight and there is nothing but the will of God secured in complacency and eternal restfulness in Christ and through Christ.<a name=35:7></a> The passage suggests that point being reached by us, not the mere abstract thought that it is so, but that the saints come to the blessed reality of the moment when all that belongs to divine grace in the wilderness is left and another scene entered which is filled with something more blessed than anything belonging to the wilderness.<a name=35:8></a> I suppose it is normally reached in assembly privilege.<a name=35:9></a> There is a moment reached when the priesthood of Christ merges in His headship.<a name=35:10></a> In the millennial day He will be a Priest upon His throne, but there is no thought of His priesthood continuing in eternity, because priesthood contemplates contrary conditions where priestly support is needed.<a name=35:11></a> Of Aaron it was said, "He shall serve me in the priest's office".<a name=35:12></a> There is a moment when what is official ceases and what is permanent as to Christ remains.<a name=35:13></a> The moment is reached typically when priesthood

		The object in reading <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>was to show how God detaches us from all that system of things that does not answer to His pleasure; while the passage in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>shows what were the purposes of good pleasure that lie in the will of God, into which we are brought by grace.<a name=36:7></a> The two put together give us an apprehension of what is the will of God.<a name=36:8></a>

		The mystery of His will comes out in verses 8 - 10.<a name=38:15></a> That is, we get an inner circle first upon which the will of God has put a most blessed impress; "holy and without blame before him in love", and "marked out beforehand" for sonship.<a name=38:16></a> Then there is a wider circle which takes in everything in heaven and on earth.<a name=38:17></a> That is the mystery of His will; it is millennial; it is the administration of the fulness of times, not eternity.<a name=38:18></a> There is going to be a wonderful administration.<a name=38:19></a> Figures known on the world's stage today are passing shadows; that is, they are things only here for a moment and they are going out.<a name=38:20></a> But Christ is going to be the centre in whom all will be headed up.<a name=38:21></a> It is a mystery now, because only the saints know it, but it is well known to them because God has made it known to us.<a name=38:22></a> Verse 8 supposes that the greatest capacity of intelligence belongs to the sons.<a name=38:23></a> If we are in this most blessed relationship, He looks for capacity in the sons so that His own wisdom and knowledge can be communicated to them -- a wonderful thing!<a name=38:24></a> Paul prayed that the saints might be equal to it.<a name=38:25></a> It is one thing to see it, another to be equal to it.<a name=38:26></a> We can only arrive at that through prayer.<a name=38:27></a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>we see the Lord prophetically in His pathway here, but looking forward to resurrection, fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.<a name=42:7></a> That is, He is looking forward to what He has now entered upon in heaven.<a name=42:8></a> It is another important aspect of the truth that Jesus being at the right hand of the throne of God is the answer to what He was here.<a name=42:9></a> We sing sometimes of "the path of worth which led up to the throne".<a name=42:10></a> He had subsisted in the form of God before He became Man, but He was found here in a path of humiliation as Man, in contact with all the conditions and circumstances which saints have to meet, and He went through all in such a way that there could only be one answer to it on God's part, and that was resurrection and a place at the right hand of His throne.<a name=42:11></a> "At thy right hand are pleasures for evermore".<a name=42:12></a> That was the answer to His wondrous path of worth; the throne, we may say, has awarded Him that place.<a name=42:13></a>

		"In view of the joy lying before him" He "endured the cross, having despised the shame".<a name=42:14></a> In Jesus we see in absolute perfection a life which was morally entitled to resurrection.<a name=42:15></a> It was the perfect expression of that which in the saints is the life of faith.<a name=42:16></a> It is well to consider this psalm, because we are apt not to think enough of the importance of the responsible life in its relation to resurrection.<a name=42:17></a> There was a character of life in Jesus as Man here on earth that could not be left in death; it could not be left out of God's resurrection world.<a name=42:18></a> But the life of Christ as set forth in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>is also, in all its moral features, the normal life of His saints.<a name=42:19></a> It is possible for us, through infinite grace, to move in the life of Jesus in our responsible life; that is, in dependence, obedience, separation from the world and its idolatry, delighting in the saints, having joy in God and in the inheritance which His love has conferred upon us.<a name=42:20></a> That is the life of Christ morally, and it culminates in resurrection and heaven.<a name=42:21></a> As we sing sometimes,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This raises the question whether we are living in the responsible life so that there is what is morally suitable for resurrection.<a name=43:6></a> It is evident that this thought is in Scripture, for we read, "those that have practised good, to resurrection of life", and we read of "the resurrection of the just".<a name=43:7></a> Such a life must be characterised, even as it was in Jesus, by overcoming the world.<a name=43:8></a> And this is essential, not only in view of resurrection ultimately, but in view of our walking together in Christian fellowship here.<a name=43:9></a> We walk with the saints as delighting in them, even as the Lord said of them in this psalm, "In them is all my delight".<a name=43:10></a> We delight in those who walk in obedience, dependence, separation from the world, and who have their joy in God, because we are exercised to move on that line ourselves.<a name=43:11></a> There is no true Christian fellowship except on this line, and it leads morally to resurrection and heaven.<a name=43:12></a> The result of working things out faithfully in the responsible life is that we are free in spirit for the resurrection sphere, and for what is heavenly, while we are together.<a name=43:13></a> We need not wait for the heavenly until we actually get there.<a name=43:14></a> The enjoyment of eternal pleasures is possible in the assembly now, but this largely depends on the character of our responsible life.<a name=43:15></a> The spiritual can only be taken up as there is moral suitability to do so.<a name=43:16></a> If we have not moved in the life of Jesus during the week we need not expect to enjoy the spiritual privileges of the assembly on the Lord's day.<a name=43:17></a> Jesus at the right hand of the throne of God is the answer to a life in which God was perfectly glorified here.<a name=43:18></a> John would remind us that, "He that says he abides in him ought, even as he walked, himself also so to walk".<a name=43:19></a> As we move on that line we shall get great enlargement in the spiritual sphere, in what is connected with resurrection and ascension.<a name=43:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything that comes from Him as ascended takes on the character of gift; it has not to be worked or paid for; it has simply to be received.<a name=44:4></a> Man has ascended up to the very highest point so as to receive gifts as Man, in connection with mankind.<a name=44:5></a> He has received all the gifts that were in the purpose of the Father's love to bestow on men.<a name=44:6></a> They are of such a character that they were suitable to be received by the ascended Man, and He has given them to men.<a name=44:7></a> This is a great administration of divine bounty, and every saint participates in the wealth conferred.<a name=44:8></a> For it is written, "But to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>.<a name=44:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of Christ ascending suggests that He has liberty to move to the very highest point.<a name=44:10></a> Indeed, He went in His own personal right "above all the heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=44:11></a> This is, of course, His own unique place.<a name=44:12></a> But in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>He speaks of ascending to His Father and our Father, and to His God and our God.<a name=44:13></a> His leading captivity captive was in view of our being liberated to move up with Him into this blessed position and relationship.<a name=44:14></a> If we understood that, it would set us free to speak to the Father and to God; there would not be the lack of liberty which there often is.<a name=44:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He "has given gifts to men .<a name=44:16></a>.<a name=44:17></a>.<a name=44:18></a> for the perfecting of the saints".<a name=44:19></a> A double portion of Christ's Spirit is given in connection with His being taken up into heaven, but in addition to this He has given gifts for the perfecting of the saints.<a name=44:20></a> These gifts express in an effective way the victorious power and wealth that subsists in Christ in heaven.<a name=44:21></a> It is for us all to recognise this, and to discern gifts which give us an impression of Christ in heaven.<a name=44:22></a> Such gifts are to be clearly distinguished from what is the product of human ability or training.<a name=44:23></a> They are gifts of the ascended Christ, and they are all enriching in a spiritual wealth that belongs to heaven.<a name=44:24></a> To disregard Christ's gifts is to disregard Christ, for they are His gifts of love to us.<a name=44:25></a> As we value Christ in heaven we value what He gives, and we value His gifts because they perfect us in the knowledge of Him in heaven so that we may be developed as

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the psalm we see a further thing.<a name=45:10></a> The ascended Christ having received gifts in Man, and even for the rebellious, is for the dwelling there of Jah Elohim.<a name=45:11></a> Notwithstanding the rebelliousness that has marked man in all stages of his history, it is the fixed thought of God to dwell among men.<a name=45:12></a> He would secure for Himself a place amongst men.<a name=45:13></a> This is brought out in the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=45:14></a> The gentiles are "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:22">Ephesians  2:22</a>.<a name=45:15></a> The apostle's prayer was "that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:19">Ephesians  3:19</a>.<a name=45:16></a> The title "Jah Elohim" suggests God as known in His absolute supremacy.<a name=45:17></a> It is noticeable that there is a militant note in this psalm.<a name=45:18></a> "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them: it is a Sinai in holiness".<a name=45:19></a> The militant thought also appears in captivity being led captive.<a name=45:20></a> There are powers in the universe acting in opposition to God, but He has taken up the challenge, and by means of Christ He has spoiled them, making a show of them publicly, and leading them in triumph.<a name=45:21></a> It is God known in complete triumph over evil, in connection with an ascended Christ, who dwells in and amongst His saints.<a name=45:22></a>

		A beautiful feature of this psalm is that the affections of the saints are portrayed here abstractedly in unmixed purity.<a name=47:7></a> That is, we are in presence of a state of soul where nothing whatever is active but the heart's engagement with an Object -- or objects -- which are most delightful.<a name=47:8></a> It is not that the speaker or singer himself is viewed in the psalm as a participator in what he describes.<a name=47:9></a> It is in no way what the King has done for him, or the relation in which he stands to the King.<a name=47:10></a> He is simply the composer or the singer, abstracted for the time from any thought of himself, but having a heart welling forth with a good matter touching the King.<a name=47:11></a> He does not think of himself as in the scenes which he describes, but his heart is full of what he describes.<a name=47:12></a> It is a peculiarly blessed experience in which no subtle element of self remains to intrude upon the delight which love finds in an Object, or objects, which give it supreme satisfaction.<a name=47:13></a> I think God would have us more often in this happy abstractedness from ourselves; not thinking exactly of our part in the precious things made known to us by the Spirit, but thinking of the delightfulness of the things in themselves.<a name=47:14></a> When we reach that point we have the truest participation in the things.<a name=47:15></a> It seems to me that "Upon lilies" in the title of this psalm has reference to the purity of affections which can look at things in this abstracted way.<a name=47:16></a> It

		This psalm is what an instructed heart has learned touching Christ; a heart, too, that has proved mercy in being delivered from the doom of apostasy, for the psalm is "Of the sons of Korah".<a name=49:1></a> Such a heart wells forth with a good matter; it does not think of itself, or of its own blessings, but gives itself to composing something touching the King.<a name=49:2></a> What I can compose concerning Christ is really the measure of my spiritual wealth.<a name=49:3></a> Composing suggests a careful and considered production, and this should be the character of what is said in the assembly.<a name=49:4></a> I do not mean that one should prepare a form of words to utter in the assembly, but what one says there should be the outcome of what we have considered.<a name=49:5></a> The understanding enters into it, so that "five words" may be much more profitable than a long discursive utterance.<a name=49:6></a> But the heart is welling forth; it is not a cold mental composition.<a name=49:7></a> But it is orderly, and there is a flow about it; the psalmist compares his tongue to the pen of a ready writer.<a name=49:8></a> We have all noticed in writing how one thought suggests another, and one thought flows into another.<a name=49:9></a> I believe this is the divine way in spiritual composition: it is in blessed contrast with formal utterance.<a name=49:10></a> The first chapter of Ephesians gives a wonderful example of spiritual composition.<a name=49:11></a> From verse 3 to verse 14 is all one sentence; then from verse 15 to chapter 2: 7 is another sentence.<a name=49:12></a> It would be very difficult to put a full stop in anywhere to break the flow of connected thought.<a name=49:13></a> I think it would suggest the kind of utterance which might have fallen from Paul's lips in the assembly.<a name=49:14></a> It seems to me that in the assembly there should be a definite flow; the Spirit being referred to as a river would suggest this.<a name=49:15></a> That is, there would be spiritual continuity; not a sudden break on to something else, but each contribution linking on with what has preceded it.<a name=49:16></a> It would be well sometimes if a brother did not go too fast or too far, but should leave room for some one to go farther.<a name=49:17></a> The "five words" principle would lead us to think that we need not attempt to cover all the ground that is possible.<a name=49:18></a> If the saints are to be instructed and edified, the ground covered by ministry must not be too extensive.<a name=49:19></a> We have to be sober in considering what capacity there may be to receive.<a name=49:20></a>

		It seems to me that we have in Simeon the thought of one who was at the very centre of divine things; "there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon".<a name=53:2></a> God would have us, beloved brethren, to cherish the thought of being at the centre of divine interests.<a name=53:3></a> Alas!<a name=53:4></a> our hearts are too ready to be content to be at a distance, but why should we be found at Dan or Beer-sheba if it is possible to be in Jerusalem?<a name=53:5></a> After the return from captivity "the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city", <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#11:1">Nehemiah  11:1</a>.<a name=53:6></a> Nine out of every ten were content to dwell in their cities away from the divine centre, and yet they recognised that Jerusalem was the favoured spot, for they blessed those "that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem".<a name=53:7></a> This shows that even in times of recovery there is danger of missing the greatest privilege of the moment.<a name=53:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would press on my own heart, and on the hearts of others, that we should really live at the centre of things in a spiritual sense.<a name=53:9></a> It cannot be denied that at the present time the assembly, and the great reality of the presence of the Holy Spirit, are the very centre of all that has divine importance, and yet how many believers live practically at a distance from that centre.<a name=53:10></a> It is sorrowful to think how much they miss.<a name=53:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This "man in Jerusalem" was marked by the fact that "the Holy Spirit was upon him".<a name=53:12></a> Even in Old Testament times God called attention to certain individuals who were said to have the Spirit, or to have the Spirit upon them.<a name=53:13></a> This must have suggested to every pious Israelite the possibility of such a thing.<a name=53:14></a> It was clearly in God's mind that His Spirit should be upon men.<a name=53:15></a> Thinking of those favoured men every pious Israelite must have been ready to say, Would that it had been me!<a name=53:16></a> But such a favour was not within the reach of all then.<a name=53:17></a> It was not until Jesus was glorified that the Holy Spirit became available for all who believe on Him.<a name=53:18></a> And this, indeed, in a much more blessed way than any Old Testament saint, or even Simeon himself, could know (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>, 17).<a name=53:19></a>

		But the very fact that it is so is intended to raise exercise.<a name=54:1></a> We are told of the five prudent virgins that they "took oil in their vessels with their torches".<a name=54:2></a> It was their exercise to be thus furnished.<a name=54:3></a> The Holy Spirit is available on the divine side; there is no restriction, no limitation, on that side.<a name=54:4></a> Indeed, the Old Testament promise, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost, that the Spirit would be "poured out" on all flesh, showed how extensive was the thought of God.<a name=54:5></a> But on our side the Lord has suggested that we should "take oil" in our vessels.<a name=54:6></a> The Holy Spirit is the gift of God, but a gift is to be received, and many scriptures speak of the reception of the Spirit, and I do not think it is ever supposed that this takes place unconsciously.<a name=54:7></a> What God does sovereignly is His matter; I dare say He often gives the Spirit to believers on the Lord Jesus who have had little exercise about the Spirit, but normally He would give souls exercise about this great gift, so that it is not a matter in which they have part without their being aware of it.<a name=54:8></a> God would have His gift valued.<a name=54:9></a> The Lord suggested to the woman at the well the wonderful character of God's giving, and His own giving, but He brought in a condition on her part.<a name=54:10></a> "Thou wouldest have asked .<a name=54:11></a>.<a name=54:12></a>.<a name=54:13></a> he would have given".<a name=54:14></a> The gift of the Spirit, as announced in the glad tidings, becomes the subject of faith; that is, we come to it in the faith of our hearts that it is in the mind and love of God to give us His Spirit.<a name=54:15></a> So we are encouraged to put in our claim with confidence; if we have received Christ as the gift of God, we are entitled also to receive the Spirit as His gift.<a name=54:16></a>

		But we cannot contemplate the gift of the Spirit without realising that it necessitates moral suitability on the part of the recipient.<a name=54:17></a> The Spirit could be upon Simeon without any incongruity; he was "just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel"; there was nothing about him to jar on the sensitiveness of the Spirit.<a name=54:18></a> If there are dark corners where unrighteousness is hidden, or if there is a lack of piety, the Spirit cannot be restful.<a name=54:19></a> It can hardly be said of such that their hearts are purified by faith.<a name=54:20></a> It must be remembered that the gift of the Spirit is the divine witness to a certain condition of heart.<a name=54:21></a> Peter said, "the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit .<a name=54:22></a>.<a name=54:23></a>.<a name=54:24></a> having purified their hearts by faith", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:8">Acts  15:8</a>, 9.<a name=54:25></a> Believers are said to be "according to Spirit", and to mind the things of the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:5">Romans  8:5</a>).<a name=54:26></a>

		Then Simeon's outlook was such that the Spirit could identify Himself with it; he was awaiting the consolation of Israel, he was looking for the Lord's Christ.<a name=55:2></a> The saints today are marked off from those in the world by their different outlook.<a name=55:3></a> Those in the world have no outlook that the Spirit could identify Himself with, but the saints have a divine outlook, they are looking for the coming of the Lord.<a name=55:4></a> That has been God's great objective ever since sin and death came in; it will bring all that is of God into the world.<a name=55:5></a> In Simeon's case he was, of course, awaiting the first coming of Christ; it is ours now to await His coming the second time.<a name=55:6></a> None are in harmony with the Spirit who are not awaiting the coming of Christ.<a name=55:7></a> To be out of harmony with the Spirit is to disregard His presence.<a name=55:8></a>

		Then the Holy Spirit made communications to Simeon; He made known to him "that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ".<a name=55:9></a> We are living in a wondrous time, for the Spirit is even now making communications to the saints.<a name=55:10></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>- 16 the Lord enlarged upon the way in which the Spirit would make divine communications.<a name=55:11></a> Clearly this was in the first place to those who had been with the Lord in the days of His flesh, but they were of our company, and what they got was for us.<a name=55:12></a> The Comforter brought to their remembrance all the things which Jesus had said to them.<a name=55:13></a> There must have been much more in that than has been recorded in the Scriptures.<a name=55:14></a>

		Overcomers today are marked by having an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies.<a name=55:15></a> I wonder if we are habituated to hearing what He is saying?<a name=55:16></a> We may be quite sure that He will never say anything contrary to the Scriptures, or that cannot be substantiated from the Scriptures, but He can bring out the mind of God in a way that never would have been gathered from the Scriptures alone apart from His speaking.<a name=55:17></a> The Spirit has always something to say to the assemblies.<a name=55:18></a> Speaking is characteristic of each Person of the Trinity, and this is in a special way the time of the Spirit's speaking.<a name=55:19></a> I think it possible that when the time comes for the assembly to be translated the Spirit may communicate to many that they will not see death.<a name=55:20></a> One would covet to be amongst those thus favoured of God, but whether

		We do not wonder that Simeon "blessed God", and we may well bless Him for all that He has brought within our range.<a name=57:8></a> It is of all importance that we should be at the centre of what is of God.<a name=57:9></a> Christ and the assembly are at the centre; the assembly is the body, the fulness, the completeness of Christ.<a name=57:10></a> If we are really in mind and affection at the centre the Spirit will have His way with us; we shall get communications such as no worldly or carnal believer could know anything about.<a name=57:11></a> The whole moral universe comes within the scope of the communications of the Spirit, and it is the privilege of the saints of the assembly to dwell, as it were, at the very centre.<a name=57:12></a> Hence the apostle prayed that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height".<a name=57:13></a> If Christ personally dwells in our hearts what is of Him in His members -- His body down here -- will have a very great place with us.<a name=57:14></a> We shall then look at the saints according to what they are potentially, and we shall desire that what they are potentially as called ones they may be substantially as formed by the Spirit in the features of Christ.<a name=57:15></a> It is evidently of immense importance that Christ should come out in His body in a substantial way; that is, as morally and spiritually formed in His members here.<a name=57:16></a> May the Lord help us in regard to these things!<a name=57:17></a>

		I wanted to read a few of the words of our Lord.<a name=58:1></a> These Scriptures are in my mind as standing in connection with what we have been reminded of lately -- the importance of love to our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=58:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think in these five utterances, which as we know, are the first recorded utterances of our Lord, we get what might be regarded as a full and complete presentation of what He is in Himself -- what He is inwardly.<a name=58:3></a> We know that painters have tried to put upon canvas their ideas of the Lord's outward appearance, but none of us trust their ideas.<a name=58:4></a> None of us would like to have a picture of the Lord Jesus on the walls of our houses, for we could not be at all sure it was really like the Lord at all.<a name=58:5></a> And if we were sure it was exactly like what He was outwardly, it would not supply any ground of love to Him.<a name=58:6></a> There is no genuine love to the Lord Jesus except as we apprehend what He is inwardly.<a name=58:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the first scripture we find that the Lord was assured that Mary and Joseph ought to have known that He would be occupied in His Father's business, or as the margin reads, "that I ought to be in the things of my Father".<a name=58:8></a> Now we do not know the Lord at all until we understand that.<a name=58:9></a> He was a boy of twelve, but He was in the consciousness of sonship, He could speak of "my Father", and of being in the things of His Father.<a name=58:10></a> That is what makes Him so different from every other man, what marked Him off from everything in the world.<a name=58:11></a> He was wholly absorbed and occupied in the things of His Father.<a name=58:12></a> He brought those things here in His heart, so that men might know them, and He lived in them; and, if we do not love Him in that character, we can hardly be said to love Him at all.<a name=58:13></a> That is, to love the Lord as He is, we need to see Him in relation to His Father.<a name=58:14></a> But perhaps a poor sinner says, He died for my sins.<a name=58:15></a> I do not depreciate that, for it is truly what that Person conferred upon me.<a name=58:16></a> But what kind of Person is He in Himself?<a name=58:17></a> I shall never love Him until I know that.<a name=58:18></a> Gratitude in the heart of a believer for what He has done for him often does not go far; it very often stops short of love to Himself -- to His own Person, and has very little separating effect from the world.<a name=58:19></a> But if we love Him in relation to the Father, we cannot avoid being

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the Lord said in His second recorded utterance, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=59:18></a> That gives me a true thought of Himself -- His Person.<a name=59:19></a> He had before Him to fulfil all righteousness -- all that was right.<a name=59:20></a> Although with Him there was no personal cause, He would go with the men who took a right line in repentance.<a name=59:21></a> We have to love Him in that character as the righteous One, and so we must take on the same character.<a name=59:22></a> I cannot love something in Him and go on with just the opposite.<a name=59:23></a> So it separates us from the whole course of sin in ourselves and in the world.<a name=59:24></a> We have been attracted after the One who fulfilled all righteousness.<a name=59:25></a> Many believers are hung up for many years because they are not in the path of righteousness; they think they love the Lord, but they do not.<a name=59:26></a> Often a very little bit of unrighteousness will hinder us.<a name=59:27></a> So that love for the Lord Jesus is a very practical thing; it adjusts us at every turn.<a name=59:28></a>

		"Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve".<a name=60:17></a> The Lord presents Himself here as worshipping and serving God.<a name=60:18></a> No one could love the Lord Jesus Christ and not be a worshipper.<a name=60:19></a> David, the great psalmist, praised Jehovah.<a name=60:20></a> Every expression of holy worship issued from Jesus.<a name=60:21></a> So that genuine love for the Lord Jesus Christ would transform us and fashion us in moral correspondence with Him.<a name=60:22></a> Worship and priestly service are the very highest things, but we speak of them to the young convert.<a name=60:23></a> The Lord spoke of worshippers for the Father to the woman of Samaria, who was only a convert of perhaps five minutes.<a name=60:24></a> No one can be happy until he is set in worshipful relationship with God.<a name=60:25></a> Christ came into manhood to be the model of how the worship and service of God is rendered in the highest.<a name=60:26></a>

		It is the glory of God to bring in life where death has been, so that in the place where death is, and in persons who have been under death, the power of life is made to appear.<a name=61:1></a> So there is something very special and distinctive about the three instances in which the Lord brought persons out of death.<a name=61:2></a> No doubt they were intended to set forth what God was doing, and going to do, in a spiritual way.<a name=61:3></a> The daughter of Jairus, the widow's son, and Lazarus all lived by reason of the power of life which was in Christ.<a name=61:4></a> In none of the cases could there be any movement, or even any desire, on their part.<a name=61:5></a> Others might be concerned about them, but nothing could be initiated by them.<a name=61:6></a> The power of life is in Christ alone, and He brings into evidence that it is so, and it is in every case applied sovereignly.<a name=61:7></a> Life in a spiritual sense is always the result of a sovereign acting of God; it is a manifest proof that God has acted.<a name=61:8></a>

		In the three different instances referred to, life manifests itself in three different ways.<a name=61:9></a> We read of the damsel that she "arose and walked"; of the young man at Nain that he "began to speak"; and of Lazarus that he "was one of those at table with him".<a name=61:10></a> These are evidences of life which it is well to consider.<a name=61:11></a>

		Three striking cases are put together by the Spirit of God in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#5">Mark  5</a>; the man possessed by a legion of demons, the woman with the issue, and the dead damsel.<a name=61:12></a> In the first we see the power of the Lord to deliver from evil in extreme and violent forms.<a name=61:13></a> In the second we see how He can meet cases of long-continued exercise about sin in the flesh.<a name=61:14></a> But in the third we see a setting forth of the form which His gracious work often takes in the children of His people.<a name=61:15></a> Such have been brought up in an atmosphere of love, and shielded from much of the evil that is in the world, but their parents long to see in them the evidence of life.<a name=61:16></a>

		One special feature of the Lord's work in relation to His testimony today is that He is taking hold of the hand of the children, and speaking to them, so that they begin to move in life.<a name=62:10></a> The first movement in life is a wonderful thing -- something done in relation to God and to His people that is spontaneous in the one who does it.<a name=62:11></a> It is good to do what one is told to do, but life has always spontaneous movements of its own.<a name=62:12></a> God has been pleased to let us know that there were such movements on the part of Jesus at the age of twelve, and the incident in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#5">Mark  5</a>would indicate that He is minded to initiate such movements in a child of twelve.<a name=62:13></a> "And having laid hold of the hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise".<a name=62:14></a> It was all from His side.<a name=62:15></a> God refers to the covenant as a taking of the people by the hand, but, if He takes by the hand when there is nothing with us but death, the whole matter must be from His side.<a name=62:16></a> The soul has to understand this.<a name=62:17></a> The epistle to the Romans shows how God takes man by the hand when he has been proved to be under sin and death.<a name=62:18></a> When we were in that state, righteousness and life were ministered to us through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=62:19></a> The very spirit of all that is in God's heart towards us has been expressed in Him, and it is brought into the heart of man by the gift of the Spirit.<a name=62:20></a> The saints are God's called ones; they are the called of Jesus Christ; He has taken hold of them personally, and because of His personal touch and call the power of life comes into their souls.<a name=62:21></a> And all this is as true of a child of twelve who becomes the subject of divine working as it is of an older person.<a name=62:22></a>

		How happy it is when parents and disciples can see that a true desire to please the Lord is active in the children!<a name=63:8></a> Instead of unruliness there is now a spirit of subjection; instead of the Lord's things being a bore they begin to be attractive; His people are loved and their company sought; it becomes a pleasure to render little acts of service; there is contentment without the pleasures of the world, and preparedness to bear a little reproach for the name of Jesus.<a name=63:9></a> All these things are evidences of a walk in newness of life which are not beyond the measure of a child of twelve.<a name=63:10></a>

		The Lord "desired that something should be given her to eat".<a name=63:11></a> When movements in life are seen it is most important to supply food to nourish the life that is there.<a name=63:12></a> Do not let us think that young people cannot appreciate the food of God's house.<a name=63:13></a> They can appreciate it, and often they get its value more fully than some who are older.<a name=63:14></a> It is interesting to think of the age of twelve as a time when there may be definite movement of soul occasioned by personal exercise before God.<a name=63:15></a> I believe a child of that age may be competent to distinguish between what is of the flesh and what is of the Spirit, and may have power in life to walk according to the Spirit and to refuse what is of the flesh.<a name=63:16></a>

		THE TRANSFIGURATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the transfiguration Jesus was seen in glorified conditions, and He was apprehended as such by men who were not yet personally outside the domain of death.<a name=69:1></a> The transfiguration in Matthew, Mark and Luke seems to correspond in a certain way with what the Lord speaks of in John as the manifestation of Himself to an obedient lover.<a name=69:2></a> This gives it a most attractive place as indicating a great spiritual privilege of this present time.<a name=69:3></a> We have accepted that the incidents of the Lord's pathway, as presented in the gospels, have a spiritual counterpart at the present time.<a name=69:4></a> The transfiguration is the crowning point in that wondrous unfolding of God's triumph in Jesus, though it does not indeed belong to this world at all, and hence was not to be spoken of until the Son of man were risen.<a name=69:5></a> The triumph of God in Jesus was not limited to meeting all the need that was here: it included man being placed in conditions of glory.<a name=69:6></a> The kingdom of God really starts from the point that God has glorified His Servant Jesus; He has received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and has shed Him forth.<a name=69:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three accounts of the transfiguration in the three gospels are of the nature of a full testimony to the kingdom before it is known publicly.<a name=69:8></a> In Matthew what belongs to the future is brought into the present; it is the kingdom in prospect.<a name=69:9></a> In Mark it is the kingdom come in power, and this is seen in the exceeding whiteness of His garments -- the power of the kingdom being repellent of every soil of evil.<a name=69:10></a> It is the kingdom viewed in its present moral power of righteousness and holiness.<a name=69:11></a> In Luke it is the kingdom as seen in pattern in Jesus, for the change in Him comes about as He prayed, and His departure is the subject of converse.<a name=69:12></a> It is a glory which is connected with dependence and a going-out from life in this world.<a name=69:13></a> It is the kingdom of God as in moral contrast with what is here, and the way in which we come into it.<a name=69:14></a> He could be transfigured to manifest who He was, but He would also be transfigured by way of dependence, so as to be pattern for us.<a name=69:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see the kingdom in its supremacy in Matthew; in its moral purity in Mark; and in Luke we see the way in which its glory is reached.<a name=69:16></a> In other words, we see Jesus supreme in the rights of His Person, and supreme in moral excellence, and supreme as leading in the way that ends in glory.<a name=69:17></a>

		In the kingdom things are not given indiscriminately; they are assigned sovereignly on the principle of selection.<a name=70:1></a> This comes out in Matthew particularly, as we see in things being revealed to babes, in Peter being selected for special revelation, and to have the keys; also in the eleventh hour labourer, and His right hand and left being reserved for those for whom it is prepared, and also in the distribution of the talents.<a name=70:2></a> So three being selected to view the Lord transfigured indicates that the matter in hand is to be the subject of testimony.<a name=70:3></a> Jesus has been seen actually by Stephen and Paul since He was received up in glory; but the three on the holy mount saw His majesty beforehand.<a name=70:4></a> He could take on the majesty of His kingdom before His death, for it belonged to His Person so that He could be changed from the condition of His humiliation into the condition of glory, and be seen in that condition by mortal eyes.<a name=70:5></a> It was a question of what was going to be maintained in testimony, and of what was fully adequate for this.<a name=70:6></a> It would link with the "two or three" in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=70:7></a> The present time is the time when things are secured in Christ Himself, and an adequate testimony being secured to this on the principle of selection.<a name=70:8></a>

		There is great spiritual gain in the consideration of our Lord Jesus Christ in every aspect in which Scripture presents Him to the view of faith; and the above scriptures call our attention to Him as being lifted up and being buried.<a name=77:1></a> The Spirit of God has linked the two thoughts together in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:22">Deuteronomy  21:22</a>, 23.<a name=77:2></a> Being hanged on a tree refers to one as "lifted up", and the thought of burial is closely connected with this.<a name=77:3></a>

		In the light of this we can see how important the cross is as the universal testimony of God to men.<a name=79:12></a> Paul and John are in perfect harmony as to this.<a name=79:13></a> Paul came to the Corinthians announcing the testimony of God, and he said, "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>.<a name=79:14></a> The great thing in preaching is "that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain"; that is, emptied of its true meaning.<a name=79:15></a> There is wonderful meaning in the lifting up of Christ on the cross, and its real force is to be brought home to men.<a name=79:16></a> "The word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power".<a name=79:17></a> Christ crucified is "to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness; but to those that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:23">1 Corinthians  1:23</a>, 24.<a name=79:18></a> When this testimony comes to men "in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" it brings them clean out of the world.<a name=79:19></a> It is a testimony that can only be truly presented in spiritual power; hence Paul came to Corinth in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, not that he was afraid of the Corinthians, but he feared lest some element of human wisdom should come in to mar his service.<a name=79:20></a>

		We gather, further, from <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:23">Deuteronomy  21:23</a>, that one who has been publicly exposed, as become a curse, is viewed as a defilement to the land.<a name=80:1></a> Hence it is written, "thou shalt in any wise bury him that day .<a name=80:2></a>.<a name=80:3></a>.<a name=80:4></a> thou shalt not defile thy land".<a name=80:5></a> No doubt it was as having this scripture in mind that the Jews were anxious that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, <a href="../bible/John.htm#19:31">John  19:31</a>.<a name=80:6></a> But there is divine instruction in the ordinance, and it gives the burial of the Lord an important place.<a name=80:7></a> As having been identified with sin and curse -- as bearing it vicariously -- the burial of the Lord was necessary that the very condition in which He was made sin might pass completely out of sight.<a name=80:8></a> So long as He was exposed upon the cross what was in public evidence was One in the place of sin and curse.<a name=80:9></a> His death did not remove Him from that position publicly, but His burial did, and He never reappeared in the condition in which He was made sin.<a name=80:10></a> The condition which He had taken up as coming into holy manhood, in which He could bear sin and die, went out of sight when He was buried, and as raised from the dead He is in a new condition to which neither sin nor death could ever be attached.<a name=80:11></a> Viewing this matter in the light of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:23">Deuteronomy  21:23</a> we can understand why the burial of Christ is included in the glad tidings which Paul preached, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:4">1 Corinthians  15:4</a>.<a name=80:12></a> The condition in which Christ was made sin went out of God's sight in His burial, and this is of immense importance when we consider all its consequences in their bearing on those who love Him.<a name=80:13></a> Burial is viewed in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:23">Deuteronomy  21:23</a> as removing defilement from the land.<a name=80:14></a> When seven of Saul's descendants were hanged before Jehovah for his sin against the Gibeonites, it was when they had been buried we are told, "afterwards God was propitious to the land", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#21:14">2 Samuel  21:14</a>.<a name=80:15></a> The sentence having been executed, and the condition in which it was executed having been removed from God's sight in burial, the matter was righteously ended.<a name=80:16></a> The Christ on whom we have believed is One who has not only died, but who was also buried.<a name=80:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to bear in mind that when the Spirit of God by Paul draws attention to Christ as descending, He does not stop short of burial.<a name=80:18></a> For His burial is clearly the full depth of His descent according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:9">Ephesians  4:9</a>, 10.<a name=80:19></a> "But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=80:20></a> He that descended is the same who

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John the vessel is not mentioned, but we are told that "Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus".<a name=82:7></a> I believe that in the setting of this gospel the Spirit of God would lead us to regard Mary herself as the vessel.<a name=82:8></a> She had stored up in affectionate appreciation, a wealthy knowledge of One who was so great personally that He had descended from Godhead's fullest glory that He might go down to the lower parts of the earth.<a name=82:9></a> He was descending to burial, and He took account of her as having kept her ointment for the day of His preparation for burial.<a name=82:10></a> One who could so descend must necessarily ascend up where He was before, and regarded thus in His personal greatness it is fitting that His feet should be anointed and not His head.<a name=82:11></a>

		It is important to notice that the reference to the Lord descending into the lower parts of the earth is in the epistle to the Ephesians, for that epistle gives us the full height of things, and also the full depth.<a name=82:12></a> Indeed, we have the "depth and height" particularly mentioned in it, chapter 3: 18.<a name=82:13></a> "The lower parts of the earth" must be understood as indicating where the might of God's strength wrought in the Christ, as we read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a>, 20.<a name=82:14></a> The apostle prays that we may know "the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead".<a name=82:15></a> The mighty power of God acted in those "lower parts of the earth" into which Christ had descended in love, so that His burial really took Him to the point which would witness to the fullest expression of the might of God's strength.<a name=82:16></a> I do not know that we have anywhere

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The resurrection of Christ is a far greater expression of divine power than creation.<a name=83:9></a> In creation God spake and it was done.<a name=83:10></a> There is no suggestion of any extraordinary exertion of divine power in creation, but the words used in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a> do suggest the exercise of extraordinary power on God's part.<a name=83:11></a> God would have us to ponder this.<a name=83:12></a> It is necessary that He should give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him so that we may know this power, and understand that it is "towards us who believe".<a name=83:13></a> But the fact that Paul prayed for it for the saints is evidence that God is willing to give us this enlightenment.<a name=83:14></a>

		A further result of the burial of Christ is its bearing on those who love Him.<a name=83:15></a> We are never to forget that He has been buried here, and that His burial was a matter that brought into activity the affections of His lovers.<a name=83:16></a> The world that lifted Him up was not allowed to make provision for His burial.<a name=83:17></a> Men did indeed appoint His grave with the wicked, but God would not allow that appointment to stand.<a name=83:18></a> In retaining the Lord's burial in the hands of lovers it seems as though God would say to every lover of Christ, This is a matter for you to be concerned about; how do your affections move in regard to it?<a name=83:19></a> We have seen how Mary's affections moved in relation to His burial, and in Joseph of Arimathaea we see one who took up publicly and wholeheartedly the position of identification with Christ in burial.<a name=83:20></a> This was his great privilege, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are four great desires in the prayer.<a name=99:6></a> First, that His own might be kept in the Father's name: "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we".<a name=99:7></a> The Son was here to declare the Father's name.<a name=99:8></a> That name had been given to Him that He might make it known to men.<a name=99:9></a> This was the work which the Father had given Him to do.<a name=99:10></a> The thought of the Father's name was the last thing before Him ere He went to the cross (verse 26), and it was the first thing before Him as the risen One, <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=99:11></a> The Father gave His name to the Son that He might reveal it.<a name=99:12></a> The depths of infinite divine grace and love and holiness-for it is "Holy Father"-are in that name, and all was given to the Son that He might make it known.<a name=99:13></a> In going into death the Lord had before Him the unspeakable suffering of that hour when sin must be dealt with according to divine holiness, but it was from the Father's hand that He took the cup, and He took it that the glory of the Father's name might appear.<a name=99:14></a> His great thought was, "Father, glorify thy name" <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:28">John  12:28</a>.<a name=99:15></a> Sin was to be put away, reconciliation effected; but, above and beyond all, the Father's name was to come out in its glory of grace.<a name=99:16></a> This was the supreme thought in the heart of the Son of God as He drew near to death.<a name=99:17></a> Do we think enough of this, beloved brethren?<a name=99:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as to the world the desire of the Son of God is, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil", verse 15.<a name=100:6></a> How does the Father keep us out of evil?<a name=100:7></a> I am assured that it is by filling us with what is supremely good.<a name=100:8></a> "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth".<a name=100:9></a> The truth is in a living Person, and the Father would make that Person to our hearts the embodiment of everything worth knowing.<a name=100:10></a> The taint of evil is upon the best things in the world, but good in absolute perfection-even the perfect setting forth of the blessed God-is in Christ.<a name=100:11></a> There is preservative power in the knowledge of Him to keep us out of all the evil here.<a name=100:12></a>

		"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth".<a name=100:13></a> He was ever morally separate from the evil of the world, but now He has taken a place, as the risen and glorified One, entirely apart from it.<a name=100:14></a> His death, in that sense, was the moment of His entire separation from the scene and circumstances where sin was.<a name=100:15></a> He is wholly apart from all that is evil, and He is in that holy sanctification at God's right hand that the knowledge of Himself there may keep us out of all the evil here.<a name=100:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 21 there is a third desire: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=100:17></a> I trust we may know more of that blessed unity in the divine nature in which the Son of God would have all His own to be.<a name=100:18></a> These are feeble days, and the practical realisation of unity is much hindered, but there is unity in the divine nature.<a name=100:19></a> In every bit of true knowledge of the Father and the Son there must be unity.<a name=100:20></a> It is "that they also may be one in us".<a name=100:21></a> If believers know the Father and the Son they come into this unity, for wherever the knowledge of the Father and the Son is there must be unity of a profoundly real nature.<a name=100:22></a> It is the knowledge of divine Persons that brings

		One is thankful to be reminded, as we have been, of the importance of prophetic communications, for they are, I think we might say, communications of the mind of heaven at any particular moment.<a name=105:1></a> Nothing is more to be desired than to be recipients of communications that give us the present mind of heaven, and as being of the assembly we are in a position and in relationships which make it a delight to God to communicate His mind to us.<a name=105:2></a>

		I ventured to read these three scriptures because Peter and Paul and John were men who were of great interest to heaven, and the Lord did not leave them without the communication of His mind.<a name=105:3></a> In each case they received communications; two of them relative to the beginning of things in the assembly period, and John receiving what refers specially to the close of that period, which brings the experience of John in a definite way to our own time, and to ourselves.<a name=105:4></a> What I have specially in mind relates to what our brother referred to as the capacity to receive.<a name=105:5></a> We may be assured that heaven is ready to communicate; that is, divine Persons are ready to communicate; but the more special and exalted the communications are the more special is the condition of soul that is required to receive them.<a name=105:6></a> I feel as to meetings of this character (I may say this is the first of such a character at which I have been privileged to be present) that spiritual capacity to communicate will be found perhaps in two or three, but it is of immense importance that spiritual capacity to receive shall be found in all, otherwise these meetings will fail of the divine intent.<a name=105:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice that in each case these great servants of God speak of special communications, but at the same time they call attention to special conditions on their part which qualified them to receive divine communications.<a name=105:8></a> Peter speaks of it very simply to the brethren; he says, "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision".<a name=105:9></a> Paul tells the crowd at Jerusalem that as he was praying-notice again, as he was praying-he became in ecstasy: and John, who is the vessel of the divine communications and prophetic word of the last days, uses corresponding language; he says that he "became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=105:10></a> These statements

		are not to be regarded lightly, because I cannot suppose that ecstasy is limited in the divine mind to the apostles, nor that being, as John says, "in the Spirit" is restricted.<a name=106:1></a> What I understand by it is that, if we are to be spiritually capable of receiving communications from heaven, there must be a state and abstraction of mind which would somewhat correspond with what is referred to in Scripture as "ecstasy".<a name=106:2></a> I do not mean to suggest anything mystical or fanciful, but a sober, spiritual reality; and we may notice, as helpful to us in this regard, that the prayers of Peter and of Paul tended to ecstasy.<a name=106:3></a> It is a fine suggestion for us, beloved brethren: it was private prayer, whether on the housetop or in the temple, but the prayers of these two great servants led to ecstasy.<a name=106:4></a> I take it that ecstasy is a condition in which the mind is abstracted from the natural and human influences that would normally act upon our minds and our spirits.<a name=106:5></a> Ecstasy implies complete freedom from all that, and indicates a state which makes room for the reception of the mind of heaven.<a name=106:6></a> I am sure we are all convinced that such a state is extremely desirable, indeed it is essential, if we are to have prophetic communications in the assembly.<a name=106:7></a> Such communications are of such an exalted character that they require entire immunity from the influence of the conditions that normally act upon us here.<a name=106:8></a> It is encouraging to note that private prayer on the part of Peter and Paul tended to that condition; so that the importance of prayer in relation to such meetings as this is very great.<a name=106:9></a> We should come to them from intercourse with God, and with our minds free in a special way.<a name=106:10></a> There are special things and states in Christianity as well as what is, I may say, ordinary in a spiritual sense; and we should cultivate that special condition of soul that is peculiarly free to receive divine communications.<a name=106:11></a> Paul, as we know, speaks in another scripture, of being beside himself to God.<a name=106:12></a> One covets the realisation of such a state as that; it is very much the thought of "ecstasy".<a name=106:13></a> The soul is free from self-consideration and thus prepared for the communication of God's mind.<a name=106:14></a>

		Then John's experience brings us to our own time, because, as we know, the revelation of Jesus Christ refers to the end of the assembly period, and to that which will follow.<a name=107:5></a> John tells us in chapter 1 that the things are "shortly to come to pass", and he says, "the time is at hand", so that the Revelation is to be read as specifically applying to the very time in which we find ourselves now.<a name=107:6></a> Here is a blessed servant of God suffering for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ, and that is the moral qualification to receive further light.<a name=107:7></a> I believe that at the present time those who have received light from God are those who have been prepared to suffer for what they already know.<a name=107:8></a> I believe if any Christian is prepared to suffer for what he knows, he will get communications from heaven.<a name=107:9></a> They come to people who value the things of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ so far as they may have understood it, and who are prepared to suffer for it.<a name=107:10></a> Such persons do not find it difficult to become "in the Spirit".<a name=107:11></a> John says, "I became in the Spirit".<a name=107:12></a> He is not referring to the Christian state as described in the eighth chapter of Romans, but to something special.<a name=107:13></a> I believe, dear brethren, we ought to lay ourselves out for what is special.<a name=107:14></a> As being "in the Spirit" John gets wonderful communications; and these communications, so far as they relate to our period, relate to local assemblies, bringing out the special interest of the Lord in local assemblies.<a name=107:15></a> Chapters 1 and 22, the beginning and the end of this book, make clear that the Lord has before Him the thought of local assemblies.<a name=107:16></a> It is not the truth in a general way, or abstractly, but it is the thought of the truth of the assembly as worked out in a concrete way in localities.<a name=107:17></a> I think we must accept that; and I take it, beloved brethren, that what is prophetic in any local company or companies

		I believe we have very little idea of the importance to divine Persons of our coming together (no matter how few or how feeble outwardly) in the light and faith of the original and unchanging mind of God with regard to His people.<a name=108:10></a> As thus coming together the prophetic word will confirm every exercise that is of God.<a name=108:11></a> I would say in this connection that ecstasy does not set aside personal exercise.<a name=108:12></a> We find in the case of Peter and Paul that personal exercises came into expression even when in ecstasy.<a name=108:13></a> We find these two great servants (just like the brethren of today) not at once prepared to receive divine communications.<a name=108:14></a> They both reasoned against the divine communications, and entered good arguments against them.<a name=108:15></a> So you see the element of personal exercise goes on; but if we are really in a state which at all corresponds with ecstasy we shall not find it difficult to judge any action of our own minds and our own wills.<a name=108:16></a> These great servants were not disobedient to the heavenly visions; they accepted the light.<a name=108:17></a> As we walk together in local assemblies we find that exercises come along, and they test and humble us.<a name=108:18></a> The effect of divine communications in a day of departure must always be humbling; they will always have the effect they had upon

		My thought was to add a word as to the spiritual condition that would give us capacity to receive communications of the mind of heaven.<a name=109:4></a> It is an extraordinary moment, because one cannot think that the Lord will leave any part of the truth altogether ineffective before He translates the assembly to Himself.<a name=109:5></a> He will make every part of the truth effective, and He will make it effective in local companies; so that this has a very practical bearing on us as walking together in local fellowship.<a name=109:6></a> The Lord will help us as to His mind, even though we may have to fall at His feet as dead.<a name=109:7></a> I feel sure I am speaking to many who, like myself, have had to taste in some small measure an experience like that.<a name=109:8></a> But we have always found, and shall find, that the One who searches is the One who supports, and He teaches us that we can only follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, as calling upon Him out of a pure heart; that is, He alone is our resource and strength.<a name=109:9></a> If He gives us the mind of heaven, it will search and expose a great deal that has been in ourselves, but He will make Himself adequate and sufficient for us, so that in the very last moment of the assembly's history there may be something very bright for Himself.<a name=109:10></a>

		In view of the great elevation of the divine purpose, the apostle turns to God in prayer for us (for we can put our own names in here), that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give us the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, being enlightened in the eyes of our hearts.<a name=132:10></a> Could anything be greater than the knowledge of divine Persons?<a name=132:11></a> How such acquaintance would raise the tone of our minds, and regulate our every thought.<a name=132:12></a> Nothing base would be tolerated for a moment; it would prepare us for something further, and there are three petitions proffered for us.<a name=132:13></a> First, that we might know what is the "hope of his calling".<a name=132:14></a> What is the hope of His calling?<a name=132:15></a> Is it not all the vast scope of God's purposes connected with the church?<a name=132:16></a> The vista of glory, excelling glory in endless succession throughout the ages of ages.<a name=132:17></a> That as I understand it is the hope of His calling!<a name=132:18></a> All will subsist in the value of redemption; every purpose in the heart of the eternal God rests upon that indestructible basis, the death of Christ.<a name=132:19></a>

		If inwardly delivered so that Christ is magnified in us, we find ourselves in a scene of contrariety where all kinds of pressures come on the people of God.<a name=137:8></a> Paul says, "we were excessively pressed beyond our power, so as to despair even of living".<a name=137:9></a> He speaks quite simply about it, making no attempt to hide the fact that he felt the pressure intensely.<a name=137:10></a> It is a mark of spiritual shallowness not to feel pressures that come upon us.<a name=137:11></a> Paul did not affect to be above feeling the pressure, but he met it by taking the ground that he had the sentence of death in himself.<a name=137:12></a> He was already, as to his own mind, as good as dead, and if that were so everything hung on "God who raises the dead".<a name=137:13></a> The greatest pressure of all is death; it may even be "so great a death".<a name=137:14></a> But Paul's trust was not in himself-the sentence of death was there-but in God who raises the dead.<a name=137:15></a> If we were actually dead no one could do anything for us but God, and if we are excessively pressed beyond our power, so as to despair even of living, the only One to whom we can look is God; He raises the dead.<a name=137:16></a> God is not baffled even if His saints are killed, for He raises the dead; He holds the master key.<a name=137:17></a>

		It is interesting to observe how this blessed Person forms the link between God and His saints.<a name=145:9></a> The fact that God's Son is our Lord gives us a link with God, and it is our true and holy dignity as saints that in the midst of the world of the ungodly, we have a blessed link with God as revealed in grace and love.<a name=145:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin", verse 6.<a name=146:5></a> "Our old man" is the man in whom was found the activity of self-will.<a name=146:6></a> What has become of that man?<a name=146:7></a> There is not room in the universe for two independent wills; God's will must be supreme.<a name=146:8></a> The man in whom is the activity of self-will was condemned and crucified with Christ.<a name=146:9></a> Faith brings the knowledge of this into the believer's soul, and the effect is that he judges his own will and all its activity.<a name=146:10></a> Instead of glorying in it, and seeking to give effect to it in every possible way, the believer is afraid of his own will.<a name=146:11></a> He recognises it as evil and condemned.<a name=146:12></a> The only will he can trust is God's will.<a name=146:13></a> In this way the body of sin is annulled, and henceforth the believer does not serve sin.<a name=146:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<a name=146:15></a> Likewise reckon ye also your-selves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord", verses 10, 11.<a name=146:16></a> This supposes that the affections are so set upon Christ that we are prepared to take account of ourselves as being in the same relation to things as He is.<a name=146:17></a> He has died to the whole sphere where man's will is active-that is, to the world socially, politically, and religiously.<a name=146:18></a> If we love Him we shall not care to go on with things in which He has no place, and in which He takes no part.<a name=146:19></a>

		In verse 18 we see two classes.<a name=152:5></a> To one class the preaching of the cross is foolishness; to the other class it is the power of God.<a name=152:6></a> If men love the present system of things and the principles that are characteristic of this age, they must regard the word of the cross as foolishness, because it makes nothing of all the things which to them are of value and importance.<a name=152:7></a> But such are perishing.<a name=152:8></a> Their life is in a system of things which is utterly doomed.<a name=152:9></a> The world, with all its political, educational and social schemes, is under the judgment of God.<a name=152:10></a> But to those who love it, and have their life in it, to say this seems the height of folly.<a name=152:11></a>

		Believers are "called" to find their every blessing in Christ Jesus, chapter 1: 30.<a name=153:18></a> This chapter is of immense importance, because it shows, on the one hand, how man in the flesh is excluded, and, on the other, it presents a complete system of divine blessing in another Man-that is, in Christ Jesus.<a name=153:19></a> God has called us into blessing that is altogether of Himself, and in relation to this blessing we have to trace our origin to God.<a name=153:20></a> We are "of him".<a name=153:21></a> The first and every succeeding impulse in our souls towards Christ was "of God".<a name=153:22></a> Spiritually speaking every Christian has derived his being directly from God.<a name=153:23></a>

		This scripture has for its subject the question of eating or not eating what was sacrificed to idols: we may find great matters brought before us in connection with it.<a name=156:1></a> Indeed it is characteristic of Scripture that great things are often developed in connection with exercises, comparatively small in themselves, which arise in the pathway of the saints.<a name=156:2></a> For instance whether a woman is to cover her head when she prays is seen to involve the whole truth of headship.<a name=156:3></a> Again the question of going to law before the tribunals of the world is seen to call in question the fact that saints are called to judge the world and angels.<a name=156:4></a> So we find this question of eating meat offered to idols raises the question of the place divine Persons have in the affections of the saints.<a name=156:5></a> It was with the thought of considering this that I suggested reading this Scripture.<a name=156:6></a> We should all admit that there could be nothing greater, or of more practical importance, than the thought of the place divine Persons have in our affections: the apostle shows the contrast between knowledge and love, and it is important to note that.<a name=156:7></a> All of us here tonight have knowledge.<a name=156:8></a> The apostle says, "We all have knowledge": that is, we know a good deal about God, but that does not give us recognition with God.<a name=156:9></a> "If any one love God, he is known of him".<a name=156:10></a> I may know a great deal but one would desire to be marked by that of which God can take account, to be characterised by what has value with God.<a name=156:11></a> "If any one love God, he is known of him"-there is some-thing there that God can recognise-God can be truly known in a nature that suits Him.<a name=156:12></a> The Lord raises these questions with us; for instance He tells us that in a coming day many will profess to know Him: "Have we not prophesied in thy name?<a name=156:13></a> and in thy name have cast out devils?<a name=156:14></a> and in thy name done many wonderful works?<a name=156:15></a>" but He says, "I never knew you".<a name=156:16></a> This raises a serious consideration.<a name=156:17></a> I may say, I know God and I know the Lord, but the question of real importance is, Does the Lord know me?<a name=156:18></a> Is there anything in me that God can recognise as being of Himself?<a name=156:19></a>

		THE DYING OF JESUS

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:10">2 Corinthians  4:10</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "dying" or "putting to death" of Jesus is an expression not found in any other scripture.<a name=167:1></a> It seems to intimate that such features as were seen in Jesus could only meet with death here; they were not such as to be approved in this world; the answer which men gave to them was that they put Him to death.<a name=167:2></a> This was ever before Him from the outset of His service here, and particularly as the hatred of men became more and more manifest towards the close of His ministry.<a name=167:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul was "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus"; it was not merely in his heart, or in his mind, but "in the body".<a name=167:4></a> It refers, I think, to his readiness to accept bodily suffering in carrying on the service of the glad tidings.<a name=167:5></a> His gospel was "of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God", and God had shone in his heart "for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=167:6></a> This treasure was in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power might be of God, and not from the vessel.<a name=167:7></a> There was to be the full setting forth of God, but this, in a world of darkness and evil, meant suffering for the vessel.<a name=167:8></a> It had been so when the Vessel was a divine Person here in holy manhood as Jesus.<a name=167:9></a> His blessed and perfect service was answered by His "putting to death".<a name=167:10></a> Now this was always borne about in Paul's body, for that body had become in a very special way the vessel of divine treasure; the outshining of the glory of Christ and of the glory of God was in his ministry.<a name=167:11></a> But then this involved correspondence with Jesus, in whom the service of divine love to men was perfect.<a name=167:12></a> It had meant "putting to death" for Him, and it meant for Paul a daily dying (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:31">1 Corinthians  15:31</a>), a working of death in him, and a consuming of the outward man in the service of love.<a name=167:13></a> His body carried the evidence of his devotion to that service, even as he bore in it "the brands of the Lord Jesus", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:17">Galatians  6:17</a>.<a name=167:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The bearing about in Paul's body of the dying of Jesus, and the manifestation in his body of the life of Jesus, went together.<a name=167:15></a> The life of Jesus was a life spent in the service of love, with no issue here but "putting to death".<a name=167:16></a> Paul desired that that life might be manifested in his body; he accepted that it involved death here; but he knew what the issue would be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the life of Jesus divine love was in activity, and, in speaking of the life of Jesus being manifested in his body, I think Paul was referring to the service of love.<a name=168:4></a> Some moral qualities may be, so to speak, self-contained, but love cannot be self-contained; it must be active towards others.<a name=168:5></a> Paul held him-self- held his body-for the activities of the service of love, and he was prepared to move on that line at personal cost.<a name=168:6></a> The service of love is always costly.<a name=168:7></a> It is affecting to see at what a cost God has reached the end which His love desired.<a name=168:8></a> The Lord Jesus in the activity of His love has effected the pleasure of God, but at the cost of death.<a name=168:9></a> Paul was in correspondence with the blessed God and with Jesus, and he was prepared for the cost; he bore about in his body the dying of Jesus.<a name=168:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is righteous and holy, but His motive nature is love; He has given expression to it at great cost; and it can only come out in His servants at the cost of suffering.<a name=168:11></a> It is a wonderful thing to appreciate "the life of Jesus", and for our bodies to become vessels for the manifestation of a life devoted to the service of love.<a name=168:12></a> It is humbling to discover that one has so little ability to take it up practically.<a name=168:13></a> If we moved on that line we should find that there are opportunities to surrender and to suffer.<a name=168:14></a> How often are we thinking of what is due to us!<a name=168:15></a> Everything was due to Jesus, but He did not consider that; His whole life was marked by dedication to the service of love.<a name=168:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is through our bodies that the life of Jesus can be manifested.<a name=168:17></a> These bodies with all their weaknesses and limitations -mortal bodies-can be vessels for that manifestation.<a name=168:18></a> Paul was in harmony with what God had before Him, and God was helping him by discipline.<a name=168:19></a> He was always bearing about in his body the dying of Jesus, and on God's part he was always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, and he was happy that it should be so.<a name=168:20></a> His intense desire was that the life of Jesus should be manifested in his body.<a name=168:21></a> This is a wonderful result of divine working.<a name=168:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's discipline comes in to help this.<a name=169:8></a> Our condition here in "mortal flesh" is one in which we are continually being disciplined by God.<a name=169:9></a> "For we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus".<a name=169:10></a> God has such delight in the life of Jesus that He will faithfully discipline those who live that it may be manifested in their mortal flesh.<a name=169:11></a> It was "on account of Jesus"-on account of His preciousness to God-that Paul was delivered unto death.<a name=169:12></a> God would have the life of Jesus manifested, and so He disciplined Paul that, through the working of death in him, that precious life might appear in his mortal flesh.<a name=169:13></a> And all will be approved in resurrection.<a name=169:14></a> If it is "the dying of Jesus" here, "he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you".<a name=169:15></a> The result will be gathered up for God, and for His resurrection world.<a name=169:16></a> The saints will be clothed presently with their house which is from heaven, but they are being morally suited for that by the development in them under divine teaching and discipline of the life of Jesus.<a name=169:17></a> God would have us much affected by the thought of it

	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose every Christian must be conscious that there is peculiar fulness and blessedness in the truth as presented in this epistle.<a name=172:1></a> We have things unfolded here as they are in the mind of God; the ministry is not limited by any consideration of feebleness or failure in saints.<a name=172:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first chapter is chiefly connected with "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory", verse 17.<a name=172:3></a> I under-stand the use of this name to convey the thought that God is the Author and Originator of a circle of things characterised by glory.<a name=172:4></a> It is a scene of glory that is brought before us where everything is headed up in Christ.<a name=172:5></a> We are brought in according to God's eternal choice, and the good pleasure of His will, to obtain an inheritance in Christ, "to the praise of his glory", verses 12, 14.<a name=172:6></a> God has marked us out for sonship in a universe of bliss.<a name=172:7></a> And as the bride of Christ the church will inherit everything in Him and with Him.<a name=172:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get the power by which all this is effected.<a name=172:9></a> There is no doubt that man has gone from the lowest place in God's universe to the highest place by "the working of the might" of God's strength.<a name=172:10></a> The Lord Jesus came into death for us, to maintain the glory of God in respect of all that we had done and all that we were, and God's mighty power came in and raised Him from the dead and set Him in the highest place in the universe.<a name=172:11></a> It is that power that is "towards us who believe".<a name=172:12></a> Nothing less than that power could take us up from death, and put us in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.<a name=172:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 we see that God has marked us out for sonship "to the praise of the glory of his grace"; and we have obtained an inheritance in Christ that "we should be to the praise of his glory"; and in chapter 2 we see how God has taken up such as we for the satisfaction of His own love.<a name=172:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"God, who is rich in mercy", comes in because of out state and condition; nothing but the wealth of mercy could have met us.<a name=172:15></a> But on God's side it is "for his great love wherewith he loved us".<a name=172:16></a> God has taken us up, not only in the depth of mercy, but to satisfy His own love.<a name=172:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Old Testament times men were not in the presence of the love of God.<a name=173:3></a> I have no doubt the Old Testament saints knew something of God as being rich in mercy, but it was impossible they could know Him in the satisfaction of His Jove.<a name=173:4></a> The reason is simple.<a name=173:5></a> The Object which alone could furnish satisfaction to the love of God was not yet revealed.<a name=173:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when the Son of God came here "the heaven was opened .<a name=173:7></a>.<a name=173:8></a>.<a name=173:9></a> and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:21">Luke  3:21</a>, 22.<a name=173:10></a> The Father's love found its perfect repose in that blessed One, and He found His repose in the love of which He was the Object-He was "in the bosom of the Father".<a name=173:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the beloved Son was alone in the presence of the Father's love.<a name=173:12></a> If we were to be brought into it He must die.<a name=173:13></a> There was necessity for our sinful flesh to be removed.<a name=173:14></a> The death and judgment due to us have come upon Him.<a name=173:15></a> Sinful flesh could not be brought into the presence of God's love, but it has been condemned in the death of Christ.<a name=173:16></a> And another thing-that condition of being-human life in flesh and blood-with which in us din and death have come into contact has been brought to an end before God in the death of Christ.<a name=173:17></a> The end of all flesh has come before God.<a name=173:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And when Christ rose from the dead it was in an entirely new state-quickened in the Spirit; a state with which sin and death never had, and never can have, any contact whatever.<a name=173:19></a> "In that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=173:20></a> He is for ever absolutely apart from every question of sin and death-having taken up all those questions once at the cross for the glory of God.<a name=173:21></a> And He now lives in resurrection in the presence of God's holy love.<a name=173:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great thing for us is to see that God would bring us to live together with Him in the presence of that wondrous love.<a name=173:23></a> To be quickened together with Christ is to be made to live in spirit outside everything that has been touched by sin or that has come under death in the presence of God's holy love.<a name=173:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How we are brought into this may be seen in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:15">John  20:15</a> - 18, 22.<a name=173:25></a> In the first place there was a ministry which gave the disciples the <i>light</i> of an entirely new association with Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mary is, in a certain way, a figure of gift; she was the great apostle of Christianity to the apostles.<a name=174:5></a> I think the Lord sent this message by a woman to show that in connection with His things <i>affection</i> is the chief qualification.<a name=174:6></a> It was love that qualified Mary to receive this message and to carry it.<a name=174:7></a> She was not required to add anything to it.<a name=174:8></a> The most important qualification of a gift is the jealousy of love that the message should not be marred in any way.<a name=174:9></a>

		When the light came to them they were affected by it.<a name=174:10></a> If we are rightly affected by divine light we shall soon get the consciousness of what is presented to us as light.<a name=174:11></a> The light conveyed in Mary's message put the disciples outside what was of man, and gathered them together with the doors shut upon the religious man according to the flesh, i.<a name=174:12></a>e.<a name=174:13></a> the Jews.<a name=174:14></a> Then the Lord came and stood in the midst, and after speaking peace to them, and showing them His hands and His side, He breathed on them.<a name=174:15></a> He imparted to them, in figure, the consciousness of being in association with Him in life.<a name=174:16></a> He would have them to know that they lived with Him in the presence of the Father's love.<a name=174:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of apprehending all this is that we come out in a new character down here.<a name=175:7></a> We enter upon our calling.<a name=175:8></a> There is one new man and one body; we have access to the Father; and we are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=175:9></a>

		It is important to see that the washing of regeneration (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3">Titus  3</a>) comes before the renewing of the Spirit.<a name=197:3></a> If I were to have a scripture to illustrate that it would be <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:37">Acts  2:37</a>, 38; we find there the people were pricked to the heart when they heard that the crucified Jesus was made Lord and Christ; and they said, "What shall we do?<a name=197:4></a>" They realised that they were all wrong, and not only so, but that they were surrounded by a people that were all wrong.<a name=197:5></a> So Peter says, "Repent, and be baptised every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", and in verse 40 he says, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation".<a name=197:6></a> I should connect the washing of regeneration with being saved from this perverse generation: regeneration is a new order of things in which to live.<a name=197:7></a> I think baptism in its true moral import is the washing of regeneration.<a name=197:8></a> In the midst of a baptised profession we have all to be exercised to learn what it really means; and we have to learn its moral import long after we are baptised.<a name=197:9></a> The reason I dwell on this is that I think the renewal of the Spirit does not operate in the old condition at all but in a new condition, in that new place into which the kindness and love of God has brought us, and in which we find the salvation which the love to man of our Saviour God has provided.<a name=197:10></a> We find it in an order of things quite apart from the perverse and darkened generation found in this world.<a name=197:11></a> No doubt the secret why the renewing of the Holy Spirit is not a greater reality to people is that they are not in the good of the washing of regeneration.<a name=197:12></a>

		Now in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>the renewing of the mind is before us.<a name=200:15></a> It is important that the minds of the saints should be renewed as well as their affections.<a name=200:16></a> There is evidently an action that goes on subsequently to the renewal of the Spirit: the renewing of the mind gives power for transformation, for it speaks of being "transformed by the renewing of your mind".<a name=200:17></a> It is the same word that is used of the Lord on the mount: "He was transfigured before them".<a name=200:18></a> It is a complete change.<a name=200:19></a> If the renewing of the mind is not followed up, there is a lack of transformation.<a name=200:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mind is presented in the epistle to the Romans in three different ways.<a name=200:21></a> In chapter 1 we have the reprobate mind: they did not think good to have God in their knowledge, so He gave them up to a reprobate mind, void of moral discernment,

		to do unseemly things.<a name=201:1></a> The state of the reprobate mind leads to doing unseemly things, and the state of the renewed mind leads to doing seemly things.<a name=201:2></a> I do not think we do anything right apart from a right condition of mind, a renewed mind.<a name=201:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get another mind in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>we might speak of it as an exercised mind, not a renewed mind, because there is no power to effect transformation.<a name=201:4></a> It is the principle of a man's mind; it speaks (verse 23) of the law of his mind.<a name=201:5></a> That is, the fixed principle in his mind was a desire to do what was right and pleasing to God, but there was no transforming power, so he could not be the good man he would like to be.<a name=201:6></a> It is a great change from a reprobate mind, but it is only an exercised mind; the man is still in bondage.<a name=201:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the renewed mind in chapter 12, it is a mind able to effect transformation, so that a man can come out openly and publicly as transfigured.<a name=201:8></a> It would result in entire absence of conformity to the world; we should be in conformity to the world that is coming presently.<a name=201:9></a> A Christian, as having his mind renewed, would be transformed, he would move through this world as a man of the world to come.<a name=201:10></a> I have often thought, What did they think in Jerusalem after the Lord's resurrection when the bodies of the saints arose and went about the city?<a name=201:11></a> What a sight!<a name=201:12></a> There should be something similar in the way the saints move about now: their thoughts and discernments are quite different from those of the people of this world, and this is the result of the one God and one Lord having their place in our affections.<a name=201:13></a> Men in the heathen world did not think it good to have God in their knowledge, and the result was a reprobate mind.<a name=201:14></a> The saints think it good to have God in their knowledge; it is their chief joy, and the result is a renewed mind.<a name=201:15></a> Their thoughts and discernments all become new, and they are outwardly transformed.<a name=201:16></a> That is the only way to produce an unworldly people-not by dressing them up from outside.<a name=201:17></a> There is always a tendency to take colour from this world, but we are to take colour from the world to come.<a name=201:18></a>

		We have already seen that in the first chapter of this epistle the Son of God is set before us in the greatness of His Person, and in all the excellence of His inherited Name as come into manhood.<a name=213:1></a> He is set before us in a personal glory which excels that of the most exalted creatures.<a name=213:2></a> And His greatness is that which gives character to the revelation which God has made of Himself in the Person of the Son, and it also gives character to the whole system of blessing which He has inaugurated; that is, to Christianity in the fulness of its blessings according to God.<a name=213:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second chapter, which is now before us, we find the same blessed Person presented in three positions-in humiliation, in supremacy, and in exaltation.<a name=213:4></a> We get now the history, if we may so say, of how the counsels of God can be brought into effect in the accomplishment of all His thoughts of blessing, so that in result Christ may be supreme in a universe of bliss when all things--the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth-shall be headed up in Him.<a name=213:5></a> We see, too, the ground on which that Blessed One can be found in the position of "leader of salvation" in reference to a company of "many sons" given to Him by God that He may bring them to glory.<a name=213:6></a> And we also learn the full privilege of the assembly as introduced by the Son to the knowledge of the Father's name, and we see the place which Christ takes with His brethren as the singer of praises in their midst.<a name=213:7></a> And, finally, He is presented to us as the Deliverer of His saints; delivering them first by power-power which annuls "him who has the might of death, that is, the devil", and which sets "free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage"-and then delivering them by His priestly grace and succour from what would otherwise be the crushing effect of the innumerable trials and pressures which are incidental to the path of faith and to our present condition of creature weakness.<a name=213:8></a>

		In the first place we learn that it is the pleasure of God that the Son of man should be supreme over all His works (verse 7).<a name=214:3></a> Adam was a figure of this, for he was placed at the head of creation to exercise dominion-God thus setting forth at the very beginning the great thought of His own mind.<a name=214:4></a> But Adam was quickly cast down from his excellency, for he proved himself to be unable to stand against the power of evil.<a name=214:5></a> Evil could and did touch him, and he fell, we might say, at the first touch.<a name=214:6></a> But if the figure has thus broken down, it is that it may give place to the substance-to that which cannot break down-to that which was in the mind of God when He created the figure.<a name=214:7></a> For I apprehend it would not be going too far to say that man in innocence was not morally suited to be set over the works of God's hands, and to have all things put under his feet.<a name=214:8></a> It was not suited to God that the universe should be set in order without every moral question having its perfect solution.<a name=214:9></a> With an innocent man at the head of creation the whole question of good and evil was necessarily in abeyance.<a name=214:10></a> Under such circumstances neither righteousness nor holiness could be displayed: the moral ordering of the universe would have been wanting in most essential particulars.<a name=214:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was in the wisdom of God to bring all these moral questions into connection with man, and eventually to solve them in the most perfect way, so that man might be set over the works of His hands.<a name=214:12></a> That is, God will set the Son of man in supremacy, that there may be in the universe the most perfect and blessed ordering of everything according to all that God is in His nature and moral character.<a name=214:13></a> Every-thing will be subjugated to the One in whom God has been glorified.<a name=214:14></a> If God undertakes to set the universe in order, we may be sure that there will not only be the ascendency of power, but the perfect setting forth of everything that is morally suited to God.<a name=214:15></a> It is evident that man in innocence (however blessed might be his state in itself) was not competent to take such a place as this, for as yet he knew not good and evil.<a name=214:16></a> And certainly it was impossible for man as fallen under the power of evil to be set in such a position.<a name=214:17></a> In short, for man to be set in supremacy over the works of God's hands involved

		Our hearts have often been comforted and elevated by the thought that we are going to be like the Son of God in His glorified condition, but it is necessary also that we should consider that in becoming Man in the circumstances in which we are "it behoved him in all things to be made like to his brethren".<a name=221:1></a>

		PHILADELPHIA'S CROWN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:11">Revelation  3:11</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord contemplates at the end of the present period an assembly that has a crown.<a name=228:1></a> Different crowns are promised to faithful individuals as a special incentive to those in labour or conflict for the Lord.<a name=228:2></a> But the crown spoken of to Philadelphia is a crown of assembly character; it is an assembly crown.<a name=228:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we consider how the "crown" is presented in the New Testament we see that it supposes the completion of what is entered upon, whether it be the athlete (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:25">1 Corinthians  9:25</a>), or the warrior (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:8">2 Timothy  4:8</a>), or the one who proves able to stand through temptation (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:12">James  1:12</a>), or the faithful shepherds (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:4">1 Peter  5:4</a>), or the assembly in Smyrna faithful unto death (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:10">Revelation  2:10</a>).<a name=228:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An assembly with a crown suggests to me saints walking together in the truth and character of the assembly.<a name=228:5></a> They have not, like Sardis, stopped short of completion; they have reached what is possible.<a name=228:6></a> I do not think we have reached that yet, but it is a glorious goal set before us--not an individual goal, but an assembly goal.<a name=228:7></a> That is, if we reach it at all we must reach it together.<a name=228:8></a> Hence the love of the brethren marks this assembly.<a name=228:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As illustrating what I mean I would refer to Stephen, whose name is the Greek word for "crown".<a name=228:10></a> He reached the highest possible point at the moment.<a name=228:11></a> An open door was set before him to know in the fulness of the Spirit an opened heaven, and the glory of God, and Jesus the Son of man standing there.<a name=228:12></a> He completed the testimony of the moment.<a name=228:13></a> He was speaking to men who knew something of a dispensation marked by angelic glory.<a name=228:14></a> It was an angel who spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, for they received the law as ordained by the ministry of angels.<a name=228:15></a> All the true glory of the dispensation that was past was concentrated in Stephen as a final testimony to the official representatives of the nation.<a name=228:16></a> They saw his face as the face of an angel.<a name=228:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But he moves on to a further glory.<a name=228:18></a> He sees heaven opened as the scene of the glory of God, and Man there in the Person of Jesus, and as a suffering witness he passes into that heavenly scene in perfect correspondence with the Man in heaven.<a name=228:19></a> It seems to me that is the climax of the individual line.<a name=228:20></a> Stephen

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a striking and stimulating fact that at the end of the present period we should have presented to us the thought of an assembly with a crown.<a name=229:5></a> With "little power" the assembly in Philadelphia has a crown.<a name=229:6></a> She has reached the completion of what is possible, so that the complacent love of Christ rests upon her.<a name=229:7></a> Now are we really set to reach this?<a name=229:8></a> Are we minded to follow up every ray of assembly light, and every intimation of assembly character, that comes before us, so that every assembly exercise may be worked out to its completion?<a name=229:9></a> It is a day of great departure, but it is also a day of great revival.<a name=229:10></a> The Lord would have His saints to be without pretension, but characterised by everything that properly marks the assembly.<a name=229:11></a> He would have assembly features carried and expressed by the brethren as going on together.<a name=229:12></a> He exercises us so that we may reach and hold fast all the possibilities that He has put within our reach, so that there may be a company on earth before He comes amongst whom assembly exercises will have been worked out to completion.<a name=229:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many things come in to further this-difficulties and conflict.<a name=229:14></a> A local difficulty generally raises a needed local exercise; there are often the same elements working in others as in those who are the immediate cause of the difficulty.<a name=229:15></a> If the Lord calls attention to something evil it is a mirror in which each one may see the evil that is in himself, so that the root of it may be judged in each one.<a name=229:16></a> J.<a name=229:17></a>N.<a name=229:18></a>D.<a name=229:19></a> said that discipline exercised in any other spirit than that of self-judgment is an abomination to God.<a name=229:20></a> If things come to the sad extremity of ceasing to walk with one who is characterised by evil it is an occasion for an assembly exercise.<a name=229:21></a> Such a person is declared to be unfit for Christian fellowship anywhere.<a name=229:22></a> We have the whole assembly in view in taking such a step.<a name=229:23></a> A few Christians in a place set to work out assembly exercises together would have the whole company in view in doing so.<a name=229:24></a> And I have no doubt that the faithfulness of a few would benefit the whole local assembly.<a name=229:25></a> If things are worked out to completion in a few, the Lord has secured things morally, and He will be able to bring out the whole assembly in a coming day in the gain

		of what has been worked out in the exercises and affections of the few.<a name=230:1></a> The promise is to Philadelphia: "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world", but it will actually embrace the whole assembly.<a name=230:2></a> So that we have nothing less in mind than the whole; we do not dissociate ourselves in heart from "all saints".<a name=230:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is so also in connection with ministry.<a name=230:4></a> The ministry of Christ is in view of Christ being cherished down here, and coming out in His saints.<a name=230:5></a> The gifts are for the whole assembly; any spiritual light or food that is given is for all saints.<a name=230:6></a> We cannot bring it to them, perhaps, or see how it is going to reach them; but we regard it in view of the good of all the brethren.<a name=230:7></a> I think if this were really the state of our hearts and minds the Lord would give us more access to our fellow-saints for their good and ours.<a name=230:8></a> It is the want of love that hinders, not the want of light.<a name=230:9></a> We need to live more in the love of Christ for the assembly.<a name=230:10></a> "I have loved thee".<a name=230:11></a> To know that love is an assembly exercise which is to be followed up to its full gain.<a name=230:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Keeping His word, not denying His name, and keeping the word of His patience, are true assembly exercises.<a name=230:13></a> The Lord would have us to realise the possibility of working them out in such a way as to possess an assembly crown.<a name=230:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing which is of importance.<a name=230:15></a> That is, the Lord's attitude to His saints universally, and even to wretched Laodicea, should determine ours.<a name=230:16></a> He would have us to be sympathetic with Him as to this.<a name=230:17></a> There are thousands of true believers in what answers to Thyatira.<a name=230:18></a> The Lord says to them, "I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come".<a name=230:19></a> He is tender and considerate for them: He compassionates them.<a name=230:20></a> Then as to Sardis He appreciates the fact that a few have not defiled their garments, and He says that they shall walk with Him in white "because they are worthy".<a name=230:21></a> A true assembly exercise would make us sympathetic with the Lord's attitude towards His saints both in popery and in protestantism, though it would preserve us in complete separation from what He disapproves in both.<a name=230:22></a> We should regard them as He regards them.<a name=230:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as to Laodicea it seems to me that the Lord's attitude is a model for us.<a name=230:24></a> He is outside, but He has placed Himself

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may expect much opposition to any true assembly exercise, but it is the only thing which will lead to the possession of this crown.<a name=231:5></a> It would greatly promote the service of love amongst the saints if we were all more jealous in regard to the crown.<a name=231:6></a> Stephen held fast what he had; he did not lose his crown, May we realise more the blessedness of Philadelphia's crown, and be more set to acquire it and to hold it fast!<a name=231:7></a>

		At the end of the assembly's history the Lord contemplates something that has true assembly character, though in remnant conditions, and He presents Himself to Philadelphia as the Holy and the True, and as the One "who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open".<a name=232:2></a> It is an encouraging word at the present time when the enemy is working to restrict freedom for God's people, to hinder them by pressure of various kinds, or even by fear.<a name=232:3></a> But the key, the power to control the whole position, is in the hand of Him who is in heaven.<a name=232:4></a> What a comfort it is that we have only to be faithful to what He has given us and we shall prove that He holds the key to the position!<a name=232:5></a> He will set before us an "opened door" to enter upon what is ours spiritually.<a name=232:6></a> Let us not miss such a wonderful privilege!<a name=232:7></a>

		The apostle Paul was straitened in prison at Rome, it might seem very straitened for his ministry, but I believe the whole heavenly side of the ministry committed to him opened up to his soul in a much enlarged way.<a name=232:8></a> He was shut away from public service, but he retired to the region of the Spirit and got more than he ever had before-the precious truths unfolded in Colossians and Ephesians and Philippians.<a name=232:9></a> Outwardly restricted, he was inwardly enlarged; a door was opened for him into heavenly truth, and not for him only but for the whole assembly.<a name=232:10></a> I do not say that the historical church ever stood in the truth and power of it.<a name=232:11></a> It was not until the last hundred years that the prison ministry of Paul was brought home to the intelligence and affections of many saints.<a name=232:12></a> The Lord has given us a great opened door into the spiritual.<a name=232:13></a> He has given us also an opened door in public liberty; otherwise we might be put in prison for coming together as we do now.<a name=232:14></a> All this is the result of the key of David being in the hand of the glorified Man in heaven.<a name=232:15></a> In one sense He has purchased our liberty at the cost of the blood of His faithful martyrs in days that are not very far off in point of time
