		C.A.<a name=3:12></a>C.<a name=3:13></a> Yes, a break which is occasioned by the thought of the kingdom being introduced and Jehovah's Anointed coming into view.<a name=3:14></a> God had in view not only helping people in their distresses and delivering them as in judges, but He had in view the bringing in of something that was entirely of Himself in connection with which His strength, power and glory should be known.<a name=3:15></a>

		C.A.<a name=4:8></a>C.<a name=4:9></a> I think so.<a name=4:10></a> The prophet is not one who has a mind of his own.<a name=4:11></a> The thing about a prophet is that he has the mind of God and can bring in moral power so that the people of God may be prepared for the kingdom.<a name=4:12></a> It is the kingdom in a moral way.<a name=4:13></a>

		H.B.<a name=4:14></a> Are you thinking of prophetic ministry?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:16></a>C.<a name=4:17></a> Prophetic ministry is the most important thing we have at the present time.<a name=4:18></a> The prophet as having the mind of God would pray for the people.<a name=4:19></a> In the light of that Samuel said in chapter 12 of this book, "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you" (verse 23).<a name=4:20></a> The prophet prays in communion; as having the mind of God, he would pray on that line.<a name=4:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		-.F.<a name=4:22></a> In this day, conditions were there that Samuel could pray for the people, but later on we read, "Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, my soul would not turn toward this people" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15:1">Jeremiah  15:1</a>).<a name=4:23></a>

		Here is a Levite who was occupying a position that was then of God.<a name=5:1></a> He was occupying his local position in Ephraim but occupying it in the light of Shiloh.<a name=5:2></a> He was occupying a position locally in the light of what was universal; that is a great matter for us.<a name=5:3></a> Shiloh was where the ark was and the tabernacle.<a name=5:4></a> It represented what was universal and also a state of things that God was about to reject on account of the corruption that was there.<a name=5:5></a> We are living in times when the universal idea has been brought into discredit by the conduct of those identified with it.<a name=5:6></a> There are a vast number in christendom who occupy the universal position, and they bring discredit on it.<a name=5:7></a> Notwithstanding that, the man of faith does not give up the universal thought because it is discredited, he clings to it and goes to Shiloh every year.<a name=5:8></a>

		C.A.<a name=5:11></a>C.<a name=5:12></a> Quite so; we get intense exercise in Hannah.<a name=5:13></a> Elkanah is presented to us as having two wives who were of a very different spirit.<a name=5:14></a> The one was more outwardly favoured of God than the other, but that only leads to boastfulness.<a name=5:15></a> Hannah refers to that in the next chapter, "Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth" (verse 3).<a name=5:16></a> A woman under reproach does not seem to have as much favour from God as her rival.<a name=5:17></a> Peninnah seemed to have the favour from God; she had sons and daughters, and it looked as though God was more favourable to Peninnah than to Hannah.<a name=5:18></a> Sometimes people talk of great numbers and great blessing and it seems as if all were right with them but we see here another woman who was outwardly sorrowful and going through the deepest exercise because she wanted something for God.<a name=5:19></a> It is open to us all to take up that exercise.<a name=5:20></a> That which is outward and is prosperous and successful always despises and looks down with contempt on that which is lowly in spirit and that only seeks something for God.<a name=5:21></a> We

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:4></a>C.<a name=6:5></a> I think it is rather the beginning of a new chapter.<a name=6:6></a> We see the corruption in Shiloh and faith in Elkanah in that he goes up yearly to Shiloh; he could not give up the divine thought because it was publicly discredited.<a name=6:7></a>

		A.B.<a name=6:8></a> I should like help as to Shiloh.<a name=6:9></a> We sometimes say that if we name the name of the Lord we must depart from iniquity; if so, why was it faith to go to Shiloh?<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:11></a>C.<a name=6:12></a> Because God had not abandoned Shiloh.<a name=6:13></a> The time came when He did, when He had to forsake Shiloh and then it had no claim on faith.<a name=6:14></a> But at this time God had not forsaken Shiloh or given "his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor".<a name=6:15></a> In this part of the book Shiloh was owned of God and represented the universal thought which we are to cling to however much it may be discredited.<a name=6:16></a> The thought of the one church is discredited, but we are not to give up the divine thought because it is discredited; that is important.<a name=6:17></a>

		C.A.<a name=6:20></a>C.<a name=6:21></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=6:22></a> The remnant in Luke had profited by a long course of prophetic ministry from Samuel to Malachi.<a name=6:23></a> They had profited and come to realise that the time of fulfilment was at hand.<a name=6:24></a>

		It seems to me that the Philistines coming up to seek David would be typical of the false brethren coming in to spy out our liberty in Christ Jesus as referred to in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:4">Galatians  2:4</a>.<a name=23:1></a> They were met in stern combat by Paul and their images were taken away by the decree of the apostles and elders.<a name=23:2></a> But they come up yet again and have to be met in a new way.<a name=23:3></a> "Turn round behind them" would be more like Paul writing to the Galatians and his rebuke to Peter.<a name=23:4></a> In each case he took them up on the ground of their own past.<a name=23:5></a> There had been a real work of God there which could be counted on.<a name=23:6></a> The mulberry-trees would speak of taking advantage of what is favourable in meeting the enemy.<a name=23:7></a> Any work in souls is a divine growth and He moves in relation to that.<a name=23:8></a> Amongst true believers there is always that to be counted on; the "sound" of marching will be there.<a name=23:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there is a third Philistine attack which is more successful than the other two and it comes in where we might have least expected it.<a name=23:10></a> When we feel quite sure that we are doing what is right there is often a lack of dependence and of care in making sure that we are going about it in a way that God can support.<a name=23:11></a> David was assured that his city was the place for the ark, and he would bring it there.<a name=23:12></a> But his way of doing it was not a spiritual way and it brought out that there was an unjudged Philistine element in himself.<a name=23:13></a> There may be a Philistine element in that

		which truly desires to make much of Christ.<a name=24:1></a> In Chronicles we get much more of the spiritual exercises of David and the recognition of what is priestly and levitical and of hallowing for this great service.<a name=24:2></a> There is a due order in handling what is holy and if that order is not observed some Philistine expedient is almost certain to be adopted.<a name=24:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ark had never had the honour in Israel that was due to it from the time when the Philistines had taken it.<a name=24:4></a> It had been cherished in private but before it could have its public place Zion had to be taken and the lame and the blind removed.<a name=24:5></a> All that had in view a place for the ark.<a name=24:6></a> It is as the saints occupy Zion and understand what it is to dwell in the city of David in the fulness of what is secured in Christ on the ground of His victory, and from whence the lame and the blind have been excluded, that the exercise can have place in relation to the ark.<a name=24:7></a> But how often in Scripture we have the thought of a first which does not answer to the mind of God and then a second which does.<a name=24:8></a> I believe this enters into nearly all spiritual exercise.<a name=24:9></a> We do not at first understand the holiness of what we are taking in hand to do.<a name=24:10></a> We think that what can be done in the way that first suggests itself will do for God.<a name=24:11></a> But we have to learn that what is priestly and levitical must take the place of what is Philistine.<a name=24:12></a> There are a great many now professedly gathered to the name of the Lord, and most of them, we may admit, have a true desire to honour Him and to provide a place for Him.<a name=24:13></a> But if things are not done in a truly priestly and levitical way we may be sure that something of the "new cart" character will be found in evidence.<a name=24:14></a> We find that in the house of Abinadab he hallowed Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:1">1 Samuel  7:1</a>), but that hallowed man does not appear in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6">2 Samuel  6</a>.<a name=24:15></a> It was just the absence of that hallowed state that made all the difference between pleasing God and displeasing Him.<a name=24:16></a> What strikes one in Philadelphia is that the Lord presents

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Himself as the Holy and the True, and He speaks of the overcomer as being made a pillar in the temple of His God.<a name=25:1></a> The holiness of the position is emphasised.<a name=25:2></a> It is possible to have the light of all that is proper to Philadelphia without the state in which alone it can be carried out for the pleasure of God.<a name=25:3></a> This is a great exercise for us all.<a name=25:4></a> We can only have the ark with us on its own conditions.<a name=25:5></a> Even so great a servant as David had to learn this.<a name=25:6></a> And even Paul had to learn how deadly the Philistine element was if once allowed a footing.<a name=25:7></a> David was afraid, and it is well when such a holy fear comes into the heart.<a name=25:8></a> But God gives Him a lesson in grace, as He always does when we are in danger of becoming legal under rebuke.<a name=25:9></a>

		The 'ark of God' is the term applied commonly to the ark in Samuel where it is, we may say, more exposed to unholy handling than anywhere else.<a name=26:1></a> That is, it is viewed according to its essential divine character, not in the relations of grace which would be signified by the name 'Jehovah' or when the covenant is definitely brought in.<a name=26:2></a> It is very much like the difference between 'God' and 'the Father' in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=26:3></a> God is a spirit; it is what He is essentially, and this must never be forgotten in worshipping Him.<a name=26:4></a> Indeed, if we lose the sense of this, and the reverence suitable to it, we shall miss the sweetness of the name of 'Father', and all that goes along with it.<a name=26:5></a> Christ as the Ark of God would be regarded as the One who maintains, or in whom is maintained, all that is due to God, and in whom is set forth all that God is morally.<a name=26:6></a> He has declared God who is light and love: "In him is no darkness at all", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>.<a name=26:7></a> He sits between the cherubim; there is perfect discrimination between good and evil.<a name=26:8></a>

		The key to <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#8">2 Samuel  8</a>lies in its connection with chapter 7, for it is "after this it came to pass".<a name=35:1></a> The chapter speaks of the victories of a spiritual man, and their results for God in what is dedicated to Him.<a name=35:2></a> My impression is that while David is often distinctly a type of Christ, he is more often a type of what is spiritual in saints.<a name=35:3></a> His psalms are, as we well know, often the personal utterances of the Spirit of Christ as developed in saints  --  particularly in the remnant.<a name=35:4></a> Solomon is the seed, Jehovah's son, in chapter 7, and David worships as in presence of the counsel of God established by Him.<a name=35:5></a> In one sense Christ can be spoken of as the great Worshipper, singing praise to God, but it would seem that He sings as identifying Himself with the praising company, all of whom praise as having His Spirit.<a name=35:6></a> If He identifies Himself with them He must necessarily be in their midst as the pre-eminent One, undoubtedly the Chief Singer.<a name=35:7></a> The saints as a praising company constitute His house.<a name=35:8></a>

		1. The Person whom the gospel presents is the Son of God.<a name=44:5></a> By sending His Son into the world God presented Himself in grace to men.<a name=44:6></a> There was no form of human need that He was not able and willing to meet; there was no kind of pressure upon man that He could not relieve.<a name=44:7></a> He "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>.<a name=44:8></a> He came not to condemn the world, not to impute trespasses to men, but to present in the excellence of His own Person the blessed grace of God.<a name=44:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was also in Him the complete setting forth of everything that was according to God's good pleasure in a Man.<a name=44:10></a> He was the beloved Son, in whom the Father was well pleased.<a name=44:11></a> Every divine perfection was brought near to men in pure grace in that blessed and holy Person.<a name=44:12></a> And every one whose heart was attracted by His grace, and believed on Him, obtained forgiveness of sins and found the knowledge of God.<a name=44:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		2. But this wondrous grace must reign through righteousness, and it could only be presented to men in One who was willing and competent to charge Himself with the liabilities of men.<a name=44:14></a> The Lord Jesus could speak of forgiveness of sins because He was about to bear sins in His own body on the tree; He could heal every disease, and rescue men from the power of death itself because He had come in grace to undergo all that was due to men in consequence of sin.<a name=44:15></a> In the days of His flesh the accomplishment of all this was future, but it is now past, and the gospel declares

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what He has undergone on man's behalf.<a name=45:1></a> He has borne and suffered for sins, has been made sin, and has tasted death.<a name=45:2></a> He charged Himself with the liabilities of men, and has undergone the holy judgment due to sin.<a name=45:3></a> And all this in absolute grace, that the grace of God might flow out in righteousness to men.<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the gospel declares further how God has acted towards the One who thus came in grace into man's condemnation.<a name=45:5></a> God raised Him from the dead, so that He saw no corruption, and He lives for evermore beyond the reach of sin and death.<a name=45:6></a> Man, in the Person of the Lord Jesus, has an entirely new place with God, and is found in a state to which no imperfection or condemnation can ever attach.<a name=45:7></a> Nothing has been overlooked or compromised.<a name=45:8></a> Sins have been borne, sin has been judged, death has been suffered, Satan's power overthrown, and all this by One who is now raised from the dead as the glorious Witness to the complete triumph of grace.<a name=45:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thought we may gather from the picture before us is that the known grace of God not only separates a man from the world of the ungodly, but it gives him a true judgment of himself.<a name=46:10></a> In the presence of David's grace Mephibosheth could only say, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?<a name=46:11></a>" This is repentance -- the judgment which a sinner has of himself in the presence of divine grace.<a name=46:12></a> "Repentance and remission of sins" are both preached in the name of a risen Saviour.<a name=46:13></a>

		In <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:1">2 Thessalonians  2:1</a> Paul beseeches them "by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him".<a name=48:10></a> It is an expression of peculiar sweetness -- think of all saints gathering together to Him -- not to His name, but to Himself, and as <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:10">1 Thessalonians  5:10</a> says,

		After presenting the hope of the Lord's coming in the first epistle, the apostle in chapters 1 and 2 of the second epistle gives words of consolation and instruction in view of the coming apostasy: then he says "But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope by grace, encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word", <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:16">2 Thessalonians  2:16</a>, 17.<a name=49:8></a> Nothing, not even the thickness of tissue paper, is to come between the Lord and our hearts; then we should have the enjoyment of our relationship with the Lord Jesus and with our God in service and in suffering for the testimony.<a name=49:9></a> It is the consciousness of the immediate support and love of the heart of Christ and the place we have eternally in our Father's heart and purpose that is our proper start: if we are to continue and to finish well we must make this beginning.<a name=49:10></a>

		Now in speaking of Barzillai, I wish to draw attention to this very serious consideration, that a person may have a good start and make progress, and then go back, the Lord having lost in the heart the place He had at first.<a name=49:11></a> There is nothing more sad than departure from the Lord Himself, and I suppose the history of Barzillai has been given to us in Scripture so that we should be able to take account of the sadness of spiritual enfeeblement.<a name=49:12></a> Barzillai and his companions met David when he was in reproach, bringing the very best they had, and no mean provision it was.<a name=49:13></a> The Spirit of God gives us a list of what they brought, "beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and

		Now in chapter 19, David returns to Jerusalem and Mephibosheth is there to greet him.<a name=50:4></a> Mephibosheth's affection has been sustained; he has been feeling the absence of David and the falling away from David of many in Jerusalem and through the testing time of David's absence he has ever remembered him with affectionate regard for his person and rights: his happiness is bound up with God's beloved.<a name=50:5></a> David mentions the inheritance, but Mephibosheth replies, 'It is not that I am thinking of.<a name=50:6></a> I am not troubled about the inheritance, everything to me is that you have come back'.<a name=50:7></a> What a comfort to the heart of David!<a name=50:8></a> -- a welcome from a heart that had never declined but had beaten true in his absence.<a name=50:9></a> But it is otherwise with Barzillai; he meets the king and follows him over Jordan.<a name=50:10></a> David makes a proposition to Barzillai, 'Come up to Jerusalem and I will feed you.<a name=50:11></a> I do not forget that when in adversity you fed me, and now I want you to be my guest in Jerusalem, I want to maintain and feed you there'.<a name=50:12></a> What an invitation!<a name=50:13></a> The Lord proposes an advancement spiritually for us -- that we should go right up into the heart of blessing, where Christ is supreme, that we should dwell with Him in His Jerusalem.<a name=50:14></a> We should enjoy now what we are to enjoy eternally with Christ.<a name=50:15></a> The Lord finds pleasure in our willing response to that.<a name=50:16></a> Although the Lord regards with delight every bit of service towards Himself as it comes out in relation to His people -- caring for them, feeding them, serving Him in His interests here, just as Barzillai and his associates cared for David and his followers -- yet more deeply valued still by the Lord Jesus is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to speak a little tonight about the house of God in connection with the kingdom.<a name=57:1></a> This looks on, in great measure, to a day that is yet to come, but there is much in it of present value for our instruction.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tabernacle was movable and provisional.<a name=57:3></a> It was intended to be carried about, and was only for the time.<a name=57:4></a> It did not represent an established or permanent order of things.<a name=57:5></a> The house, properly speaking, could not be built until the kingdom was established.<a name=57:6></a> When the kingdom was established and mount Zion secured under David the house came distinctly in view.<a name=57:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:68">Psalm  78:68</a> - 70 we may see the connection between God's choice of David and of mount Zion and the building of His sanctuary.<a name=57:8></a> Jehovah dwelt in Zion as His rest for ever (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:13">Psalm  132:13</a>, 14), and this prepared the way for His sanctuary to be built by Solomon.<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of the kingdom being established in the hands of David was that the people were delivered from every enemy.<a name=57:10></a> "Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree".<a name=57:11></a> Jehovah put all the enemies under the soles of David's feet, so that when Solomon came to the throne he could say, "Jehovah my God has given me rest on every side: there is neither adversary nor evil event".<a name=57:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, the effect of the kingdom being established was that the people were commanded and ordered according to the pleasure of God.<a name=58:5></a> You remember how it is said in the book of judges, "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes".<a name=58:6></a> God raised up saviours for the people in their distresses, but there was no king to order them according to God's pleasure.<a name=58:7></a> The king was placed over the people to rule them for God.<a name=58:8></a> We read of Solomon that he was set on Jehovah's throne to be king to Jehovah his God (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#9:8">2 Chronicles  9:8</a>).<a name=58:9></a> Christ has that place for us now.<a name=58:10></a> Not that we know Him exactly as King -- He is Lord to us -- but I speak of the principle.<a name=58:11></a> The day of His glory here, of which Solomon's reign was figurative, is yet future, but we sing oftentimes:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'Christ of God, our souls confess Thee <br>King and Sovereign even now'.<a name=58:12></a></blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to come under the control of that blessed One.<a name=58:13></a> He has established His right to control us by going into death for us.<a name=58:14></a> We must admit that He has a right to command and order us and it is our happiness and security to be under His sway.<a name=58:15></a> We have no business now to do what is right in our own eyes.<a name=58:16></a> In the kingdom of God we are put under the blessed control of divine grace and love

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is all this in view of?<a name=59:2></a> If the king destroyed the enemy's power and controlled the people for God's pleasure it was all in view of the house of God being built.<a name=59:3></a> It is interesting to see that from the very beginning of David's history he had the house of God before him.<a name=59:4></a> I think we may gather this from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=59:5></a> In the time of David's afflictions he devoted himself to "find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob", and he says in verse 6, "Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we found it in the fields of the wood".<a name=59:6></a> When he was living in Bethlehem and wandering in the fields -- long before he came to the kingdom -- the house of God was before him, and he came to the kingdom really to prepare for the building of the house.<a name=59:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with this read <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#5:3">2 Samuel  5:3</a> - 7; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:12">2 Samuel  6:12</a>.<a name=59:8></a> David's first act after being anointed king over Israel was to take "the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David", and one of his next acts was to bring up the ark of God "into the city of David with joy".<a name=59:9></a> The Lord had chosen Zion; He had desired it for His habitation.<a name=59:10></a> He had said, "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:13">Psalm  132:13</a>, 14.<a name=59:11></a> David acted in victorious power to secure the place that God had chosen, and then he brought the ark to rest there.<a name=59:12></a> Zion spoke of the victorious power and supremacy of David and it represents all the grace and blessings that have been secured in a risen and ascended Christ on the ground of redemption.<a name=59:13></a> God's purposes of grace had to be established in Christ risen and glorified on the basis of redemption before His house could be built.<a name=59:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem in the actual history of things here as though the enemy held the field, and that nothing of God's will was established.<a name=59:15></a> But as a matter of fact the enemy's

		power is completely broken and God's purpose and grace are established in the most glorious way in Christ as the risen and exalted One.<a name=60:1></a> This is known by faith and in the Holy Spirit, so that it can be said to believers now, "Ye have come to mount Zion", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a>.<a name=60:2></a> The house of God is built upon the impregnable basis of a victory which has broken the enemy's power, and a Person who has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light, One in whom God's purpose and grace are established, Jesus Christ the Son of God.<a name=60:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David thought and wrought from the very beginning in view of the house of God, and in this he was a type of Christ.<a name=60:4></a> Christ came here to secure a place and material for God's house.<a name=60:5></a> He secured a company in order to make them "living stones" for God's spiritual house.<a name=60:6></a> Then He accomplished redemption, and went to the right hand of God in order that the Spirit might be given to those who believed and that they might thus become God's dwelling-place here.<a name=60:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to note that when the ark was brought to the city of David there was "gladness", and the people had a good time (see <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:18">2 Samuel  6:18</a>, 19).<a name=60:8></a> They were caring that God should have His place, and the result was that they were blessed and enriched.<a name=60:9></a> If we want to have a good time we must be like David, who set his affection on the house of his God.<a name=60:10></a> If we do so we are sure to have prosperity of soul.<a name=60:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:7">1 Chronicles  22:7</a> - 10 we see that it was in David's mind to build the house, but he was not suffered to do so because he had shed blood abundantly.<a name=60:12></a> This is an interesting scripture, because it points to a distinction between two characters which are united in Christ.<a name=60:13></a> Christ is the Man of war and the Man of rest and peace -- He is the true David and the true Solomon.<a name=60:14></a> David came in victorious power to meet and destroy every enemy, and Christ has

	<div class="paragraph">
		taken up this character; He has maintained all the rights of God with regard to sin, and in view of the blessing of man.<a name=61:1></a> Then Solomon (peaceable) was a man of rest, and in his day God gave peace and quietness.<a name=61:2></a> Christ is now in the blessed peace of resurrection, having vanquished every foe.<a name=61:3></a> As the risen One He said to His disciples, "Peace be unto you".<a name=61:4></a> No disturbing element can ever reach the shore of resurrection.<a name=61:5></a> There is rest on every side, and neither adversary nor evil occurrent.<a name=61:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One might say that typically David was the king of righteousness, and Solomon the king of peace.<a name=61:7></a> Both are united in Melchisedec -- figure of Christ as the One who "shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne", <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:13">Zechariah  6:13</a>.<a name=61:8></a> In a coming day Christ will be the King of righteousness and the King of peace, and in connection with Him the millennial temple will be built, the glory will be brought in, and everything on earth will be ordered for the pleasure of God.<a name=61:9></a> But in a certain way, as I have suggested, we know Him in these characters now -- as the true David who in the victorious power of grace has put every foe beneath His feet so that there might be full blessing for all who believe on His name, and as the true Solomon in the blessed rest and peace of resurrection.<a name=61:10></a> These things are hinted at in picture in the Old Testament; we enter by faith and in the Spirit into the reality of them now; and in a quickly coming day they will be publicly displayed in power and glory.<a name=61:11></a>

		It was reserved to Solomon to build the house, but David was the one who secured the place for it, and who provided the material.<a name=61:12></a> He could say, "Behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without

		In the previous reading we considered the house itself and, particularly, the materials used in its construction, suggestive of spiritual material which comes now under the hand of Christ, the true Solomon, and which is being built up a spiritual house.<a name=84:1></a> We referred to the stones, cedar, cypress and olive as representing symbolically various features of the work of God in His people, all combining together to form His house.<a name=84:2></a> We noticed that all was presented from the divine side, and presented as perfect; there are no figures of what is defective.<a name=84:3></a> What is in the mind of God is presented for our consideration, so that we might be exercised to come up to it by the work of God proceeding in our souls.<a name=84:4></a>

		But there are many scriptures which give us light as to progress on our side in spiritual apprehension, and I understand that the "side-chambers" present this side of things in a striking way.<a name=84:5></a> They are not the house itself, but they stand in close relation to it.<a name=84:6></a> They are in three storeys, enlarging as they ascend.<a name=84:7></a> There is "the lowest floor", then the "middle one", and then "the third".<a name=84:8></a> I believe the consideration of this will be found helpful, for in the truth as set out in the New Testament, particularly in the epistles, we may see what answers to these three grades of elevation and enlargement.<a name=84:9></a> The chambers of each floor as they ascend are of larger dimensions, so that they indicate the thought of spiritual progress.<a name=84:10></a> The thoughts thus suggested are helpful not only in a general way but in regard of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "lowest floor", I think we may say, is where baptism and the Lord's supper are.<a name=85:2></a> That is, it answers to the truth as set forth in Romans and 1 Corinthians.<a name=85:3></a> If we are not right on that floor we cannot expect to go higher.<a name=85:4></a> It is where our moral relations with God, and with the brethren, and with the world, are divinely adjusted.<a name=85:5></a> When we receive the gospel our moral relations with God are put right.<a name=85:6></a> On the ground of redemption we are justified so that we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by Him we have access by faith into the favour of God, and the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.<a name=85:7></a> This blessedness is unfolded in the epistle to the Romans, chapter 5; we also learn that the adjustment of our relations with God involves the adjustment of our relations with the world, and baptism has its place in this connection.<a name=85:8></a> We must accept a public position here which is in keeping with right relations with God.<a name=85:9></a> The public position is burial with Christ; baptism means that we go out by burial from the life of the world, "in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>.<a name=85:10></a> That is a new kind of life here on earth.<a name=85:11></a> As buried to the former life we yield ourselves to God as alive from among the dead and our members instruments of righteousness to God.<a name=85:12></a> That is a kind of life which the Spirit can support.<a name=85:13></a> Christ has now a footing in our hearts where He once had none, and if Christ is in us "the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>.<a name=85:14></a> The flesh has ceased to dominate: in result we can present our bodies a living sacrifice, so that God's will may be worked out in us in the way of service to the brethren (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>).<a name=85:15></a> For we are members one of another to serve; we have many to serve us and we have many to serve, and in taking up this

		service in a practical way we find freedom from selfishness.<a name=86:1></a> Being in right relations thus with the brethren we are liberated for the service of God.<a name=86:2></a> We are "to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus; that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:5">Romans  15:5</a>, 6.<a name=86:3></a> It is evident that this brings us into view of the service of the house, but it is, to use the language of the type, "the lowest floor".<a name=86:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first epistle to the Corinthians runs parallel with Romans, and it develops our assembly relations.<a name=86:5></a> The truth of the fellowship to which we are called comes out in this epistle, as does the Lord's supper as the rallying point of the assembly.<a name=86:6></a> Believers come together in their different localities to remember the Lord Jesus in the place where He died, and to share in common the precious fruit of His body being given and His blood poured out.<a name=86:7></a> It is the privilege of the saints to come together locally as those who are in the conscious gain of the new covenant, both in the letter and in the spirit of it.<a name=86:8></a> We thus enjoy in a corporate way the place and portion which the death of Christ and the gift of the Spirit have brought us into.<a name=86:9></a> And as together we find an outlet for our praises to the Lord Jesus and also to the blessed God.<a name=86:10></a> We occupy a place in relation to the house of God which answers to the chambers of "the lowest floor".<a name=86:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The normal effect of being in the good of the Roman epistle and of taking up in a practical way the assembly order of 1 Corinthians is that we look for something further.<a name=86:12></a> The "lowest floor" truly occupied would ensure collective freedom and the spirit of sonship would give power to ascend.<a name=86:13></a> We read that "they went up by winding stairs into the middle floor, and out of the middle into the third".<a name=86:14></a> And it is to be noticed that "the entrance to the side-chambers of the middle floor was in the right side of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the house".<a name=87:1></a> The right side suggests the thought of power, as we find generally in Scripture.<a name=87:2></a> We can only go up to the middle or third floor as there is spiritual power to do so; we must always go up by "the right side".<a name=87:3></a> But in the spirit of sonship there is liberty and power to go up.<a name=87:4></a> It is to be observed in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15">Romans  15</a>the power of the Holy Spirit leads to abounding in hope.<a name=87:5></a> It fills the soul with bright anticipation of something higher; the closing verses of the epistle would lead the Roman believers to see that there was much more in the apostle's mind than he had unfolded.<a name=87:6></a> They would see that there was a great deal more to be entered upon; they would have hope of things more elevated than what he had spoken of.<a name=87:7></a> They would recognise that there were "stairs" leading upward to a higher level!<a name=87:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And to the Corinthians also, though the greater part of the first epistle refers to "the lowest floor", the apostle does not end without leading their hearts upward.<a name=87:9></a> Chapter 15 is like "stairs" leading upward, for he speaks of Christ as risen being First-fruits of a risen company, and he says, "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones.<a name=87:10></a> And as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>, 49.<a name=87:11></a> We may remember that the stairs for the house of Jehovah, and the balustrade were made of sandal-wood (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#9:11">2 Chronicles  9:11</a>; <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#10:12">1 Kings  10:12</a>).<a name=87:12></a> It was wood that came from a far-off clime; "There came no such sandal-wood, nor was there seen to this day".<a name=87:13></a> So I would suggest that the sandal-wood stairs represent what leads up in the direction of the heavenly.<a name=87:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come together to break bread on "the lowest floor", but it is not the Lord's mind that we should remain on that level.<a name=87:15></a> He would have us to go up to the middle floor and also to the third.<a name=87:16></a> One feels sure that any christian in the good of Romans and 1 Corinthians would desire to go up, but going up is a question of power.<a name=87:17></a> And power for this lies

		What they saw in Himself was the way up.<a name=88:3></a> Those who saw the risen Christ, and with whom He assembled during forty days, were in flesh and blood condition, but they understood that all that was precious to them was now in resurrection, and that there was no distance between them and the risen One.<a name=88:4></a> They did not know as a matter of doctrine that they were risen with Christ; that was left to Paul to unfold; but they had the reality of it in spiritual experience.<a name=88:5></a> Everything that had caused distance had been removed by His death, so that we see no fear or trouble or unbelief on their part in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>.<a name=88:6></a> The service He had rendered in verifying Himself to them in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>had been effective.<a name=88:7></a> They could be with the risen One, and not only hear Him, but speak to Him with confidence.<a name=88:8></a> It was true of them that they were risen "with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=88:9></a>

		There were "holy and faithful brethren in Christ" in Colosse of whom it is said that they were "raised with him".<a name=88:10></a> They were men and women living in a city in Asia Minor, but they had been raised with Christ through faith of the working of God who raised Him from among the dead.<a name=88:11></a> This was clearly a faith position.<a name=88:12></a> Let us try to understand what this would mean to them.<a name=88:13></a> They would know that they could be with God as in company with Christ risen.<a name=88:14></a> They would know, in the light of what Epaphras had taught them and what Paul had written to them earlier in his letter, that Christ was "firstborn from among the dead", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a>.<a name=88:15></a> That is, He was the pre-eminent One, the glorious Head of the company risen with Him.<a name=88:16></a> They would know that they were His body, to increase

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we had never heard of these things before, and it was brought home to us in spiritual power that by faith of the working of God we were raised with Christ, I am sure it would make a great impression on us.<a name=89:4></a> We should understand that the great thing now for us is to hold fast the Head, to get suggestions from Christ as Head.<a name=89:5></a> He would not fail to minister to the body that it might increase with the increase of God.<a name=89:6></a> Christ as Head is the great Source of supply, and He makes use of "the joints and bands" to convey what is of Himself to the body.<a name=89:7></a> It is not, in the teaching of the Colossian epistle, the action of gifts, though of course their service is recognised as in Paul and Epaphras and others in chapter 4, but in the teaching of the epistle the Head is held fast as furnishing ministry through joints and bands so that "increase of God" is brought about.<a name=89:8></a> I understand "the word of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:16">Colossians  3:16</a>) to be the word of the Head, which is to dwell richly in all the holy and faithful brethren in Christ, so that the teaching of the Head becomes available, and this issues in there being psalms, hymns and spiritual songs to God.<a name=89:9></a> The thought is that the vast reservoir of wealth that is in the Head becomes available for the body so that God is praised as the great Source from which all has come.<a name=89:10></a> It is beautiful to see that ministry from the Head leads to "increase of God"; there is great wealth in the knowledge of God.<a name=89:11></a>

		When we come together in assembly we begin on the lowest floor, but we should have in mind that there is a way up to another level.<a name=89:12></a> We should not forget the "stairs", but be prepared to go up step by step, remembering that power is needed at each step.<a name=89:13></a> We must remember, too,

	<div class="paragraph">
		that the stairs are winding; it is impossible to see far ahead; we must be content to go up step by step as we have power in a way of spiritual leading.<a name=90:1></a> We cannot see all the way clear before us on any particular occasion.<a name=90:2></a> A note to <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#2:9">Proverbs  2:9</a> in the Darby Translation is helpful in regard to "winding"; it says, 'God's path for the saint .<a name=90:3></a>.<a name=90:4></a>.<a name=90:5></a> does not always lead where we expect, or so that we can see straight on in it'.<a name=90:6></a> This applies also to the steps by which we go up when we are together in assembly.<a name=90:7></a> If Christ has His place amongst us as the Mediator of the new covenant He will serve us so that we shall be empowered to go up, but not exactly in a formal way so that we can see all the way by which we are going.<a name=90:8></a> In a formal religious service everything goes on in a fixed order from which there is no deviation, but in the spiritual service of the assembly room must be left, surely, for Christ to have His place in the midst as Head, and who can tell beforehand what He will suggest on any particular occasion?<a name=90:9></a> He will surely lead upward, but exactly how the steps will go cannot be foreseen when we enter on the upward way.<a name=90:10></a> Of course every spiritual movement will be in accord with the truth as made known to us but in the movements of life in the assembly as convened we should expect to find something quite different from a formal order.<a name=90:11></a> Holding fast the Head will keep us in touch with infinite resource and variety in relation to the holy service of God.<a name=90:12></a> Any company of saints where Christ has His place as Head would look for a lead from Him.<a name=90:13></a> There would be joints and bands available through whom great spiritual thoughts would be conveyed which would determine our upward steps.<a name=90:14></a> If there is the "increase of God", there will assuredly be increase to God in the blessed service of praise.<a name=90:15></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we may see an example of this when He gave that wonderful message to Mary Magdalene, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=91:8></a> He did not entrust this message to a great gift but to a woman who was a joint or band through whom He could minister.<a name=91:9></a> And in saying "I ascend", He was leading up all their thoughts and hearts to the chambers of the third storey.<a name=91:10></a> To be risen with Christ and to hold the Head are wonderful things, but they belong to the middle floor.<a name=91:11></a> Colossians prepares us to go higher than this when it calls upon us to "seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God", and to have our mind on those things.<a name=91:12></a> That is a leading up to another level.<a name=91:13></a> The epistle to the Ephesians gives us the "third storey", the highest spiritual level.<a name=91:14></a> We see there that there is a divine sense in which we can be said to be raised up to a very great elevation.<a name=91:15></a> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down

		God secured something for Himself even in the house of Jeroboam.<a name=126:1></a> There was a testimony there in a young life in which was found something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel.<a name=126:2></a> This was another way by which God spoke to Jeroboam.<a name=126:3></a> First by the prophetic testimony of the man of God (Ahaziah the son of Ahab sent to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron: <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#1:2">2 Kings  1:2</a>) from Judah, and now through the moral exercises of his own son.<a name=126:4></a> But this one who is the only living link with Jehovah in Jeroboam's house falls sick and it proves to be unto death.<a name=126:5></a> There was nothing in Jeroboam's house or ways to keep him alive, and God takes him away, it would appear, in mercy.<a name=126:6></a> Jeroboam has evidently a feeling that God has something to say in the matter, but his conscience tells him that he has departed from God and that he has no right to apply to the prophet.<a name=126:7></a> His wife must not be known as such.<a name=126:8></a> How often the conscience is speaking when the will is unsubdued!<a name=126:9></a> Jeroboam no doubt knew that Abijah was the only one in his house who feared Jehovah.<a name=126:10></a> In Abijah's sickness God was speaking to a heart and he felt it, and was assured that Jehovah was interested in the lad and that His prophet would tell what should become of him.<a name=126:11></a> But the message sent to Jeroboam by the prophet was hard.<a name=126:12></a> It was a message of judgment upon his house, and indeed upon all Israel for their idolatry.<a name=126:13></a> The only point of good was Abijah.<a name=126:14></a> It is the good that was taken away so that unsparing judgment may come on all the rest.<a name=126:15></a> It was definitely made known that all Israel would be given up on account of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had given Jeroboam great opportunities, but he made very bad use of them.<a name=127:5></a> God had also testified by the man of God against his idolatry and had shown at the same time by healing his hand (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#13:6">1 Kings  13:6</a>) that He would act in grace to him if he took the place of dependence and need.<a name=127:6></a> But all was of no avail: he persisted in his evil course.<a name=127:7></a> In conditions of departure God is pleased to put men in places of responsibility and give them opportunity, which, if wrongly used, become an occasion of judgment: God speaks to popes and bishops and kings and in principle to us all.<a name=127:8></a> We are all tested by the position God puts us in in His government or providence.<a name=127:9></a> But if nothing results for God in it judgment is inevitable.<a name=127:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But people with whom God has had dealings cannot forget it, and the conscience and the heart act even when there is no change in the will.<a name=127:11></a> This accounts for inconsistence in the conduct of people who seem sometimes as if they feared God and yet their general course is such as to greatly displease Him.<a name=127:12></a> To have a responsibility in relation to God is one thing, and it may be to feel it at times, but to be subject to God so that one is practically controlled by His will is quite another.<a name=127:13></a>

		So Jeroboam, when concerned about his son, thinks of the prophet.<a name=127:14></a> He has no personal access to God, and he would not have it known that he was owning the God of Israel.<a name=127:15></a> There is no straightforwardness or transparency about him.<a name=127:16></a> And his sending to the prophet only brought condemnation on himself and his house and ultimately on all Israel.<a name=127:17></a>

		Jeroboam, but in his son Abijah -'My Father is Jah' -- we see that God had one even in Jeroboam's house in whom good was found towards Jehovah the God of Israel.<a name=128:1></a> There was a remnant there who were not subject to the judgment pronounced.<a name=128:2></a> Indeed Abijah had to be taken away before the house of Jeroboam was cut off.<a name=128:3></a> So that Abijah represents a faithful remnant when hearts think of God and of Christ in a day of prevalent evil.<a name=128:4></a> Abijah is a great encouragement to those who are the only ones in their family who think of what is due to God.<a name=128:5></a> In his coming to the grave there is the thought that He would have no place in the idolatrous system, but he would have a place in God's world of resurrection.<a name=128:6></a> In the darkest time of departure God has reserved for Himself and for His world a remnant who are removed from the scene of judgment before the judgment comes.<a name=128:7></a>

		Then we find that idolatry was rampant in Judah also, so that the world comes up and takes away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the king's house; "he even took away all", even all the shields of gold.<a name=128:8></a> Twice it is said that Rehoboam's mother was an Ammonitess.<a name=128:9></a> Solomon's unholy links with the strange women bore its fruit in their offspring: they were not "wholly a right seed", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:21">Jeremiah  2:21</a>.<a name=128:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God definitely pronounced judgment upon Jeroboam, Baasha and Ahab.<a name=128:11></a> Each represented the state of the last days, which skew evil come to a head.<a name=128:12></a> This shews that the moral character of the last few days may re-appear in successive periods of church history as in Israel's.<a name=128:13></a> John speaks of the last hour (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>).<a name=128:14></a> It was so morally though a prolonged period had still to run its course.<a name=128:15></a> I think when the apostles' teaching was departed from, the whole character of the last few days was present, the mystery of lawlessness working all the time but God holding things in check in view o His own purposes and testimony.<a name=128:16></a> So we can understand the long history of

		Chapter 17 is a private experience which goes on, known only to faith, but which stands in relation to the general and public corruption; that is, Elijah and the widow are instructed in divine resources at a time when famine conditions prevail generally.<a name=135:4></a> First, Elijah has to learn what it is to be personally sustained at the torrent Cherith, which seems to speak of divine resources as they may be known by the individual.<a name=135:5></a> But then, that is not intended to be all; it is followed by what is collective set forth in the widow who has a house.<a name=135:6></a> God commands certain spiritual resources for us individually, but He purposely orders that such resources do not suffice for us permanently.<a name=135:7></a> They have to give place to another order of things.<a name=135:8></a> We have to learn what God has commanded for us in house conditions.<a name=135:9></a>

		It is to be noted that the first verse of this chapter tells us that Elijah went with Elisha, intimating to us that Elisha's spiritual education is the great point in this chapter, and this makes it very distinctly applicable to ourselves.<a name=150:5></a> God would shew in that dark period of Israel's history that the power in which the Jordan was crossed was still available for His people, and God would impress us in our day that all the power that was evidenced in the resurrection and ascension of Christ is available to be known in spiritual reality by the saints today in spite of the apostasy around.<a name=150:6></a> It shews how Christ is to be learned today, so that it is very cheering.<a name=150:7></a>

		Our spiritual education in view of knowing Christ in heaven proceeds on the lines suggested by the four places visited by Elijah and Elisha.<a name=151:7></a> The starting-point of this journey was Gilgal, the place of circumcision, where the flesh is seen to be absolutely cut off.<a name=151:8></a> However feeble we may be in our apprehension of it, the circumcision of the Christ is a great divine reality; it is what was effected in His death.<a name=151:9></a> So that it is viewed in Colossians as a completed thing; in Christ we are circumcised; it is, as Paul says, the putting off of the body of the flesh.<a name=151:10></a> This has been effected in the death of Christ, and it is applied to us by a divine operation -- "circumcision not done by hand".<a name=151:11></a> Circumcision, as is often noticed, comes in Colossians before baptism, which seems to suggest that, in this connection, what is inward precedes what is outward.<a name=151:12></a> Circumcision takes place in the heart and spirit.<a name=151:13></a>

		This scripture is such, in its spiritual import, as to call for our most earnest attention.<a name=156:1></a> It shows how the disciples were brought to know Christ as ascended at the beginning of the present period.<a name=156:2></a> But I believe that in the mind of the Spirit there is special instruction here for the last days.<a name=156:3></a> It seems to me that from Jeroboam onward days of departure are in view; indeed, the departure became evident even in Solomon's time.<a name=156:4></a> But it was seen in a public and general way when the ten tribes revolted and idolatry was set up.<a name=156:5></a> So that in the different men of God raised up, and in their prophetic testimony, we see how God works in a day of abounding evil.<a name=156:6></a> In Elijah the testimony is gathered up in a remarkable way.<a name=156:7></a> We see the great truths of accepted sacrifice at Carmel, the burnt-offering for all Israel, so that God is known in that light by the seven thousand.<a name=156:8></a> If this truth is not fundamental in our souls we could never take up the lessons of <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2">2 Kings  2</a>.<a name=156:9></a> Of course, in the antitype it is Christ's own offering of Himself securing acceptance for all the people of God.<a name=156:10></a> But then, Elijah was taken up into the heavens, bringing something into view altogether outside the ruined state of things in Israel.<a name=156:11></a> He is to be, typically, the ascended Christ; but before Elijah went up he took this wonderful journey with Elisha which leads to the point of translation.<a name=156:12></a>

		The question is raised here of the food supply in a time of famine.<a name=172:1></a> At such a time it is the concern of Christ that there should be food, but there was a lack of discernment in one who went out to gather herbs and brought what was wild, it was unwittingly shred into the pot.<a name=172:2></a> This was not an enemy's work but a mistake by one who intended to help; such mistakes have been a frequent source of trouble in the church.<a name=172:3></a> I think it sets forth the working of the human mind in the things of God.<a name=172:4></a> There may be a good intention without spiritual discernment.<a name=172:5></a> There has been an immense amount of teaching which was meant to do good but which has been really harmful to the people of God.<a name=172:6></a> But we see here how the Lord would use such an occasion to bring out His own resources in neutralising what is of the enemy, though introduced by friends.<a name=172:7></a>

		God brought the weight of death on Hezekiah's spirit, but it was really that he might learn how God could intervene in the power of resurrection so that he might go up on the third day to the house of Jehovah.<a name=211:5></a> But before going up there must be the application of the "cake of figs".<a name=211:6></a> It is clear from Scripture that the characteristic of the fig is sweetness; see <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#9:11">Judges  9:11</a>.<a name=211:7></a> So that I understand the "cake of figs" to be a symbol of the sweetness of divine intervention where all was apparently hopeless.<a name=211:8></a> Hezekiah wrote after he had recovered, "But thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction", and, "Jehovah was purposed to save me", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:17">Isaiah  38:17</a>, 20.<a name=211:9></a> He learned the love of God at the low point to which he was brought.<a name=211:10></a> It is terrible to us naturally to realise that death is upon us as before God, but it is just there that the love of God comes into contact with us.<a name=211:11></a> "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly.<a name=211:12></a> For scarcely for the just man will one die, for perhaps for the good man some one might also dare to die; but God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:6">Romans  5:6</a> - 8.<a name=211:13></a> The thought prominent in this Scripture is not that the claims of God have been met; that aspect of the truth comes out in the blood as put upon the mercy-seat.<a name=211:14></a> But here it is that

		Many believers have never definitely faced the fact that death is upon them; such have a very vague idea of what life is according to God.<a name=212:4></a> Hezekiah could say, "Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; and thou hast recovered me, and made me to live .<a name=212:5></a>.<a name=212:6></a>.<a name=212:7></a> The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:16">Isaiah  38:16</a>, 19.<a name=212:8></a> It was not simply that he recovered in a natural way, but his spirit was made to live as knowing the intervention of God for him as under death.<a name=212:9></a> So that he lived Godward in praise.<a name=212:10></a> Those who live by the Spirit in relation to God, as having God's love shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, know that it is in death that that love has reached them.<a name=212:11></a> "Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned .<a name=212:12></a>.<a name=212:13></a>.<a name=212:14></a> but death reigned from Adam until Moses .<a name=212:15></a>.<a name=212:16></a>.<a name=212:17></a> death reigned by the one .<a name=212:18></a>.<a name=212:19></a>.<a name=212:20></a> sin has reigned in the power of death", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:12">Romans  5:12</a>, 14, 17, 21.<a name=212:21></a> It is as the full weight of this comes on our spirits that we are prepared to appreciate that this dreadful thing, death, has become in the death of Christ the expression to us of the love of God.<a name=212:22></a> And the Holy Spirit delights to apply that love to us by shedding it abroad in our hearts.<a name=212:23></a> The death of Christ thus becomes to us peculiarly full of sweetness.<a name=212:24></a> It is not simply that we believe that God loves us, but His love is shed abroad in our hearts, and it becomes a power of life there.<a name=212:25></a> We are then amongst "the living" who can praise God for His love known through the death of Christ.<a name=212:26></a> The assembly is made up of such living persons.<a name=212:27></a> Normally one who has the Spirit

		But there is something more: "On the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah".<a name=213:3></a> That implies the power of resurrection.<a name=213:4></a> The sign of it was that Jehovah "brought the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward".<a name=213:5></a> It needed God to reverse the whole natural course of things.<a name=213:6></a> This was the wonder which was done in the land.<a name=213:7></a> I think the fact that the shadow went ten degrees backward intimates that death is removed in the power of resurrection in a way that is known to faith before the time when death will be publicly swallowed up in victory.<a name=213:8></a> While we are still here in the responsible life, where death is still manifestly upon all men, and, as to what is seen publicly, upon us too, we may know the power of Christ's resurrection, and we may be risen with Him by the faith of the working of God who raised Him from among the dead.<a name=213:9></a> Going up on the third day implies the truth that is brought out in the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=213:10></a> Saints can be risen with Christ before they are actually risen.<a name=213:11></a> Every one of us should apprehend this as a divine possibility.<a name=213:12></a> Going up to the house of Jehovah would be for us entering into the privileges of the assembly.<a name=213:13></a> The youngest of us should understand that we come together in assembly first of all to think of the great witness of divine love in the death of Christ.<a name=213:14></a> Then it is our privilege to magnify Christ in every aspect of His Person and glory, and in all that He is to the assembly as her glorious Head.<a name=213:15></a> Even the youngest and feeblest believer can say 'Amen' to every utterance which praises and magnifies Christ.<a name=213:16></a> And this would prepare us in a very blessed way to go up into conscious association with Him as risen with Him, and to know that even as ascended to the Father

		There has been a certain amount of exercise as to the service of song, and my thought in these Scriptures was that it might be spiritually profitable for us to see the connection between the service of song and the ark getting its place.<a name=236:1></a> No doubt we have all noticed that there is no such singing recorded either in the books of Samuel or in the books of Kings.<a name=236:2></a> In these books we see David as a type of Christ in victorious power, asserting the rights of God and doing great achievements in order that every adverse power might be brought into subjection and that the people of God might be in rest from all their enemies.<a name=236:3></a> That is suggestive of what Christ has done for us.<a name=236:4></a> But the service of song does not stand in relation to that; so that though there are great triumphs, and the people of God are brought into rest, the supremacy of David over every hostile power is unchallenged; yet there is no service of song.<a name=236:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Solomon had been previously charged to build the house but now he is charged in the presence of all those who represented all Israel.<a name=256:1></a> The princes, the military men and all who served the king were to understand that the building of the house of rest for the ark of the covenant was the principal thing in God's mind and that Solomon was to "build my house and my courts".<a name=256:2></a> Jehovah also had chosen him to be His son.<a name=256:3></a> All were to be brought into this great matter.<a name=256:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it is today.<a name=256:5></a> God would have all the people and His servants to know what is for His pleasure here upon the earth, because the house does not typify what is in heaven but a house of rest for God upon the earth.<a name=256:6></a> David adds, "and for the footstool of our God" (verse 2).<a name=256:7></a> God's thought is that the earth is to furnish a footstool for Him to convey His thoughts of blessing in a restful position.<a name=256:8></a> He has finished the work and is restful.<a name=256:9></a> The house is the house of rest for the ark of the covenant, that is, Christ as the Ark can be restful in the affections of saints as finding congenial conditions there.<a name=256:10></a> It is Christ as expressive of all that is in the heart of God manward, as seen particularly in Luke's gospel.<a name=256:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 1 I we read of "the house of the mercy-seat" -- a beautiful designation.<a name=256:12></a> God can be perfectly restful where He is known as revealed in Christ and through the death of Christ; and He would link all this with the thought of sonship for He has brought it all in by One who is the Son of His love.<a name=256:13></a> John's gospel comes in to give us the full sense

		of the blessedness of the declaration of God.<a name=257:1></a> It has come by One who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=257:2></a> Solomon represents Christ glorified as the Object of the Father's love.<a name=257:3></a> His present place is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=257:4></a> As Man He is in the most intimate enjoyment of the Father's love.<a name=257:5></a> We shall not understand the character of the house down here if we do not see that it is built by the Son glorified (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>).<a name=257:6></a> So there is that on earth which corresponds with what is in heaven.<a name=257:7></a> Whatever thoughts there are in connection with God being nearer to men -- such as the Ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat -- behind all and above all is that of Christ's blessed sonship.<a name=257:8></a> What restfulness for God is brought in there!<a name=257:9></a> The covenant as known by Israel included all that was in the mind of God for blessing so that in applying it to ourselves it includes sonship.<a name=257:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we can understand that David could not build the house.<a name=257:11></a> Fighting battles and overcoming what is adverse is very essential, but it does not minister rest to God.<a name=257:12></a> We may contend for the truth and stand for what is right and yet stop short of being a house of rest for God.<a name=257:13></a> Sonship must impress its own blessed character upon the whole system that comes under Solomon.<a name=257:14></a> We are thus encouraged to take a very exalted view of these types and to read into them a meaning that harmonizes with what is known in the assembly today.<a name=257:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that, in the light of this, we are to "keep and seek for all the commandments of Jehovah your God".<a name=257:16></a> This brings in all that is known as the divine will, whether of individual or collective application.<a name=257:17></a> If we get careless we may miss the most blessed things; we may, in a practical sense, lose the house and the land.<a name=257:18></a> Verse 9 is still true.<a name=257:19></a> The perfect heart and the willing mind are needed.<a name=257:20></a> God searches all hearts and discerns all the imaginations of the thoughts.<a name=257:21></a>

		The striking thing about this chapter is that all seems to stand connected with the porch.<a name=259:3></a> There is no veil in Kings but there is in Chronicles, no brazen altar in Kings but there is in Chronicles.<a name=259:4></a> What is to be learned from these?<a name=259:5></a> The porch, as I understand it, sets forth what is presented of God manward.<a name=259:6></a> It is the most conspicuous feature of the house, ten by twenty by one hundred and twenty cubits.<a name=259:7></a> It makes one think of the one hundred and twenty upon whom the Spirit came at Pentecost.<a name=259:8></a> There was a setting forth of the great things of God in them.<a name=259:9></a> They were all in the light of what had been set forth by the Lord in His service here, and they knew Him as risen and taken up into heaven.<a name=259:10></a> I think the height of the porch has reference to that.<a name=259:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the houses, treasuries, upper chambers, inner chambers and the house of the mercy-seat were all there behind the porch.<a name=259:12></a> Paul speaks of the mystery of the glad tidings, conveying to us that there is a great deal hidden, as it were, behind the glad tidings.<a name=259:13></a> If God dwells amongst His people there is a great deal that gives character to the glad tidings but which is in the background.<a name=259:14></a> Saints living in the love of God might answer today to the houses, resulting in our being very near to each other.<a name=259:15></a> Then the treasuries indicate that there has been an accumulation of what is precious.<a name=259:16></a> If we take the last hundred years what an accumulation of precious things has come into the house!<a name=259:17></a> Then the upper chambers would refer to what is above the level of man's thoughts altogether.<a name=259:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 13 we turn to the service Godward and the instruments of service.<a name=260:7></a> We find that the latter are divided into two classes as vessels of gold and vessels of silver; utensils they are called here; they are for use.<a name=260:8></a> The saints as utensils of silver think of themselves as of value to God but secured by redemption.<a name=260:9></a> We are brought back to God for His pleasure in all the value of the death of Christ.<a name=260:10></a> This is largely how we are viewed as eating the Lord's supper.<a name=260:11></a> It is largely Paul's teaching, that we are justified, reconciled, accepted in the Beloved and receiving sonship.<a name=260:12></a> All this is on redemption ground.<a name=260:13></a> We are in new creation on that ground.<a name=260:14></a>

		It often happens that when God has given light as to His mind those to whom it comes fail to rise to it.<a name=269:1></a> Solomon in this chapter is an example of this.<a name=269:2></a> In considering persons in the Old Testament who are typical of Christ we have always to distinguish between those features in which they are types of Christ and those incidents which bring out their own personal shortcomings.<a name=269:3></a> Even the latter are profitable to us and instructive; they are useful negatively just as the features typical of Christ are enriching in a positive way.<a name=269:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that if Solomon had acted in the light which had come to him through his father David he would not have gone to the tabernacle at Gibeon.<a name=269:5></a> He would have known that the true altar of burnt-offering was in the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.<a name=269:6></a> He was not truly a son of his father in going to Gibeon.<a name=269:7></a> This teaches us how easily we may drop down from what is proper to sonship; then the house drops out of view.<a name=269:8></a> It is noticeable that there is no reference to the house in Solomon's prayer in this chapter.<a name=269:9></a> The great outstanding interest of the moment was the house that was to be built, but Solomon was occupied with other things, very good and desirable things, but not God's chief interest at the moment.<a name=269:10></a> Many believers honour God, and are even honoured by Him, as having desires of which He approves and which He answers, who yet fall short of His present movements in grace and of what is His present glory.<a name=269:11></a> They are content with a measure of communion which is far less than it

		Two great events in David's life were the bringing of the ark to its resting-place in Zion and building the altar of burnt-offering in the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.<a name=270:3></a> Both these acts were the setting aside of the original order and the institution of something new in the ways of God.<a name=270:4></a> They were light given by God as to how He would get His place after the complete breakdown of the system set up by Moses.<a name=270:5></a> He would have His will done perfectly by Christ, and something set up to which the ark could be brought as a place of rest.<a name=270:6></a> Many scriptures speak of Zion as God's dwelling place.<a name=270:7></a> We need to apprehend this before we can take up the thought of the house as built by Solomon.<a name=270:8></a> Zion had been the stronghold of the enemy's power, but when taken by David it became the royal city and the resting place of the ark.<a name=270:9></a> Zion represents the assembly as the place where the reign of grace is known.<a name=270:10></a> The beautiful features of Zion, as seen in Scripture, set forth what marks the assembly as set up in the fulness of God's grace in Christ; every hostile element has been overcome, so that, under the mighty influence of Christ every heart is pervaded by divine grace.<a name=270:11></a> It is the fruit of His triumph here, not in heaven.<a name=270:12></a> In a spiritual sense christians are born in Zion; that is how God writes them up; they are sons and daughters of Zion.<a name=270:13></a> So that the bringing of the ark to Zion is bringing it to a place where all is of grace, which therefore answers to God's desires and is a place of rest for Him.<a name=270:14></a> He dwells there in complacency and can be known there.<a name=270:15></a> This is in contrast with the tabernacle which He had to forsake because it represented a system which failed to secure restfulness for Him.<a name=270:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Pending the setting up of the new system in Zion, God went on with the tabernacle service at Gibeon, though His ark was not there.<a name=270:17></a> He received the offerings and praises of

	<div class="paragraph">
		His people at a level lower than what was in His mind for them.<a name=271:1></a> This was the evidence of His patience during a transitional period.<a name=271:2></a> But when Zion had been set up, and the ark placed there, any thoughtful Israelite could have understood that an entire change had come about in the ways of God.<a name=271:3></a> Zion would have superseded Gibeon in his affections.<a name=271:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the altar in the threshing-floor of Ornan was further light.<a name=271:5></a> It was to be the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.<a name=271:6></a> A new economy was to be set up, which would supersede the tabernacle economy, but which would, in due time, incorporate all the spiritual features of the old economy.<a name=271:7></a> This raises the question whether we understand the new economy, what Christ has brought in as the true David, Zion as His city, and the ark as brought there.<a name=271:8></a> Or are we going on with something which has ceased to be pleasurable to God?<a name=271:9></a> Many believers are like Solomon here; they ignore the light which has come in from God, and they go on with things which for the time He bears with but which have no correspondence with His present mind.<a name=271:10></a> This is a peculiar state of things, but it answers to a good deal which goes on today.<a name=271:11></a> It is an aspect of the situation which brings out in a striking way the patience and forbearance of God.<a name=271:12></a> But, though God may bear with what is not in accord with His present mind and may even accept offerings from His people who go on with it, He has no restful satisfaction in it.<a name=271:13></a> When He has given light He will not countenance His people in ignoring it.<a name=271:14></a> He allows them to prove that Gibeon and its effects result in depreciation of what is precious, and in links with Egypt, and in helping on the world, and in delaying spiritual movements in regard to His house.<a name=271:15></a> That is the lesson in this chapter.<a name=271:16></a>

		worship soon became lowered to the level of Gibeon, and has continued there.<a name=272:1></a> God has borne with this in true saints, but it has not pleased Him; it has lowered the whole character of His service and He has allowed it to be seen that it tends to worldliness.<a name=272:2></a> But the truth has been revived in these last days, and the character of Zion has been set forth in much precious ministry so that it may be known that God dwells there as His desired rest; it is therefore a very serious thing to go on with Gibeon.<a name=272:3></a> It is, indeed, said that Gibeon was the great high place, as though to mark that it partook of idolatrous character.<a name=272:4></a> People may claim that they offer spiritual sacrifices, and that they truly praise God and have happy times, and even get their prayers answered in a remarkable way.<a name=272:5></a> But all this may be at Gibeon, and not at Zion or Jerusalem.<a name=272:6></a> God would impress on all His saints not to go on with things which He may be bearing with, but which are not in accord with His present mind or in keeping with the light which He has given.<a name=272:7></a> Many would say, 'God accepts our service and blesses us, and we are happy', and they think that is all that matters.<a name=272:8></a> But if God had indicated His mind as to how He would be served it will not please Him if we disregard the light which He has given.<a name=272:9></a> The "palace" will not be built at Gibeon.<a name=272:10></a> For that we must move in the present light of God; we must come to Zion and see the ark there restfully, and then to the new altar in the threshing-floor of Ornan.<a name=272:11></a> The house is built there; it can only be built there.<a name=272:12></a> David, as a man instructed of God, could not go before the altar at Gibeon, "for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21:30">1 Chronicles  21:30</a>.<a name=272:13></a> He realised that the tabernacle at Gibeon represented a system of things which was not in accord with the present mind of God, for He had forsaken it.<a name=272:14></a> And, moreover, it inspired fear because it was connected with legal requirement; a spirit of bondage again to fear came in that connection.<a name=272:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The purpose of Solomon "to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom" now comes into view, so that things are evidently on a different spiritual level from what we read in chapter 1.<a name=273:1></a> The description of the house as built by Solomon is amongst the things "written before" which "have been written for our instruction"; there is much to be learned from it as to the present mind of God.<a name=273:2></a> There is instruction in the fact that so many strangers were employed in the building.<a name=273:3></a> We learn from chapter 8, verses 7 and 8, that they were of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.<a name=273:4></a> They were of the nations doomed to destruction in Joshua's time, but now under Solomon they were made tributary and laboured in the building of the house.<a name=273:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This signifies how God takes up those who were once subject to His judgment, and brings them under the subduing power of Christ so that they become serviceable for the work of His house.<a name=273:6></a> This is one blessed result of Christ being in supremacy.<a name=273:7></a> Those who come under His influence become bondmen for the house, however unworthy and obnoxious they were before.<a name=273:8></a> Indeed, none come to labour for the house save on the terms that they deserve nothing -- "We also all once .<a name=273:9></a>.<a name=273:10></a>.<a name=273:11></a> were children, by nature, of wrath, even as the rest", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:3">Ephesians  2:3</a>.<a name=273:12></a> "For we were once ourselves also without intelligence, .<a name=273:13></a>.<a name=273:14></a>.<a name=273:15></a> living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:3">Titus  3:3</a>.<a name=273:16></a> It is that class of people who are rendered tributary until this day.<a name=273:17></a> Every one of them is expressive of the gracious power of Christ to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Solomon sending to Huram King of Tyre typifies the Gentile being brought in as contributing skill and material for the building.<a name=274:3></a> The house of God could not take its present form without the Gentiles.<a name=274:4></a> The great supper of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>and the younger son's coming in in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>shew how the Gentile gets a place in the house.<a name=274:5></a> So that the truth of the mystery is hinted at in this chapter.<a name=274:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a> Paul speaks of "the revelation of the mystery", and this great matter is developed in Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=274:7></a> It is something far greater than God's ways in connection with Israel, and something far greater than all promises or prophecies; it was "hidden throughout the ages in God", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:9">Ephesians  3:9</a>.<a name=274:8></a> The word "mystery" does not mean that it cannot be known, but that it is known only to those who are initiated into it.<a name=274:9></a> But when known it works out practically in the body and the house.<a name=274:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The house as seen typically in chapters 2 to 5 of 2 Chronicles is wholly for the pleasure of God.<a name=274:11></a> It is something quite apart from formal profession, and from the mixed multitude which passes as being christian.<a name=274:12></a> It is where God is served according to what He is as a Spirit, and therefore every feature of it bears the mark of "spirit and truth", <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>.<a name=274:13></a> It is very suggestive that Solomon should be able to speak so freely and fully to Huram about the house and the service that would be carried on in it.<a name=274:14></a> He evidently regarded Huram as able to follow intelligently the matters of which he spoke, and to take them up as contributing to them in a practical way.<a name=274:15></a> It is thus that the Gentiles are regarded in the ministry of Paul.<a name=274:16></a> (See <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:11">Ephesians  2:11</a> - 22; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:1">Ephesians  3:1</a> - 12; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:24">Colossians  1:24</a> - 29).<a name=274:17></a> By the calling and work of God the Gentiles are brought in to have part in His wondrous purpose, and to be "built together for a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things particularly mentioned by Solomon here: the burning of incense, the continual arrangement of the shewbread, and the burnt-offerings.<a name=275:7></a> He has before him mainly the thought of what was to be presented to God, and the three things mentioned largely cover the service of the house Godward.<a name=275:8></a> They bring out how the saints, as the holy priesthood, minister to God.<a name=275:9></a> The burning of incense refers, I believe, to how we approach God with prayers and praises, not as having in mind our personal needs and exercises, but God's wondrous thoughts with regard to us in Christ.<a name=275:10></a> We need to be furnished with God's thoughts as to His saints so as to be able to present them to God as having intelligently entered into them.<a name=275:11></a> It is as we are maintained in ability to do so that we can "burn before him sweet incense"; we can speak to Him as bringing the holy fragrance of what is for His pleasure and glory.<a name=275:12></a> We can understand what sweet incense there was in the Lord's wondrous prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and the recorded prayers of the apostle Paul are full of fragrance as bringing out what is in the mind and heart of God concerning His saints.<a name=275:13></a> Then the praises that are rightly found in the house of God are all suitable to the golden altar; they bring to God the fragrance of His wondrous thoughts in Christ as now known in the hearts of His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then "the continual arrangement of the shewbread", or, as it is literally, 'the bread of the presence', speaks of how the saints can be viewed of God as in the life of Christ, and thus wholly apart from the flesh, and in a spiritual order that is delightful to God.<a name=276:2></a> The result of reconciliation is that the saints can be presented holy and unblameable and irreproachable before the fulness of the Godhead (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:22">Colossians  1:22</a>).<a name=276:3></a> This is how the saints appear in the holy place; Christ is their life, as represented in the "fine wheaten flour" of which the cakes of shewbread were made.<a name=276:4></a> The "bread of remembrance" as it is called in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#24">Leviticus  24</a>is said to be "an offering by fire to Jehovah", and "most holy unto him of Jehovah's offerings by fire".<a name=276:5></a> This shews that it is regarded as wholly acceptable, and apart from anything that would not bear the fullest testing by God.<a name=276:6></a> It is intended to bring to our minds that, on the ground of the death of Christ, and in virtue of His work in them, God is able to view His saints according to what Christ is, who is their life.<a name=276:7></a> They are thus before Him for His eternal pleasure, for it is "an everlasting covenant" and "an everlasting statute" (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#24">Leviticus  24</a>).<a name=276:8></a> And saints, as divinely illuminated, can think of themselves thus as yielding pleasure to the heart of God.<a name=276:9></a> It is part of the service of the house that they can be thus presented.<a name=276:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this is on the ground of the burnt-offering.<a name=276:11></a> We have an entirely new and blessed ground of acceptance in Christ, and that is the fact that He has "delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:2">Ephesians  5:2</a>.<a name=276:12></a> In the service of the house this is never forgotten.<a name=276:13></a> It has its place "morning and evening", and "on the sabbaths and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God".<a name=276:14></a> That is to say it is carried on continuously as the essential basis of all the

		Solomon communicated to Huram his sense of the greatness of God, and that the house must be correspondingly great: "The house that I will build is great; for great is our God above all gods".<a name=277:2></a> This must ever be in our thoughts in regard to the house; we cannot think of anything small or unimportant in the house of One so great.<a name=277:3></a> Therefore great skill is required for the working out of what pertains to the house.<a name=277:4></a> And the fact that Huram is called upon to send a skilful man suggests that it was in the will of God that spiritual skill should be found amongst the Gentiles for the working out of those great thoughts which were to take form in His house.<a name=277:5></a> Consideration of Paul's epistles to saints in Gentile assemblies will shew us what has to be worked out.<a name=277:6></a> The following chapters in 2 Chronicles give us in a typical way much instruction as to this.<a name=277:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The large food supply in verse 10 shews us what is available for those who labour in connection with the house.<a name=277:8></a> Spiritual food of the finest quality is provided in abundance; I suppose there has never been so much brought before the saints in ministry since apostolic days as there has been during the last hundred years.<a name=277:9></a> And one cannot doubt that one great divine object has been to strengthen the people of God for labour in connection with His house.<a name=277:10></a> He intends that His house shall be built and finished before this present period closes.<a name=277:11></a> It has been frequently remarked that the books of Chronicles were written after the return from captivity.<a name=277:12></a> They were specially intended for remnant times so that saints in such times might be encouraged to bring what is in God's mind to completion, even though in a small and feeble way outwardly.<a name=277:13></a> We shall not be feeble spiritually if we feed on such food as is typified in verse 10 of this chapter.<a name=277:14></a> But we shall be feeble if we do not feed, and it is to be feared that this is the case with most of those who profess to know

		"Twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil".<a name=278:3></a> The wheat and the barley are for bread by which man's heart is strengthened (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#104:15">Psalm  104:15</a>).<a name=278:4></a> Even according to nature man's strength comes by food, and it is so in the realm of grace.<a name=278:5></a> I think Scripture suggests to us that wheat typifies the product in men of God's operations in grace.<a name=278:6></a> John the baptist said of the One who should come after him, "whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:12">Matthew  3:12</a>.<a name=278:7></a> "The seed is the word of God", and it fructifies in those "who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:15">Luke  8:15</a>.<a name=278:8></a> God's testimony of grace in Christ is the producing cause of all that is suitable to be brought into His granary, and the condition of men's hearts is revealed by how it acts upon them.<a name=278:9></a> If their hearts are "honest and good" -- and this must be by God's working in them, for no man naturally has "an honest and good heart" -- there is a result for God such as marks the feast of Pentecost, which is now running its course.<a name=278:10></a> For "the feast of weeks", that is Pentecost, is "the first-fruits of wheat-harvest", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:22">Exodus  34:22</a>.<a name=278:11></a>

		But "beaten wheat" indicates that it has passed the threshing-floor; there has been a beating out of the grain, and a winnowing away of the chaff.<a name=278:12></a> The Lord does this in His threshing-floor, and we are reminded of this when we read of the house being built "in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#3:1">2 Chronicles  3:1</a>.<a name=278:13></a> Threshing-floor experiences he at the very basis of any constructive work in the house of God.<a name=278:14></a> There must be the separation of what is precious from what is

		The "barley" brings before us Christ as the First-fruits for God after having been in death on account of all that we were and had done.<a name=279:7></a> The "barley-meal" in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5">Numbers  5</a>brought "iniquity to remembrance", but it was typical of Christ as bearing the judgment of Israel's unfaithfulness.<a name=279:8></a> Barley-harvest is prominent in the book of Ruth when the remnant, represented by Ruth and Naomi, returned to Bethlehem.<a name=279:9></a> When we have wandered and experienced restoring grace it is very sweet to find that Christ has borne what we deserved, and that He is the First-fruits of an order in which there will never be any failure.<a name=279:10></a>

		The fact that there are two cherubim in the most holy place would hardly refer to testimony, for testimony is not rendered there.<a name=291:4></a> I think the two may suggest divine government acting in a combined or co-operative way, so that a full result is reached in divine operations.<a name=291:5></a> In relation to God's protective government there is often a combination of forces working together to bring about the end that is before Him.<a name=291:6></a> We see this illustrated in the book of Esther.<a name=291:7></a> God breaks up man's combinations, as at Babel, but His combinations destroy the power of what is hostile to His thoughts and purposes.<a name=291:8></a> Two, when seen on God's part, confirm a thing.<a name=291:9></a> We have probably little idea how far-reaching have been the movements of divine government in favour of what is of Himself spiritually, or how effective they have been.<a name=291:10></a> It is a comfort to be reminded and assured of this, and especially at a time when so many powerful forces seem to be working adversely to what is of God.<a name=291:11></a>

		The dimensions of the brazen altar shew that this altar was many times the size of that made by Bezaleel in the wilderness.<a name=293:1></a> The altar, as known by us today, is very great, for it witnesses that divine love has been expressed in a sacrificial way, and this forms the basis of all our relations with God in His house.<a name=293:2></a> It is expressly said by God, "I have chosen for myself this place for a house of sacrifice", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#7:12">2 Chronicles  7:12</a>.<a name=293:3></a> There is something peculiarly touching in the love of divine Persons as expressed sacrificially because it has acted towards us who have had a sinful history here.<a name=293:4></a> The love of God as shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit is a sacrificial love: "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:6">Romans  5:6</a>), "But God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:8">Romans  5:8</a>), "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?<a name=293:5></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:32">Romans  8:32</a>), "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>), "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>, 15) and "The Christ loved us and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:2">Ephesians  5:2</a>).<a name=293:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		chose us in Christ before the world's foundation, and the love which gave us the place of children and sons.<a name=294:1></a> Then Christ chose us out of the world in His love, and called us, and He loves His own as given to Him by the Father.<a name=294:2></a> The Spirit in the book of Kings had in mind those aspects of divine love which are not sacrificial, for the altar is not mentioned in the description of the house there.<a name=294:3></a> But here in Chronicles it has its place, and is seen to be of large dimensions.<a name=294:4></a> In a day of recovery God would give the altar a very large place.<a name=294:5></a> Each kind of offering, the burnt-offering, the oblation, the peace-offering, the sin and trespass-offering, was brought to the altar, and the altar itself spoke of the capability and strength of Christ, by reason of what He was personally, to sustain the action of fire in such a way that the whole of His offering, and every part of it, yielded fragrance and glory to God.<a name=294:6></a> The altar is a place, too, for our sacrifices to be brought, and we shall be rich to offer if we really appreciate Him as the great Offerer, and that it is by Him that we offer.<a name=294:7></a>

		The altar and the other things mentioned in this chapter as being made of brass had their place in the court.<a name=294:8></a> They have to do typically with the assembly as seen in the place of responsible witness here; that is, as seen in 1 Corinthians.<a name=294:9></a> The Lord's supper has its place in that connection, and its having been restored in these last days to its place in the assembly has led to a much deeper appreciation of divine love as expressed sacrificially.<a name=294:10></a> The loaf and the cup speak of the love of Christ and of the love of God as expressed sacrificially, that is, in a way that involved sacrifice on the part of Christ and of God.<a name=294:11></a> We call to mind the One who gave His body and whose blood was poured out.<a name=294:12></a> His wondrous offering is past, and we now eat His supper to call Him to mind who is forever beyond all suffering.<a name=294:13></a> Indeed, it is evident that when in the midst of His apostles He instituted the Supper He was in spirit and

		The molten sea comes next in the description and it is evident that it contemplates conditions in which there is need for purifying.<a name=295:11></a> The sea was for the priests to wash in and none of us can suitably take up priestly service in the house of God without washing at this sea.<a name=295:12></a> And God would impress us with the very large provision which He makes for purifying; "in capacity it held three thousand baths".<a name=295:13></a> The whole of "the word" is available for purifying, and it is applied by the patient, persistent service of Christ, typified by the three hundred oxen which encompassed it round about, and also by the twelve oxen on which it stood, which looked north, west, south and east.<a name=295:14></a> The three hundred were "ten in a cubit"; they were relatively small, and suggest how Christ serves us in regard to purifying in detail.<a name=295:15></a> He would not have us to be careless about what seem to be small matters.<a name=295:16></a> Without His purifying service in detail we should be very apt to let something pass which would have a disqualifying effect in regard to priestly service in the house of God.<a name=295:17></a> A tender conscience and a priestly heart would not wish to be disqualified, and

		13 appear to represent the saints as set up in testimony here, which is the aspect of the assembly as seen in 1 Corinthians.<a name=298:1></a> What was made prominent on each pillar was a globe covered with a network which held two hundred pomegranates.<a name=298:2></a> The pomegranates were held in unity by the network, and all covered the globe.<a name=298:3></a> Without attempting to say that it is the strict interpretation of the type one may say that the underlying truth in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> is the unity of the body, into which all saints have been baptised in the power of one Spirit.<a name=298:4></a> The saints are also seen as held in a certain fellowship or communion which determines their associations here; all saints are called to the fellowship of God's Son, and are entitled to have their part in the fellowship of His blood and His body.<a name=298:5></a> This is a very practical reality, as may be seen by reading <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>; it held the saints together as apart from any association with the idolatrous world around them.<a name=298:6></a> We find at the beginning that all that believed "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>.<a name=298:7></a> They were held together in that way; none thought of breaking away from the fellowship; they would have been lawless if they had done so.<a name=298:8></a> In every believer sealed by the Spirit there is some fruit for God, as set forth in the pomegranates, but the fruit is never seen in its true setting until it is held in the network of the fellowship.<a name=298:9></a> It is essential to the testimony of God that it should appear in that setting.<a name=298:10></a> If saints disregard the fellowship they are really on the line of scattering and not of gathering.<a name=298:11></a> How could anyone who had known the happiness of walking in the fellowship ever think of breaking away from it?<a name=298:12></a> And yet we see this done sometimes, to the soul's great loss, and to the Lord's dishonour.<a name=298:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Huram acted under the authority of King Solomon in making the things of brass, but when the golden vessels are spoken of they are said to be made by Solomon.<a name=299:5></a> Certain things connected with the service of God belong to the sphere of lordship; they are matters of authority and commandment.<a name=299:6></a> "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>.<a name=299:7></a> But the more advanced and spiritual part of the service stands in relation to the headship of Christ; this answers to the vessels of gold which were found in the holy place.<a name=299:8></a>

		The one candlestick in the tabernacle was, no doubt, typical of Christ as sustaining light by the Spirit in the house of God.<a name=299:9></a> The ten candlesticks here would seem to refer to spiritual light being maintained on the principle of responsible service.<a name=299:10></a> Great spirituality is required for this; which is emphasised by the gold being spoken of as "pure" and "perfect"; and the lamps are said to burn "before the oracle".<a name=299:11></a> The divine thought is that there shall be a ministry in God's house that corresponds with the full disclosure of His mind.<a name=299:12></a> This necessitates continued enquiry, not only on the part of those who minister, but on the part of saints generally.<a name=299:13></a> We speak of temple light, and we should expect to have it as we enquire together.<a name=299:14></a> For what is in the Scriptures only becomes light to us as it is brought out by the Spirit.<a name=299:15></a> But if believers read the Scriptures with true exercise they could never be content with an unspiritual ministry.<a name=299:16></a> They would want to find a ministry

		The ten tables correspond in number with the ten candlesticks, and they carry the shewbread, which is literally, 'bread of the presence' (see note to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:30">Exodus  25:30</a>).<a name=300:5></a> This sets forth that spirituality enables us to view the saints as before God for His pleasure, having Christ as their life.<a name=300:6></a> If we think of Christ as Head we think of the body as being of Him.<a name=300:7></a> In Colossians the saints are not looked at as children or sons, but as the body, the assembly, for the expression of Christ under God's eye for His pleasure.<a name=300:8></a> The aspect of the mystery in Colossians is that Christ is in a company of Gentile saints, the hope of glory.<a name=300:9></a> It is the privilege of saints to know this as a spiritual reality, and to be before God in the holy place according to the truth of it.<a name=300:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The number "ten" in connection with the lavers, the candlesticks and the tables seems to indicate that God would have the truth of these things to be taken up in a practical way as the fruit of responsible exercise.<a name=300:11></a> The most purely spiritual things are not understood, or entered into, apart from attention to Scripture, and diligent enquiry and prayer.<a name=300:12></a> They will not be known apart from very real exercise in the soul.<a name=300:13></a> It is noticeable that Paul not only ministers the word, but he prays with intense fervour, suggesting to us that prayer is the way to have the ministry made good in our souls by the working of God.<a name=300:14></a> But all this exercise comes in on the responsible side and the thought of this seems to be conveyed by the use of the number 'ten'.<a name=300:15></a>

		I ventured to suggest the reading of this scripture, dear brethren, because in the types we are considering in Chronicles we are brought to a point when the Spirit of God tells us that there was nothing in the ark save the two tables, suggesting that it is possible to reach a point spiritually when Christ is regarded only from the standpoint of the will of God.<a name=302:1></a> I thought that was the teaching of it for us.<a name=302:2></a> That is, that the will of God has been fully and permanently secured in Christ, and by means of Christ He is going to displace everything else; so that even those matters which are essential for us as regarded in the wilderness, and in responsible service, are no longer in view.<a name=302:3></a> The golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod that budded are no longer found in the ark; they are there in Hebrews in the wilderness setting, but not in the ark when it is brought to rest -- nothing remains there but the will of God.<a name=302:4></a> I read the New Testament scriptures to develop that.<a name=302:5></a>

		The principal thing in this chapter is the bringing up of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah "to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place".<a name=310:3></a> The ark of the covenant is the most remarkable symbol to be found in Scripture, for, though it was a material thing, it was the actual seat of Jehovah's presence amongst His people.<a name=310:4></a> He is repeatedly said to dwell between the cherubim, and He said to Moses, "There will I meet with thee, and will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, everything that I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:22">Exodus  25:22</a>.<a name=310:5></a> The ark is said to be God's strength and His glory (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:61">Psalm  78:61</a>); and it is called "the ark of thy strength", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:8">Psalm  132:8</a>.<a name=310:6></a> But the history of the ark shews us that the greatest privilege that can be conferred upon man only becomes the occasion to bring out the evil that is in man's heart.<a name=310:7></a> When Israel had the ark in their midst they dishonoured it by their high places and graven images and yet they assumed that it would help them against their enemies!<a name=310:8></a> This only resulted in the ark itself being given into captivity.<a name=310:9></a> This shews that, apart from His sovereignty in mercy, the nearer God comes to men the more will He be dishonoured, and this was fully proved when He was manifested in flesh in the person of Jesus.<a name=310:10></a> If His glory and His thoughts of blessing are to be known He must undertake the whole matter Himself.<a name=310:11></a> And this is what He has done, and it is seen typically in the ark being protected and cared for, and, in due time, brought by David to a resting place in Zion.<a name=310:12></a>

		But David came in, typical of Christ as the One able to do God's will in meeting and setting aside the power of the enemy so that a place of rest might be secured for God and for the ark of His strength.<a name=311:1></a> Scripture suggests two distinct thoughts in relation to the securing of Zion.<a name=311:2></a> First, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, it is reached as the outcome of David's "affliction", and his unselfish devotion to "find out a place for Jehovah".<a name=311:3></a> Then in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#11">1 Chronicles  11</a>we read that "David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David".<a name=311:4></a> The seat of the enemy's power became David's stronghold as the result of his victory.<a name=311:5></a> In His devotion Christ has come in, at all cost to Himself, to secure a place for God in the very spot where the enemy held sway.<a name=311:6></a> He allowed no affliction or difficulty to turn Him aside from this purpose of His heart.<a name=311:7></a> On the other hand, He acted in victorious power to secure Zion by conquest.<a name=311:8></a> In the very place where "sin has reigned in the power of death" He so met and overcame all the power of the enemy that at the present time grace reigns through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=311:9></a> The ark was brought to a place of rest in being brought to Zion, but it was there provisionally as being in "a tent".<a name=311:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is instructive to consider the difference between the place which David prepared for the ark in Zion and the place to which Solomon brought it in the most holy place in the house.<a name=311:11></a> The first was a provisional place of rest, but the house was a permanent resting place, for the staves being drawn out indicated that the ark was not to be carried again.<a name=311:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God desired a place of rest in relation to all that had come in here by sin and Satan's power, and Christ has secured that rest for Him.<a name=312:5></a> David's bringing the ark to Zion typifies how, when men had forfeited all title to blessing from God, He took up in the sovereignty of His mercy, through the Lord Jesus Christ, a position where He can be known as extremely favourable to men.<a name=312:6></a> Nothing can be added by either God or men to the grace that reigns now through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=312:7></a> God is in the attitude of forgiveness towards all men.<a name=312:8></a> Righteousness, life, salvation and every blessing that divine favour can bestow are available for men.<a name=312:9></a> God has left Sinai and come to Zion, and all there subsists according to what He is Himself as set forth in Christ.<a name=312:10></a> God does not look for anything in man, save repentance, but He is perfectly at rest in what He has set forth of Himself in Christ, and in what is available for men in Christ.<a name=312:11></a> There is not a feature of need in men which is not fully provided for by the all-blessing grace of God.<a name=312:12></a> It might be thought that none who knew this would hesitate a moment to turn to such a God, to boast and glory in Him for evermore!<a name=312:13></a> But such is the alienation of the human heart from God that nothing but the touch of sovereign mercy can bring about in that heart a true appreciation of God as dwelling in Zion.<a name=312:14></a> All must be of Himself, the abundantly blessed provision in

		Blessed as Zion is, it is not the culmination of God's thoughts.<a name=313:9></a> David was right in desiring that the ark should not remain "under curtains", for Jehovah said to him, "Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#6:8">2 Chronicles  6:8</a>.<a name=313:10></a> But the house was to be built by one of whom Jehovah said, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:13">1 Chronicles  17:13</a>.<a name=313:11></a> This was a prophetic declaration that the full thought of God could only be brought in and established by One in the relationship of Son to Him.<a name=313:12></a> The Spirit of God has greatly magnified, in recent years amongst the saints, the truth of the Lord's sonship, and this has been in view of God's great and blessed thoughts being brought out in their completeness and finality.<a name=313:13></a> Solomon bringing the ark up to its place in the house indicates typically that the full thought of God is reached.<a name=313:14></a> The ark being brought into "the oracle of the house" suggests the full revelation of God's mind; it is very much Christ as seen

		Then the possibility is suggested (verses 24, 25) of God's people being "put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee".<a name=340:3></a> This contemplates a general defection which exposes the people of God to inroads of the enemy whereby they suffer loss of their divinely given inheritance.<a name=340:4></a> The saints at Corinth and in the Galatian assemblies are examples of this.<a name=340:5></a> And it can hardly be denied that at the present time the principles of the world have so prevailed that the blessing in Christ is very little known or enjoyed.<a name=340:6></a> But the way is open to "turn again and confess thy name".<a name=340:7></a> We are called by God's name (chapter 7: 14), but we may give up the confession of it, and all manner of evil may come in for which He may have to chasten us.<a name=340:8></a> Recovery is brought about by turning again, and confessing the name we have sinned against.<a name=340:9></a> This is more than confessing our sins; we confess the positive excellence of the name that has been made known to us, and this leads to genuine repentance and turning from sin.<a name=340:10></a> It is in giving God's name its true place that individual or collective recovery takes place.<a name=340:11></a> It is in thinking of Him, and of the wondrous way in which He is known to us through the Lord Jesus Christ, that we are recovered.<a name=340:12></a> It is possible deeply to regret past or present failure without getting relief or restoration.<a name=340:13></a> When we have sinned and are conscious of it the way back is to confess what God is notwithstanding what we have been.<a name=340:14></a> It is very suitable to confess how wrong we have been, but this does not bring power into the soul.<a name=340:15></a> In confessing what is positive we find the true power of restoration, and we pray differently when we return to God's name.<a name=340:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I purpose to make a few remarks on the seven things which the Queen of Sheba saw during her visit to Solomon.<a name=365:1></a> I need hardly say that I do not intend to dwell on these things in a merely historical way, but as figurative of certain things which are now made good in Christianity in connection with Christ risen and glorified.<a name=365:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that she saw was "the wisdom of Solomon".<a name=365:3></a> One of the first great lessons that we have to learn in Christianity is that Christ is the Wisdom of God.<a name=365:4></a> This comes out in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>.<a name=365:5></a> We have to see that every human resource and activity has been brought to nothing.<a name=365:6></a> Corinth was second only to Athens as a centre of learning, and as the headquarters of different schools of philosophy; and the saints were evidently affected by the atmosphere around them, as we all are more or less.<a name=365:7></a> Hence the apostle found it necessary to insist that the cross set man in the flesh completely aside with all his wisdom and power.<a name=365:8></a> There is nothing in the cross in which man can boast.<a name=365:9></a> No man could boast in the fact that he was under death.<a name=365:10></a> Human wisdom is of no account whatever in the things of God.<a name=365:11></a> Yet it is deeply rooted in people's minds that a preacher must be a learned man; his mind must be trained, and so on.<a name=365:12></a> The cross is very little understood.<a name=365:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>we learn that God operated in wisdom in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=366>[Page 366]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connection with creation and in carrying out His purpose.<a name=366:1></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>we read that the Word became flesh and dwelt amongst men, and it was in Him that God's wisdom was seen.<a name=366:2></a> Then at the cross we see man in the flesh condemned and removed in judgment, while at the same time all the blessedness of God's love is brought to light.<a name=366:3></a> Finally, Christ is raised and glorified at God's right hand, and He is "God's power and God's wisdom", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:24">1 Corinthians  1:24</a>.<a name=366:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It follows from this that the wisdom of God does not come within the cognizance of man's natural powers.<a name=366:5></a> It is "hidden wisdom", "God's wisdom in a mystery".<a name=366:6></a> It can only be known by the Spirit (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>).<a name=366:7></a> The thought of "wisdom" is the revelation of God in all the blessedness and perfection of counsels and resources that no power of evil can baffle.<a name=366:8></a> The fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ the glorified Man (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>).<a name=366:9></a> The effect of apprehending Christ as the Wisdom of God is to make us not only independent of man's wisdom, but infinitely superior to it.<a name=366:10></a> And we not only have Christ objectively as "God's wisdom", but "we have the mind of Christ".<a name=366:11></a> We have a new and divine intelligent faculty by which we can apprehend the wisdom of God.<a name=366:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thing mentioned as being seen by the Queen of Sheba was "the house that he had built".<a name=366:13></a> Christ is the builder of everything that is for God's pleasure and glory on earth.<a name=366:14></a> The Father prepared the material and brought it to Him (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:37">John  6:37</a>, 45, etc.<a name=366:15></a>), and He put it together in resurrection power as His assembly (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>).<a name=366:16></a> There is divine material and a divine Builder, and the result is a divine structure.<a name=366:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ's assembly is God's house.<a name=366:18></a> The connection between the two thoughts is seen in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>, 12.<a name=366:19></a> The assembly is Christ's, but He sings God's praises in the midst thereof, and this gives it the character of God's house.<a name=366:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>Christ as a divine Person -- the Son --

		<a name=367>[Page 367]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		builds the house, and is over it as Son.<a name=367:1></a> When we come to the house of God we find what is characteristic of Christianity, viz.<a name=367:2></a>, that the carrying out of God's pleasure is no longer entrusted to servants -- however faithful such might be, as for example, Moses -- but everything is brought about by the Son.<a name=367:3></a> That is, everything is accomplished by God Himself in the Person of the Son.<a name=367:4></a> It is this which gives the character of perfection to everything in Christianity.<a name=367:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1">1 Peter  1</a>and 2 give us what may be called our side of the truth of God's house; that is, we see the different elements of the divine work by which we are constituted living stones in chapter 1, and in chapter 2 we see the effect of that work in saints coming to the Living Stone so as to be built up a spiritual house.<a name=367:6></a> In result, God's pleasure and God's testimony are found here in the assembly.<a name=367:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Approach to God in the sanctuary (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>) is the highest privilege of those who form the house of God.<a name=367:8></a> They are also introduced to a circle where divine satisfaction can be found, and where God's light and perfection is revealed (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>).<a name=367:9></a> This is a subject which attracts one's heart, but which I cannot enlarge upon now.<a name=367:10></a> It will come before us to some extent in the next section of our subject.<a name=367:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third thing which the queen saw with admiration was "the food of his table".<a name=367:12></a> I have just mentioned that in the house of God we come to a circle where divine satisfaction can be found.<a name=367:13></a> There is food there.<a name=367:14></a> In the world, the greater your desires are and the more refined your tastes the less likely you are to get satisfaction.<a name=367:15></a> But in the house of God, the more your spiritual desires and capacities are enlarged the more perfect is your satisfaction, for there is an overflowing provision.<a name=367:16></a> It is not only that grace and strength are vouchsafed to us in times of need and pressure -- I trust we all know something of this -- but there is that which satisfies every spiritual craving and desire of those

		<a name=368>[Page 368]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		born of God.<a name=368:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At every stage of our spiritual history the Spirit creates in our souls exercises and desires appropriate to our state, and by which we are prepared to appreciate that which may be known of God and of His beloved Son.<a name=368:2></a> Spiritual tastes and appetites are thus brought into being, which can only be satisfied by the knowledge of God.<a name=368:3></a> But in the food of God's house there is that which perfectly satisfies these spiritual tastes.<a name=368:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I apprehend that 'milk' is a figure of divine grace, adapting itself to our need and weakness.<a name=368:5></a> It is the suited food for babes; that is, those in spiritual immaturity.<a name=368:6></a> But 'meat' represents all that which has to do with divine purpose and counsel.<a name=368:7></a> It is that in which the blessedness of God Himself is set forth.<a name=368:8></a> This is the food of those who are full-grown, those who have come to the apprehension that the flesh is worthless, and that everything for God is established in Christ risen and glorified.<a name=368:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, the queen noticed "the deportment of his servants".<a name=368:10></a> The word translated "deportment" does not exactly convey how they conducted themselves but rather the excellence of their position and privilege as being called to serve in Solomon's house.<a name=368:11></a> It was a most blessed position to occupy.<a name=368:12></a> "Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom!<a name=368:13></a>" They had their dwelling in the circle of Solomon's greatness and glory, and they were privileged continually to hear his wisdom.<a name=368:14></a> We may see in this a figure of the character of christian blessing.<a name=368:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our true blessing and joy does not consist in receiving certain things from Christ, but in being drawn to Him so as to find everything that is blessed and satisfying for our hearts in Him.<a name=368:16></a> Christ does not give blessings away to be enjoyed apart from Himself.<a name=368:17></a> He gives every blessing in Himself.<a name=368:18></a> The great longing of the psalmist was expressed
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=369>[Page 369]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in the words, "One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty" (or graciousness) "of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>.<a name=369:1></a> Again it is written, "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be constantly praising thee.<a name=369:2></a> Selah", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84:4">Psalm  84:4</a>.<a name=369:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find the same spirit in the two disciples who heard John speak and followed Jesus.<a name=369:4></a> When He said unto them, "What seek ye?<a name=369:5></a> .<a name=369:6></a>.<a name=369:7></a>.<a name=369:8></a> <i>they</i> said to him, Rabbi (which being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?<a name=369:9></a> He says to them, Come and see.<a name=369:10></a> They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:38">John  1:38</a>, 39.<a name=369:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed to be drawn thus into the presence of One in whom all divine wisdom and love is revealed!<a name=369:12></a> The true Solomon in all His glory, "(as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth", the revealer of the Father!<a name=369:13></a> How blessed to be amongst the "men" given to Him by the Father, that they may find in Him the revelation of the Father, and thus be brought into life eternal!<a name=369:14></a> Solomon's servants dwelt in the light of his wisdom and glory, and were happy.<a name=369:15></a> But what was their portion and privilege compared with ours?<a name=369:16></a> We may see in them, indeed, a lovely and striking picture; but it is only a picture.<a name=369:17></a> It is given to us, through infinite grace and love, to enter into the divine reality in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=369:18></a> May God encourage our hearts to do so!<a name=369:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing which impressed the queen was "the order of service of his attendants" (or ministers), "and their apparel".<a name=369:20></a> All the appointments of the house, with its different offices, and the orderly and harmonious working of the whole, revealed the wisdom and perfect administration of Solomon.<a name=369:21></a> In this we see a figure of the order that properly belongs to the house of God.<a name=369:22></a> Christendom in

		general has entirely departed from the divine order, having lost the sense of what that order is.<a name=370:1></a> The administration of the Lord Jesus, and the presence of the Spirit here, are quite unknown in any practical way in christendom generally.<a name=370:2></a> Hence we find ecclesiastical systems set up, and religious officials appointed to maintain human order.<a name=370:3></a> On the other hand, not a few have left the organised religious bodies, and taken independent and professedly non-sectarian ground, that they might be at liberty to serve and minister in their own way.<a name=370:4></a> But clerical order and radical independency are alike unknown in the house of God.<a name=370:5></a> Everything there is under the administration of one Lord, and is in the power of the one Spirit.<a name=370:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The clerical system stands hopelessly condemned in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=370:7></a> However great and gifted a man may be, he is only one member of the body, and he cannot possibly discharge the functions of the other members.<a name=370:8></a> The attempt to do so can only be a human effort, unprofitable to men and displeasing to the Lord.<a name=370:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The radical principle of everyone doing as he feels led is, if possible, a greater evil still, for it gives room for all the evils of one-man-ministry to be multiplied, and often subjects saints to the infliction of ministry (so called) from men whose only qualifications are self-confidence, and a desire to hear their own voices.<a name=370:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Edification is the great end of all ministry.<a name=370:11></a> The saints are to be built up in the knowledge of God; Christ is to be ministered to our hearts, and the things of the Spirit presented to us.<a name=370:12></a> And this, not merely in a general way -- the barren statement of things admitted to be true -- but so as to lead us on in a deepened knowledge of God.<a name=370:13></a> As our spiritual capacities are enlarged we should find in the house of God a ministry that would continually help and edify us.<a name=370:14></a> A ministry that does this approves itself to every spiritual mind as being of God.<a name=370:15></a> It carries the stamp of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subduing knowledge of divine Persons, and a deep sense of the greatness of divine thoughts, characterizes every true minister.<a name=371:2></a> We realise that he is not seeking to make himself prominent, or to display his ability in the way he presents things.<a name=371:3></a> He is conscious of the greatness and blessedness of that which he seeks to present and it is his one desire that it should become great and blessed to our hearts.<a name=371:4></a> We see that he is absorbed by it, that it elevates him above self-consideration, and this gives moral weight to his ministry.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The service that is of God makes divine Persons and divine thoughts prominent.<a name=371:6></a> In this way the knowledge of God characterises His house, and true edification is found there.<a name=371:7></a> The "order of service of his attendants" is invariably on the line of edification (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>).<a name=371:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word as to "their apparel".<a name=371:9></a> Everything about Solomon's ministers was suitable and appropriate to their service.<a name=371:10></a> Their personal appearance was consistent with their high service.<a name=371:11></a> How important is this!<a name=371:12></a> People will pay little heed to the ministry of those whose personal appearance and ways are not in harmony therewith.<a name=371:13></a> I have heard of one who was continually speaking of being 'dead with Christ', but going on with much worldliness at the same time.<a name=371:14></a> Such ministry only dishonours the Lord, and is a stumbling-block to souls.<a name=371:15></a> The apparel does not match the service!<a name=371:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		The great throne speaks symbolically of what is secured in Christ.<a name=376:3></a> It must necessarily be a great throne, when we think of the greatness of the Person that is to occupy it.<a name=376:4></a> He is not only Son of man, able to take up all God's thoughts as to man and bring them to fruition, but in order to do that He must needs be a divine Person.<a name=376:5></a> So it is evident in the reference to the Son of man that none could take that place but a divine Person.<a name=376:6></a> The Lord seems to cherish the title of Son of man specially.<a name=376:7></a> In the gospels He refers many times to that title, but He makes it clear that He was nevertheless a divine Person.<a name=376:8></a> Before the council He testified to the high priest, following his adjuration, that they should see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power: that is, He appropriates to Himself what belongs to Jehovah.<a name=376:9></a> So these thoughts are essential to any divine conception of the throne.<a name=376:10></a> It is occupied by the Son of man, who clearly is a divine Person, therefore it is due to Him in every way that He should have the place of supremacy in the universe of God.<a name=376:11></a> He is the One we now look upon as crowned with glory and honour.<a name=376:12></a> It is characteristic of the dispensation that we should look upon Him in all His suitability and fitness to occupy the universal throne.<a name=376:13></a> I think that Stephen is the pattern; his confession was that he saw "the Son of man standing at the right hand of God".<a name=376:14></a> These thoughts are stupendous, and yet we cannot think truly of the throne in a divine sense without rightly taking them in.<a name=376:15></a>

		Zerah the Ethiopian represents the hostility of the natural man in his darkness against what is of God.<a name=389:6></a> The faithfulness of Asa called out this opposition so that the question was really between God and man.<a name=389:7></a> It was a clear-cut issue.<a name=389:8></a> So that it made no difference whether there was much or no power with them who were attacked.<a name=389:9></a> It was Jehovah and His army.<a name=389:10></a> So there is absolute victory; none of the enemy were left alive, and very much spoil was secured.<a name=389:11></a> It is always so when the enemy is met in reliance upon God.<a name=389:12></a> Every form of opposition brings out the truth more clearly, so that the saints become stronger at the very points which have been attacked.<a name=389:13></a> I doubt whether we really stand intelligently in any truth until we have to meet darkness as to it, either in ourselves or in others.<a name=389:14></a> It is a real help to us when Zerah comes with apparently overwhelming power because we are acting faithfully in a day of recovery.<a name=389:15></a> We see also that there was offering to God out of

		And there was, in addition, a great confirmation by the Spirit of God through Azariah.<a name=390:2></a> God's fixed principles of acting come in as a great encouragement in a day of recovery.<a name=390:3></a> Verse 2 of chapter 15 indicates fixed principles answering to 2 Timothy.<a name=390:4></a> Every victorious conflict is a source of strength, and the prophetic word gives intelligent assurance.<a name=390:5></a> "There is a reward for your deeds" (verse 7).<a name=390:6></a>

		It is sad to think of Jehoshaphat, in whom there was much that was commendable, bringing into his household such a person as Athaliah.<a name=392:1></a> She was the daughter of Ahab, who "wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah more than all that were before him" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#16:30">1 Kings  16:30</a>), and who took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, a worshipper of Baal.<a name=392:2></a> It was when Jehoshaphat had "riches and honour in abundance" that "he allied himself with Ahab by marriage", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#18:1">2 Chronicles  18:1</a>.<a name=392:3></a> Outward prosperity, accompanied by spiritual decline, led to this unholy alliance.<a name=392:4></a> Jehoshaphat did not foresee that Athaliah would prove to be the inveterate enemy of all divine rights in Judah, but this turned out to be the case.<a name=392:5></a> There can be no doubt that true saints have often been used by Satan to bring in principles and practices that are really lawless because they have not their origin in the will of God.<a name=392:6></a>

		Paul made known to the Thessalonians that "the mystery of lawlessness already works" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:7">2 Thessalonians  2:7</a>), and he intimates that it would continue to work, though with a certain divine restraint upon it, until the lawless one, the personal antichrist, should be revealed.<a name=392:7></a> It is a serious matter for consideration that the mystery of lawlessness is working at the present time in every part of the christian profession.<a name=392:8></a> Of course it is not declared to be such or it would not be a mystery.<a name=392:9></a> It is like the leaven which the woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.<a name=392:10></a> It is working all the time bringing man's will into the sphere where God's will alone should

	<div class="paragraph">
		But God does not suffer such a working of evil without providing a counter action in His own gracious working, so, following upon the passage quoted from 2 Thessalonians, it is written, "only there is he who restrains now until he be gone".<a name=393:5></a> We can thank God that the restraining power is not yet gone, and I believe He would have us to learn from the Scripture before us how it works.<a name=393:6></a>

		Athaliah's real character and object soon came to light.<a name=393:7></a> She "rose up and exterminated all the royal seed of the house of Judah".<a name=393:8></a> She could not bear that there should be any rival to her own supremacy.<a name=393:9></a> The will of man in the sphere of divine things is never harmless or neutral; however unwittingly it may be introduced it is always hostile to the authority of the Lord and to the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit.<a name=393:10></a> The royal seed was representative of that which would maintain divine rights as against all that was lawless, and the mystery of lawlessness exposes its true character by its hatred of that which expresses the will of God.<a name=393:11></a> Two conflicting forms of man's will may agree to tolerate each other, but they will unite to oppose, and, if possible, to destroy what is set to maintain the will of God.<a name=393:12></a> The mystery of lawlessness works in such things as putting christians under the law, attaching life-giving efficacy to sacraments, setting up episcopal and priestly authority, or forming believers into sects each of which has its own

		But God works, as we have said, to preserve what is of Himself and I believe this has been seen particularly during the last hundred years or a little longer.<a name=394:4></a> There has been, first, a hidden work of God in the affections of saints leading them to value and cherish what is of Himself as seen in Christ, and then a spiritual movement that has secured in the way of public testimony what is due to Christ, so that in result, the service of God according to His will might go on in the very scene where the mystery of lawlessness has well-nigh dominated everything.<a name=394:5></a> Not that we see this on a very large scale.<a name=394:6></a> The prophetic picture of it in the Scripture before us does not lead us to expect that for it centres in a babe who was entirely dependent on the care of others.<a name=394:7></a> But for his aunt and his nurse, Joash would undoubtedly have been slain, but a secret working of God in a faithful remnant secured his preservation.<a name=394:8></a>

		God would have us to see typically in Joash one who is distinctively the king's son, and in whom, as such, there is power for the maintenance of what is of God notwithstanding the presence and mighty working of the mystery of lawlessness.<a name=395:4></a> That is, he is typically Christ viewed as small and of little account in men's eyes, but discerned to be most precious by certain persons who cherish and safeguard Him, first in secret, and then in a more public way, until His ascendancy brings about the complete overthrow of lawlessness.<a name=395:5></a> In its full result this will be accomplished publicly at the coming of the Lord, but this is not what is set before us in this type, but rather the present spiritual result as known in the realm of faith of Christ getting His true place in the hearts of His lovers.<a name=395:6></a> It should be evident to those taught of God that the true royal seed is Christ for He is the only One absolutely free from the principles of lawlessness.<a name=395:7></a> The work of God in human hearts leads to Him being preserved and defended and honoured; this is what we see in the scripture before us.<a name=395:8></a> Joash was a type of Christ as recognised and honoured by faith and love at a time when evil is in ascendancy amongst the people of God.<a name=395:9></a> We do not get a type in this chapter of what Christ does for faith, but of what faith and love do for Him.<a name=395:10></a> We see here, in picture, assembly affection and care for Him, the result of His being known as the One in

		The mystery of lawlessness always works through the natural mind and will of man, but where there is a subjective state wrought by God, represented by Jehoshabeath, and there is priestly intelligence, represented by Jehoiada, saints will discern that the wisdom of this world is essentially hostile to Christ.<a name=399:6></a> He must be hidden from it in the sense that it is not permitted to intrude, even in the smallest degree, into the testimony concerning Him.<a name=399:7></a> The intrusion of the mind and will of man has proved fatal to the knowledge of Christ and of the assembly in Christendom generally, and it is only where the import of the cross has been, in measure, apprehended, and place given to the Spirit of God, that there has been any return to the truth.<a name=399:8></a>
