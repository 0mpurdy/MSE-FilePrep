		CHRISTIANITY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many in the present day seem to think that Christianity is a development of Judaism, but there could be no greater mistake.<a name=3:1></a> Christianity is the introduction of what is wholly new and altogether divine in the Person of the Son of God.<a name=3:2></a> We are slow to get hold of this.<a name=3:3></a> We do not readily perceive that "the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:6">Matthew  16:6</a>), and human sentiment (verses 22, 23) are things of which to beware.<a name=3:4></a> But if we savour the things that be of men we are far from the savour of "things that are of God".<a name=3:5></a> The leaven of the Pharisees is human religiousness, and the leaven of the Sadducees is human intellect working in connection with divine things.<a name=3:6></a> Both are to be dreaded and shunned as elements ever opposed to what is of God, and human sentiment is no better in result, however well it may appear on the surface.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The full revelation of God has come out in Christ the Son.<a name=3:8></a> This gives Christ an altogether unrivalled place in the estimation of everyone who has been taught of the Father.<a name=3:9></a> Godhead glory shines out in Him before our adoring hearts.<a name=3:10></a> I do not refer to this merely as christian doctrine, but as something which has become a very great reality to us.<a name=3:11></a> It is our deep joy to know the blessed God revealed in His beloved Son.<a name=3:12></a> God has spoken to us in the Son, and He would have us to look at the wonderful record contained in the gospels, in the intelligence of the Holy Spirit, to see the revelation of Himself in it all.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then whatever came out in the life of Jesus here was uttered in a far deeper way at the cross.<a name=3:14></a> What a telling forth of God's heart was there!<a name=3:15></a> The death of the Son of God is the mighty voice of divine love to man.<a name=3:16></a> The ruin, need, guilt, and
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		condemnation of man, the sinner, only serve as the dark background to show in stronger light the love that would reach him and bless him in spite of it all.<a name=4:1></a> When all were in utter darkness and ignorance of God, He spoke in that amazing hour of Calvary so that He might be known, and loved, and worshipped by all who have ears to hear.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The revelation of God necessarily carries with it salvation for men.<a name=4:3></a> God has spoken to us in the Person of the Son (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>), and the "great salvation" began to be spoken by the Lord (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>).<a name=4:4></a> Salvation is man's inheritance according to the grace of God.<a name=4:5></a> The portion of men in God's mind is to be "heirs of salvation", and those who despise their birthright are profane persons like Esau, entirely alienated from God.<a name=4:6></a> Salvation for men is bound up with the revelation of God because that revelation has come out in the way of redemption.<a name=4:7></a> The heart of God was toward man, but certain terrible questions stood in the way.<a name=4:8></a> Sins, death and the curse seemed to bar the blessing of men, but the Son has removed them all out of the way.<a name=4:9></a> He "having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>), and men can now find salvation in the knowledge of God.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing -- the rights of God are all taken up in His beloved Son.<a name=4:11></a> There are two things in this connection: the inheritance and the throne.<a name=4:12></a> God has established the Son "heir of all things"; He will take up his inheritance in the Person of the Son.<a name=4:13></a> Then the throne -- the rule of God -- will also be taken up in the Son, so that God's inheritance may be filled with order and blessing under His rule.<a name=4:14></a> The glorious Person who is great enough for all this, and the knowledge of Him by the Father's work in souls, is the Rock on which the assembly is built.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All saints are living stones for Christ's assembly by divine calling.<a name=4:16></a> That is what we are in the thought and intention of God.<a name=4:17></a> But we have to become living stones characteristically, and the Father's work is essential to this.<a name=4:18></a> Peter was a kind of

	<div class="paragraph">
		pattern man; he confessed the Christ, the Son of the living God, by the Father's revelation; but no doubt he had afterwards to reach what was involved in his confession in the history of his soul.<a name=5:1></a> We often get things first as divine light, and then we have to be brought into the spiritual reality of them by the work of God in our souls.<a name=5:2></a> These two things must ever be kept in view: what we are by God's calling and what we are by God's work.<a name=5:3></a> The first is all that is in God's mind for us; the second is the measure of our experimental entrance upon it.<a name=5:4></a> The first is altogether divine and perfect; as to the second the Spirit may be grieved by us and the work of God hindered.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly, as built by Christ, is composed of those who are in the life of Christ by the Spirit and who own no other, and therefore the gates of hades cannot prevail against it.<a name=5:6></a> Satan can overthrow everything that is of man, but he cannot prevail against what is of Christ.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord said to Peter, "Thou art Peter, (a stone: note h, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>) and on this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=5:8></a> There is something in common between a stone and a rock; a stone is a small piece of the same material as a rock.<a name=5:9></a> Peter was a bit of the Rock, and that is what saints are.<a name=5:10></a> As taught by the Father to appreciate Christ, and to turn from what is not Christ, we, that is true believers, are of kindred nature with Christ.<a name=5:11></a> "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>).<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look around in the world we see that people generally have little or no concern about Christ; His things are of no interest and are meaningless to them.<a name=5:13></a> But there are hearts that thrill with joy in the sense of His blessedness and love.<a name=5:14></a> What makes the difference?<a name=5:15></a> Just this, that it has been well-pleasing to the Father to reveal something of that blessed One to babes (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>).<a name=5:16></a> It is infinitely better to be the smallest, feeblest babe and to perceive the greatness and glory and love of Christ than to be the most honoured person

		in the world without any appreciation of Him.<a name=6:1></a> It is good when Christ can say to one, "Thou art Peter" -'You are of kindred nature to Myself'!<a name=6:2></a> Of course it is necessarily so, if He is our life, and in the Spirit we own no other.<a name=6:3></a> The Father has taken us up to bring this about in us.<a name=6:4></a> If Christ has thrown self and the world and man in the flesh into the shade in the estimation of our hearts, it is clear proof that we have been the subjects of a divine work.<a name=6:5></a> It is as such that we are material for Christ's assembly -- divinely formed material for a divine structure.<a name=6:6></a> The Christ, the Son of the living God, is now before us, and the consciousness of belonging to Him and being of Him puts us in spirit outside things here and in moral separation from man in the flesh and his world.<a name=6:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wanted to read a few of the words of our Lord.<a name=7:1></a> These scriptures are in my mind as standing in connection with what we have been reminded of lately -- the importance of love to our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think in these five utterances, which, as we know, are the first recorded utterances of our Lord, we get what might be regarded as a full and complete presentation of what He is in Himself -- what He is inwardly.<a name=7:3></a> We know that painters have tried to put upon canvas their ideas of the Lord's outward appearance, but none of us trust their ideas.<a name=7:4></a> None of us would like to have a picture of the Lord Jesus on the walls of our houses, for we could not be at all sure it was really the Lord at all.<a name=7:5></a> And if we were sure it was exactly like what He was outwardly, it would not supply any ground of love to Him.<a name=7:6></a> There is no genuine love to the Lord Jesus except as we apprehend what He is inwardly.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the first scripture we find the Lord was assured that Mary and Joseph ought to have known that He would be occupied in His Father's business, or as the note reads, "That I ought to be in the things of my Father".<a name=7:8></a> Now we do not know the Lord at all until we understand that.<a name=7:9></a> He was a boy of twelve, but He was in the consciousness of sonship, He could speak of "my Father", and of being in <i>the things</i> of His Father.<a name=7:10></a> That is what makes Him so different from every other man, what marked Him off from everything in the world.<a name=7:11></a> He was wholly absorbed and occupied in the things of His Father.<a name=7:12></a> He brought those things here in His heart, so that men might know them, and He lived in them; and if we do not love Him in that character, we can hardly be said to love Him at all.<a name=7:13></a> That is, to love the Lord as He is, we need to see Him in relation to His Father.<a name=7:14></a> But perhaps a poor sinner

		says, 'He died for my sins'.<a name=8:1></a> I do not depreciate that; it is true, it is what that Person conferred upon me.<a name=8:2></a> But what kind of Person is He in Himself?<a name=8:3></a> I shall never love Him until I know that.<a name=8:4></a> Gratitude in the heart of a believer for what He has done for him often does not go far; it very often stops short of love to Himself, to His own Person, and has very little separating effect from the world.<a name=8:5></a> But if we love Him in relation to the Father we cannot avoid being separated from the world which knows nothing of the Father, who is altogether in separation from the world.<a name=8:6></a> Indeed, John says, "If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world .<a name=8:7></a>.<a name=8:8></a>.<a name=8:9></a> is not of the Father" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:15">1 John  2:15</a>, 16): All that is really blessed for men lies now in the knowledge of the Father.<a name=8:10></a> Jesus as a Boy of twelve was absorbed in His Father's things, and in that character He becomes an object of love to His own; He is carrying in His heart the secret of all the grace of God for men.<a name=8:11></a> If we love Him in that character, it shows we have apprehended the Father's things.<a name=8:12></a> For there is a whole system of things characterised as the Father's things, which are contrary to everything in the world.<a name=8:13></a> So if you have the Father's things brought to you by Jesus you <i>cannot</i> have the world.<a name=8:14></a> It is a very practical thing.<a name=8:15></a> So everything is possessed in Jesus; they are things which were designed by the Father to be the portion of Jesus.<a name=8:16></a> He is the only One that can give us any impression of them.<a name=8:17></a> Those who do love Him in that character have done with the wretched, worthless things of the world.<a name=8:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the Lord said in His second recorded utterance, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=8:19></a> That gives me a true thought of Himself -- His Person.<a name=8:20></a> He had before Him to fulfil all righteousness -- all that was right.<a name=8:21></a> Although with Him there was no personal cause, He would go with the men who took a right line in repentance.<a name=8:22></a> We have to love Him in that character as the righteous One, and so we must take on the same character.<a name=8:23></a> I cannot love something in Him and go on with just the opposite.<a name=8:24></a> So it separates us from the

	<div class="paragraph">
		whole course of sin in ourselves and in the world.<a name=9:1></a> We have been attracted after the One who fulfilled all righteousness.<a name=9:2></a> Many believers are hung up for many years because they are not in the path of righteousness; they think they love the Lord but they do not.<a name=9:3></a> Often a very little bit of unrighteousness will hinder us.<a name=9:4></a> So that love for the Lord Jesus is a very practical thing, it adjusts us at every turn.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord in speaking to the devil brings out some of the great and precious things that belong to His own Person.<a name=9:6></a> "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth".<a name=9:7></a> If we have finished with the world, what are we going on with?<a name=9:8></a> We cannot go on with a vacuum.<a name=9:9></a> We are too negative in the matter; there is too much negative christianity.<a name=9:10></a> The Lord as a Man here lived by every word that went out through God's mouth.<a name=9:11></a> There is no other wav to live.<a name=9:12></a> If we did not live on the word of God, we should starve.<a name=9:13></a> Christians not drawn into His manner of life do starve.<a name=9:14></a> He lived by every word of God.<a name=9:15></a> It is too great for me, and I do not question that.<a name=9:16></a> It is the character and quality of all life toward God, that we live by the communications of the blessed God.<a name=9:17></a> And we love Him if we apprehend Him in that character.<a name=9:18></a> Then we must take on that character -- love will surely go His way -- and it will make its practical impression on us.<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He says, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God".<a name=9:20></a> That is, the Lord Jesus becomes an object of affection as One with absolute confidence in God.<a name=9:21></a> He was put on the pinnacle of the temple.<a name=9:22></a> Sometimes God puts His saints in a position of danger.<a name=9:23></a> The Lord was then, and he was as quiet and confiding and restful as at any moment in His life.<a name=9:24></a> Now this is the Person we love.<a name=9:25></a> It is really the test of our affection for the Lord.<a name=9:26></a> Sometimes we are trembling and fearful.<a name=9:27></a> Oh, if we only loved Him we should be drawn into the same blessed confidence He has in His God and Father.<a name=9:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These words are the setting forth of all that He is inwardly, and as we see and appreciate Him in this way, we take on the character of the One we love.<a name=10:10></a> If we admire the features of Christ they must come out in us.<a name=10:11></a> Of course it is a continual development with us, with small accessions from time to time, until we become like the Son of God, and get clearance from the world and all that is contrary to God.<a name=10:12></a> God give us to move in affectionate appreciation of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=10:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of this raises a very important exercise as to things which would hinder that influence; we must do nothing to hinder the production or manifestation of that kind of spirit; so the Lord speaks of offending one of these little ones who believe in Him.<a name=13:20></a> He says of the one who does it that "it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea".<a name=13:21></a> We see thus the terrible character of any influence that would operate contrary to this "little child" spirit.<a name=13:22></a> If I bring in the influence of self-importance, and not only manifest it myself but influence others by it, it is a terrible thing in the sight of God.<a name=13:23></a>

		THE LORD GIVING SIGHT TO THE BLIND (FROM C.A.C.S NOTES)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has come before me that there is much instruction for us in the seven instances recorded of the Lord giving sight to the blind.<a name=26:1></a> It was held, I believe, by the rabbis that this was a miracle reserved to the Messiah, and though it was spoken of prophetically in the Old Testament there is no instance there of a blind man receiving sight.<a name=26:2></a> Nor is it recorded in the New Testament that anyone save the Lord ever performed this miracle.<a name=26:3></a> Paul being sent to "open their eyes" referred to his public service amongst the Gentiles in setting the truth of the position before them; it was not exactly doing a divine work in them, but bringing the truth to them so as to leave them responsible to turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God.<a name=26:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the giving of sight to the blind as it was done by the Lord seems to speak clearly of a divine operation by which men become capable of apprehending what has been introduced into the world in the Person of Christ.<a name=26:5></a> The presence of light is not sufficient.<a name=26:6></a> There is a great deal of light in Christendom, for the Scriptures are there and much spiritual ministry of the truth, but the capacity to apprehend it in a spiritual way is lacking.<a name=26:7></a> When the Lord was here the whole light of God was here, but men did not apprehend it; they were blind and the precious realities which were present were hidden from them.<a name=26:8></a> And it is an exercising thing to consider that we may be in the presence of much spiritual light without having any spiritual apprehension of it.<a name=26:9></a> But there is great encouragement in the sevenfold witness of the record in the gospels that Christ, and Christ only, is the One who can give us sight, and who delights to do so.<a name=26:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When John the baptist sent to ask Him, "Art thou the coming one?<a name=26:11></a> or are we to wait for another?<a name=26:12></a>" the first proof

	<div class="paragraph">
		that He gave was that John's disciples were to report to him that "blind men see".<a name=27:1></a> Every ray of divine light is in Christ, but we may be assured of this and yet feel how very little of it we have apprehended so as to have the continued joy of it in our hearts.<a name=27:2></a> We need His precious and divine service to enable us to see, and there is a direct and personal character about this so that we know that it is His own action and touch that has done it.<a name=27:3></a> He has not delegated this power or service to any other; it is in every case a personal transaction of Christ with the individual soul.<a name=27:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first two persons are spoken of in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:27">Matthew  9:27</a> - 31.<a name=27:5></a> This is in an interesting connection, for the whole of this chapter save the last four verses records what took place in "his own city".<a name=27:6></a> This was, no doubt, Capernaum, to which city He had removed from Nazareth at the beginning of His ministry (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:12">Matthew  4:12</a>).<a name=27:7></a> It was a place of great light, so that the Lord could speak of it as having been raised up to heaven.<a name=27:8></a> It would represent a place specially favoured by God, and where special testimony was rendered to what was there in Christ.<a name=27:9></a> Emmanuel was there, having chosen to go to a people sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to make that "his own city".<a name=27:10></a> So that there was a remarkably full presentation in Capernaum of what was there in Him.<a name=27:11></a> Forgiveness and power for helpless men, a call of infinite grace to sinners, the Bridegroom was there for the joy of those who were "sons of the bridechamber"; perfect healing for the woman with the issue of blood -- a figure of the state of Israel in uncleanness -- and the ruler's daughter raised up from death.<a name=27:12></a> "And the fame of it went out into all that land".<a name=27:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this seems to be presented as having exercised attraction upon two blind men, and as having produced faith in their souls that Jesus could open their eyes.<a name=27:14></a> What marks these two men is that they come in faith.<a name=27:15></a> Jesus did not propose to do for them anything beyond what was according to their faith; He loves to be counted on, and to do all that He is counted on for.<a name=27:16></a> Now this raises the question as to how far we have been personally affected by what we know of God as

		having come near to men in Jesus -- Emmanuel.<a name=28:1></a> Has it led us to desire the power of spiritual apprehension?<a name=28:2></a> Has it given us faith to count upon Him to give us ability to see all that is there to be seen?<a name=28:3></a> Do we read the gospels historically as so many wonderful incidents, or do we definitely seek from the Lord ability to see the greatness and glory of what was there in the Person of Jesus?<a name=28:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"He touched their eyes".<a name=28:5></a> It is noticeable that in every instance of the Lord giving sight, save that in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:22">Matthew  12:22</a>, 23, He touched the eyes of the blind.<a name=28:6></a> I think the exception was because there the man was possessed by a demon, and there is no instance that I know of in which the Lord touched one who had a demon.<a name=28:7></a> He cast out the spirits with a word, we are told (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:16">Matthew  8:16</a>).<a name=28:8></a> In dealing with demons there was not the element of sympathy which is conveyed by a touch; they were dispossessed by the word of authority.<a name=28:9></a> So that when blindness was directly traceable to the presence of a demon we can understand why there was no touch.<a name=28:10></a> But in every other instance there was a touch of personal contact.<a name=28:11></a>

		There are other parables in Matthew and Luke with similar teaching to this one.<a name=86:1></a> In all of them there are servants waiting for the return of their master, and exhorted to watch because the moment of his arrival is uncertain.<a name=86:2></a> There are two events to which these parables are commonly applied.<a name=86:3></a> Some teach that they refer to the coming of Christ at the end of the world.<a name=86:4></a> They cannot mean this, because as all Christians agree, according to Scripture, there is to be a millennium -- a thousand years of peace and blessing -- before the end of the world, and how can we "watch" for an event which we know to be a thousand years off?<a name=86:5></a>

		Then another and more usual explanation of these parables is that they refer to death.<a name=86:6></a> The Scriptures show that the Lord's coming is not death.<a name=86:7></a> Moreover, in all these parables the coming of Christ is spoken of as being at an unknown and unexpected time.<a name=86:8></a> Now this is not usually the case with death, which in the vast majority of cases gives full warning of its approach.<a name=86:9></a>

		It seems to me that we have in Simeon the thought of one who was at the very centre of divine things; "There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon".<a name=109:2></a> God would have us, beloved brethren, to cherish the thought of being at the centre of divine interests.<a name=109:3></a> Alas!<a name=109:4></a> our hearts are too ready to be content to be at a distance, but why should we be found at Dan or Beersheba if it is possible to be in Jerusalem?<a name=109:5></a> After the return from captivity "the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city" (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#11:1">Nehemiah  11:1</a>).<a name=109:6></a> Nine out of every ten were content to dwell in their cities away from the divine centre, and yet they recognised that Jerusalem was the favoured spot, for they blessed those "that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem".<a name=109:7></a> This shows that even in times of recovery there is danger of missing the greatest privilege of the moment.<a name=109:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would press on my own heart, and on the hearts of others, that we should really live at the centre of things in a spiritual sense.<a name=109:9></a> It cannot be denied that at the present time the assembly, and the great reality of the presence of the Holy Spirit, are the very centre of all that has divine importance, and yet how many believers live practically at a distance from that centre.<a name=109:10></a> It is sorrowful to think how much they miss.<a name=109:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told of the five prudent virgins that they "took oil in their vessels with their torches".<a name=110:9></a> It was <i>their</i> exercise to be thus furnished.<a name=110:10></a> The Holy Spirit is available on the divine side; there is no restriction, no limitation, on that side.<a name=110:11></a> Indeed, the Old Testament promise, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost, that the Spirit would be "poured out" on all flesh, showed how extensive was the thought of God.<a name=110:12></a> But on our side the Lord has suggested that we should "take oil" in our vessels.<a name=110:13></a> The Holy Spirit is the gift of God, but a gift is to be received, and many scriptures speak of the <i>reception</i> of the Spirit, and I do not think it is ever supposed that this takes place unconsciously.<a name=110:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What God does sovereignly is His matter; I dare say He often gives the Spirit to believers on the Lord Jesus who have had little exercise about the Spirit, but normally He would give souls exercise about this great gift, so that it is not a matter in which they have part without their being aware of it.<a name=110:15></a> God would have His gift valued.<a name=110:16></a> The Lord suggested to the woman at the well the wonderful character of God's giving, and His own giving, but He brought in a condition on her part.<a name=110:17></a> "Thou wouldest have asked .<a name=110:18></a>.<a name=110:19></a>.<a name=110:20></a> he would have given".<a name=110:21></a> The gift of the Spirit, as announced in the glad tidings, becomes the subject of faith; that is, we come to it in the faith of our hearts that it is in the mind and love of God to give us His Spirit.<a name=110:22></a> So we are encouraged to put in our claim

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we cannot contemplate the gift of the Spirit without realising that it necessitates moral suitability on the part of the recipient.<a name=111:2></a> The Spirit could be upon Simeon without any incongruity; he was "just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel"; there was nothing about him to jar on the sensitiveness of the Spirit.<a name=111:3></a> If there are dark corners where unrighteousness is hidden, or if there is a lack of piety, the Spirit cannot be restful.<a name=111:4></a> It can hardly be said of such that their hearts are purified by faith.<a name=111:5></a> It must be remembered that the gift of the Spirit is the divine witness to a certain condition of heart.<a name=111:6></a> Peter said, "The heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit .<a name=111:7></a>.<a name=111:8></a>.<a name=111:9></a> having purified their hearts by faith" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:8">Acts  15:8</a>, 9).<a name=111:10></a> Believers are said to be "according to Spirit", and to mind the things of the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:5">Romans  8:5</a>).<a name=111:11></a> If we are not in moral suitability to the Spirit we may miss practically the gain of this wondrous gift.<a name=111:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Simeon's outlook was such that the Spirit could identify Himself with it; he was awaiting the consolation of Israel, he was looking for the Lord's Christ.<a name=111:13></a> The saints today are marked off from those in the world by their different outlook.<a name=111:14></a> Those in the world have no outlook that the Spirit could identify Himself with, but the saints have a divine outlook, they are looking for the coming of the Lord.<a name=111:15></a> That has been God's great objective ever since sin and death came in; it will bring all that is of God into the world.<a name=111:16></a> In Simeon's case he was, of course, awaiting the first coming of Christ; it is ours now to await His coming the second time.<a name=111:17></a> None are in harmony with the Spirit who are not awaiting the coming of Christ.<a name=111:18></a> To be out of harmony with the Spirit is to disregard His presence.<a name=111:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Holy Spirit made communications to Simeon; He made known to him "that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ".<a name=111:20></a> <i>We</i> are living in a wondrous time, for the Spirit is even now making communications to

		Overcomers today are marked by having an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies.<a name=112:6></a> I wonder if we are habituated to hearing what He is saying?<a name=112:7></a> We may be quite sure that He will never say anything contrary to the Scriptures, or that cannot be substantiated from the Scriptures, but He can bring out the mind of God in a way that never would have been gathered from the Scriptures alone apart from His speaking.<a name=112:8></a> The Spirit has always something to say to the assemblies.<a name=112:9></a> Speaking is characteristic of each Person of the Trinity, and this is in a special way the time of the Spirit's speaking.<a name=112:10></a> I think it possible that when the time comes for the assembly to be translated, the Spirit may communicate to many that they will not see death.<a name=112:11></a> One would covet to be amongst those thus favoured of God, but whether we have this privilege or it is reserved for others, let us see to it that we do get the communications which the Spirit is making.<a name=112:12></a> Let us consider the possibility of having communications from the Holy Spirit who is dwelling here, and who is acquainted with everything that is in the mind of God.<a name=112:13></a> There is no part of the will of God, or of divine counsel, that is not perfectly known to the Holy Spirit, and He is here that it may be made known to us.<a name=112:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we are to have the gain of this we must not be "scattered abroad".<a name=112:15></a> We must be at the centre of things.<a name=112:16></a> Simeon was there, and because he was there he missed nothing that was possible at the moment.<a name=112:17></a> He was where divine communications were not missed.<a name=112:18></a> A well-known servant of the Lord said that he always got things first by the Spirit, and then he

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we see that Simeon moved in a practical way under the control of the Spirit.<a name=113:3></a> If he had been half an hour earlier in coming into the temple, or half an hour later, he might have missed a most blessed opportunity.<a name=113:4></a> If we move with the Spirit and in the Spirit we shall not miss divinely given opportunities.<a name=113:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Simeon saw the whole salvation of God -- all that the Scriptures had spoken of for thousands of years -- substantiated in a little Child.<a name=113:6></a> It was no longer promises or statements of Scripture, but all that was of God was there substantiated in a Babe six weeks old!<a name=113:7></a> And he received Him into his arms.<a name=113:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There have been moments, I dare say, when we have thought how blessed it would have been to embrace that holy Babe.<a name=113:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be sure that those who are at the centre think much of Christ, and they think much of what is of Christ, that is, of the assembly which is His body.<a name=113:15></a> Christ is not now here personally, but He is here substantially in His body.<a name=113:16></a> The Spirit would lead us to see what is here now -- His body deriving from Him.<a name=113:17></a> He said to Saul of Tarsus of His suffering saints, 'They are "me"'.<a name=113:18></a> If we truly embrace Christ in our affections we cannot fail to take account of His body here.<a name=113:19></a> He is here substantially in His body.<a name=113:20></a> We look at every believer as of the body potentially, and we want him to be of it substantially as formed in the features and moral qualities of Christ.<a name=113:21></a> We do not want merely to think of the statements

		of Scripture in an abstract way, but to have them brought into concrete expression in ourselves and in all saints.<a name=114:1></a> We can see that Simeon received very real substance into his arms, and God would have us to regard the assembly, the body of Christ, as a substantial thing, composed of persons who have very definitely derived from Him so as to be in their measure expressive of Him.<a name=114:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not wonder that Simeon "blessed God", and we may well bless Him for all that He has brought within our range.<a name=114:3></a> It is of all importance that we should be at the centre of what is of God.<a name=114:4></a> Christ and the assembly are at the centre; the assembly is the body, the fulness, the completeness of Christ.<a name=114:5></a> If we are really in mind and affection at the centre, the Spirit will have His way with us; we shall get communications such as no worldly or carnal believer could know anything about.<a name=114:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole moral universe comes within the scope of the communications of the Spirit, and it is the privilege of the saints of the assembly to dwell, as it were, at the very centre.<a name=114:7></a> Hence the apostle prayed that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:16">Ephesians  3:16</a> - 18).<a name=114:8></a> If Christ personally dwells in our hearts, what is of Him in His members -- His body down here -- will have a very great place with us.<a name=114:9></a> We shall then look at the saints according to what they are potentially, and we shall desire that what they are potentially as called ones they may be substantially as formed by the Spirit in the features of Christ.<a name=114:10></a> It is evidently of immense importance that Christ should come out in His body in a substantial way; that is, as morally and spiritually formed in His members here.<a name=114:11></a> May the Lord help us in regard to these things!<a name=114:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great favour from God that we should be brought to know things in divine perfection.<a name=118:1></a> One feels how precious it is to see all that is suitable to God without a flaw.<a name=118:2></a> The true character and blessedness that is our portion through Christ is patterned in Him.<a name=118:3></a> You see the thing perfectly patterned in Him, so we can learn our own true character, and our true place and blessedness in perfection as patterned in Christ.<a name=118:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke writes with method.<a name=118:5></a> There is divine method in the way he writes, and he puts things in moral order.<a name=118:6></a> We learn first how such a Man as Jesus lives, and then how such a Man worships and serves; and next we see the perfect way in which such a Man confides in the known love of God.<a name=118:7></a> Now this is the true character of our life as being of Christ, and we have to admit as believers that we are of Christ.<a name=118:8></a> So I have to learn my true character according to grace, in Christ.<a name=118:9></a> As to the life of our spirits, we live by what God has spoken to us; and this comes out in connection with the first temptation, that man lives not by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.<a name=118:10></a> We live by what God has spoken to us, and that constitutes the life of our souls; God has spoken to us in Christ, and it is what comes to us from God that constitutes our life, whether we have fed on it little or much.<a name=118:11></a> Every communication from God enlarges our capacity to live Godward, and it is very interesting to see this.<a name=118:12></a> He speaks to us so that we might live on it, and that principle runs right through the Christian's life: we live by what God speaks to us.<a name=118:13></a> The thought of God is that we should live in relation to Him, in the conscious appreciation of every word that He has been pleased to speak.<a name=118:14></a> The Lord actually did live on every word that proceeded from God's mouth -- it formed His life morally as a Man down here.<a name=118:15></a> We have,

		<i>perhaps</i>, received very few of God's words to live upon, but they constitute the measure of our life.<a name=119:1></a> What we should seek to get hold of is the positive features which the temptations brought out -- they brought out positive features in Christ.<a name=119:2></a> As believers we are no longer listening to the serpent; those who are of Christ are closed to Satan and open to God.<a name=119:3></a> I should like the youngest believer to set that down as a definite spiritual fact, that he is after Christ by the grace of God.<a name=119:4></a> God speaks to us that we might be free to worship and serve Him.<a name=119:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first temptation what comes out is how God has moved towards man to speak to him in such a way that he can live by what God says, and the measure in which we have appreciated what God has said is the measure by which we live spiritually.<a name=119:6></a> But God has spoken to us because He wanted worshippers and servers; He wants us to do homage to Him, and it is His pleasure that we should serve Him.<a name=119:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second temptation we see that all the power and glory of the world's system has no attraction for Jesus, and it is interesting to note that the thought of worshipping and serving God is set against all the power and glory of the world, which would be the full scope of man's ambition as a fallen creature: God sets against it the power and glory of being able to worship and serve Him.<a name=119:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an infinitely greater power and glory in worshipping and serving God than in anything that the devil can confer.<a name=119:9></a> So one sees it is infinitely greater and nobler to serve Him than to receive all the glory and power that belongs to this world.<a name=119:10></a> This is the true way of deliverance from all human ambitions.<a name=119:11></a> If our hearts have fed upon what God has spoken to us we shall have affection for Him.<a name=119:12></a> To covet the power and glory of the present world system requires that one should become a worshipper of the devil: it demands that we shall do homage to the one who holds it out as the great prize to the ambitions of men.<a name=119:13></a>

		I have believed ever so feebly and simply on Christ as God's salvation, then the way that God knows me is as one who stands in all the value of redemption, and the one who has received the Spirit, so as to be formed after Christ.<a name=120:1></a> God does not know me according to the flesh; He knows me in Christ.<a name=120:2></a> And we have to rise up to the thoughts of God.<a name=120:3></a> God's thoughts are that we are of Christ, we are blest through Christ, in Christ, and for Christ, and Christ is in us, and we are to be with Christ and like Christ through all eternity.<a name=120:4></a> We learn that the object God has in view for us is to learn an entirely new power and glory.<a name=120:5></a> There is power which lies in the gift of the devil, but we want nothing to do with it; we want as little to do with it as Christ did; we want no more of the power and glory of this world than Christ had.<a name=120:6></a> Can each one of us say, 'It is true of me through God's infinite grace'?<a name=120:7></a> As Christians we have a new thought of glory; we are attracted by an entirely new kind of power and glory, which the natural man never wants, but Christ wanted it and we want it.<a name=120:8></a>

		The sanctuary is the place where God is worshipped and served, and what a mercy it is to be transferred into such a region as that.<a name=120:9></a> The devil has not got a jot or tittle that is spiritual; he has nothing to offer beyond death, nothing of true value.<a name=120:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That blessed Man of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>was in the brightness of the sphere where God is worshipped and served in the beauty of holiness, and what belonged to the world system had not the least attraction to Him; and that should be true of everyone who has the knowledge of Him.<a name=120:11></a> I think the glory of doing homage to God, and serving Him, would put the glory of the world out of hearts and keep it out.<a name=120:12></a> The glory of the world is for a moment: there is nothing abiding, nothing of true value.<a name=120:13></a> That system of things has gone: it has lost its hold on our hearts, and what holds us now is God speaking to us, and we now live to God.<a name=120:14></a> What a moment it will be for me when I open my eyes in a scene where there is no distraction!<a name=120:15></a> God has thoughts about me that transcend all human conception

	<div class="paragraph">
		The world is the full limit of man's ambition, but we learn there is a greater glory in serving God.<a name=121:5></a> He has delivered us out of the hands of all our enemies, to serve Him in holiness; He has delivered us in the power of redemption, to serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives.<a name=121:6></a> I came to this meeting with the thought of being spiritually enlarged.<a name=121:7></a> I do not believe in coming to a meeting and going out again in the same manner as I came in.<a name=121:8></a> The more I receive the more I can give, and I worship and serve in the light of what God has spoken to me.<a name=121:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third temptation brings out the restful assurance of divine love in which the Lord Jesus was kept while here below.<a name=121:10></a> The devil comes and quotes Scripture, and asks the Lord to put it to the test and see if it was true or not!<a name=121:11></a> There is always the subtle tendency in our hearts to want proof that God loves and cares for us.<a name=121:12></a> The great danger is that we may be like the Jews desiring a sign; when the Lord was here, they came to Him asking for signs, and it is very often Satan's way to want us to acquire some evidence that God really does love and care for us.<a name=121:13></a> Christ is our evidence, and we do not want evidence of the love and care of the blessed God other than Christ.<a name=121:14></a>

		C.A.<a name=122:1></a>C.<a name=122:2></a> It is remarkable that it is the activities of the woman that we see here rather than the activities of Jesus.<a name=122:3></a> We might say that Jesus does nothing; He is sitting at meat, and He remains sitting; all the activities are on the part of the woman.<a name=122:4></a> It is very sweet when such a point is reached when the Lord has no longer to be active but can be the subject of the activities that divine grace has set in movement in the heart of a sinner.<a name=122:5></a> This incident seems to set forth not so much the grace that forgave as the effect of that grace in a heart that had come to appreciate it.<a name=122:6></a>

		This part of the gospel is a wonderful section as bringing out the answer to what Simeon said of the Lord, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:32">Luke  2:32</a>).<a name=123:7></a> We see a Gentile brought into view at the beginning of chapter 7 as having a right thought of Jesus.<a name=123:8></a> The widow who lost her son no doubt represents Israel.<a name=123:9></a> Israel's hopes were all dead, but she proves the compassion of Jehovah in restoring her hopes on the principle of resurrection -- she gets her son, her hopes are restored to her.<a name=123:10></a> Peter talks of hopes restored in resurrection.<a name=123:11></a> It is a comprehensive view of what God is doing, bringing to light the Gentile and bringing Israel to light as having a right appreciation of His grace as revealed in Jesus.<a name=123:12></a>

		The thought in my mind is that our growing up to spiritual manhood is a simple matter to those whose affections are commanded by the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=147:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When He was here the Lord was forming His disciples in the features of spiritual manhood, and the result of His influence was their coming to realise that there was no one with whom He could be compared.<a name=147:2></a> There was variety of opinion about Him, but here (verse 20) He challenges the disciples as to what they could say of Him.<a name=147:3></a> And the challenge is continually brought to us as to what our hearts can really say as to His Person.<a name=147:4></a> Peter says He is "the Christ of God".<a name=147:5></a> The Lord had an unrivalled place in their affections, and this confession was an opportunity for Him to point out the character of the testimony, to speak of that to which He was about to come.<a name=147:6></a> He was free to tell them of His sufferings and subsequent glory and what would involve on their part suffering and the losing of their lives for His sake, and that they would need not to be ashamed of Him or His words.<a name=147:7></a> That is, He was preparing their hearts for the suffering time when the features of manhood would be necessary.<a name=147:8></a> It is all very well to be babes, to be carried, but such are no good as support to the testimony.<a name=147:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord takes chosen men in this instance, and He permits them to see Him glorified, and the two greatest servants in the Old Testament, Moses and Elias, with Him glorified, speaking with Him and standing with Him.<a name=147:10></a> It was surely to impress their hearts with the great favour that was there.<a name=147:11></a> They were from day to day, from week to week, and from year to year in the presence of a light that never shone on Moses and Elias; they were more highly favoured in walking with the Son of God than these saints were.<a name=147:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the disciples got the Spirit they must have loved to contemplate these two great and chosen servants of God, borne along in their ministry and prophetic word by the Spirit, so that they are in the glory in a glorified condition, not occupied with it but with what was the basis of it all.<a name=148:5></a> How far has the death of our Lord established itself in our souls, so that we are not absorbed with the full glory of the kingdom, but with His death?<a name=148:6></a> All is based on the precious and unspeakable value of his death, and it must be so if we are presented "unblamable and irreproachable", as these two men were.<a name=148:7></a> They had something greater in their hearts than kingdom glory -- the marvellous death through which He would bring it all about, the basis on which the world to come stands, and on which the world of bliss stands for eternity.<a name=148:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The vision fades, Moses and Elias depart (the kingdom glory must give place to something in which they have no part), and the cloud overshadowed the disciples, "and they feared as they entered into the cloud".<a name=148:9></a> They could not possibly understand it, so that it occasioned fear.<a name=148:10></a> But it was a blessed indication that all that Moses and Elias could know of the kingdom glory was to give place to something transcendently wonderful.<a name=148:11></a> They were not only shadowed by the cloud, but enveloped in it, referring no doubt to what was coming in in the ministry of Paul and John, to the economy of the Father and the Son.<a name=148:12></a> It was, as Peter says, "The excellent glory" -- the surpassing glory.<a name=148:13></a> It is the place we have in connection with the beloved Son, the place in the Father's love in association with His Son.<a name=148:14></a> We can understand how

		Ministry and reading will not do us much real good if they do not produce exercise, and turn us to God in prayer.<a name=155:2></a> Christians often hear most blessed ministry without making much spiritual progress because they lack prayerful exercise.<a name=155:3></a> It is God's way to prepare us for spiritual blessing by making us feel the need of it.<a name=155:4></a> He fills the hungry with good things, and satisfies the longing soul.<a name=155:5></a> If God presents His own blessed things to us in ministry, it is in order to awaken exercise about them in our hearts.<a name=155:6></a> We have to pray our way into these things, if we desire to make them our own.<a name=155:7></a>

		A Christian thus luminous is clothed with "the armour of light" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:12">Romans  13:12</a>).<a name=157:12></a> There is that about a spiritual man which forbids the approach of evil suggestions and wickedness.<a name=157:13></a> Men feel instinctively that they cannot approach him with suggestions of sin and folly.<a name=157:14></a> They hush their lewdness and blasphemy in his presence.<a name=157:15></a> He is encircled by the protective power of God's light.<a name=157:16></a> He thus escapes many a snare that is laid for the feet of the half-hearted and the worldly believer.<a name=157:17></a> The life-testimony of a saint never fails to tell upon men's consciences, however much they may profess to scoff at the whole thing.<a name=157:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord warns us against the influence of five things which ever tend to dim or extinguish the light.<a name=157:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Firstly, "He began to say to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:1">Luke  12:1</a>).<a name=157:20></a> The leaven of the Pharisees is the desire to appear better to others than we really are.<a name=157:21></a> The Pharisee is also marked by being particular and scrupulous about little things, while he neglects matters much more weighty.<a name=157:22></a> He also loves pre-eminence, such as the first seats in the synagogues, and covets a reputation for piety while his secret life corresponds little therewith.<a name=157:23></a> We need constantly to watch and pray against the spirit of all this, for it is natural to our flesh.<a name=157:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, there is the spirit of the doctors of the law: "Ye lay upon men burdens heavy to bear, and yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:46">Luke  11:46</a>).<a name=157:25></a> It is so easy to lay down the law for others, and to expect more

	<div class="paragraph">
		from them than we render ourselves.<a name=158:1></a> The flesh finds a certain pleasure in this, but to its own condemnation.<a name=158:2></a> I have no moral right to claim from anybody, even in my mind, what I am not rendering myself.<a name=158:3></a> The great thing is to be displaying what is right, not to be demanding it.<a name=158:4></a> The true spirit of the Christian is not to impose burdens but to "bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:2">Galatians  6:2</a>).<a name=158:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, there is the fear of man: "Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:4">Luke  12:4</a>).<a name=158:6></a> The worst that men can do, if their enmity is allowed to go to its full extent, is to send us to heaven!<a name=158:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourthly, covetousness is a great hindrance if it gets place in our hearts: "Take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness .<a name=158:8></a>.<a name=158:9></a>.<a name=158:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:15">Luke  12:15</a> - 21).<a name=158:11></a> The desire to increase possessions here is a terrible blight upon spirituality; it quickly puts the extinguisher upon God's candle.<a name=158:12></a> It is not so much what one has that hinders him, but what he desires to have.<a name=158:13></a> If the heart is set upon things here the soul cannot prosper.<a name=158:14></a> A man's business is for discipline, that he may provide things honest in the sight of all men, not to promote covetousness.<a name=158:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, a saint may be hampered and hindered by fears and cares about his circumstances.<a name=158:16></a> This is an opposite snare to the previous one.<a name=158:17></a> The Lord says, "Consider the ravens, that they sow not nor reap .<a name=158:18></a>.<a name=158:19></a>.<a name=158:20></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:24">Luke  12:24</a> - 30).<a name=158:21></a> If a believer gets anxious and full of care about his circumstances he cannot be shining very brightly.<a name=158:22></a> It often happens that believers are afraid to let their light shine for fear of possible consequences.<a name=158:23></a> But the God who thinks of a sparrow will not forget a saint, especially a saint who may be suffering for Christ's sake.<a name=158:24></a> He has put a number on every hair of our heads, and His faithfulness can never fail.<a name=158:25></a> In most cases, saints who are anxious about their circumstances are not in extremities, but they are afraid that they will be.<a name=158:26></a> David proved that Jehovah not only saved him out of all his troubles but delivered him from all his fears (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#34:4">Psalm  34:4</a> - 6).<a name=158:27></a>

		The result of keeping free from these things, which tend to dim or extinguish the light of God in our souls and in our testimony, is that we are "like men who wait their own lord" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:35">Luke  12:35</a> - 37).<a name=159:1></a>

		But there are two things that hinder this: unsuitability and infirmity.<a name=160:3></a> If a soul is not quite sure that his sins are forgiven he is not free to respond, and if a soul does not know what it is to be delivered from the flesh he is not free to respond.<a name=160:4></a> By the cross all the unsuitability has been removed, the sins and the flesh.<a name=160:5></a> And then there is infirmity, the cares of this life.<a name=160:6></a> It was not unsuitability that hindered Martha but it was infirmity; the cares of this world, they weighed upon her; she was "distracted with much serving".<a name=160:7></a> It was no small thing to have a number of men drop in to dinner, as we might say; she was pressed by it and was not free to enjoy His company.<a name=160:8></a> It was a wonderful thing to have the Son of God in her house, and she was so glad to have Him there that she could not enjoy Him!<a name=160:9></a>

		The two disciples going to Emmaus had a care, but deep in their hearts they had the disposition for His company, they did want to have it and the Lord knew it and went after them and made Himself known to them.<a name=161:11></a> And He so ministered to them that they forgot the care that had pressed them before; they forgot their own circumstances; they forgot their own circle and they went back to Jerusalem to the circle of His interest.<a name=161:12></a> And that is priesthood.<a name=161:13></a> Beloved, how much have we forgotten our own things in the desire for His company?<a name=161:14></a> I ask my own soul, How much am I disposed for His company?<a name=161:15></a> We can have it if we want it.<a name=161:16></a>

		SOME THOUGHTS ON RESURRECTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:29">Luke  20:29</a> - 39
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have an unfolding of the truth of resurrection in these verses, and this is of the utmost importance, as it is in resurrection that God permanently secures all that is for His own pleasure.<a name=204:1></a> There is a resurrection world which the Sadducees knew nothing about; all their thoughts were formed on the model of the present world.<a name=204:2></a> There are two worlds; the world of the natural and the world of the spiritual.<a name=204:3></a> The Lord would lead us into the light, faith and spirit of the spiritual world.<a name=204:4></a> That world is going to abide untouchable by death, and beyond its power.<a name=204:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Sadducees did not get beyond the range of the natural.<a name=204:6></a> The most prominent and characteristic feature of this world is that its sons marry and are given in marriage; its distinctive feature is the natural, and the Sadducee cannot see beyond that, he cannot see the spiritual.<a name=204:7></a> If there is nothing but the natural, there is nothing for the pleasure of God, for death is on the natural; the fairest and most lovely thing in nature has come under death.<a name=204:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord would lead us away from the natural into the spiritual.<a name=204:9></a> Resurrection brings us into an order which is entirely spiritual.<a name=204:10></a> It is good to entertain the thought of what is spiritual, for nothing will go into God's resurrection world but what is spiritual.<a name=204:11></a> No one will be there who is not worthy; there will be no unworthy material in that world, "but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world".<a name=204:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every spiritual element which God has introduced into this world is material for His resurrection world; the natural contributes nothing to that world.<a name=204:13></a> Our great concern should be to be developed in the features that will secure our being counted worthy for the resurrection world.<a name=204:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=205>[Page 205]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord speaks in verse 37 of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<a name=205:1></a> God had introduced in these men elements suitable for His world, and they had apparently been lost, for the men in whom they had appeared had died and been buried.<a name=205:2></a> They could not be really lost because God must have every element of His spiritual work in His resurrection world.<a name=205:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The natural appeals to us very strongly, but if we come under the teaching of the Lord He will cause the spiritual to appeal to us more powerfully than the natural.<a name=205:4></a> The Lord would have us walk in the light and faith of resurrection even while we are still connected with the natural.<a name=205:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One feels the great importance of cherishing this thought of being counted worthy of that world; it raises the question whether we are cultivating features which God must have in His world.<a name=205:6></a> The thief on the cross judged himself and vindicated Jesus, and he acknowledged that all the kingdom rights belonged to Jesus.<a name=205:7></a> These were spiritual elements which God could not leave out of His world.<a name=205:8></a> If one is able to see the blessed character of God's grace as it is available for sinful men, that is a spiritual element, however small it may be.<a name=205:9></a> People think they are going to be together in families in heaven as they were on earth, taking up old links, but that is entirely natural.<a name=205:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The power to see what is of God is a spiritual element which goes along with new birth, the ability to see God's kingdom.<a name=205:11></a> There is no question of growth, or formation in connection with seeing; a babe a day old can see, and the ability to see what is of God is an element which God must have in His world in a resurrection condition.<a name=205:12></a> He is going to gather it all up, nothing goes into His resurrection world but what is fit to be there, and the fitness is acquired now.<a name=205:13></a> I trust we desire to be more worthy of that world where all is spiritual.<a name=205:14></a> Those who are worthy are elevated to the rank of angels, to the rank of beings who are wholly spiritual.<a name=205:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should be more exercised to be spiritual than to enjoy the happiest natural relationships.<a name=205:16></a> In the resurrection world

	<div class="paragraph">
		there is no more death, we are going to be equal to angels.<a name=206:1></a> We do not often talk of being like angels, but the Lord does here.<a name=206:2></a> "Equal to angels" is the character of being, and "sons" is the relationship in which the being is set.<a name=206:3></a> It has pleased God to have certain beings who are wholly spiritual, "who maketh his angels spirits" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#104:4">Psalm  104:4</a>).<a name=206:4></a> Even our bodies will be spiritual in the resurrection world, and it is important to see that the Lord Jesus as teaching in the temple would put an impression of that world on us, so that we should not be henceforth dominated by the natural, but by the spiritual.<a name=206:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Resurrection unto life is a question of personality; it is those who have practised good who have part in it (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:29">John  5:29</a>).<a name=206:6></a> To practise good is a spiritual element, and God wants that for His world.<a name=206:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thief on the cross was wonderfully honoured.<a name=206:8></a> In that supreme moment when the Son of God was on the cross, he was singled out to confess the Lord in circumstances of extreme outward reproach.<a name=206:9></a> What a place he had, what a confession!<a name=206:10></a> He was surely the object of admiration of all heaven.<a name=206:11></a> He had a unique place of confession, as completely vindicating the Lord, and investing Him with all the glory of the kingdom at such a moment.<a name=206:12></a> God could not leave such a man as that out of His world.<a name=206:13></a> So with everything that is the fruit of grace, it is all needed for God's world; that is why the saints have to be raised, there is that about them which God cannot do without in His world.<a name=206:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the point of view of resurrection the saints are not viewed as being in heaven, but in their graves; the Lord says, "All who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:28">John  5:28</a>, 29).<a name=206:15></a> Abraham is in his grave from the point of view of resurrection as are all the other saints who have died.<a name=206:16></a> God worked in those subjects of grace and produced in them spiritual elements, but the natural was there too, and they died.<a name=206:17></a> So apparently and publicly God lost all these spiritual elements, for the saints have died and been buried and are still in their graves.<a name=206:18></a> They went down, so they

		must come up.<a name=207:1></a> The person is identified with his body in Scripture.<a name=207:2></a> "Pious men buried Stephen"; and the angel said, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay" -- He was identified with His body.<a name=207:3></a> At the end of Matthew's gospel there was a singular public witness to resurrection power having come in; "Many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:52">Matthew  27:52</a>, 53).<a name=207:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The bodily condition suited to God's world is brought about by resurrection; the saints are going to be raised in a condition wholly spiritual.<a name=207:5></a> We get the thought in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>of what is sown; that implies that whatever the condition in which the sowing takes place there is seed suitable for resurrection.<a name=207:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One regards the saint's body as the temple of the Holy Spirit; it has been dedicated to God and presented a living sacrifice.<a name=207:7></a> There is a holy character about the body of the saint, inasmuch as it is a vessel of the activities of the Holy Spirit.<a name=207:8></a> There is a moral and spiritual identification between what is sown and what is raised; the believer put in the grave comes out, and comes out in a condition wholly spiritual, and it is good to seek that order of things now.<a name=207:9></a> "To them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2:7">Romans  2:7</a>).<a name=207:10></a> To be seeking incorruptibility is to be seeking what is outside the natural altogether; it is wholly spiritual.<a name=207:11></a> Paul was earnestly set for it, "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:11">Philippians  3:11</a>).<a name=207:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Death having come in as a blot on God's creation, it has to be removed publicly by resurrection.<a name=207:13></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>there is no mention of going into heaven; my impression is that the object of the apostle was to lead the hearts of the saints into a spiritual sphere so as to wean them from the power of the natural.<a name=207:14></a> Resurrection is marked by incorruptibility, glory and power; it is a spiritual condition.<a name=207:15></a> The Spirit of holiness places man outside all that is corrupting; it has

		<a name=208>[Page 208]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		been verified in the Lord Jesus; He has been "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:4">Romans  1:4</a>).<a name=208:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That the spiritual is greater than the natural is one great point of temple teaching.<a name=208:2></a> If we were more in the light and faith of resurrection we should think more of what is spiritual, more of what is angel-like.<a name=208:3></a> Think of spiritual and holy beings whom it has pleased God to maintain by His election -- for we read of the elect angels -- beings who are able to participate in the delights of God's grace, and who are taken into confidence as to His activities in grace.<a name=208:4></a> Angels are the willing and happy servants of the will of God, and are in every way on spiritual lines.<a name=208:5></a> What a character of being to resemble!<a name=208:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Being spiritual lies at the basis of being sons of God.<a name=208:7></a> "Equal to angels" is the nature of the being; then there is the wonderful relationship, sons of God and sons of the resurrection.<a name=208:8></a> The pleasure of God will be permanently secured in a deathless scene, a scene that is wholly spiritual.<a name=208:9></a> Think of the blessedness of it!<a name=208:10></a> If we have known it, even for half a minute, when we were really in the Spirit and absorbed with God and with Christ, think of it being perpetuated in God's world in incorruptible conditions!<a name=208:11></a> We shall indeed have a greater intimacy with the blessed God than ever angels had.<a name=208:12></a> The apostle Paul longed for the resurrection state: "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead".<a name=208:13></a> He was pursuing it, leaving the natural behind, the whole energy of his being reaching out after what is wholly spiritual.<a name=208:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord does not speak in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20">Luke  20</a>of the resurrection of any but saints, but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:29">John  5:29</a> He says that those who have done evil will go forth from the tombs, "to resurrection of judgment".<a name=208:15></a>

		Ques.<a name=209:1></a> Is there any link between the raising of the relationship of Christ as the Son of David, and the blind man who calls on Him for relief in the end of chapter 18?<a name=209:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=209:3></a>C.<a name=209:4></a> Well, I think there was a link, but it would seem that the Lord's intention was to enlarge greatly the truth of His Person.<a name=209:5></a> It was a great thing that the blind man should recognise Jesus as the Son of David, the Messiah.<a name=209:6></a> He recognised Him as the One who had opened the eyes of the blind.<a name=209:7></a> It was commonly taught by the Jewish rabbis that the opening of the eyes was a miracle reserved for the Messiah, reserved for the Son of David.<a name=209:8></a> The Old Testament Scriptures which speak of the opening of the eyes of the blind clearly refer to the days and the power of the Messiah, so that the blind man had the faith of that.<a name=209:9></a> He had the faith that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah.<a name=209:10></a> No one else could open the eyes.<a name=209:11></a> But did you not think that in this temple instruction the Lord's desire was to give great enlargement to that thought?<a name=209:12></a> The scribes and the Pharisees had the thought that the Messiah would be the Son of David, and the blind man had got so far as recognising that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of David.<a name=209:13></a> It would appear that as teaching in the temple the Lord would give great enlargement to the thought of His greatness.<a name=209:14></a>

		and so divine light is thrown upon the greatest questions that were exercising faith, and exercising the minds of the people generally.<a name=210:1></a> Because what you find is that all the people are in the temple.<a name=210:2></a> They are all listening, not only the disciples, but all the people are there, showing that this is a public aspect of things.<a name=210:3></a> And I think divine teaching is public.<a name=210:4></a> It is not confined to the disciples, but it is public.<a name=210:5></a> As the Lord says, "And in secret I have spoken nothing" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#18:20">John  18:20</a>).<a name=210:6></a> The Lord publicly vindicates the truth in respect of divine authority, and in respect to the rights of God, to the government of God and to resurrection; and now, having disposed of these questions, He Himself raises a matter which was far greater than any of the others, the matter of the greatness of His own Person.<a name=210:7></a> 'Son of David' was not a title great enough.<a name=210:8></a> It was a wonderful and blessed title, but it was not great enough.<a name=210:9></a>

		(<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:42">Matthew  22:42</a>).<a name=210:18></a> It surpasses in importance all the other subjects upon which the Lord had thrown divine light; and the Lord does still publicly throw divine light upon every question; He maintains the temple character of things publicly and I believe He will do so to the end.<a name=210:19></a> There will always be, as long as the saints are upon the earth, a public maintenance of teaching in regard to every subject that men have to consider relative to God.<a name=210:20></a> I do not think the Lord is ever going to allow that to lapse.<a name=210:21></a> That is not what we enjoy privately, but it is public and it is for all the people to listen to.<a name=210:22></a>

		When the Lord took the bread and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to them, they recognised Him.<a name=241:1></a> It was not now facts about Him, but Himself.<a name=241:2></a> The bread He broke represented the new condition into which He had come through death.<a name=241:3></a> It is death viewed from that standpoint; that is, as His way into His glory.<a name=241:4></a> The fact that He broke the bread and put it into their hands suggested a new condition of manhood into which He had entered through death, and His giving it into their hands suggested that they were to have part in that kind of humanity.<a name=241:5></a> Whether they be few or many, there are moments in privilege and blessing when we realise that we have part in His risen life, we are of that order of humanity into which He entered in resurrection.<a name=241:6></a> His giving the bread to them was an indication that they were to partake of the same order of life in which He was as risen.<a name=241:7></a> The other disciples were confounded and frightened when He came, but I can hardly think that those two were affrighted.<a name=241:8></a>

		His disappearing from the two disciples was as much as to say, 'If you want more of Me, you must find it at Jerusalem'.<a name=241:13></a> And so He gives us personal touches in order to bring us to the assembly -- He makes His saints conscious that they have part in His life, and so are suitable to be led into all those thoughts of divine love that are known in the assembly.<a name=241:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These verses bring out several great and blessed things which are characteristic of christianity.<a name=263:1></a> Not that christianity was really established till the Spirit was given on the day of Pentecost, but the things which are spoken of in this scripture are characteristic of christianity.<a name=263:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The death of Christ is the great basis on which christianity rests; everything for us begins from His death.<a name=263:3></a> This is what the apostle John meant when he said, "This is he that came by water and blood" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:6">1 John  5:6</a>).<a name=263:4></a> He does not there speak of His incarnation, but of His death.<a name=263:5></a> All true christian blessing is based on the death of Christ; all starts from there.<a name=263:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the scripture I have read we find Him "after he had suffered".<a name=263:7></a> Many pious people adore the Lord in His pathway here and their hearts follow Him with intense interest to the foot of the cross, as they say, and there they seem to lose sight of Him.<a name=263:8></a> Such souls find great comfort in the thought that He died for them as poor sinners, but they do not really apprehend Him as the risen One; they have a measure of relief, but do not know divine rest and peace.<a name=263:9></a> We find here that "he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs".<a name=263:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is right that we should dwell on the suffering of Christ.<a name=263:11></a> It shows what the world is as a system, and what man is as a fallen creature.<a name=263:12></a> The exceeding wickedness and darkness of man's heart was manifested by the way we treated that blessed One.<a name=263:13></a> He had done us nothing but good, but we nailed Him to a cross.<a name=263:14></a> Perhaps you think they were worse than we are?<a name=263:15></a> Beloved friends, do not make any such mistake.<a name=263:16></a> The same wickedness and enmity against God is in all

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then again the darkness of man came out at the cross as well as his wickedness.<a name=264:5></a> There was full witness to that blessed One when He was here.<a name=264:6></a> All His words and works showed who He was.<a name=264:7></a> He was the Lord of glory, perfect, lovely, acceptable to God in every way, God's beloved Son, but men would not have Him.<a name=264:8></a> The world knew Him not and His own received Him not.<a name=264:9></a> Perhaps you say, 'But what about the little company who did receive Him?<a name=264:10></a>' Well, beloved friends, think of what came out in that company when tested.<a name=264:11></a> One betrayed Him, another denied Him, and all forsook Him.<a name=264:12></a> On man's side there was nothing but an utter breakdown.<a name=264:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But on His side what perfect grace and love!<a name=264:14></a> His presence here exposed the wickedness and darkness and weakness of man, but we may be sure that God would never have sent Him merely to expose this.<a name=264:15></a> He came to remove it all in the way of atonement.<a name=264:16></a> The black tide of man's wickedness rose to its flood, but it was met by the deep, full, glorious tide of divine grace, love and sovereign mercy.<a name=264:17></a> Christ suffered for sins and bore the condemnation of man as a creature full of the poison of sin.<a name=264:18></a> All that there was on our side -- sins, defilement, curse, death -- was taken up and borne by Him.<a name=264:19></a> Every question has been raised and settled in divine righteousness and love to the glory of God.<a name=264:20></a> Then what remains?<a name=264:21></a> <i>Christ</i> remains, the risen One.<a name=264:22></a> "He presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs".<a name=264:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there was another thing.<a name=264:24></a> Christ brought all the blessing of God into this world in His own Person, but the disciples had to learn that the blessing that was in Him could not be transferred to man in the flesh, in whom there was nothing but sin.<a name=264:25></a> Christ had to go into death to remove that man sacrificially from before God.<a name=264:26></a> The disciples "hoped that <i>he</i> was the one who is about to redeem Israel" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:21">Luke  24:21</a>).<a name=264:27></a> They looked for divine blessing to be brought into the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world rejoices to get rid of Christ.<a name=265:4></a> "Ye shall weep and lament, ye, but the world shall rejoice; and ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy .<a name=265:5></a>.<a name=265:6></a>.<a name=265:7></a> ; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:20">John  16:20</a>, 22).<a name=265:8></a> When they saw Him alive from the dead, showing Himself by many infallible proofs, they had Him in a new and eternal character.<a name=265:9></a> No doubt it was most blessed to go about with Him and hear His gracious words and see His mighty acts, but that did not meet the question of sin or of death or remove the curse.<a name=265:10></a> But Himself alive after His suffering is the proof that all these things have been dealt with to the glory of God.<a name=265:11></a> If you look at that risen Man you will see what can never crumble away -- all the blessings of God's grace and the thoughts of His love established in One who is alive for evermore.<a name=265:12></a> When you see Him alive after His sufferings you rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.<a name=265:13></a> I put it to you, beloved friends, do you know that resurrection joy?<a name=265:14></a> That is the true joy of Christianity.<a name=265:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to another thing.<a name=265:16></a> The risen One was seen of them forty days, and He was "speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God" (verse 3).<a name=265:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14:17">Romans  14:17</a> we get the moral elements that make up the kingdom of God: "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".<a name=265:18></a> These are the things which have come in through the Lord Jesus Christ; they are established in Himself as the risen One.<a name=265:19></a> Have you righteousness?<a name=265:20></a> Many a believer would say, 'I am trusting the mercy of God through Christ'.<a name=265:21></a> But God would have you see that He has established righteousness for you in Christ.<a name=265:22></a> By the grace of God we are "in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us .<a name=265:23></a>.<a name=265:24></a>.<a name=265:25></a> righteousness" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>).<a name=265:26></a>

		We get the whole gospel in verse 38.<a name=280:18></a> The remission of sins which is so much preached is only half the gospel.<a name=280:19></a> The positive side, that men should receive the Holy Spirit, is usually left out.<a name=280:20></a> It is striking when one considers how little the Holy Spirit is preached about: one seldom hears the gift of the Holy Spirit mentioned in a gospel preaching.<a name=280:21></a> There is something wrong in that when you consider the wonderful reality it is to receive the Holy Spirit, and yet it is rarely mentioned and only man's relief spoken of.<a name=280:22></a> I remember in one place where I preached about the Holy Spirit I was told afterwards that it was the first time that anyone had thought of the reception of the Holy Spirit.<a name=280:23></a>

		Another thing we get in verse 40 that we do not hear preached is, "Be saved from this perverse generation".<a name=281:3></a> It is quite true we are to save ourselves; that is, by severing our connection with the world that crucified Jesus.<a name=281:4></a> We cannot have this world and the kingdom of God.<a name=281:5></a> It is not preached enough that we must renounce this world: we must save ourselves in that way.<a name=281:6></a> It was said also to Saul, "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:16">Acts  22:16</a>).<a name=281:7></a>

		In this chapter we see christianity established here in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=282:1></a> Last week we were looking at some of the things which are characteristic of christianity as seen in chapter 1, but the coming of the Holy Spirit was needed to make them good intelligently and in power in the company of believers.<a name=282:2></a> It is of the greatest importance to see that the Holy Spirit has come.<a name=282:3></a> Many are occupied with the gift of the Spirit, and praying for a baptism of the Holy Spirit, but the fact is the Holy Spirit has come, and the great mark of His presence is the testimony He renders to Christ.<a name=282:4></a> The Lord Himself said, "<i>He</i> shall bear witness concerning me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>), and the effect of His coming was that the apostles preached Christ in such a way that three thousand souls were converted in one day, and brought to continue in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayers.<a name=282:5></a> It is in these things that christianity really consists.<a name=282:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, Jesus the Nazaraean was "a man borne witness to by God".<a name=283:11></a> Christ is the subject of every divine testimony.<a name=283:12></a> Look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:32">John  5:32</a> - 39.<a name=283:13></a> Here we see a fourfold witness to Christ -- that of John the Baptist, of His own works, of the Father and of the Scriptures.<a name=283:14></a> Every divine testimony really centres in Christ.<a name=283:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing, beloved friends, to see that God's pleasure is to introduce that blessed Person to our hearts.<a name=283:16></a> God is set on filling us with blessing in Christ.<a name=283:17></a> We cannot find blessing anywhere but in Him, but we shall find everything to meet our consciences and satisfy our hearts if we receive God's witness to His beloved Son.<a name=283:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#81:10">Psalm  81:10</a> - 16 we see what God had in His mind for Israel, but they would have none of Him.<a name=283:19></a> They closed their hearts against His testimony.<a name=283:20></a> No doubt God will in a coming day bring them into blessing, but meantime we are in His thoughts for blessing.<a name=283:21></a> God is saying to us, "Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it".<a name=283:22></a> He is waiting to feed us with the finest of the wheat and to satisfy us with honey out of the rock.<a name=283:23></a> How important that we should not miss this!<a name=283:24></a> How careful should we be not to miss the blessed testimony of the Holy Spirit to Christ now!<a name=283:25></a> God has no blessing for us outside Christ -- no delight or pleasure but in Him.<a name=283:26></a>

		Second, "Him, given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (verse 23).<a name=284:1></a> Why was He thus given up to death?<a name=284:2></a> Because if we were to be filled with blessing in Him, He must die to remove us and our sins.<a name=284:3></a> We have to see that that is the way that God has taken.<a name=284:4></a> God has, if I may so say, relieved Himself of all that in us which was obnoxious to Him.<a name=284:5></a> Sins were before Him -- Christ has become the propitiation for them.<a name=284:6></a> Man the sinner was there -- Christ has come in the likeness of sinful flesh and gone into death to bear his condemnation and to put him out of God's sight, not only in holy judgment but in holy love.<a name=284:7></a> God has been glorified about all we have done and all we are, and He can now speak to us of Christ.<a name=284:8></a> How near this brings the love of God to us when we see the way He has taken to set us aside so that He might fill us with the blessedness of Another, and that His own beloved Son!<a name=284:9></a> To know the love of God we must look at the cross.<a name=284:10></a> We can never measure its depths, but it is a delight to see that God, by the death of Jesus, has cleared the ground righteously so that we might be fully blessed in Him.<a name=284:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third, "Ye, by the hand of lawless men, have crucified and slain" (verse 23).<a name=284:12></a> This shows us the place Christ has in the estimation of the world.<a name=284:13></a> He is not allowed a place here; He is disallowed indeed of men.<a name=284:14></a> So much so that if you find a person really giving Christ a place you feel sure it is a work of God.<a name=284:15></a> People think that things have changed because of the progress of religion, etc.<a name=284:16></a>, but there is no place for Christ in the unconverted heart today any more than there was then.<a name=284:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The man who does not receive Christ is really in the same spirit as those who crucified Him.<a name=284:18></a> He says in his heart, 'I do not want Him, I have no room for Him'.<a name=284:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it not a wonderful thing, beloved friends, that the finger of God has touched us, and made room for Christ in our hearts?<a name=284:20></a> It is having Christ that puts the Christian outside the world, whether politically, socially or religiously.<a name=284:21></a> If he speaks of Christ to his political friends, or at the social party, all are made uncomfortable; a cloud comes over the scene

		Fourth, "Whom God has raised up" (verse 24).<a name=285:7></a> Here we come to God's side.<a name=285:8></a> If on man's side He was rejected and slain, on God's side resurrection power was displayed.<a name=285:9></a> Everything that is for God now stands on the basis of resurrection.<a name=285:10></a> Everything here comes to an end by death.<a name=285:11></a> The best and fairest things here wither under death's terrible blight.<a name=285:12></a> But here we find a blessed Man who cannot be held by death.<a name=285:13></a> He has been raised up and is alive for evermore where sin and death can never come.<a name=285:14></a> He was cut off and had nothing here, but the Holy Spirit through Peter calls attention to the joy He has entered into in resurrection.<a name=285:15></a> See verses 26, 28.<a name=285:16></a> This is a quotation from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, which speaks of the joy of the Messiah in resurrection.<a name=285:17></a> When here, He was a Man of sorrows in a lowly path of grief and pain which ended in death, but He has entered into His joy in resurrection.<a name=285:18></a> Christ is the one "fairer than the sons of men".<a name=285:19></a> The beatitudes of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>find their only perfect fulfilment in Christ; He was the One poor in spirit, the One who mourned in presence of all the evil here, the meek One, the merciful, the One pure in heart, the peacemaker, and the One of all others who was persecuted and reviled for righteousness' sake.<a name=285:20></a>

		And what did He get for it here?<a name=285:21></a> Was He rewarded by men, or indeed at all in the present order of things?<a name=285:22></a> No, beloved friends, His joys were in another scene.<a name=285:23></a> He said to His disciples, "Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:12">Matthew  5:12</a>).<a name=285:24></a> He entered into His joy in resurrection (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#21:3">Psalm  21:3</a> - 6).<a name=285:25></a> Think of the exceeding joy of

		Christ in resurrection!<a name=286:1></a> You have doubtless often prayed for spiritual joy, but the way the Holy Spirit would bring you into it would be by leading you to see that Christ has entered into all that was in the purpose of God for man, and this in resurrection, that it might be secured for you in Him.<a name=286:2></a> He has entered as Man into all that is spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>, 10 as "things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit".<a name=286:3></a> Christ has entered in resurrection into all this; it is all established in Him, and the Spirit reveals it to us down here that we may have as heavenly light what soon shall be our part.<a name=286:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The disciples must have had the thought that when Christ got a place here they would share it with Him.<a name=286:5></a> But He gets a place <i>there</i> and shares that place with His own.<a name=286:6></a> He has companions in His joy; God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions.<a name=286:7></a> He has sanctified us by His death in order that we might share His joy.<a name=286:8></a> Is it not a wonderful thing to belong to such a Person, and to have such a portion with Him?<a name=286:9></a> But, remember, it is all on the resurrection side.<a name=286:10></a>

		Fifth, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God" (verse 33).<a name=286:11></a> Christ is rejected here, but exalted there.<a name=286:12></a> Men try to make it appear as if Christ had a place on earth -- a place of honour here -- but it is not so.<a name=286:13></a> The world that cast Him out and slew Him now builds costly and magnificent edifices professedly in His name.<a name=286:14></a> It is the old principle: the fathers killed the prophets, and the children built their sepulchres.<a name=286:15></a> But the Christian is not deceived by this.<a name=286:16></a> He knows Christ to be still despised and rejected by men, but he knows Him as the One whom God has highly exalted and set at His right hand.<a name=286:17></a> As we learn that He is not here our hearts turn to Him there, and our minds are set on things above where Christ sits at the right hand of God.<a name=286:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sixth, "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which <i>ye</i> behold and hear" (verse 33).<a name=287:7></a> How true it was of Christ that He loved righteousness and hated wickedness!<a name=287:8></a> He showed it by going to the cross to establish righteousness and to put away iniquity.<a name=287:9></a> And now He has been anointed with the oil of gladness that He may share that anointing with His companions.<a name=287:10></a> He has received the Holy Spirit as Man that He might shed Him forth on us.<a name=287:11></a> How wonderful to see that there is a heavenly company on earth having part in the anointing of that blessed Man at the right hand of God!<a name=287:12></a>

		Seventh, "God has made him, this Jesus whom <i>ye</i> have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (verse 36).<a name=287:13></a> All the rights and authority of God are set forth now in the Lord Jesus.<a name=287:14></a> He is Lord.<a name=287:15></a> There are poor dupes of Satan who will not give divine honours to the Lord Jesus.<a name=287:16></a> Such do not honour God at all.<a name=287:17></a> Then, on the other hand, Jesus is the Christ -- God's anointed One to bring to pass all the thoughts and purposes of God with regard to the blessing of man.<a name=287:18></a> God has had counsels and purposes of blessing for man from all eternity, and Jesus is the anointed Man by whom all will surely come to pass.<a name=287:19></a> He was Lord and Christ, but in the days of His flesh His glory was veiled.<a name=287:20></a> Now it is manifested by the place in which God has set Him at His own right hand.<a name=287:21></a> He is Lord and Christ.<a name=287:22></a>

		The apostles' teaching and the fellowship are intimately bound up together, and then in close connection with them we have "breaking of bread and prayers".<a name=288:9></a> The Lord's supper had a great place in their hearts and it became a new rallying-point for them.<a name=288:10></a> The temple was the rallying-point in judaism, and while the Lord was with His own He was their rallying-point.<a name=288:11></a> But now the temple was desolate and the Lord was gone.<a name=288:12></a> What remained?<a name=288:13></a> Well, for one thing, the christian company remained, persevering in the apostles' teaching and fellowship.<a name=288:14></a> And another thing remained: the Lord's supper.<a name=288:15></a> He had instituted it on the night of His betrayal, leaving it, so to speak, in place of Himself, as His own way of bringing His saints together in His absence.<a name=288:16></a>

		It is instructive to observe that the course of apostasy divides itself into two great streams.<a name=300:8></a> Thyatira represents one of those streams, and Laodicea the other.<a name=300:9></a> One is the vast current of superstition, idolatry, and fleshly religion which we see full-blown in popery, and which is known in this country as ritualism.<a name=300:10></a> The other is rationalism, which assumes the competency of the human mind to investigate, and to pronounce upon, the things of God.<a name=300:11></a> Both agree to exclude Christ.<a name=300:12></a> Ritualism makes much of man in the flesh as a religious being.<a name=300:13></a> Rationalism makes much of him as an intellectual being.<a name=300:14></a> The truth of christianity is that man in both aspects is under death and judgment as offensive to God, and that nothing avails before God but a new creation in Christ Jesus.<a name=300:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One is thankful to be reminded, as we have been, of the importance of prophetic communications, for they are, I think we might say, communications of the mind of heaven at any particular moment.<a name=334:1></a> Nothing is more to be desired than to be recipients of communications that give us the present mind of heaven, and as being of the assembly we are in a position and in relationships which make it a delight to God to communicate His mind to us.<a name=334:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I ventured to read these three scriptures because Peter and Paul and John were men who were of great interest to heaven, and the Lord did not leave them without the communication of His mind.<a name=334:3></a> In each case they received communications: the first two of them receiving things relative to the beginning of things in the assembly period and John receiving what refers specially to the close of that period, which brings the experience of John in a definite way to our own time and to ourselves.<a name=334:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have specially in mind relates to what our brother referred to as the capacity to receive.<a name=334:5></a> We may be assured that heaven is ready to communicate; that is, divine Persons are ready to communicate; but the more special and exalted the communications are the more special is the condition of soul that is required to receive them.<a name=334:6></a> I feel as to meetings of this character (I may say this is the first of such a character at which I have been privileged to be present) that spiritual capacity to communicate will be found perhaps in two or three, but it is of immense importance that spiritual capacity to receive shall be found in all, otherwise these meetings will fail of the divine intent.<a name=334:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice that in each case these great servants of God speak of special communications, but at the same time they call attention to special conditions on their part which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=335>[Page 335]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		qualified them to receive divine communications.<a name=335:1></a> Peter speaks of it very simply to the brethren; he says, "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision".<a name=335:2></a> Paul tells the crowd at Jerusalem that as he was praying -- notice again, as he was praying -- he became in ecstasy.<a name=335:3></a> And John, who is the vessel of the divine communications and prophetic word of the last days, uses corresponding language; he says that he "became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=335:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These statements are not to be regarded lightly, because I cannot suppose that ecstasy is limited in the divine mind to the apostles, nor that being, as John says, "in the Spirit" is restricted.<a name=335:5></a> What I understand by it is that, if we are to be spiritually capable of receiving communications from heaven, there must be a state and abstraction of mind which would somewhat correspond with what is referred to in Scripture as "ecstasy".<a name=335:6></a> I do not mean to suggest anything mystical or fanciful, but a sober spiritual reality; and we may notice, as helpful to us in this regard, that the prayers of Peter and of Paul tended to ecstasy.<a name=335:7></a> It is a fine suggestion for us, beloved brethren.<a name=335:8></a> It was private prayer, whether on the housetop or in the temple, but the prayers of these two great servants led to ecstasy.<a name=335:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take it that ecstasy is a condition in which the mind is abstracted from the natural and human influences that would normally act upon our minds and our spirits.<a name=335:10></a> Ecstasy implies complete freedom from all that and indicates a state which makes room for the reception of the mind of heaven.<a name=335:11></a> I am sure we are all convinced that such a state is extremely desirable, indeed it is essential if we are to have prophetic communications in the assembly.<a name=335:12></a> Such communications are of such an exalted character that they require entire immunity from the influence of the conditions that normally act upon us here.<a name=335:13></a> It is encouraging to note that private prayer on the part of Peter and Paul tended to that condition; so that the importance of prayer in relation to such meetings as this is very great.<a name=335:14></a> We should come to them from intercourse with
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=336>[Page 336]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God and with our minds free in a special way.<a name=336:1></a> There are special things and states in christianity as well as what is, I may say, ordinary in a spiritual sense; and we should cultivate that special condition of soul that is peculiarly free to receive divine communications.<a name=336:2></a> Paul, as we know, speaks in another scripture of being beside himself to God.<a name=336:3></a> One covets the realisation of such a state as that; it is very much the thought of "ecstasy"; the soul is free from self-consideration and thus prepared for the communication of God's mind.<a name=336:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With Peter and Paul it was the communication of the mind of heaven at the beginning; the Gentile was coming into view.<a name=336:5></a> The Gentile was being revealed as in the light of God's purposes, cleansed and fitted for a place in the spiritual house concerning which Peter afterwards ministered.<a name=336:6></a> They were to take up the holy service of God.<a name=336:7></a> It was a wonderful flood of heavenly light into the soul of Peter.<a name=336:8></a> Then, in relation to Paul the word of God was to be completed, the whole counsel of God was coming out, the full height of all that was in God's mind -- the truth of the mystery, the assembly as the body of Christ and as the habitation of God in the Spirit.<a name=336:9></a> It was all coming out, but the intimation of it came to a man in ecstasy.<a name=336:10></a> I cannot but think that God greatly values a condition of soul which is free from the normal influences that act upon us as living in this world.<a name=336:11></a> He would have us free so that we might come into the mind of heaven as receiving communications that come to us from God.<a name=336:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John's experience brings us to our own time, because, as we know, the Revelation of Jesus Christ refers to the end of the church period and to that which will follow.<a name=336:13></a> John tells us in chapter 1 that the things "must shortly take place" and "the time is near", so that the Revelation is to be read as specifically applying to the very time in which we find ourselves now.<a name=336:14></a> Here is a blessed servant of God suffering for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus, and that is the moral qualification to receive further light.<a name=336:15></a> I believe that at the present time those who have received light from God are

		those who have been prepared to suffer for what they already know.<a name=337:1></a> I believe if any Christian is prepared to suffer for what he knows he will get communications from heaven.<a name=337:2></a> They come to people who value the things of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ so far as they may have understood it, and who are prepared to suffer for it.<a name=337:3></a> Such persons do not find it difficult to become "in the Spirit".<a name=337:4></a> John says, "I became in the Spirit".<a name=337:5></a> He is not referring to the christian state as described in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>but to something special.<a name=337:6></a> I believe, dear brethren, we ought to lay ourselves out for what is special.<a name=337:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As being "in the Spirit" John gets wonderful communications; and those communications, so far as they relate to our period, relate to local assemblies, bringing out the special interest of the Lord in local assemblies.<a name=337:8></a> Chapter 1 and chapter 22, the beginning and the end of this book, make clear that the Lord has before Him the thought of local assemblies.<a name=337:9></a> It is not the truth in a general way, or abstractly, but it is the thought of the truth of the assembly as worked out in a concrete way in localities.<a name=337:10></a> I think we must accept that; and I take it, beloved brethren, that what is prophetic in any local company or companies must of necessity have a bearing on the local conditions of that company.<a name=337:11></a> The Lord is specially testifying things in the assemblies.<a name=337:12></a> "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies" (chapter 22: 16).<a name=337:13></a>

		The Lord is contemplating that the church period shall end in character as it began.<a name=337:14></a> He tells us He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.<a name=337:15></a> The end is to correspond with the beginning; that is the idea.<a name=337:16></a> We have been already reminded that the mind of God does not change.<a name=337:17></a> What was in the mind of God in the beginning, communicated through Peter to the Jews and through Paul towards the Gentiles, still remains true.<a name=337:18></a> Paul set the local assemblies in the light of the precious ministry which was committed to him; he set all the local assemblies in the light of the kingdom of God, and the

	<div class="paragraph">
		house of God and the body of Christ.<a name=338:1></a> That was his ministry, and he set the assemblies in that light at the beginning.<a name=338:2></a> It is to be noticed, too, that Peter addresses in his epistle the sojourners of the dispersion in the same area geographically as the seven assemblies of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>.<a name=338:3></a> The truth of a spiritual house and a holy priesthood was to take form in the five provinces named.<a name=338:4></a> He clearly had local companies in view as found in a large area.<a name=338:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe we have very little idea of the importance to divine Persons of our coming together (no matter how few or how feebly outwardly) in the light and faith of the original and unchanging mind of God with regard to His people.<a name=338:6></a> As we come together thus, the prophetic word will confirm every exercise that is of God.<a name=338:7></a> I would say in this connection that ecstasy does not set aside personal exercise.<a name=338:8></a> We find in the case of Peter and Paul that personal exercise came into expression even when in ecstasy.<a name=338:9></a> We find these two great servants (just like the brethren of today) not at once prepared to receive divine communications.<a name=338:10></a> They both reasoned against the divine communications and entered good arguments against them.<a name=338:11></a> So you see the element of personal exercise goes on; but if we are really in a state which at all corresponds with ecstasy we shall not find it difficult to judge any action of our own minds and our own wills.<a name=338:12></a> These great servants were not disobedient to the heavenly visions; they accepted the light.<a name=338:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we walk together in local assemblies we find that exercises come along and they test and humble us.<a name=338:14></a> The effect of divine communications in a day of departure must always be humbling.<a name=338:15></a> They will always have the effect they had upon John; when he saw one like the Son of man he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=338:16></a> If we have prophetic ministry, do not let us think we are going to enjoy it.<a name=338:17></a> Prophetic ministry is not a thing to be enjoyed; it comes to search us, to go down to the very roots of our moral being to find out our motives and feelings and thoughts; but if we are in the Spirit we shall accept adjustment.<a name=338:18></a>

		One great mark of a person who has known what it is to withdraw into this peculiar abstraction of mind involved in being in the Spirit is that he, is amenable to adjustment; the mind of heaven carries his conscience and his affections.<a name=339:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought was to add a word in connection with what had already been said, as to the spiritual condition that would give us capacity to receive communications of the mind of heaven.<a name=339:2></a> It is an extraordinary moment, because one cannot think that the Lord will leave any part of the truth altogether ineffective before He translates the assembly to Himself.<a name=339:3></a> He will make every part of the truth effective, and He will make it effective in local companies; so that this has a very practical bearing on us as walking together in local fellowship.<a name=339:4></a> The Lord will help us as to His mind, even though we may have to fall at His feet as dead: I feel sure I am speaking to many who, like myself, have had to taste in some small measure an experience like that.<a name=339:5></a> But we have always found, and shall find, that the one who searches is the One who supports, and He teaches us that we can only follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, as calling upon Him out of a pure heart; that is, He alone is our resource and strength.<a name=339:6></a> If He gives us the mind of heaven it will search and expose a great deal that has been in ourselves, but He will make Himself adequate and sufficient for us, so that in the very last moment of the church's history there may be something very bright for Himself.<a name=339:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John gives the church a glorious finish -- "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=339:8></a> That will mark the local assemblies when the prophetic word has done its work.<a name=339:9></a> I take it that the Spirit and the bride being free to say 'Come' means that everything has been judged that came under the displeasure of heaven; the washing of the robes has been completed and there has been a going in to eat of the Tree-of Life in moral conditions that are suitable.<a name=339:10></a> The assembly's finish thus becomes similar to the assembly's beginning.<a name=339:11></a> I do not say in a large way publicly, but I believe God intends to realise these

		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27:1">Acts  27:1</a> - 44
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 2 and 3 of this chapter we get a hint of the happy conditions which were found in the assembly when it was marked by the work of faith, the labour of love and the enduring constancy of hope.<a name=373:1></a> "Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us".<a name=373:2></a> What a comfort to Paul to have with him that kind of companionship -- the company of those who were his glory and joy!<a name=373:3></a> (See 1 Thessalonians.<a name=373:4></a>) In those days of first love the saints were characteristically Paul's friends, and there was much "consolation of love" amongst them and refreshment of heart.<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verses 4 - 7 "the winds were contrary".<a name=373:6></a> The prince of the power of the air raised every kind of opposition.<a name=373:7></a> "Satan has hindered us", Paul says.<a name=373:8></a> There was great persecution and many contrary elements.<a name=373:9></a> There was slow sailing and difficulty.<a name=373:10></a> It was for the Jewish believers a transitional stage from the old order to the new, and this rendered movement slow.<a name=373:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 8 they came to Fair Havens.<a name=373:12></a> This was the place God intended for them, and where they should have stayed.<a name=373:13></a> It answers to "without the camp, bearing his reproach".<a name=373:14></a> This would have been a safe place, but it was "ill adapted"; the outside place and the reproach of Christ are never comfortable to flesh and blood.<a name=373:15></a> And verse 9 tells us that navigation was "already dangerous, because the fast was already past".<a name=373:16></a> I think there is moral import in that.<a name=373:17></a> There is always danger when self-restraint is given up and self-indulgence begins.<a name=373:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul counsels them in verse 10.<a name=373:19></a> This very much corresponds with what we have in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:17">Acts  20:17</a> - 35.<a name=373:20></a> That was a solemn moment; it was like the pilot leaving the ship, but giving a solemn warning as to the perils of the voyage before them.<a name=373:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we find in verse 11 that the official class will not heed Paul.<a name=374:1></a> It is striking how soon an official class were found in the church who disregarded Paul's teaching -- a clerical order soon sprang up who would not listen to the apostles.<a name=374:2></a> The effect of their counsel was an effort to reach Phoenice, a place which looks north-east and south-east; that is, it faces in two different directions, which rather suggests trying to make the best of both worlds.<a name=374:3></a> This brings us along in the history to Constantine's time and after, when the church and the world came into unholy union.<a name=374:4></a> For a time the south wind blew softly (verse 13) and all seemed favourable.<a name=374:5></a> When we are going wrong Satan does not stand in our path as a roaring lion; he rather makes things easy for us.<a name=374:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But soon the storm broke, and there was no power to stand against it.<a name=374:7></a> The true state and position of the church having been departed from, and an official class being in authority who did not heed Paul, there was no power to stand against the evil influences which broke like a tempest upon her.<a name=374:8></a> The head of the ship could not be brought to the wind.<a name=374:9></a> There was no spiritual power to face or to resist the pressure of evil; the ship was caught and driven before it.<a name=374:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Certain efforts were made in verses 16 and 17 which had their correspondence in church councils and the formulation of creeds, which helped to preserve things a little as to outward forms.<a name=374:11></a> But spiritually there was great surrender; "the next day they threw cargo overboard".<a name=374:12></a> All heavenly truth was given up.<a name=374:13></a> How could the worldly church retain the truth of association with a risen and heavenly Christ, or what was connected with the presence and power of the Spirit down here?<a name=374:14></a> So her precious cargo had to go.<a name=374:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the third day "with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture".<a name=374:16></a> I suppose that church order remained for some time after the church had practically given up the heavenly calling and her true affections and hopes.<a name=374:17></a> For example, we may conclude that all was in outward order at Ephesus (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>) though first love had been

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then for many days "neither sun nor stars" appeared.<a name=375:3></a> There was no heavenly light.<a name=375:4></a> People speak of those days as 'the Dark Ages'.<a name=375:5></a> No doubt God had His witnesses in many a hidden corner, but as to the public history of the church it was dark indeed.<a name=375:6></a> And there was no enjoyment of food; "they had been a long while without taking food".<a name=375:7></a> Light and food go together.<a name=375:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then after "a long while" Paul speaks again.<a name=375:9></a> "Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me".<a name=375:10></a> If Paul's teaching had been heeded, the church would have been preserved.<a name=375:11></a> But in spite of all this he now comes in with the cheering word that there should be "no loss at all of life" -- everything vital would be preserved.<a name=375:12></a> I think "Paul" spoke again at the Reformation and since.<a name=375:13></a> Justification by faith brought in vitality; it became a question of believing God, not the church.<a name=375:14></a> "I believe God".<a name=375:15></a> The just lives by his faith.<a name=375:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 27, "the sailors supposed that some land neared them", and they take soundings.<a name=375:17></a> It began to be realised that the voyage would end in shipwreck even as Paul had warned them long before.<a name=375:18></a> The attention drawn to dispensational and prophetic truth, and the application of these truths to the present circumstances of the church were very much like taking soundings.<a name=375:19></a> This led to the position being realised.<a name=375:20></a> Ruin and apostasy were the only future to be contemplated here, but this was learned in the light of all that the assembly was according to the divine thought, and the hope of the Lord's coming and the church's previous rapture came distinctly into the view and affections of saints.<a name=375:21></a> It began to be widely felt by all exercised persons that we were in the last days, and that the coming of the Lord drew nigh.<a name=375:22></a> And every sounding is less and less.<a name=375:23></a> Even thirty years ago people would have been shocked at the things which are widely preached today, and religious infidelity gets bolder every day.<a name=375:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		wish to flee out of the ship and to go off in a boat, but Paul will not suffer this to be done, though it was ostensibly to serve a good purpose.<a name=376:1></a> The "boat" seems to suggest the dissenting principle which recognises that the ship -- the public profession -- is in a bad state, but proposes to remedy matters by forming little churches on a narrower basis than that of the assembly of God.<a name=376:2></a> But this is not really the divine way; Paul's doctrine does not allow it.<a name=376:3></a> The sad plight of the ship must be faced and owned, but the divine preservation is in being with Paul.<a name=376:4></a> "God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee".<a name=376:5></a> If we are with Paul we shall hold to the truth of the assembly, of which he was minister, and we shall not admit any sectarian or 'little church' ideas.<a name=376:6></a> Without attempting to form anything we shall walk with fellow-saints on the principles Paul laid down in 2 Timothy.<a name=376:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To go off in a boat suggests to my mind a giving up of the truth of the assembly.<a name=376:8></a> Christians associate together on the basis of certain truths, but practically give up what is the distinctive truth of the present time -- the truth of the assembly.<a name=376:9></a> Many things have become a "boat" in which saints have gone off from assembly truth.<a name=376:10></a> At different times there have been movements amongst those professing to walk together in the truth which have involved the practical giving up of divine assembly principles, and those movements have led to divisions amongst saints.<a name=376:11></a> It is a real exercise not to go off in a boat where we shall not be in company with Paul!<a name=376:12></a> We have to hold to every divine principle and to every part of assembly truth, whatever the outward ruin may be.<a name=376:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 33, "while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food".<a name=376:14></a> The light of a coming day begins to break.<a name=376:15></a> Peter speaks of the day dawn and the morning star arising in the hearts of saints.<a name=376:16></a> This is pretty much what the Spirit has been giving to many hearts in recent years.<a name=376:17></a> And along with the light of the coming day, food has been provided for saints.<a name=376:18></a> Light and food always go together; if God gives light He also gives food to build up the constitution of His saints.<a name=376:19></a> Salvation is found in the food supply.<a name=376:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=377>[Page 377]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then verse 35 is strikingly suggestive.<a name=377:1></a> In connection with Paul's voice being heard the breaking of bread comes in.<a name=377:2></a> It is one of the most distinctive features of these last days that the breaking of bread has been revived.<a name=377:3></a> It was lost in sacramentalism for many centuries, but it has been revived and it seems to indicate a special activity of the love of Christ just before, and in view of, the end.<a name=377:4></a> It is wonderful that such a precious and divine rallying-point should have been restored, and that the saints should be exercised to get away from all sacramental and formal ideas, and to enter into what the Supper was in the heart and mind of the Lord Jesus when He instituted it, and all that He intended it to be to them as the witness of His love, and the answer to that love -- so deeply valued by Him -- on their part.<a name=377:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He gave thanks to God before all".<a name=377:6></a> How sweet to think of this!<a name=377:7></a> The breaking of bread and thanksgiving to God go together, and both are revived in the power of divine love just before the end.<a name=377:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then "having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea".<a name=377:9></a> I do not know whether we might take this as suggesting that a satisfied people have something to cast upon the waters -- there is a widespread testimony of grace in the glad tidings.<a name=377:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 41 is close to the end.<a name=377:11></a> Two powerful forces of evil meet with destructive effect.<a name=377:12></a> Superstition and infidelity -- ritualism and the sacramental system on one side, and rationalism on the other, and between the two everything is breaking up.<a name=377:13></a> Nothing will get through but the energy of individual faith, and vitality comes out in this.<a name=377:14></a> This is what we see in 2 Timothy.<a name=377:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 28: 1 - 10 is suggestive of the time to come when those who show favour and kindness to the people of God will come into blessing (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:31">Matthew  25:31</a> - 46).<a name=377:16></a> Paul's character is seen in his readiness to gather sticks for the fire -- a ministry of warmth and comfort; and Satan's power, figured in the viper, is dispossessed and nullified.<a name=377:17></a> Then we see the powers of the world to come in the healing of the father of Publius

		The persons who are outstanding as types of Christ in the Old Testament are Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Boaz, David and Solomon, but promises largely centre in Isaac and David.<a name=394:1></a> Isaac is Christ as the Heir-the fulfilment of all promise, but who inherits all as having died and risen.<a name=394:2></a> All that was promised in holy writings has been fulfilled in Christ, but Christ is the Heir -- the only One entitled to the promises -- "The seed came to whom the promise was made" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:19">Galatians  3:19</a>).<a name=394:3></a> "But if ye are of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise" (verse 29).<a name=394:4></a> We are of Christ as having the faith of Him (see <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:22">Galatians  3:22</a>).<a name=394:5></a> God's promise is the setting forth of what He would bring to pass as glad tidings for men, but it is all "concerning his Son".<a name=394:6></a>

		But then He must "come of David's seed according to flesh".<a name=394:7></a> David is the man after God's heart who is to do all God's will.<a name=394:8></a> He represents Christ anointed to do God's will in kingly power.<a name=394:9></a> The power of evil being here, it has to be met by the kingdom of God coming in.<a name=394:10></a> The horn of salvation in the house of David His servant shows that what was seen in David typically came out fully in his Seed.<a name=394:11></a> He was marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead.<a name=394:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As energised by the Holy Spirit in the inner man we learn three things which are brought before us in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>.<a name=528:2></a> Firstly, we learn that the flesh profits nothing (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:63">John  6:63</a>).<a name=528:3></a> I do not think that anyone could really discern the utter unprofitableness of the flesh until he had the Spirit.<a name=528:4></a> The conscience of man takes account of sins but when one is born anew and has received the Spirit there is divine capability to discern the utter worthlessness of the flesh.<a name=528:5></a> As in the flesh we are under death and condemnation .<a name=528:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in the second place we learn that there is a way of escape from this state.<a name=528:7></a> No one could really be happy with God so long as he was identified in his spirit and conscience with the flesh.<a name=528:8></a> Not that there is actual deliverance from the presence of the flesh.<a name=528:9></a> This will not be until death, or the coming of the Lord.<a name=528:10></a> But there is a way of deliverance in spirit by the appropriation of Christ's death.<a name=528:11></a> No one knows much about life until he knows what it is to be free in spirit from the flesh that "profits nothing".<a name=528:12></a> "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves" (verse 53).<a name=528:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by appropriating the death of Christ that we find ourselves detached in spirit from all that we are as in the flesh.<a name=528:14></a> We have to appropriate the death of Christ as that in which our history as in the flesh has closed under divine judgment.<a name=528:15></a> He came here in likeness of flesh of sin and went to the cross to be there made sacrificially what we were actually, so that all that we were morally as in the flesh might be condemned and removed in judgment from before God's eye.<a name=528:16></a> The end of all flesh has come before God in the death of Christ.<a name=528:17></a> Now we have to feed on that death -- to appropriate the value and meaning of it -- as that by which we are freed in spirit from our worthless selves.<a name=528:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, thirdly, we learn that the death of Christ is not only our way out of all that we are morally as in the flesh, but it is our way into the love of God.<a name=528:19></a> Christ has come into death that

		He might open an eternal well-spring of divine love for our hearts, so that we might live in that love.<a name=529:1></a> He came from Godhead's fullest glory down to the dust of death that He might give expression to all the depths of God's nature, and place the love of God within reach of the appropriation of our hearts.<a name=529:2></a> The Spirit energises us in the inward man for the appropriation of that love.<a name=529:3></a> The well of water in the believer is the Spirit giving energy of affection to enter thus into eternal life.<a name=529:4></a> It is by the Spirit we have life in us -- that capacity to know divine love, so as to live in it.<a name=529:5></a> "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal" (verse 54).<a name=529:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get the appropriation of Christ Himself.<a name=529:7></a> "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, <i>he</i> also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (verse 57).<a name=529:8></a> The Christian lives on account of Christ; he lives because he is energised in his affections by the Spirit to appropriate what Christ is at the right hand of God.<a name=529:9></a> The One who came down out of heaven to give His flesh for the life of the world has ascended up where He was before, and He is there as Priest to sustain His saints in life.<a name=529:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a> we get two thoughts which may be looked at in connection with what has come before us.<a name=529:11></a> "<i>Ye</i> also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God".<a name=529:12></a> Here we get the death of Christ as that by which we are freed from the law, and then the thought of coming into such relation to Christ as the risen, living One that we bring forth fruit to God.<a name=529:13></a> Fruit is the evidence of life, and it is the result of being married to Christ.<a name=529:14></a> He came into death in order to set us free from the law, the claim of which being brought home to us as in the flesh could only produce the sense of utter weakness and condemnation.<a name=529:15></a> But, on the other hand, Christ is raised from the dead, and lives for evermore, that we may come into contact with Him, and be strengthened and succoured by Him so as to bring forth fruit to God.<a name=529:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing of great importance in connection with bringing forth fruit to God.<a name=530:9></a> The assembly is not only nourished and cherished by Christ, but she is subjected to Him.<a name=530:10></a> We are married to Christ in order to come under His blessed control, and the one who has known what it is to be nourished and cherished by Him delights to be subjected to Him.<a name=530:11></a> It is when we are nourished and cherished by Christ, and subjected to Him, that we bring forth fruit to God.<a name=530:12></a> Our own will is set aside.<a name=530:13></a> We are controlled and commanded by Christ.<a name=530:14></a> He becomes "to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation; addressed by God as high priest according to the order of Melchisedec" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:9">Hebrews  5:9</a>, 10).<a name=530:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>we are looked at as being in Christ Jesus, and as having received the Spirit, so that we may walk after the Spirit, and know the love of God so as to love Him in response.<a name=530:16></a> Then in verse 34 is introduced the fact that Christ at the right hand of God makes intercession for us.<a name=530:17></a> When Paul says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=530:18></a>", it is clearly the love of Christ as Priest that is before him.<a name=530:19></a> How blessed to know that not all the power of evil without can separate us from the love of the Priest!<a name=530:20></a> In presence of all the power of the enemy, "we more than conquer through him that has loved us".<a name=530:21></a> Instead of pressure here coming in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object of Christ's priestly intercession is that our hearts may be kept in the knowledge and joy of the love of God.<a name=531:3></a> The effect of His intercession is that we are persuaded that nothing "shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=531:4></a> Christ came down from the top to the bottom to open for us, in His own precious death, the springs of divine love.<a name=531:5></a> He has now gone back from the bottom to the top as a risen and glorified Man to intercede for us that we may not be moved away from those springs of divine love.<a name=531:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:19">Galatians  2:19</a>, 20 we see that the law had said its last word to Paul in the death of Christ, and now, as having Christ living in his affections, he lived to God.<a name=531:7></a> If anyone could have looked into Paul's heart he would have found that Paul was nothing there, but that Christ was everything.<a name=531:8></a> It is possible to be trying to live Christ externally while self is large in the heart, but the great thing is that Christ should live in our affections.<a name=531:9></a> Then the apostle could say as to his practical life as a man in this world, "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=531:10></a> He lived on account of that blessed Person at the right hand of God.<a name=531:11></a> The Son of God was a greater reality to Paul than anything that existed in the sphere of sight.<a name=531:12></a> Every step that he took in his life in flesh down here he took in the light of the Son of God in glory.<a name=531:13></a> Human influences and motives did not rule him; circumstances did not control him; he lived in the light of the Son of God, as bound to Him by the love in which that blessed One had given Himself for him.<a name=531:14></a> And from the Son of God he drew support and succour for all the needs of his path and service.<a name=531:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the very grace which the covenant declares as existing on God's part becomes the bond of agreement between God and those with whom He consummates the covenant.<a name=557:3></a> If God engages and binds Himself to man by the covenant it is that man may be bound to Him according to the terms of that covenant.<a name=557:4></a> God works in man by His own quickening power, so that there may be an appreciation of the covenant in man's heart.<a name=557:5></a> As to Israel, this quickening is seen in the valley of dry bones (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37">Ezekiel  37</a>).<a name=557:6></a> The people will be made to live in the knowledge of God -- to live in that which He has made Himself known to be in grace -- and what God is will be the bond of agreement between Him and His people.<a name=557:7></a> "All shall know me in themselves, from the little one among them unto the great among them" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:11">Hebrews  8:11</a>), and the knowledge of God will form an unbreakable bond between Him and His people; they will be bound to Him in the knowledge of what He is.<a name=557:8></a> "My people shall be satisfied with my goodness" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:14">Jeremiah  31:14</a>).<a name=557:9></a> What God is becomes the security of the whole universe of bliss.<a name=557:10></a>

		Closely connected with the covenant is "the lawgiving".<a name=557:11></a> God will put His laws into the mind, and write them in the heart of Israel.<a name=557:12></a> That is, He will so operate in quickening power in man's intelligence and affections that man will be in accord with all that He is.<a name=557:13></a> The Lord is the Spirit of the covenant, but on the other hand Christ is the Spirit of the law.<a name=557:14></a> All the will of God in regard to man has come to light in Him; all that is pleasurable to God in man is seen in Christ.<a name=557:15></a> In having the Spirit of Christ, and being formed thereby, the "lawgiving" is made good in the saints.<a name=557:16></a> God will bring to pass in another day that the law will be set forth in Israel, and His will will find expression in a people here on earth.<a name=557:17></a> But

		THE RENEWAL OF THE MIND
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:2">Romans  12:2</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On an earlier occasion we were considering the renewal of the Spirit: we were seeing that it is the most important part of that action of mercy by which we are saved.<a name=579:1></a> The renewal of the Holy Spirit would perhaps give one the greatest conception of renewal that is possible; one could not conceive anything greater.<a name=579:2></a> Indeed it is very comforting and blessed to see that the things the gospel brings to us as divine gifts are the greatest things of all.<a name=579:3></a> All the wonderful things which God has bestowed on us -- the gift of the Spirit, salvation, eternal life, the children's place, sonship, the inheritance -- these are the greatest things in Scripture: and yet they are all the gift of the love of God, given because God would give them and nothing else would suit His mind.<a name=579:4></a> So the greatest things are, in a sense, common to all saints, by the gift of divine love.<a name=579:5></a> The renewal of the Holy Spirit is poured on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, and it is by that we are saved.<a name=579:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought it would be helpful if we looked now at the subject of the renewal of the mind.<a name=579:7></a> It seems to me that the renewal of the mind is something subsequent to the gift of the Spirit: it is the result of moral exercises that are consequent on the gospel being known and the Spirit received.<a name=579:8></a> In the epistle to the Romans the mind is spoken of in three distinct ways.<a name=579:9></a> The first is in chapter 1: 28, "According as they did not think good to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things".<a name=579:10></a> There we see the reprobate mind; it is the judicial consequence of men having determined that it was not well to have God in their knowledge.<a name=579:11></a> This was universal in the heathen world; men did not consider it well to have God in their knowledge, and so God judicially gave them up to a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=580>[Page 580]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		reprobate mind, a mind void of moral discernment, and the result was they did all kinds of unseemly things.<a name=580:1></a> The doing of these things was the result of the state of their minds.<a name=580:2></a> I want you to note this, because our doing right depends on the condition of our minds, it is the result of the renewing.<a name=580:3></a> Their conduct was the result of the reprobate mind.<a name=580:4></a> I trust none of us are in that state; I assume that no one here has a reprobate mind.<a name=580:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 7: 22 we find another sort of mind, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members".<a name=580:6></a> We might speak of that as the 'exercised mind'.<a name=580:7></a> It is a mind that is exercised towards God and towards what is good.<a name=580:8></a> The law that is in that mind, the fixed principle that works there, is the desire to do what is right and pleasing to God; so we can speak of it as the exercised mind.<a name=580:9></a> But we find there is another law in that person besides the law of the mind, and that is the law in his members, the law of sin; and practically the law of sin always gets the upper hand.<a name=580:10></a> He wants to do right, but there is a power too strong for him.<a name=580:11></a> It is an exercised mind but we could not speak of it scripturally as a renewed mind.<a name=580:12></a> It is a man who does not know the grace of the gospel, he is not in the good of deliverance and liberty.<a name=580:13></a> There may be some here with exercised minds; they would like to do what is right and to please God, but there is another power working, and to their grief and sorrow it generally gets the upper hand.<a name=580:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 12 we come to the 'renewed mind', we find there is a transforming power connected with it.<a name=580:15></a> "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (verse 2).<a name=580:16></a> Instead of proving your own weakness and failure you prove what is good and acceptable and perfect, and that is the will of God.<a name=580:17></a> It is in doing it that you prove it, you never prove anything until you do it.<a name=580:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Many people read their bibles, and see blessed things in Scripture, but they never prove anything because they do not step out on the path of doing them: it is then we prove them.<a name=581:1></a> I am speaking of elementary things because I have come to the conclusion that most of our defects lie at the foundation, we are weak there.<a name=581:2></a> Certain great principles have never been laid in our souls, and the result is we are spiritually weak and defective all through.<a name=581:3></a> We have to get in contact with these great spiritual realities which belong to us, our true portion, the things in which all our blessing consists.<a name=581:4></a> They are not things which do not belong to us; we are not trespassers when we take them up: we are taking up our divinely given property, our birthright.<a name=581:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Romans unfolds things that would bring about the renewing of the mind; it is the result of moral exercises brought about under the influence of grace.<a name=581:6></a> The character of divine grace is unfolded to us in this epistle: we do not get it so blessedly anywhere else.<a name=581:7></a> God would bring our minds under the influence of this blessed grace in which He has dealt and is dealing with us; and the result of that influence operating in our minds would be -- a complete renewal of our thoughts, discernments and judgments about everything we might have to do with.<a name=581:8></a> It is a mind that is not weak like the man's mind in chapter 7 which did not transform him.<a name=581:9></a> The renewed mind is an effective mind which is able to bring about that the man is transformed.<a name=581:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We might speak of an immense number of things in this epistle, but I want to call attention to five words which seem to me to concentrate the moral influences which God would bring to bear on us to renew our minds.<a name=581:11></a> They are: grace, support, power, purpose and compassion.<a name=581:12></a> A great many other words could be found to have an important place in the teaching of this epistle, but I should like to keep to these five words.<a name=581:13></a> They embody divine influence by which God would renew our minds; He would give us an entirely new ability to think, discern and estimate things.<a name=581:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=582>[Page 582]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first word is grace.<a name=582:1></a> God says, "we are .<a name=582:2></a>.<a name=582:3></a>.<a name=582:4></a> under grace"; it is a definite statement.<a name=582:5></a> "We are not under law but under grace" (chapter 6: 15).<a name=582:6></a> It is an immense influence.<a name=582:7></a> The grace of God is something we did not deserve at all, we did nothing for it.<a name=582:8></a> Everything that grace bestows -- and the epistle speaks of abundance of grace -- is, all the favour of God, bestowed by God without any claim, or merit, or reason on our side.<a name=582:9></a> We are justified freely by His grace, cleared from every charge, He has dismissed from His mind every accusation.<a name=582:10></a> He holds us clear, not a spot or stain, every accusing voice is silenced.<a name=582:11></a> What a blessed influence to be brought to bear on our minds, an entirely new impression of God, that He is dealing with us in grace because of what He is.<a name=582:12></a> We have peace with God because every question is settled; Christ is risen and He is our righteousness.<a name=582:13></a> None of us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ could be improved as to righteousness, because a risen Christ is our righteousness.<a name=582:14></a> Grace did it.<a name=582:15></a> Grace has given us that risen glorious Man in all His suitability to God, and to that resurrection world in which He has entered: He is our righteousness.<a name=582:16></a> How has it come to pass?<a name=582:17></a> Grace did it, and we have received abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness.<a name=582:18></a> God would influence us by it.<a name=582:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the second word is support.<a name=582:20></a> I connect this with chapter 7, where we are told that we have "been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God" (verse 4).<a name=582:21></a> The idea there is that instead of being linked up with law, which made continual demands and gave no support, we are put in relation to Christ, who is a perpetual source of support; and by His support He can make us fruitful to God.<a name=582:22></a> Instead of demand we have always a source of supply.<a name=582:23></a> Have we all got that sense?<a name=582:24></a> Many believers have a continual sense of demand, as if God required what they could not render, a sense of deficiency, that they cannot keep up to the mark.<a name=582:25></a> God would encourage us in the sense of

	<div class="paragraph">
		having a divine Person, One who has been raised from the dead, who can give us every conceivable support that we require; One we can count on who will never fail us.<a name=583:1></a> Instead of law making demands we have a Person who supplies everything, who is a continual source of enrichment and supply.<a name=583:2></a> And we can have His companionship too.<a name=583:3></a> God would bring us under the influence of all this: it is by these things He renews the mind.<a name=583:4></a> God gives us a new outlook, a new estimate, the discernment of mind in accordance with what He has presented to us in His grace.<a name=583:5></a> What a renewal of thoughts and discernments of the mind!<a name=583:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third word I spoke of was power.<a name=583:7></a> The Spirit indwells, and that we get in chapter 8.<a name=583:8></a> It is wonderful that the Spirit should be indwelling the saints, and that He should be there in the way of power.<a name=583:9></a> He is there to shed the love of God abroad in our hearts (chapter 5), and He is there to lead us into sonship, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, <i>these</i> are sons of God" (chapter 8: 14).<a name=583:10></a> But He has come in as power, so if "ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (chapter 8: 13).<a name=583:11></a> There is power to do it by the Spirit; the Spirit is life with a view to righteousness.<a name=583:12></a> I should like my own heart to be more engaged with the blessed realities of what grace has conferred.<a name=583:13></a>

		The last word I spoke of was compassion.<a name=584:4></a> The epistle does not end at chapter 8: we are brought there to touch purpose, glory and conformity to Christ, God's Son; and then the apostle turns aside, as we know, and speaks from chapters 9 to 11 on the line of sovereignty, God's absolute sovereignty; and he brings out the fact that all blessing for man must be the result of divine compassion.<a name=584:5></a> I do not think anything could so affect the mind as that.<a name=584:6></a> All the grace of God presented in Christ would be nothing to me as to true value if God had not had compassion on me.<a name=584:7></a> Every one of us is the subject of divine compassion or we should never have come into blessing at all.<a name=584:8></a> This gives one such a sense of absolute indebtedness to God, of being shut up to Him in His sovereign compassion: nothing else subdues the mind and heart.<a name=584:9></a> I have often said that the only one spoken of in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>as a worshipper is Jacob, and he was the man of all others who had to learn true divine sovereignty; it made him a worshipper.<a name=584:10></a> The end of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>is very like worship: the apostle after speaking of divine sovereign compassion breaks out in worship to God.<a name=584:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=594:3></a>C.<a name=594:4></a> Perhaps we might bring both thoughts into it.<a name=594:5></a> The Spirit does love, because the Spirit is God, and God is love, and we need not leave out that thought surely; but I should suppose that Paul was thinking of the love that the Spirit produces.<a name=594:6></a> A divine Person who is here and dwelling in the saints is a Person who loves and therefore is producing an animating cause for love in those in whom He dwells, and this chapter reminds us very definitely that christianity is a matter of persons, not a system of teaching as people think.<a name=594:7></a> All that has come to pass in divine working in the kingdom of God comes out in persons, and I have no doubt this chapter is to bring that out, for about forty persons are named here.<a name=594:8></a> Is it not very affecting that each saint is an extraordinary person?<a name=594:9></a> We used to hear a while ago about 'common people', but God does not have that kind of thing, every saint is of an extraordinary nature, he is part of the greater things that have come in through the death and ascension of Christ and the descent of the Spirit.<a name=594:10></a> The Lord said the Father would show Him greater things than these, and He is doing it at the present time -- much greater things than anything on earth yet known.<a name=594:11></a> He is showing them to the Son and the Son is showing them to us by the Spirit.<a name=594:12></a> Sometimes it is said the saints speak too much of themselves, but I have always found they do not think enough of themselves.<a name=594:13></a> The great object of Scripture is to show us how great we are as in Christ, and as indwelt by the Spirit.<a name=594:14></a> So no saint is lost in a crowd.<a name=594:15></a>
