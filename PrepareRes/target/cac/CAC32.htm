		C.A.<a name=3:1></a>C.<a name=3:2></a> This epistle is important for us, as giving the place the assembly has locally in the mind of God, and the great grace available for it in Christ.<a name=3:3></a> It also develops the dangers apt to manifest themselves, and the divine remedy for them.<a name=3:4></a> The object of the epistle is really to bring the saints locally into oneness of mind, and the joy of all that grace has conferred upon them as subjects of the work of God.<a name=3:5></a> This epistle is serviceable in a day of departure.<a name=3:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is a company of persons in each locality where there is divine speaking, where the things of God are spoken of in a suitable manner.<a name=6:4></a> That is what the apostle dwells on in the early verses in this chapter (verses 4 - 7); that is, they were fully furnished for divine speaking.<a name=6:5></a> It is not a company marked by silence, but by speaking, according to the resources provided, the grace in Christ Jesus that qualified them.<a name=6:6></a> Speaking supposes intelligence in both speaker and hearer.<a name=6:7></a> The "oracles" connect very much with it; if a man cannot speak as having the mind of God he should be silent in the assembly.<a name=6:8></a>

		In these verses you get the constitution of the assembly, and what qualifies it to function.<a name=6:9></a> It functions in virtue of the grace that God has given it in Christ Jesus; it provides for everything in the assembly.<a name=6:10></a> He is bringing it out to people who badly needed it (and <i>we</i> badly need it); they had quite got away from the constitution, for there were divisions and so on.<a name=6:11></a> It is a wonderful source of supply -- "word", "knowledge", "testimony" -- and all is to find expression in the assembly in a divine way.<a name=6:12></a> Is what is said really being said from a divine source, from the grace that is in Christ Jesus?<a name=6:13></a> Then some are too backward.<a name=6:14></a> Why cannot I speak in the assembly?<a name=6:15></a> Is there a shortage?<a name=6:16></a> Has God set the assembly going without sufficient to carry it on?<a name=6:17></a> Why cannot I have a supply from the Head?<a name=6:18></a> There is to be no exaltation of man in what is said, or in the way it is said.<a name=6:19></a> It is a new kind of speaking which carries the grace of a new kind of Man -- not Adam at all.<a name=6:20></a> Every brother should look for ability to draw from this resource.<a name=6:21></a> What I can do

		"Joined to the Lord" is a very striking expression -- "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit".<a name=64:1></a> Paul had spoken of the body as being "for the Lord" (verse 13); He has an exclusive right to it as over against any unclean association.<a name=64:2></a> Our bodies are members of Christ, which is a wonderful exaltation of the body; the mortal bodies of the saints are members of the anointed and exalted Man, and this is brought in to correct the debased filthiness of those who had recently come out of the corruption of the heathen world.<a name=64:3></a> And in this same connection Paul speaks of the individual believer as "joined to the Lord".<a name=64:4></a> It is evident that the marriage bond is in his mind; he would have each believer to know that he is in this bond with the Lord.<a name=64:5></a> As members of Christ the "body" conception is before us; our bodies are for the expression of Christ; but being joined to the Lord is the way by which we are brought into vital oneness, one Spirit with Him.<a name=64:6></a> I do not remember that the thought of being joined to <i>the Lord</i> is found in any other scripture, and it is presented as an individual matter.<a name=64:7></a> The people at Lydda and the Saron "turned to the Lord"; at Joppa "many believed on the Lord"; at Antioch "a great number believed and turned to the Lord".<a name=64:8></a> Barnabas exhorted all "with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord".<a name=64:9></a>

		We read that "a large crowd of people were added to the Lord".<a name=64:10></a> But something more intimate is suggested in being "joined to the Lord"; it is a personal bond entered into which is comparable to the marriage relation, and which results in spiritual oneness -- the individual is "one Spirit" with the One to whom he is joined.<a name=64:11></a> It is truly a wonderful thought.<a name=64:12></a>

		We get the truth of associations in chapter 10 before the Supper in chapter 11.<a name=81:4></a> It would seem that at Corinth there were some who could go into an idol temple and eat what was offered, doing it on the principle that the idol was nothing and that it did not make any difference if it was offered to idols.<a name=81:5></a> But the question of association comes in, and the apostle shows that they were really in communion with demons.<a name=81:6></a> God is very concerned about the associations of His people and not only about our personal conduct.<a name=81:7></a> It is a serious matter to be going on with something that, in principle, is evil.<a name=81:8></a> A recognition of the true character of christian fellowship would save us from that.<a name=81:9></a> The apostle brings out the only kind of association that is contemplated for Christians.<a name=81:10></a> They are linked up with the communion of the body and blood of Christ -- it is an exclusive fellowship.<a name=81:11></a> Nothing could be more exclusive than the thought of the body of Christ and the blood of Christ.<a name=81:12></a> If we are associated with that, it entirely precludes any other kind of association.<a name=81:13></a> It says, "Ye cannot drink the Lord's cup, and the cup of demons"; "ye cannot", that is the true principle of all associations.<a name=81:14></a> It is not that there is anything narrow about it, it is a far greater and richer fellowship than any other kind of fellowship.<a name=81:15></a> He would impress that on us by speaking of the blood first, which is not in the order of the Supper.<a name=81:16></a> "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of the Christ?<a name=81:17></a>" He has in mind to give us a sense of the wealthy character and wonderful blessing of the christian association.<a name=81:18></a> It is well for us to look at it and see that it is the cup of blessing.<a name=81:19></a> He supposes that all believers

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=89:1></a>C.<a name=89:2></a> It may be well just to say what we had before us on a previous occasion, namely the presentations in Mark's gospel and in Matthew's of the Lord's supper: the prominent feature in Mark is that the bread was to be taken, and in Matthew the prominent thought is that it was to be eaten; the thought of calling the Lord to mind does not have any place in these two gospels.<a name=89:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come to the account in Luke of what took place in the presence of the twelve apostles, and the account given to us by Paul, which he received from the Lord that he might give it to the gentile assemblies, the thought of remembrance or calling to mind is, I suppose, the prominent thought of the service.<a name=89:4></a> So that we come to that particular aspect of this precious subject this afternoon.<a name=89:5></a>

		Having given us the truth of headship in its bearing on order with regard to man and woman in their speaking to God or for God, and having given the Lord's institution of His supper as the rallying point of the assembly, the apostle takes up the subject of spiritual manifestations.<a name=110:1></a> He does not pursue the line of assembly worship towards the Lord or towards God: He makes no reference to the Lord taking His place in the midst of the assembly.<a name=110:2></a> I suppose the state of the Corinthians did not permit of any development on that line.<a name=110:3></a> The matter that was important to be considered next was the subject of spiritual manifestations as found in the assembly viewed as the one body here on earth.<a name=110:4></a> It is the body as the anointed vessel here, furnished with gifts for profit, all of which are operated by one and the same Spirit.<a name=110:5></a> This is a universal thought, which is made known to us that we may understand what has come to pass in the wisdom and power of God.<a name=110:6></a> It extends far beyond Corinth, for it took in at that time all saints on earth who had come under the baptism of the one Spirit.<a name=110:7></a> This delivers us at once from any thought of independency, for how can any member of one body be independent of the other members?<a name=110:8></a> They must all work together in unity, and this applies particularly to the gifts, services and operations that go on in the body.<a name=110:9></a> He does not go into the deeper and more spiritual aspects of the truth of the one body as seen in Colossians and Ephesians where the body is for the display of the graces of the heavenly Man.<a name=110:10></a> Here it is the gifts and services and operations that are profitable to the saints.<a name=110:11></a> A divine wealth has been conferred which results in a great variety of contribution, all having its source in one Spirit, and therefore all operating in perfect unity.<a name=110:12></a> This was something quite different from anything they had known in the world.<a name=110:13></a>

		(chapter 7: 1).<a name=115:1></a> Man, as to his body, was indeed this; he was "fearfully, wonderfully made", "curiously wrought", and all his members were written in God's book "when as yet there was none of them" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#139:14">Psalm  139:14</a> - 16).<a name=115:2></a> The members of the human body were the subject of divine counsel, and were written in God's book before they were formed by His hand out of the dust of the ground.<a name=115:3></a> Dust was the material out of which they were made, but the design was in God's book before they were formed.<a name=115:4></a> He worked in divine skill to form what He had planned long before, and as He formed the body of Adam we may be sure that He had in mind that one body which would in due time be the result of the baptising of the Spirit.<a name=115:5></a> In that body there is the most perfect balance and proportion.<a name=115:6></a> It cannot be improved upon; each member is necessary and is in its place; no one member can take the place of another.<a name=115:7></a> The foot may be foolish enough to say, "Because I am not a hand I am not of the body"; so is God having in mind that certain members would be discontented with the place assigned to them and might cease to function bodywise because they thought some other member had a more favoured place?<a name=115:8></a> But it is of God that there should be different members, and the Spirit has made no mistake in the place and function which He has given to each.<a name=115:9></a> Each is needed, and God on His own behalf has set each of the members in the body as it has pleased Him.<a name=115:10></a> The body is the great result, the sum total; no one member is independent of any other member.<a name=115:11></a>

		But then another truth comes out, that certain members of the body seem to be weaker; but they are necessary!<a name=115:12></a> And certain parts we esteem to be less honourable, but these we clothe with more abundant honour -- a striking and significant suggestion, for it is suggested that clothing implies honour.<a name=115:13></a> It seems to me that the clothing as applied to the less honourable members would be put on the saints by the ministry of what is eternal or that which is perfect.<a name=115:14></a> The gifts which characterise the members are time gifts; not

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now while all this refers to the human body it is, of course, intended to have its application to Christ's body.<a name=116:12></a> So the apostle concludes the subject by saying, "Now ye are Christ's body, and members in particular".<a name=116:13></a> The one Spirit coming into manifestation in the saints in Corinth, and in every locality, so one is exercised to be a member in whom and by whom spiritual operations go on.<a name=116:14></a> It is easy to see that this would practically exclude the flesh and the natural mind of man and would really prepare us for chapter 13.<a name=116:15></a>

		The apostle seems to have reserved to the last the most serious thing at Corinth, the denial of the resurrection.<a name=127:1></a> The other things were inconsistent with the truth but this was the sweeping away of the truth altogether.<a name=127:2></a> Everything was gone if Christ was not risen; the whole thing was a lie that had been preached to them from beginning to end.<a name=127:3></a> The idea of the enemy is to limit everything to the earth and the present time.<a name=127:4></a> This was the error of the Sadducees come in -- rationalism.<a name=127:5></a> The error of the Pharisees was a religious error.<a name=127:6></a> What the devil had brought in from the beginning resulted in death on man and so now he would bring in the denial of the resurrection.<a name=127:7></a> Nothing could put away sin but death, and nothing could remove death but resurrection.<a name=127:8></a> Paul had received this gospel from the glory; he had it direct from Christ in heaven and what he had received was that Christ had died for sins and that He had been buried, etc.<a name=127:9></a> If instead of reasoning out things we bring Christ in we should be put right at once.<a name=127:10></a> The simple might not be able to explain things but if he has the unction he has the sense that he is right.<a name=127:11></a> God is allowing His people to be tested today by the most pernicious errors.<a name=127:12></a> The Old Testament saints died in the consciousness that God would not be baffled.<a name=127:13></a> This chapter shows that God is really victorious and will be.<a name=127:14></a> We are not very familiar with resurrection power ourselves.<a name=127:15></a> The point is really to be in the consciousness of present victory.<a name=127:16></a> The enemy has succeeded in putting away the truth of resurrection.<a name=127:17></a> Resurrection puts us outside the course of things here altogether.<a name=127:18></a> Where Christ is carries the whole position of where His own are -- all that belongs to Him.<a name=127:19></a> Where Christ is is the important thing and settles the whole matter if I love Him.<a name=127:20></a> I think the common idea is that death is somewhere between God and us; you go through death,

		and there at the other side is God; but there is no longer the distance of death between us and God.<a name=128:1></a> Someone has said that Bunyan put the river in the wrong place; he ought to have had it near where the burden rolled off instead of at the end of the journey.<a name=128:2></a> We can be with God outside death altogether and that because Christ has died and risen.<a name=128:3></a> J.<a name=128:4></a>B.<a name=128:5></a>S.<a name=128:6></a> said, speaking of his departure not long before, that his thought of it was that he should be very happy with the Lord and all at once he would find himself with Him.<a name=128:7></a> It is really in the company of a living One that we taste life; it is as being in the company of the Lord that we are happy.<a name=128:8></a> There must be a transaction between the soul and Christ; it is not simply that it is something you hear and believe.<a name=128:9></a> To these individuals it was a distinct manifestation.<a name=128:10></a> What Paul could say was that Christ had possession of him.<a name=128:11></a> As to the things of christianity we are often like children looking into the shop windows and desiring to have, and stop there.<a name=128:12></a> If God gives us desires, He wants them to be satisfied.<a name=128:13></a> I think the actual journey to resurrection is a great reality to us.<a name=128:14></a> There is the attraction of Christ and there is the death side to learn too.<a name=128:15></a> The discipline of God comes in to help us, and there are the yearnings of life.<a name=128:16></a> This is a death scene.<a name=128:17></a> God presents everything that is beautiful and attractive to us.<a name=128:18></a> I am sure if we paid more attention to God we should get on better.<a name=128:19></a> He tells us most blessed things if we would only listen to Him.<a name=128:20></a> If Israel had hearkened to the word it would have been their salvation.<a name=128:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=129:3></a>C.<a name=129:4></a> I suppose the apostle with the spirit of wisdom left the most serious matter to the end of his letter.<a name=129:5></a> If there is no resurrection there is nothing!<a name=129:6></a> It sweeps away the whole fabric of christianity at once.<a name=129:7></a> It is well to keep in mind what we have often noticed in the epistle, that the object of the apostle was to produce spirituality in these children of his at Corinth.<a name=129:8></a> They had received the gospel, but were very unspiritual.<a name=129:9></a> They were gratifying the flesh in many different ways, so he brings forward one thing after another to bring about more spiritual conditions -- a matter which all Christians should carefully consider -- and there is nothing that would produce spirituality more than resurrection.<a name=129:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=129:11></a> The Spirit was given consequent on Christ being risen and ascended.<a name=129:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=129:13></a>C.<a name=129:14></a> It is important perhaps to notice the subject is confined to believers in this chapter.<a name=129:15></a> It is not a general teaching on the resurrection; the wicked dead are not once mentioned, unbelievers do not come into it.<a name=129:16></a> We know they will be raised to the resurrection of judgment.<a name=129:17></a> There is no allusion to that; it is the resurrection of Christ as bearing on believers.<a name=129:18></a>

		SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 15 - 45
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle would not have had much to say if he had not brought in the resurrection in his preaching.<a name=136:1></a> It is important for one to have his feet planted on the rock of resurrection.<a name=136:2></a> This was a special attack of the enemy and not the state of the Corinthians that made him write like this.<a name=136:3></a> There was an activity of mind at Corinth that laid them open to questions and carnal reasonings.<a name=136:4></a> The important thing is that resurrection is the sphere of God's working at the present time.<a name=136:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#150:1">Psalm  150:1</a> there are two things: "Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power".<a name=136:6></a> 1 Corinthians is the firmament of His power, and 2 Corinthians is the sanctuary.<a name=136:7></a> The first epistle (resurrection) is all the power of God.<a name=136:8></a> 1 Corinthians is the foundation epistle and 2 Corinthians is the superstructure.<a name=136:9></a> Where Christ is determines everything for God and for faith.<a name=136:10></a> If Christ was accepted here and honoured after the flesh, this would be the place for God.<a name=136:11></a> The resurrection sphere is the sphere where God is working, and there is no knowledge of God anywhere else.<a name=136:12></a> He is the God who raised up Jesus from the dead.<a name=136:13></a> Abraham knew Him as the God of resurrection; it is very wonderful.<a name=136:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The enemy has brought in sins, and in that way death has ruined the old creation, and God has a new creation.<a name=136:15></a> I think the aim of the enemy is to try and make it out that God is in relation to this scene of evil.<a name=136:16></a> Faith knowing God cannot possibly connect God with the present state of things, so Enoch walked with God, and death could not touch him.<a name=136:17></a> Enoch is the first example of eternal life in Scripture.<a name=136:18></a> God would not let two men die (Enoch and Elijah), showing that He was superior to death and He could make a man superior to death.<a name=136:19></a> Now we see the Lord Jesus Christ superior to death.<a name=136:20></a> God shows us a scene that never can be

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=139:1></a>C.<a name=139:2></a> The apostle reasons in the first part of the chapter on the importance of Christ's resurrection, and he shows that if Christ was not risen, all he had preached to them was nothing, and they had gained nothing by believing it.<a name=139:3></a> But if Christ had been raised, it was the proof that dead persons could be raised.<a name=139:4></a> If one man was raised, it was the proof that dead persons could be raised.<a name=139:5></a> It is most wonderful that Christ has been found among the dead; and He has been found there that He might be the first-fruits in resurrection.<a name=139:6></a>

		A question having been raised as to the propriety of the custom of having a collection when the Lord's supper is eaten, it is well that we should see how Scripture presents the subject of the saints' giving.<a name=176:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the earliest day of the assembly, the breaking of bread and prayers were accompanied by a distribution "according as any one might have need" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:45">Acts  2:45</a>).<a name=176:2></a> The unity of heart and soul which marked the multitude of believers was evidenced by the great grace in which they were ready to give.<a name=176:3></a> There was a divine administration of spiritual wealth through the apostles, and a corresponding answer in what the saints freely laid at their feet (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:32">Acts  4:32</a> - 37).<a name=176:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit has called our attention to this as a primary feature of the assembly -- one might say, a constitutional feature of it.<a name=176:5></a> There is no intimation that it was enjoined by apostolic authority.<a name=176:6></a> It was entirely spontaneous: the practical evidence that the new commandment governed the assembly.<a name=176:7></a> They loved one another as the Son of God had loved them (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:34">John  13:34</a>, 35), and were thus known to be disciples of His.<a name=176:8></a> The thing true in Him had become true in them (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:8">1 John  2:8</a>).<a name=176:9></a> How precious this must have been to Him who had given Himself in order to secure a company who should love one another as He had loved them!<a name=176:10></a>

		When they were in the land, the inheritance bestowed in the love of God upon His chosen and called people yielded wealth for tithes, for offerings, for gifts to those "treasuries" which had so definite a place in the house of Jehovah (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28:11">1 Chronicles  28:11</a>, 12).<a name=177:4></a> It was the divine giving echoed back by a willing-hearted people.<a name=177:5></a> The Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, the widow were all to be thought of and cared for, as we see repeatedly in Deuteronomy.<a name=177:6></a> It was the evidence that Jehovah Himself had the place which He loved in the affections of His people, and that His own blessed character was reproduced in them.<a name=177:7></a>

		Assembly giving cannot be separated from its blessed Source in the giving of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=177:8></a> There could not be any disparity, or incongruity in character, between the love that gives in divine Persons and the love which that love begets in the children of God, and which prompts their giving.<a name=177:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of all this was realised in the assembly at Jerusalem, and it is to be sorrowfully noted that the first manifestation of the working of evil in the assembly was the attempt to have credit for devotedness of this kind when the reality of it was not in the heart.<a name=177:10></a> And the first difficulty which arose in the assembly was in connection with the ministration of that bounty which the love of the disciples made available -- a ministration which needed men "full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:3">Acts  6:3</a>).<a name=177:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then when James and Cephas and John gave Paul and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship in their going to the nations, they desired that a similar grace should be found amongst gentile believers; "only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:10">Galatians  2:10</a>).<a name=177:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to the saints in Rome, Paul speaks of the contribution of Macedonia and Achaia for the poor in Jerusalem as a matter of righteousness: "They are their debtors" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:27">Romans  15:27</a>).<a name=178:2></a> And to the Corinthians he claims as a "right" that those that announce the glad tidings should "live of the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:14">1 Corinthians  9:14</a>), though he is careful to say that personally he had not used that right.<a name=178:3></a> Both in Romans and in I Corinthians the righteous claim is insisted on, and in 1 Corinthians definite direction is given as to it being rendered.<a name=178:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noticeable that it is not said precisely when the contributions of the saints should be put together.<a name=178:5></a> This is left to be determined by the spiritual intelligence of the saints.<a name=178:6></a> In keeping with this the choice of deacons (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>) and of those who should carry the bounty of the saints (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:3">1 Corinthians  16:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:19">2 Corinthians  8:19</a>, 23) was left to those whose bounty was to be administered.<a name=178:7></a> The Lord would leave it in the hands of those whose love was expressed in it; they could be trusted to act suitably as to detail without precise commandments.<a name=178:8></a>

		But Paul does speak definitely of each putting by at home, "laying up in whatever degree he may have prospered", and this "on the first of the week".<a name=178:9></a> He links the exercise as to giving with "the first of the week", and thus with all that that day would speak of to a spiritual mind.<a name=178:10></a> There is no hint as to what proportion of one's income should be put by.<a name=178:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#18">Numbers  18</a>there is a tithe from all Israel for the children of Levi, but in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#12">Deuteronomy  12</a>and 14 there is a second tithe to be eaten before Jehovah in the place which He would choose, and there is even a third tithe mentioned in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#14:28">Deuteronomy  14:28</a>, 29.<a name=178:12></a> This would indicate that with increased prosperity in the land there would be an enlarged outlet for the affections of the people

		It is well that we should regard this exercise as to putting by at home on the first of the week.<a name=179:6></a> It would provide a ready and dedicated fund which could be drawn from, whether for contributing to the collection of assembly character, or for needs that might present themselves to us individually.<a name=179:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not until 2 Corinthians that the subject is put on its true spiritual basis; then the apostle's heart was set free to write to a self-judged company who had cleared themselves of evil.<a name=179:8></a> He would not only speak to such a company of the ministry of the new covenant and of reconciliation, but he would make known "the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:1">2 Corinthians  8:1</a>).<a name=179:9></a> He would speak of this as not unworthy to be dwelt upon in great detail alongside with the glorious subjects of his spiritual ministry.<a name=179:10></a> It was, indeed, the fruit in the saints of that ministry, and was in correspondence with it -- the grace and actings of divine Persons characterising assemblies of saints who had been "transformed according to the same image" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>).<a name=179:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		this touching reference.<a name=180:1></a> The inward and spiritual went far beyond what was material.<a name=180:2></a> "Beyond their power, they were willing of their own accord, begging of us with much entreaty to give effect to the grace and fellowship of the service".<a name=180:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not that Paul had entreated them to give, but they had entreated that they might be permitted "the grace and fellowship of the service".<a name=180:4></a> They were not abundant in carnal things; on that side it was "deep poverty"; but they were abundant in joy and in the riches of free-hearted liberality, and in the grace and fellowship of service to the saints.<a name=180:5></a> Indeed, they had given themselves first to the Lord and to Paul and those with him by God's will.<a name=180:6></a> There had been complete self-dedication, and "this grace also" of giving abounded as a result; it proved the genuineness of love; it was the evidence of the presence of elements of a profoundly spiritual character.<a name=180:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noticeable how the apostle puts the whole subject in these chapters on a most elevated plane.<a name=180:8></a> The action of divine Persons is presented as the model, and nothing can be more spiritual than that.<a name=180:9></a> Think of the moving strength of such an appeal as this!<a name=180:10></a> "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that ye by his poverty might be enriched".<a name=180:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then he concludes his appeal by saying, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9:15">2 Corinthians  9:15</a>).<a name=180:12></a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, God's unspeakable free giving, and the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies are linked together in a very blessed way, as having the same precious character, and in perfect harmony one with another.<a name=180:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of giving in the saints is the evidence of their having been "transformed according to the same image".<a name=180:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How delightful is this to the blessed God, and to His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ!<a name=180:15></a> The primary and cherished thought of God has been realised: men are in God's image, after His likeness.<a name=180:16></a> It comes out, truly, in things that are "according to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be that the Lord intends to give us a much more exalted and spiritual conception of the whole subject of giving, and to show us that it is characteristic of God's assembly -- part of the very constitution of that assembly -- because it is characteristic of the blessed God Himself, and is therefore a peculiar delight to Him as manifested in His saints.<a name=181:2></a> It is not the amount of what we give that has value -- that would be a carnal estimate of it -- but the "spirit of blessing" in which it is given, rendering it delightful to God as being according to what He is Himself.<a name=181:3></a> The widow's two mites probably represented a greater devotion of heart than the munificent gifts of Solomon at the dedication of the temple.<a name=181:4></a> It is not the amount of our contributions that give them value, but the state of heart of which they speak to the Lord.<a name=181:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we may note how spiritual are the elements which appear in those who have to do with this matter.<a name=181:6></a> God is thanked for giving diligent zeal as to it in the heart of Titus.<a name=181:7></a> A "brother whose praise is in the glad tidings through all the assemblies" is "chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself".<a name=181:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking that one peculiarly esteemed in connection with his setting forth of the glad tidings should be chosen by the assemblies for this service.<a name=181:9></a> It seems to suggest that the one who could well set forth the grace of God to men was best fitted to carry the expression of His grace in men.<a name=181:10></a> It shows how the assemblies in that early day linked together the grace set forth in divine Persons with the grace bestowed in the assemblies.<a name=181:11></a> It was, indeed, the same grace, but peculiarly sweet as seen produced in men, through divine working, who had shortly before been so far from God.<a name=181:12></a> Hence "the glory of the Lord himself" was secured by

		it; the brethren who were entrusted with the service of it were "deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory".<a name=182:1></a> It is all put on a most elevated spiritual plane.<a name=182:2></a> It may be that sometimes "the collection" is looked at as a mere matter of pounds, shillings and pence, and as having to do with meeting righteous obligations of various kinds.<a name=182:3></a> It is true that obligations have to be met, but even these have to be met according to the dignity of an assembly which is God's assembly, and which is passing through this world in the spirit of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#2:28">Deuteronomy  2:28</a>, declining to be indebted for favours to anyone here; discharging all that is due; owing no man anything.<a name=182:4></a> But assembly giving must not be disconnected in the mind from all that is the true spring of it, or it may become to us carnal rather than spiritual.<a name=182:5></a> It would then have no longer the character of the grace of God bestowed, or the expression of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; it would lose all that is rightly connected with it as a manifestation of "Christ's glory".<a name=182:6></a> It might then be felt that there was something incongruous between the Supper and the collection.<a name=182:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this connection the quotation from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#112">Psalm  112</a>is very illuminating (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9:9">2 Corinthians  9:9</a>), for in that psalm we see stated of the man that fears Jehovah the same things as are said of Jehovah Himself in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111">Psalm  111</a>.<a name=182:8></a> It is God expressed in His people, and hence their "free-hearted liberality .<a name=182:9></a>.<a name=182:10></a>.<a name=182:11></a> works through us thanksgiving to God.<a name=182:12></a> Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9:11">2 Corinthians  9:11</a> - 14).<a name=182:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What flows out of the affections of the saints as divinely taught is of the same order and character as the grace which has flowed out of the heart of Christ and out of the heart of God.<a name=183:6></a> I think the Lord would elevate our thoughts as to it more to the level of His own.<a name=183:7></a> In presenting His own love and the love of God to us He would not exclude our love; He would rather call it into lively activity.<a name=183:8></a> What would the Supper be to Him if the affections of His saints were excluded from it?<a name=183:9></a> Is it not His peculiar portion to have those affections, and to see them flowing in warmth and freshness amongst His own and to one another?<a name=183:10></a>

		The firmly attaching to Christ may be illustrated by what happened when He was here.<a name=193:2></a> The gospels show us a number of men and women who were not loose hangers-on; there were sometimes crowds of people who professed faith in Him, but they were not firmly attached to Him; they drifted off and walked no more with Him when certain features of the truth came out.<a name=193:3></a> Some loved glory from men rather than glory from God.<a name=193:4></a> But there were some of whom the Lord could say, "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:12">John  17:12</a>).<a name=193:5></a> Not one whom God has firmly attached to Christ will ever be detached from Him.<a name=193:6></a> There might be some amongst them at Corinth who had never been thus attached, as there are many in the christian profession generally, but Paul has in mind here what God had done.<a name=193:7></a> He is occupied with the positive, and for the moment with that only.<a name=193:8></a>

		The subject of giving occupies such a large place because it is the practical exhibition of the truth of the one body.<a name=238:1></a> It was of great satisfaction to the apostle that the Gentiles ministered to the poor Jews -- it showed a practical binding together.<a name=238:2></a> He had besought them not to receive the grace of God in vain, and had said also, "Corinthians, our heart is expanded .<a name=238:3></a>.<a name=238:4></a>.<a name=238:5></a>, let your heart also expand itself" (chapter 6: 11, 13), and now he could speak of the grace that had shown itself in a very practical way.<a name=238:6></a> It is the character of God coming out in the saints.<a name=238:7></a> God's character is that of a giver.<a name=238:8></a> If you can become poor even in money to the enriching of others it seems to me it is on the line of what God is and of what Christ is (see verse 9).<a name=238:9></a> That makes the subject important.<a name=238:10></a>

		God is bringing out His own testimony in men "for glory to God by us" (chapter 1: 20); and there is a circle where divine affections can have their outflow; the saints were not to be narrowed up to themselves, but to widen out to other saints -- the wide circle of Christ's interests.<a name=238:11></a> There are two sides of expansion.<a name=238:12></a> First, separation from what is outside, and then, inside, the outflow of grace and liberality.<a name=238:13></a> I do not think the apostle was anxious as to himself; even with the Philippians, he desired that fruit might abound to their account.<a name=238:14></a> The two things that characterise the saints are separation from the world which rejected Christ, and then their love for one another; they are bound together in holy love.<a name=238:15></a> Separation in itself would be a poor, cold thing; there must be these exercises of divine affections.<a name=238:16></a> We need to have the practical character of christianity before us, for we are in danger of being theoretical.<a name=238:17></a> This is a remarkable bringing together of things in verse 2: trial of affliction, abundance of joy, deep poverty, riches of liberality; you

		The way Paul speaks of himself as "a man in Christ" is most instructive, for it shows how a saint can be abstracted in his mind from everything that he is naturally, and can be conscious of what he is as in Christ without anything else being present to his consciousness for a certain period of time, his body even being no hindrance, for he was not conscious of his body at all; he did not know whether he was in it or out of it.<a name=242:1></a> Paul was, for the time, taken out of his responsible existence, but not taken out of the consciousness of being in Christ.<a name=242:2></a> As having this consciousness he was caught up to the third heaven, which in itself is deeply interesting as showing that there are three heavens.<a name=242:3></a> The tabernacle was the representation and shadow of heavenly things, the figurative representation of things in the heavens, and it had three distinct parts.<a name=242:4></a> Our great High Priest has passed through the heavens.<a name=242:5></a> These are the heavens of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>where the sun, moon and stars are set, and there is a heaven where the sun, moon and stars are set, and there is a heaven where angels are, both good and evil, and from which Satan will be cast out.<a name=242:6></a> Then there is a third heaven where the immediate presence of God is, and that is the place which God has prepared for man in Christ.<a name=242:7></a>

		Though addressed to saints in Ephesus, there is nothing in the epistle to localise it, save that Gentiles are particularly in the mind of the writer.<a name=257:1></a> It was probably carried by Tychicus at the same time as he brought the epistle to the Colossians, but was intended to set forth the whole counsel of God in its bearing on saints from among the Gentiles, so that it has a very general character.<a name=257:2></a> The opening of the epistle makes this clear.<a name=257:3></a>

		The blessing now is spiritual and it is heavenly.<a name=257:4></a> What is spiritual connects with the fact that God is a Spirit, and also with the fact that there are those who are born of the Spirit and indwelt by the Spirit.<a name=257:5></a> Such have capacity for what is spiritual.<a name=257:6></a> Then blessings are heavenly because Christ is in heaven and they are in Him who is there.<a name=257:7></a> And what is there is linked on with God's eternal purpose in Christ.<a name=257:8></a> In purpose He was viewed as Man, and the saints were chosen in Him.<a name=257:9></a> There was the thought in the mind of God before the first man existed of men being blessed in Christ and brought into accord with God in nature.<a name=257:10></a> "Holy and blameless before him in love" is a nature suitable to God.<a name=257:11></a> This comes first; the position and dignity in which God may set us comes second.<a name=257:12></a> Sonship through Jesus Christ shows the speciality and distinction which it suits the good pleasure of God's will to confer upon His saints.<a name=257:13></a> It is the glory of His grace -- the transcendent excellence of it.<a name=257:14></a> It is "in the Beloved"; that is, in Christ as in heaven, glorified.<a name=257:15></a> It is sonship suitable to heaven and to the love which rests upon Christ there.<a name=257:16></a> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ chose that it should be so: all His saints are in that favour.<a name=257:17></a> We find the expression repeatedly, "To the praise", showing that the end in view is that saints of the assembly should take up the glory of grace in their praises.<a name=257:18></a>

		As far as our side is concerned, we need redemption, which settles every moral question -- the riches of God's grace coming out in the forgiveness of offences.<a name=258:1></a> Whatever offences there had been, they are forgiven; they become an occasion for love according to verse 7 -- "Through his blood".<a name=258:2></a> It is forgiveness on the ground that the life of Christ here has been poured out that we might be with God in the value of it and in this way know the riches of His grace, so that in spite of our past we can share with Christ in the inheritance, which is all that comes unto us to the praise of God's glory.<a name=258:3></a> He has marked us out for inheritance, and this calls for intelligence as to administration.<a name=258:4></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:20">Ephesians  2:20</a> - 22 it is not a question exactly of who builds, but of the character of the building and the object in view.<a name=288:1></a> It is also important to notice that it is a present structure brought into being in conditions of responsibility, because it is in Jesus Christ, and in the Lord, and in the Spirit.<a name=288:2></a> It is also contrasted with the former state of being "strangers and foreigners".<a name=288:3></a> It is what we are brought into here and now, the apostles and prophets being men who have lived and laboured in this world, and who have become the foundation of what stands here for God.<a name=288:4></a> That building is distinguished by its corner-stone.<a name=288:5></a> One Person is pre-eminent there in contrast with every other.<a name=288:6></a> It is Jesus Christ the Man of divine pleasure -- each saint contributes something to set Him forth, for Jesus Christ is to be recognised as in us, as the result of Christ speaking in some one.<a name=288:7></a> If Jesus Christ is not in us we are reprobates, i.<a name=288:8></a>e.<a name=288:9></a> we are worthless for God (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13">2 Corinthians  13</a>).<a name=288:10></a> Jesus Christ being in us involves that we are able to move in His life morally as set forth in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=288:11></a> There is a vast company here on earth in whom Jesus Christ is thus made prominent, and in all the spiritual activities of the company, in all ministry, He is the pre-eminent One as the great Adornment of the structure.<a name=288:12></a> And it is in Him the whole building is fitted together; i.<a name=288:13></a>e.<a name=288:14></a> it is in the features and characteristics of that Man.<a name=288:15></a>

		From the Corinthian point of view, Jesus Christ is the foundation, and each one who builds on it must be careful to build what is in keeping with it.<a name=288:16></a> He must build what has spiritual value before God.<a name=288:17></a> Corrupting the temple would be by false teaching or in making prominent the man after the flesh.<a name=288:18></a>

		NOTES OF AN ADDRESS @EPHESIANS 2: 13 - 18; @EPHESIANS 3: 14 - 21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak of two things, the calling of God and the state that is suited to it.<a name=290:1></a> First, the wonderful calling with which we are called.<a name=290:2></a> In the mind of God it is His blessed purpose and pleasure and delight that we should know what His calling is.<a name=290:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The only part of it I would now speak of is "access .<a name=290:4></a>.<a name=290:5></a>.<a name=290:6></a> to the Father".<a name=290:7></a> "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".<a name=290:8></a> It is a most wonderful thing, beloved brethren, because it is very evident that we could not have access to the Father if He had not made Himself fully known, and, on the other hand, we could not have access to Him if we were not suitable to Him.<a name=290:9></a> Now what a blessed thought it is that the Father has told Himself out, for there is not a single thing in the heart of the Father that has not been fully expressed; it has all come out in the Son of His love.<a name=290:10></a> And, beloved brethren, it is really in the company of Christ that we know the Father.<a name=290:11></a> It is a wonderful thing that we should know the Father by being in the company of the Son.<a name=290:12></a> The Lord says to Philip, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip?<a name=290:13></a> He that has seen me has seen the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>).<a name=290:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is the place to learn the Father, because in the assembly we are in the company of the Son, and He makes known the Father's name.<a name=290:15></a> Now, beloved brethren, what a circle of love!<a name=290:16></a> It is necessary that we should be completely outside of the flesh.<a name=290:17></a> There are lots of believers who are not clear in the presence of the Father; they cannot get free from the thought of their imperfection, they are always under a cloud.<a name=290:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot get into the presence of the Father except as deriving from Christ.<a name=290:19></a> We are not there as children of Adam at all, and we are free to enter into a sphere where there is

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=291>[Page 291]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		no imperfection.<a name=291:1></a> The calling is that we should have access to the Father.<a name=291:2></a> There is a blessed circle into which our hearts can come, conducted into it by the Son.<a name=291:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is worship?<a name=291:4></a> Our appreciation of the Father, that is what it is.<a name=291:5></a> And our appreciation of a divine Person must be adoration.<a name=291:6></a> We enter into it by the Spirit.<a name=291:7></a> It is a scene of ineffable love, and there is no room in it for anything but adoration.<a name=291:8></a> There is nothing less than that in the Father's heart for every one of us.<a name=291:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get the state of the calling in chapter 3, the state which qualifies us to enter into the calling.<a name=291:10></a> We could not possibly enter into such a calling without a divine state.<a name=291:11></a> If I am to know the Father it must be by the Spirit of the Father.<a name=291:12></a> "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts", that blessed Person occupying our hearts.<a name=291:13></a> He has been everything to God, He has filled the heart of God.<a name=291:14></a> The thought is that the One who fills the heart of God fills the heart of the saint; that is, He has His place there.<a name=291:15></a> Everything else has gone out of the believer's heart but Christ, and the result is that we being "rooted and founded in love .<a name=291:16></a>.<a name=291:17></a>.<a name=291:18></a> may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge".<a name=291:19></a> It is a great thing that in the assembly we are brought to know the calling of the Father, to enter into it -- this wonderful calling!<a name=291:20></a> -- that we should have "access .<a name=291:21></a>.<a name=291:22></a>.<a name=291:23></a> to the Father".<a name=291:24></a> And that we should be suitable to it, that Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith, Christ filling the vision of our souls.<a name=291:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us see that we do not despise the pleasant land.<a name=291:26></a> We shall fall in the wilderness if we do not go in for the calling of God; we shall miss the present thought of the Father's heart.<a name=291:27></a> We shall have it by and by but we could miss it now.<a name=291:28></a> It is a question of going in for it and of getting on our knees about it.<a name=291:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=293:6></a>C.<a name=293:7></a> Well, I suppose the whole character of the mystery would come out in the way that the saints approach God, because the object is that principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might learn through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God.<a name=293:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=293:9></a> It is the working out of the mystery He had in mind.<a name=293:10></a>

		C.A.<a name=293:11></a>C.<a name=293:12></a> Yes, I think the working of it out is in the actual coming together of the saints.<a name=293:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=293:14></a> Do you refer to the order seen in the assembly?<a name=293:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=293:16></a>C.<a name=293:17></a> Yes, I thought so, and the intelligence of the assembly is seen in the access to God.<a name=293:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=293:19></a> This boldness corresponds with John's epistle where love emboldens.<a name=293:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=293:21></a>C.<a name=293:22></a> Yes, "boldness and access in confidence" go together, the wonderful system of approach to God being set up according to the truth of the mystery, and set up for the instruction of principalities and authorities.<a name=293:23></a> We refer sometimes to the assembly as an august company.<a name=293:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=293:25></a> If the unbeliever is impressed at the ministry meeting at the divine presence, how much more the principalities and authorities would be impressed by this.<a name=293:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=293:27></a>C.<a name=293:28></a> They would be impressed to see creatures, who are far inferior to them in point of creature glory, so superior in point of intelligence and access to God, and would see the all-various wisdom of God in it; that should come out in the assembly, I think.<a name=293:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=294:4></a>C.<a name=294:5></a> I think it means "all things".<a name=294:6></a> The wonderful thing is that the assembly has a kind of central place in the "all things".<a name=294:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=294:10></a>C.<a name=294:11></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=294:12></a> It is the deepest expression of the wisdom of God.<a name=294:13></a> There is nothing like it in heaven or on earth; and to think of that coming out intelligently in the assembly in expression and utterances by men that the angelic host can take account of intelligently!<a name=294:14></a> They can only take note of it as it comes under their notice in human beings.<a name=294:15></a> It gives a wonderful idea of the assembly as convened and lifts us out of human thoughts altogether.<a name=294:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One feels the greatness of it, if there is ability to express to God all that is in His mind and heart.<a name=294:17></a> Eating the Lord's supper is not the end of our coming together.<a name=294:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=294:21></a>C.<a name=294:22></a> Well, is it not the beginning?<a name=294:23></a> It claims the attention of the youngest and feeblest believer and sometimes they think it is the end to be reached in itself, but it is the beginning.<a name=294:24></a> The all-various wisdom of God coming out in the assembly and being given expression to there is the main thing, is it not?<a name=294:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=294:29></a>C.<a name=294:30></a> That is true; we are so slow to take up the service of God in the true character of it.<a name=294:31></a> We not only take up the service of praising God, but are to say why we praise, so that the principalities and authorities in the heavens listen with wonder.<a name=294:32></a> That is something to covet.<a name=294:33></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=295:2></a>C.<a name=295:3></a> Well, the epistle clearly takes account of the former condition, and Scripture takes account of redemption.<a name=295:4></a> Everything that God does is based on redemption.<a name=295:5></a> It indicates that there has been a state contrary to God; but He works in a scene of death and the saints are quickened, raised and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=295:6></a> That is God's working.<a name=295:7></a> And God's thought comes out in Jew and Gentile being set together, showing that there is a former status that was contrary.<a name=295:8></a> We should not know God at all if not conscious that a state of sin and death had come in.<a name=295:9></a> We could not worship without it.<a name=295:10></a> "Boldness and access in confidence" all seems to suggest that once it was not so.<a name=295:11></a> But now by the faith of Christ, "by the faith of him", we have boldness and access in confidence, so that we must have Christ before us in order to have any liberty.<a name=295:12></a> So I suppose that is why the Supper is the first thing, as it suggests Christ to us and gives us to feed upon Christ.<a name=295:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=295:14></a> So that the object of this prayer is "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".<a name=295:15></a>

		C.A.<a name=295:16></a>C.<a name=295:17></a> Yes, I think it is most important as the condition for worship.<a name=295:18></a> The prayer really gives the state in the saints that is essential for worship.<a name=295:19></a>

		Ques.<a name=295:20></a> I would like to ask in connection with the thought of the cup -- the blood -- is it more in connection with the sprinkling in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>, the thought of the covenant?<a name=295:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=295:22></a>C.<a name=295:23></a> I think that <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>illustrates it, because the result of the sprinkling is that they go up, and Moses higher still eventually.<a name=295:24></a> There is liberty to go up.<a name=295:25></a> I think the Lord's supper, especially the cup, would fill every heart with liberty.<a name=295:26></a>

		Now what will sustain the heart under pressure of this kind is the knowledge of the love of Christ -- that love in which He enters into all the pressure, and considers the effect of it upon our spirits, and makes intercession for us as to it all, so that we may "more than conquer".<a name=308:7></a> As we apprehend this activity of His love we are greatly strengthened to face the opposition.<a name=308:8></a> There is One in the highest place -- in the place of power, for He is at the right hand of God -- whose love is active to sustain us; One whose hands never get "heavy" like those of Moses (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:12">Exodus  17:12</a>), and whose intercession never fails.<a name=308:9></a> The knowledge of this sustains our hearts in confidence and courage.<a name=308:10></a> If we lose the consciousness of the love of Christ we become spiritually weak -- we fall behind as did some of old -- and when Amalek assails us we are in great danger.<a name=308:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=378:1></a>C.<a name=378:2></a> It occurred to me since sitting here that this scripture carries us back to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=378:3></a>

		Ques.<a name=378:4></a> What had you in mind?<a name=378:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=378:6></a>C.<a name=378:7></a> Well, we read there in verse 15, "Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it".<a name=378:8></a> I think that this chapter rather answers to the guarding.<a name=378:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=378:12></a>C.<a name=378:13></a> Well, I think there was that set forth in the garden of Eden which was for divine pleasure; Eden means 'pleasure'.<a name=378:14></a> There was a scene for divine pleasure, but it needed to be guarded on account of the presence and activities of evil powers, foreknown of God as likely to molest the scene of divine pleasure.<a name=378:15></a> It was a warning to Adam that evil powers were about, and that it was a scene of divine pleasure that needed to be guarded.<a name=378:16></a> It should have intimated to Adam the peril of those wicked powers in the heavenlies; and hostile powers are jealous of God's pleasure.<a name=378:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you come to the antitype of the garden in the heavenly position, it is the assembly as holding things for the divine pleasure.<a name=378:18></a> God's answer to those hostile powers is to set the assembly there in Christ Jesus, but that is a heavenly position that has to be guarded.<a name=378:19></a>

		I suppose every reader of this epistle must have noticed that there is very little of what we should call doctrine in it.<a name=403:1></a> It is an epistle of experience.<a name=403:2></a> The apostle addresses the Philippians, not on the ground of the general facts and truths of christianity, but on the ground of God's work in them, and I think it was a great comfort to him to be able to write to them on that ground.<a name=403:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing his first epistle to the Corinthians he could not address them on the ground of the work of God in them.<a name=403:4></a> He had to address them on the ground of the facts and testimony of christianity as it had been developed among them by himself.<a name=403:5></a> But when they had repented and judged themselves as the effect of that epistle, he took a different line in the second epistle, and addressed them on the ground of the work of God in them.<a name=403:6></a>

		Another thing comes in in connection with this, and that is <i>prayer</i>.<a name=411:17></a> Prayer means that there is a want in the soul, a demand for something from God, and it is consistent with God's way with us that He allows the demand to arise before He gives the supply.<a name=411:18></a> The supply is there before the demand arises, but God does not vouchsafe the supply until the demand arises.<a name=411:19></a> I suppose every Christian has known what it was to be in circumstances where there was a real

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now see how this works out.<a name=412:13></a> The Man of God's good pleasure has been rejected from the earth and set in glory at God's right hand, and God works in His saints in this world, and by His gracious way with them He brings them to feel the absolute need of divine support, so that God's good pleasure may be worked out in them.<a name=412:14></a> They are in the line of God's good pleasure, and they feel the need of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in order to work it out.<a name=412:15></a> They pray, and then the supply comes.<a name=412:16></a> If we are to be here for God's good pleasure, it is not by making efforts and stirring ourselves up that it will come to pass.<a name=412:17></a> Confessing failure and resolving to do better for the future is not sufficient.<a name=412:18></a> Nothing will put us in the line of God's good pleasure but "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".<a name=412:19></a> We must have a fresh supply for the necessity of the day, or the hour, or the minute; and how infinite is the supply available

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for us.<a name=413:1></a> Through that supply we get inward support.<a name=413:2></a> That is the first effect, as it was with the apostle in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=413:3></a> He prayed three times that the Lord would take away the thorn.<a name=413:4></a> But the Lord said, "My grace suffices thee; for my power is perfected in weakness".<a name=413:5></a> He says first, "My grace suffices thee".<a name=413:6></a> By this I understand that the Lord would give Paul such a supply of His grace that Paul would be content to be reduced to nothing by the thorn; and then when Paul was so inwardly supported that he was content to be reduced to nothing, Christ's power would tabernacle over him, and accomplish infinite results through his weakness.<a name=413:7></a> Having this wonderful supply the apostle could say, I "will .<a name=413:8></a>.<a name=413:9></a>.<a name=413:10></a> boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me".<a name=413:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is support outwardly, as we get in the end of the chapter in Philippians.<a name=413:12></a> "And not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God" (chapter 1: 28).<a name=413:13></a> The thought of salvation here, and in fact all through the epistle, is that we are for the good pleasure of God.<a name=413:14></a> Delivered from the working of our own will and from all that is evil in the world, we are for the good pleasure of God, and the power of God's salvation keeps us in the presence of our adversaries, We thus have the power of God, not only for inward support in our own spirits, but also for outward support, so that the adversaries around are not able to crush or dismay us, or turn us aside.<a name=413:15></a> The salvation of God is with us, and that is a very great thing.<a name=413:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God works in us so that we may appreciate what is according to His good pleasure; that is, that we may appreciate Christ; and then by His way with us He practically sets aside the activity of our own wills, so that through prayer we may receive the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and in the power and grace of this be here for His good pleasure.<a name=413:17></a> Then there is response to God according to chapter 2: 12, 13, "So that, my beloved, even as ye have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the path of God's will we realise that all that is of ourselves is a snare and a hindrance, and that obliges us to go on in fear and trembling and in constant dependence upon God.<a name=414:11></a> Because if we get out of the place of dependence we lose the secret of power, and fail to work out our own salvation.<a name=414:12></a>

		Salvation will not be complete until we get our glorified bodies, and so we read that "our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself" (chapter 3: 20, 21).<a name=414:13></a> That is the triumphant finish of the work of God in us; He will give us glorious bodies like the body of Christ.<a name=414:14></a> It is a great principle with God never to set up again a thing that sin has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God enable us to see more clearly the nature of His work in us, and of His way with us, so that we may be more spiritually diligent in working out our own salvation, while we wait for complete salvation out of the scenes and circumstances and condition where sin has been!<a name=415:6></a>

		I wish to bring before you a most interesting subject, namely, the desires of a Christian.<a name=416:1></a> A man's true character is indicated by his desires.<a name=416:2></a> To know a man's desires is to know the man; they are the true index to what he is.<a name=416:3></a> What a man is <i>outwardly</i> does not constitute his character: for this you must go beneath the surface to the hidden springs of the heart.<a name=416:4></a> In the word of God, man in the flesh is exposed right down to the very roots of his being.<a name=416:5></a> Not only is divine light thrown upon his actions and words, but the very desires of his heart are dragged out from their secret hiding-places and exhibited in their true and hideous nature, so that we know not only what man has done, but <i>what he is</i> -- we know his character.<a name=416:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a similar way we have in the epistle to the Philippians the unfolding of the desires of a Christian's heart; and in connection with this I may remark that nothing is more wonderful than the way in which God developed the life and experience of a Christian in the beloved apostle Paul, so that the most exalted truths are not here stated in a doctrinal way, but are presented as having been worked out in the life and experience of a man subject to like passions as we are.<a name=416:7></a> In this epistle the heart of the man in Christ is uncovered, the very core of his moral being is laid bare, his inmost desires are exposed, and thus we learn here not so much what are the privileges, or the activities of the Christian, as we learn what constitutes the <i>character</i> of a Christian.<a name=416:8></a> May the Lord's blessing attend our meditations on this subject.<a name=416:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Consider for a moment the peculiarly trying circumstances in which Paul was found when these words were penned.<a name=417:2></a> Think of him with all his natural energy of character, and with all the burning desires of a heart that had been saturated with the love of Christ, and that longed to carry the fulness of the blessing of Christ to every saint and sinner under heaven; and think what it must have been to <i>him</i> to be hemmed in by the four walls of a Roman prison.<a name=417:3></a> Such had been his position for at least two years, and yet he expresses no desire to have his circumstances altered.<a name=417:4></a> His one care and desire was that Christ might be magnified in his body in any circumstances -- whether by life or by death.<a name=417:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Did you never find yourself making your circumstances an excuse for your lack of devotedness to Christ?<a name=417:6></a> The poor man thinks, If I were rich I could magnify Christ a great deal; the weak one thinks, If I were strong and robust, what an amount of service I could render; the one who has not much gift thinks, If I could speak as well as So-and-so I could honour Christ much more than I do; others say, If I were in another family, If I had a different occupation, If my circumstances were changed a little, Christ might be magnified more largely in me.<a name=417:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the simple fact is that this is all self-occupation, and these are the wretched excuses made by the flesh to justify a lack of devotedness to Christ.<a name=417:8></a> Look at them, and you will find that they all centre round self.<a name=417:9></a> It is I this, and I that, I would be a wonderful Christian, and of course I should have the credit of it, and, in result, I would be magnified.<a name=417:10></a> The soul in this state has not really done with self -- that wretched old I -- and if circumstances permitted many works and much christian activity the result would be something like <a href="../bible/Job.htm#29">Job  29</a>.<a name=417:11></a>

		An immense advance upon this may be found in a remarkable utterance of John the Baptist: "He must increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:30">John  3:30</a>).<a name=418:2></a> Himself one of the last and greatest saints of a dispensation which recognised man in the flesh, John was taught of God to express what was not only true of himself personally, but true of him as the representative of man in the flesh.<a name=418:3></a> The very presence on earth of the second Man out of heaven was <i>morally</i> the setting aside of the old order of man in the flesh.<a name=418:4></a> Here was One who had come from above, from heaven, and contrasting this One with himself -- the Man of the new order with the man of the old -- John says, "He must increase, but I must decrease".<a name=418:5></a>

		It is in this connection that reconciliation is necessary according to Colossians, because we could not think of His having a body that was in any way unsuitable.<a name=455:5></a> He can take up nothing that is not reconciled.<a name=455:6></a> And what has been effected in reconciliation will yet be applied to all things; it extends to everything He has created, and yet there is something brought about now greater than the reconciliation of all things; that is, reconciliation of certain persons who are presented before the Fulness "holy and unblamable and irreproachable" (verse 22), in order that they can stand in relation to Him as His body.<a name=455:7></a> It is astounding!<a name=455:8></a> It is unique, because when the "all things" are reconciled, they will never be set in that intimate relationship of His body.<a name=455:9></a> So we need to be seriously concerned to enter into the greatness of it all.<a name=455:10></a>
