		There is one thing about the epistle to the Romans which makes it differ from other epistles of Paul, and that is, the fact that, in this unfolding of the truth, he takes nothing for granted, but begins at the very foundation.<a name=1:1></a> When writing to the Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, or Thessalonians, he was writing to people among whom he had laboured, and we find references to what he had taught them before; and though he had not seen the Colossians, yet Epaphras had told him so much about them that he could assume they were established up to a certain point.<a name=1:2></a> But in writing to the Romans he merely alludes to the fact that it was notorious in all the world that there was a company of believers at Rome.<a name=1:3></a> They were Gentile converts, but Paul had never seen them, and having to write a letter of commendation for Phoebe who was about to visit the imperial city, he takes the opportunity of unfolding to them "the gospel of God .<a name=1:4></a>.<a name=1:5></a>.<a name=1:6></a> concerning his Son" from the very foundation.<a name=1:7></a> He will not "build upon another man's foundation"; he prefers to lay it himself, conscious of the special grace that was given to him of God: and in unfolding these foundation truths his desire was that the believers at Rome might be established according to that which he calls "<i>my gospel</i>".<a name=1:8></a> See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:11">Romans  1:11</a>, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a>.<a name=1:9></a>

		You will notice that the verse I have read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:13">Romans  15:13</a>, comes at the end of the doctrinal and practical part of the epistle.<a name=1:10></a> Many interesting personal remarks and salutations follow, but the apostle ends his teaching at this verse, and it appears to me that this is the goal to which he is aiming to conduct us through this epistle.<a name=1:11></a> I want to point out to you this evening the course by which this goal may be reached, but before doing so I would like you to settle it in your heart that it is the will of God that you should be FILLED "WITH ALL JOY AND PEACE IN BELIEVING, THAT YE MAY ABOUND IN HOPE, THROUGH THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST".<a name=1:12></a> I believe if you get nothing else in this meeting but a sense in your soul, by the Spirit, that it is the will of God you should be in the condition here described, it would be an immense blessing to you, for you would go away with an exercised and longing heart, and if you hungered for them God would fill you with these good things.<a name=1:13></a> Have you reached this goal?<a name=1:14></a> Are you

		filled with all joy and peace in believing?<a name=2:1></a> Are you abounding in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit?<a name=2:2></a> Or have you stopped short of this blessing, into which God designs to bring you now by His Spirit?<a name=2:3></a> If you have not reached it I trust that the Lord will give you a word direct from Himself, that will point out the hindrance and help you over it into this wonderful blessing!<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us look at the course by which this goal is reached!<a name=2:5></a> It seems to me it is like a steeplechase or a hurdle race; that is, there are fences or barriers which have to be got over, and it is at these fences that so many are stopped in their progress and fail to reach the goal.<a name=2:6></a> This epistle shows us the fences, and how to get over them.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To begin with, let us suppose that a sinner -- an ordinary man of the world -- gets a distant view of this wonderful goal.<a name=2:8></a> "Filled with all joy and peace!<a name=2:9></a>" he says to himself, 'That must be perfect happiness!<a name=2:10></a> Nothing in the world has ever filled me with joy and peace.<a name=2:11></a> And though I do not quite understand what abounding in hope means, it sounds very nice.<a name=2:12></a> I must go in for these things'.<a name=2:13></a> He sets out to run toward the goal, but very soon he is brought to a dead stand by a fence so thick and high that he may well despair of ever getting over it by his own efforts.<a name=2:14></a> If you want to know what it is you must read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:9">Romans  3:9</a> - 20.<a name=2:15></a>

		In the first two chapters of this epistle we find three men.<a name=2:16></a> In chapter 1 there is an awful portrait of a corrupt heathen who has thrown off all the restraints of natural conscience, and, turning even from the revelation of God in nature, has abandoned himself to the licence of his own lusts.<a name=2:17></a> In the early part of chapter 2 we have a moralist, who can tell everybody what is right and wrong without being any better than others himself.<a name=2:18></a> In the latter part of the same chapter we have a religious man with a Bible, and a knowledge of the true God and of His will.<a name=2:19></a> So that we have (1) an open profligate sinner; (2) a moralist; (3) a religious man -- three men representative of every class of the unsaved -- and all brought to a stand by the fence in chapter 3.<a name=2:20></a> No.<a name=2:21></a> 2 might have said to No.<a name=2:22></a> 1, 'I'm a much better man than you': and so he was in many respects outwardly.<a name=2:23></a> No.<a name=2:24></a> 3 might have said to No.<a name=2:25></a> 2, 'You do not know the true God, and you have not got His word, but I worship Him in His temple and I

		"Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:24">Romans  3:24</a>.<a name=3:14></a> GRACE is the source and spring of a full and free discharge from the burden and guilt of sins.<a name=3:15></a> If you ask, What is <i>Grace</i>?<a name=3:16></a> I answer, it is the boundless love of the heart of God going out to sinners, and acting for their blessing though they deserve nothing but judgment.<a name=3:17></a> But divine love must be a righteous and holy love, and God would not clear away our sins in an unrighteous way.<a name=3:18></a> He could not make light of the guilt in which we were found, hence His grace could only reach us "through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus".<a name=3:19></a> A stupendous work has been done by Jesus on the cross to glorify God about sins, and believers stand before God on the ground of that work clear of every charge.<a name=3:20></a> It may be asked, How do we get the good of that work?<a name=3:21></a> Two short sentences from verses 25, 26 supply the answer -- "through faith in his blood".<a name=3:22></a> "him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=3:23></a> God justifies from every charge of guilt the one who has faith in the Person and work of Jesus.<a name=3:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Abraham <i>believed God</i>, and it was counted unto him for righteousness".<a name=4:4></a> Works have no place in connection with this matter, and boasting is excluded when we see that "a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:28">Romans  3:28</a>.<a name=4:5></a> It is evident that if justification is <i>by grace</i> it must be <i>of faith</i>, "otherwise grace is no more grace", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:6">Romans  11:6</a>.<a name=4:6></a> Then you will observe how the Holy Spirit brings in the thought of God known as the God of resurrection.<a name=4:7></a> God was He "who quickened the dead", verse 17, and was known as such, at least in figure, by Abraham, so that "he considered not his own body, <i>now dead</i> .<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a>.<a name=4:10></a> neither yet the <i>deadness</i> of Sarah's womb".<a name=4:11></a> This leads on to the declaration that righteousness shall be imputed <i>to us</i> if we believe -- not now in Jesus, but -- "on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=4:12></a> The One who bore all our sins, and glorified God in enduring and exhausting the penalty attached to them, is clear of them all.<a name=4:13></a> They are entirely gone, to the perfect satisfaction of God, and the One who bore them is raised from the dead.<a name=4:14></a> He is in a condition where He cannot bear sins or be charged with them any more, and the believer counted righteous by God is as clear of sins as Jesus is.<a name=4:15></a> It is thus that "being justified by faith, we have peace with God THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST".<a name=4:16></a> And while we rejoice in this, let us not forget what goes along with it.<a name=4:17></a> The One who bore all our sins is now as the Risen One in unclouded favour with God.<a name=4:18></a> He ever was, as to His own Person, the peerless Object of God's favour; but as the Risen One -- the Accomplisher of redemption -- He now stands in God's favour with a perfect title to set <i>us</i> in it also, and "BY WHOM ALSO we have access by faith into this grace (favour) wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=4:19></a> The one who has entered upon this by faith has passed the first great barrier, and has made a good start towards the goal.<a name=4:20></a>

		course would be clear right away to the goal.<a name=5:1></a> But it was not long before I came to another difficulty which, for two or three years, seemed to be more insurmountable than the first.<a name=5:2></a> It was this.<a name=5:3></a> I found that evil was present with me, even when I had the strongest desires to do good; and, though I longed to be holy, and devoted to Christ, I often found myself carried away captive in the grasp of sin.<a name=5:4></a> I made many efforts to get over this by reading the Scriptures, by prayer, by self-examination, and by resolutions and determinations.<a name=5:5></a> But all was in vain.<a name=5:6></a> There was a terrible evil within that would harass and hinder me, and throw me down in the mire in spite of all my efforts to go on to the goal.<a name=5:7></a> How could one be "filled with all joy and peace" while he was tormented and held in bondage by an evil power that was continually too strong for him?<a name=5:8></a>

		From the twelfth verse of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>the subject considered is that of two heads, and two races connected with those two heads.<a name=6:9></a> "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned .<a name=6:10></a>.<a name=6:11></a>.<a name=6:12></a> .<a name=6:13></a> Therefore as by the offence of one (or, by one offence) judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one (or, by one righteousness) the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.<a name=6:14></a> For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous".<a name=6:15></a> It is very solemn to consider that before Adam became the head of a race he was a <i>fallen man</i>; he had committed an act of disobedience, the consequences of which extend to every member of his race.<a name=6:16></a> We are involved in the results of that act, and we learn the reality of this, as I have said, by our own experience.<a name=6:17></a> But over against this solemn fact is the blessed fact that God has brought in another Head.<a name=6:18></a> This new Head is Jesus Christ, who before He became Head accomplished a certain great act, the effect and benefit of which extends to all His spiritual race.<a name=6:19></a> He accomplished one great act of righteousness when He died upon the cross.<a name=6:20></a> We have already seen how God dealt in righteousness with our SINS, but when Jesus went to the cross He was there for SIN as well as for SINS.<a name=6:21></a> See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>.<a name=6:22></a> That is, He represented before God the sinful condition into which the whole race of Adam had been plunged by the fall.<a name=6:23></a> The only way in which God could righteously deal with that corrupt and fallen race was by closing its history in death.<a name=6:24></a> The race -- that order of man -- will not do for God, and the death of Christ is the great act of righteousness in which it has been judicially brought to an end before God, that we might be brought into blessed life and liberty in connection with another Head -- Jesus Christ, the risen and exalted One.<a name=6:25></a>

		But we should have a poor and shallow idea of the meaning of this great transfer from Adam to Christ if we only learned it as a doctrine; hence it is necessary that we should learn its importance and blessedness from our own experience.<a name=7:1></a> Therefore we may be sure that no person has really understood what it is to be "in Christ", or known the liberty which "the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" confers, if he has not passed in some way through the exercises which are detailed for us in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:7">Romans  7:7</a> - 24.<a name=7:2></a>

		Chapter 8 supplies us with a perfect answer to all these painful, but most necessary, exercises.<a name=8:12></a> If we have passed through the different stages of dissatisfaction, disappointment, disgust, and despair as to ourselves, we are ready to welcome the infinite grace that gives us title to take our place on the new ground that we are "IN CHRIST JESUS".<a name=8:13></a>

		We see a great deliverance effected for us by God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=8:14></a> We now understand the meaning and value of the statements in chapters 6 and 7, that "our old man has been crucified with him", and that we have become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that we should be married to another, even to Him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.<a name=8:15></a> We are thankful to see that the death of Christ is the judicial end of our history as children of Adam; and to know that we are now entitled, and have power by the Holy Spirit, to reckon ourselves dead to sin, and alive to God in CHRIST JESUS.<a name=8:16></a>

		not to speak of the unutterable burdens that pressed continually upon His heart as He "took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses" -- feeling in His Holy spirit the full weight of every disease and infirmity that He removed by His power.<a name=11:1></a> He was indeed, as the prophet so touchingly says, "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief".<a name=11:2></a> <i>He</i> felt everything that sin had brought into the world, and <i>you</i> have to feel something of it too.<a name=11:3></a> You are called to "suffer WITH HIM".<a name=11:4></a> Does not that put a wonderful aspect upon all the sufferings?<a name=11:5></a>

		2.

		4. From verse 35 to the end of the chapter, every kind of trial and suffering is marshalled before us -- everything that the power of evil could bring upon us is brought forward, only to establish the glorious truth that none of these things, nor all of them together, can separate the believer from the love of Christ, or from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=12:1></a> So that in the face of every possible trial he can triumphantly exclaim, "<i>In all these things</i> we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us".<a name=12:2></a> If Paul and Silas had endured all their sufferings at Philippi <i>without murmuring</i> they would have been conquerors.<a name=12:3></a> But they did more than this.<a name=12:4></a> They could sing in the midst of it all; they were "<i>more</i> than conquerors".<a name=12:5></a> They had learned that, in spite of the sufferings of this present time, they could be "filled with all joy and peace in believing", and they abounded in hope "through the power of the Holy Ghost".<a name=12:6></a>

		These scriptures bring before us Three Scenes of Judgment, and I would like to say a few words about them, looking to the Lord that He may graciously use what comes before us for the help and blessing of the many young believers present.<a name=16:1></a> On each of the three occasions you will notice that Abraham rose up "early in the morning".<a name=16:2></a> He was a man in earnest -- a man with purpose of heart.<a name=16:3></a> Faith was in lively and vigorous exercise.<a name=16:4></a> No love of selfish case, no supine and carnal indulgence, retarded his movements.<a name=16:5></a> He was a man in the energy of <i>faith</i>.<a name=16:6></a> My brethren, it is in proportion as this marks us that we shall get blessing from God.<a name=16:7></a> If our hearts are awake to the reality and blessedness of divine things, and we are set upon them, I am sure we shall be greatly enriched with spiritual blessing and joy.<a name=16:8></a>

		In these chapters the man who is in the energy of faith witnesses three scenes of judgment, and it is of great importance that we should realise the typical significance of the pictures thus brought before us, for we cannot have PEACE without seeing the first, we shall not have JOY unless we see the second, and our TESTIMONY will be a total failure if we do not see the third.<a name=16:9></a>

		There is no type in Scripture more expressive than this touching scene in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>.<a name=16:10></a> Though the uplifted hand was stayed, and the fatal blow did not actually fall, the picture is so plain in its outlines that he who runs may read its meaning.<a name=16:11></a> It brings before us the greatest of all facts -- that GOD "spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:32">Romans  8:32</a>.<a name=16:12></a> Mark the words, "delivered him up"!<a name=16:13></a> Other scriptures tell us that He gave Him, that He sent Him, that He anointed Him, that He was with Him; but the supreme fact brought before us in the type we are considering is that He delivered Him up.<a name=16:14></a> It is not the incarnation that is thus spoken of, for as incarnate the Holy One of God could say, "Thou keptest me in safety when I was upon my mother's breasts", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:9">Psalm  22:9</a>, margin.<a name=16:15></a> Nor was He "delivered up" during His holy life of devoted service here, for again and again are we told that His enemies could not take or touch Him because "his hour was not yet come".<a name=16:16></a> But there came a moment when, in view

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment that Adam sinned, God's satisfaction in him came to an end.<a name=29:4></a> Instead of innocence, the germs of all possible evil were found in his heart, and he became subject to the judgment of God.<a name=29:5></a> The full fruit of sin did not come out in Adam personally; it has taken the whole history of the world to develop and exhibit it; but every bit of evil that has ever come out in Adam's children was latent in him as soon as he became a sinner.<a name=29:6></a> I will ask you to read four scriptures which show the true character of fallen man, that is of Adam, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:5">Genesis  6:5</a>, 6; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#14:2">Psalm  14:2</a>, 3; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7:20">Mark  7:20</a> - 23; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:51">Acts  7:51</a>, 52.<a name=29:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures give us God's estimate of the children of Adam at four great periods of their history.<a name=29:8></a> When man is allowed to take his own course, as in antediluvian times, every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually; when checked and restrained by God's government, as in the time of David, there are none that seek God or that do good; when His beloved Son comes to manifest all God's grace, He finds man's heart the same fruitful source of evil as ever; and the awful climax of the dark history is the betrayal and murder of the only Just One, and the perpetual resistance of the Holy Spirit.<a name=29:9></a> What a history!<a name=29:10></a> And every bit of it, and every bit of sin that you and I have found in the depths of our own hearts, is just the exhibition of that one man -- Adam.<a name=29:11></a> It may be all summed up in a word of three letters -- SIN.<a name=29:12></a>
