		AN OUTLINE OF JOSHUA
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Joshua does not, like the book of Deuteronomy, open up to us the wealth and blessedness of the land of Canaan or describe the enjoyment by God's chosen people of their inheritance.<a name=1:1></a> It is essentially a military book.<a name=1:2></a> The first half of the book is occupied by the wars of Jehovah, and the people are spoken of as the army of Jehovah; the latter half describes the division and occupation of the land by the tribes of Israel as a result of the conflict.<a name=1:3></a> This has a present voice to us, for none of us can enter into our inheritance apart from conflict; we do not hold anything for which we have not engaged in battle.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua now is the prominent figure, and he is looked at as subordinate to Moses; he is spoken of more than once as Moses' attendant.<a name=1:5></a> There is a remarkable statement as to the disciples in the opening verses of Luke; they are described as "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word".<a name=1:6></a> That qualified them to take up the Joshua character of things.<a name=1:7></a> Joshua represents the most important spiritual reality which we need to lay hold of in view of moving into the land.<a name=1:8></a> I do not think he represents Christ personally -- Christ personally is at the right hand of God -- but he represents the Spirit of Christ found in leadership amongst the people of God.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting that it should be said that Joshua as a young man remained in the tent of meeting; it seems to indicate his training.<a name=1:10></a> Joshua appears first in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>in connection with the conflict with Amalek; he appears there in a military connection.<a name=1:11></a> He gets the victory over Amalek, who represents Satan working through the flesh in a violent way to resist the Spirit.<a name=1:12></a> The Spirit had just been given typically in the water from the rock, and now we find the action of the power of evil to resist that, but there was spiritual power in Joshua that enabled him to overcome Amalek.<a name=1:13></a> There was a good general in the field.<a name=1:14></a> Joshua's first experience was to learn how to overcome the hostility that there is to the presence and action of the Spirit in the people of God.<a name=1:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34">Exodus  34</a>we find him as a young man not departing from the tent of meeting.<a name=1:16></a> The

	<div class="paragraph">
		tent of meeting was pitched outside the camp; it was a very unpretentious thing.<a name=2:1></a> It was not yet the tabernacle, but an informal structure; nevertheless the presence of Jehovah was there, and Joshua would not leave the tent; he remained in the secret of God's pavilion.<a name=2:2></a> He is seen as at home in nearness to God.<a name=2:3></a> We see him in two characters -- on the field of battle with the enemy, and then abiding in the place where Jehovah was; and he is Moses' attendant.<a name=2:4></a> He seems to represent that spirit which would mark the saints as having known the company of the Lord.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think God would touch our hearts by suggesting to us that we have a Joshua, we have an element of spiritual leading, and it lies in the Spirit of Christ.<a name=2:6></a> God would encourage the Spirit of Christ in His people, so He says, "Be strong and very courageous", and the people say to Joshua, "Be strong and courageous".<a name=2:7></a> The Joshua element was very powerful in both Paul and Timothy.<a name=2:8></a> Paul encouraged that spirit in Timothy all through his epistles.<a name=2:9></a> "Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus".<a name=2:10></a> That would bring in the Joshua element, so that there might be spiritual leading amongst the people of God, something that God could support.<a name=2:11></a> God commits Himself absolutely to Joshua.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of Christ is intensely set on bringing the people of God into everything that the love of God has purposed for them.<a name=2:13></a> That is the element amongst God's people that God would encourage and strengthen.<a name=2:14></a> It is most encouraging to me to think that there is that on this earth at the present moment to which God can unreservedly commit Himself -- that is the Spirit of Christ in the saints.<a name=2:15></a> It is a wonderful thing to recognise that there is spiritual power adequate to cause us to inherit all that God has given us in the purpose of His love; that is the element we want to strengthen and encourage.<a name=2:16></a> It is said in verse 5, "None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee neither will I forsake thee.<a name=2:17></a> Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give them".<a name=2:18></a> God will never leave nor forsake those who are formed by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=2:19></a> He could not.<a name=2:20></a> It is because the saints are viewed as partakers of the Spirit of Christ that this scripture is quoted in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13">Hebrews  13</a>, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee".<a name=2:21></a> We must read the epistle to see the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		kind of people in view; it is those who are the companions of Christ.<a name=3:1></a> If I walk after the flesh it would be profane for me to think that I could have the abiding presence of God with me.<a name=3:2></a> It has often been said of this scripture that it occurs three times in the Old Testament.<a name=3:3></a> It is said to Jacob in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>; it is said here to Joshua; and it is said to Solomon.<a name=3:4></a> Paul applies it to the sanctified company, the holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling; God never leaves them or forsakes them.<a name=3:5></a> The Spirit of Christ gives strength and courage that prepares one to suffer, to be outwardly weak, to go to the wall, but it is a spirit that can overcome every obstacle in the way of taking possession of the inheritance.<a name=3:6></a> The apostle Paul could say, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:13">Philippians  4:13</a>.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to recognise that the saints are identified with the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is identified with them, and God commits Himself absolutely to support that Spirit.<a name=3:8></a> If I move in the Spirit of Christ, I have the unreserved support of the blessed God.<a name=3:9></a> Our comfort as saints is that we are moving in concert with the Spirit of Christ, and God is with that element, as He says here, "Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest".<a name=3:10></a> Whithersoever the Spirit of Christ leads, God is with that leading.<a name=3:11></a> It is a very great exercise for us that we should see what it is that God can strengthen and encourage.<a name=3:12></a> If we are moving on the line of the spiritual leading of Christ, there is a living divine support, a victory over every foe; nothing will be able to obstruct us from entering into the inheritance.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things come out here in connection with which Joshua is exhorted to be strong and courageous.<a name=3:14></a> The first is the coming into the land: "Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give them", verse 6.<a name=3:15></a> The second is, "Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee.<a name=3:16></a> Turn not from it to the right or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.<a name=3:17></a> This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt have good success in thy ways, and then shalt thou prosper", verses 7, 8.<a name=3:18></a> There are two things: the bringing into the land, and the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		taking heed to the book that is written.<a name=4:1></a> Those are the two great actions of spiritual leadership in the saints.<a name=4:2></a> The Spirit of Christ would always lead into the purposes of God's love; and on the other hand the law would be preserved in all its integrity, and the book that was written.<a name=4:3></a> Spiritual leadership is wholly governed by the written word.<a name=4:4></a> The law is most important because it is an element of divine control, and the Spirit of Christ would always magnify that in our hearts -- the spirit of control.<a name=4:5></a> The commandments of the Lord are always to govern us.<a name=4:6></a> They are explicit and authoritative; they are to govern us, and the land will not be enjoyed otherwise.<a name=4:7></a> It is a test now of spirituality that the things that are written are acknowledged to be the commandment of the Lord (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>) -- that is how we know a spiritual person.<a name=4:8></a> A spiritual person always recognises the commandment of the Lord, and the Spirit of Christ in the saints can never be out of correspondence with the commandment of the Lord.<a name=4:9></a> Joshua was never out of accord with Moses; one could not think of such a thing.<a name=4:10></a> The law is part of what God has made known; every scripture is inspired of God.<a name=4:11></a> There is a remarkable reference to a book here, and reference to what was written.<a name=4:12></a> There is something explicit about it.<a name=4:13></a> People say, I think this and that, and I believe this or that, but the point is what is written, not what I go with.<a name=4:14></a> The Spirit of Christ will always give heed to what is written.<a name=4:15></a> If a brother says he knows he has the mind of the Lord, he subjects himself to the enquiry of the saints as to whether it is in accord with the Scriptures.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in verse 2, "Now rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people".<a name=4:17></a> The whole people are identified with Joshua, and Joshua with them.<a name=4:18></a> It is an element of spiritual leading which every saint is privileged to recognise and give place to; and we can only recognise that in another as we have the same kind of thing in our own spirits.<a name=4:19></a> There must be that in ourselves that is in harmony with any light that God gives.<a name=4:20></a> When God gives light there is often great opposition and resentment, which shows that there is not that practically in the saints that is in correspondence with it.<a name=4:21></a> We are tested by any spiritual leading that there is amongst the saints; but, if I am giving place to the Spirit of Christ, I shall greatly appreciate and respond to what is of the Spirit of Christ wherever it is found.<a name=4:22></a> If there is any measure of true separation, there is an element of spiritual leading; it might

		be in a brother or sister, and it is a great thing to have that element strengthened and encouraged.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book opens by calling attention to two important things.<a name=5:2></a> It is said in verse 4, "From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border".<a name=5:3></a> That gives the whole scope of God's purposed blessing for His people on both sides of the Jordan.<a name=5:4></a> Paul tells the Christians that all things were theirs, and they were unspiritual people too.<a name=5:5></a> "In everything ye are enriched in him" -- he spreads it out before them, "That shall be your border", an unlimited expanse; and all those of whom the Spirit can witness that they are children of God can say, That is our border.<a name=5:6></a> We are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, so the whole expanse of it is ours.<a name=5:7></a> The border includes everything on the privilege side and on the responsible side -- both sides of the Jordan -- the whole expanse of divine blessing in Christ.<a name=5:8></a> All is ours.<a name=5:9></a> But there is something else beside that.<a name=5:10></a> In verse 3 we read, "Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you" -- that is another matter.<a name=5:11></a> This refers to personal exercise and movement.<a name=5:12></a> "The sole of your foot" means that your feet have moved.<a name=5:13></a> While everything belongs to us, we only have as much as we have taken possession of.<a name=5:14></a> It is wholesome for us to remember that.<a name=5:15></a> The question is, What have I put my foot on?<a name=5:16></a> We would all accept as true that we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ; we are all thankful to hear Paul tell us that all things are ours, and we believe it; but there must be a movement with Joshua"thou and all this people".<a name=5:17></a> If they had not moved with Joshua they would never have put their foot on a piece of the land.<a name=5:18></a> The question comes to each of us, How much have we put our foot on it?<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua and the people are all identified; and as they followed and moved with Joshua they overcame one enemy after another.<a name=5:20></a> Every fresh piece of land they possessed involved marching and fighting.<a name=5:21></a> They did not put their foot on the land in five minutes: they had to move with Joshua.<a name=5:22></a> Now the question is, How far have we moved under the precious leadership of the Spirit of Christ?<a name=5:23></a> How far have we moved into the inheritance so that we are conscious that we have put our foot on a certain piece of ground?<a name=5:24></a> That is the idea.<a name=5:25></a> Every fresh tract of land, as they moved on, meant fresh fighting and fresh victory, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there was that among them in Joshua that was able to overcome every foe.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an interesting fact that they never did possess all the land, and we know as a matter of fact that Joshua did not give them rest.<a name=6:2></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>tells us that he did not.<a name=6:3></a> The thing is left open, as it is today; there is very much land to be possessed.<a name=6:4></a> We are left in the exercise and encouragement of that.<a name=6:5></a> We have not possessed very much land; we have not put our foot on a great deal.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua does two things here.<a name=6:7></a> First, he tells them to prepare victuals, which shows that a starving people cannot go over.<a name=6:8></a> It is a people that can prepare themselves victuals.<a name=6:9></a> Some of us have not reached that yet; our spiritual food has to be prepared for us and put into our mouths with a spoon.<a name=6:10></a> The Corinthians were spoon-fed people; they did not know how to prepare themselves victuals; but after Paul's second epistle to them they knew how to do it.<a name=6:11></a> If there is to be movement there must be energy, and there cannot be energy without food.<a name=6:12></a> That is why there is so little energy today amongst the people of God; they are so badly nourished.<a name=6:13></a> The Lord has set those over the household to give them their portion of meat in due season.<a name=6:14></a> The apostles have done their duty well; they have provided us with meat in due season for every possible emergency.<a name=6:15></a> There is a food supply in the ministry of the apostles, and also a perpetual food supply in the ministry of the gifts.<a name=6:16></a> There has been a living ministry going on for nearly two thousand years; the people of God have been fed and nourished all that time.<a name=6:17></a> In the dark ages even, many beloved saints lived and died in the confession of the truth; in the dark ages there was a food supply which kept up energy and ability to do something.<a name=6:18></a> The food supply is very important.<a name=6:19></a> Often difficulties and local troubles come in because the food supply is short: the remedy is a little more food.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the other side that he speaks of.<a name=6:21></a> The unspiritual people, the two and a half tribes who had stopped on the wrong side of Jordan, are spoken to about going over with their brethren.<a name=6:22></a> Joshua reminds them of the universal character of the conflict which is connected with the inheritance.<a name=6:23></a> It is a lesson for us.<a name=6:24></a> We may have rest locally, but the conflict is going on, and no one in Israel is to settle down as long as the conflicts of the inheritance are going on.<a name=6:25></a> It is a great help to feel that, though I may not be eminent spiritually, yet I am
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		called to take part in the conflicts of the inheritance.<a name=7:1></a> I think that is what Paul is referring to when he says to the Corinthians, "Quit yourselves like men; be strong" -- he was calling them out to military service.<a name=7:2></a> And he says to the saints at Philippi, who were spiritual people compared to the Corinthians, "stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings".<a name=7:3></a> Everybody is called to take part in the conflict; no section of the people of God is exempt from military service.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is of great importance as coming at the commencement of this book.<a name=7:5></a> It would intimate to us that if we are to possess and enjoy the land we must have Rahab's faith and Rahab's works.<a name=7:6></a> This is a particularly interesting chapter to us because it shows how the Gentile comes into possession of the land.<a name=7:7></a> It is most remarkable, and must have struck every one of us, that we should have a chapter like this at the beginning of a book like this.<a name=7:8></a> Before we have any of the triumphs of Joshua and the army of Jehovah, we have a moral triumph which is greater than any of the military triumphs.<a name=7:9></a> I suppose the greatest victory recorded in the book is the victory of divine grace in the soul of Rahab.<a name=7:10></a> All those who form the household of faith, viewed as in the land, belong typically to Rahab's house.<a name=7:11></a> Rahab's household is the household of faith.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we see here the marvellous working of God in the very place where the enemy is strongest, for I suppose Jericho would represent that, and it was the strongest part of Jericho, for Rahab's house was on the wall.<a name=7:13></a> We see here one in the strongest part of the enemy's stronghold, and such a one as she was, a disreputable woman, for the New Testament reminds us each time she is mentioned that she was Rahab the harlot.<a name=7:14></a> How this magnifies the sovereign mercy that could act in such a place as Jericho, and in one of the worst women in Jericho, and so work in her that she becomes the mother in Israel of her day!<a name=7:15></a> It is interesting to see that the spies that Joshua sent did nothing else, as far as the record goes, but take knowledge of the work of God in Rahab -- not the strength of the enemy, but the mighty power of God that could work in the strongest part of the enemy's territory and secure such a triumph for Himself.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>that Rahab received the spies with peace.<a name=8:1></a> It must have been an astonishment to those spies to find a person in Jericho to receive them with peace.<a name=8:2></a> The fact was that Jehovah had become her God; their God was her God unquestionably.<a name=8:3></a> I have no doubt she was beyond many in Israel, because she was the one person who had a divine outlook on the situation.<a name=8:4></a> When the spies came back to Joshua they reported Rahab's outlook on the situation.<a name=8:5></a> It is very remarkable that Rahab's faith seems to be connected with how she received the spies, and her works are connected with how she dismissed them.<a name=8:6></a> We have to learn these two lessons; we have to learn spiritually what it means if we are to estimate the present situation aright.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spies represent the two-fold character of the mission of the Spirit.<a name=8:8></a> The mission of the Spirit today has a two-fold character: He is here as a spy and He is here as a messenger.<a name=8:9></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>calls them spies, and <a href="../bible/James.htm#2">James  2</a>calls them messengers.<a name=8:10></a> Now the Spirit of God has come in that two-fold character: He is a spy to seek out and expose all the power of evil in this world.<a name=8:11></a> "He will bring demonstration to the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me no longer; of judgment because the ruler of this world is judged", <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:8">John  16:8</a> - 12.<a name=8:12></a> That is the Spirit in the spy character; He searches out and exposes all the condition of the world in its opposition to God, in its Jericho character.<a name=8:13></a> On the other hand He is a messenger; He brings messages of blessing to all those who fear God.<a name=8:14></a> So these two men were spies in relation to Jericho, but messengers in relation to Rahab, divine messengers of grace and blessing; and the Spirit has that character for all who fear God.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"They came into a harlot's house, named Rahab".<a name=8:16></a> They came to her as messengers, and as spies she received them in peace.<a name=8:17></a> Rahab was quite in accord with the judgment that God had passed on the people to whom she had belonged; she is in harmony with God and His people about it all, so she received the spies with peace.<a name=8:18></a> There was perfect harmony between Rahab's spirit and the spies.<a name=8:19></a> What a wonderful thing that God could bring that about in presence of all the power of Satan and the world!<a name=8:20></a> He could bring a soul into harmony with His Spirit's work as to all that is in the world; He can do that in the sovereignty of His mercy.<a name=8:21></a> There is a great deal

		involved in it.<a name=9:1></a> Typically she entered into the death and resurrection of Christ, she could speak of what God did at the Red Sea, and then of what the people did in the overthrow of Sihon and Og.<a name=9:2></a> She understood typically what God had done through the death and resurrection of Christ for His people as seen in the Red Sea.<a name=9:3></a> And she understood what He was in the power of the Spirit in His people in overthrowing the flesh.<a name=9:4></a> She had an estimate of it all, and she says, "That people shall be my people; I will link myself with them; their God shall be my God; I no longer belong to Jericho or to Jericho's king; I belong to those people".<a name=9:5></a> She received the spies with peace.<a name=9:6></a> Rahab shows how God in His sovereign mercy can separate a soul from this present evil world viewed as the sphere of spiritual activities of evil.<a name=9:7></a> Jericho represents this world as a sphere of the activities of spiritual evil, all kinds of wrong thoughts and teachings which emanate from wicked spirits in the heavenlies.<a name=9:8></a> God can work in such a scene and dissociate a soul completely from it; He did that for Rahab so that she had no longer any thought of being a friend of the world.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very wonderful that James should put Abraham and Rahab together.<a name=9:10></a> He selects them purposely.<a name=9:11></a> There is so to speak, a father and a mother.<a name=9:12></a> He brings them together: the great august vessel of promise, Abraham, in all his dignity as the great father; and then a poor harlot, Rahab.<a name=9:13></a> They are both the subjects of the same sovereign calling, and the same sovereign working.<a name=9:14></a> So Abraham and the harlot stand both together, different vessels, but the same working and the same treasure put in each one.<a name=9:15></a> I may be a very respectable man like Abraham, as far as this world goes, or a most disreputable person like Rahab -- that is only the vessel.<a name=9:16></a> What matters is what God puts into the vessel, and that is faith.<a name=9:17></a> God puts faith there; God put it into Abraham and He put it into Rahab.<a name=9:18></a> It is faith that distinguishes a person with God; not the vessel, but what God puts into the vessel.<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The work of God in that woman's soul had completely detached her before the messengers came.<a name=9:20></a> Jehovah was her God and Jehovah's people her people, so that when the spies came she received them with peace.<a name=9:21></a> She was in harmony with what was outside the city, and in complete separation morally from what was inside the city.<a name=9:22></a> That is the position for us today.<a name=9:23></a> As a matter of fact we are still in Jericho, but we are there as completely dissociated from everything morally

	<div class="paragraph">
		The people now move with Joshua, and they are called to lodge three days before they go over Jordan, which suggests a preparatory exercise in connection with important spiritual movements.<a name=14:1></a> I do not think God would have His people act, as it were, on the spur of the moment; He would have us consider what we are doing, especially in relation to spiritual movements, so that we do not act on sudden impulses.<a name=14:2></a> We act with consideration and conviction.<a name=14:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we see in chapter 1, three days were allotted for the preparation of victuals.<a name=14:4></a> "Prepare yourselves victuals, for in three days ye shall pass over", it suggests that food is an important element in connection with that spiritual movement which is set forth in the crossing of the Jordan.<a name=14:5></a> It is a spiritually nourished people, not a starving people, that go over Jordan.<a name=14:6></a> Then the three days suggest the preparation of their hearts, the preparation of our hearts, to understand what the crossing of Jordan really means.<a name=14:7></a> The Lord spoke of three days: "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up", and He spoke of being three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<a name=14:8></a> "Three days" is an important period.<a name=14:9></a> When the light of heaven shone into Paul's heart there were three days of preparatory exercise; there were three days in which he could not see and in which he did not eat or drink.<a name=14:10></a> There must have been deep exercises going on in his soul, but that was a necessary preparation for the new movement that he was about to make.<a name=14:11></a> I do not mean to say that in his case it was going over Jordan, but it was preparation for a great spiritual movement; he was about to move entirely out of the region of the flesh into the region of the Spirit.<a name=14:12></a> No doubt the deep exercise of the three days was needed in order that he might fully appreciate what he was going to move out of and what he was going to move into.<a name=14:13></a> I think the three days were always present to the mind of the Lord.<a name=14:14></a> At the beginning of His ministry in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>He speaks of "after three days", showing that the thought of passing over to the resurrection side was much before Him at the very beginning of His ministry.<a name=14:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Ithinkchapter.htm#1">I think chapter  1</a>of the gospel of John is very suggestive in connection with this.<a name=15:3></a> The Lord Jesus is first seen as the Lamb of God, the Taker-away of the sin of the world -- that is the sacrificial question which had to be settled first, and then comes the personal question.<a name=15:4></a> The second time John speaks he says, "Behold the Lamb of God" -- it is the Person, and they follow Jesus; He is walking.<a name=15:5></a> It seems to me that the Spirit of God would suggest in that chapter that the Son of God is moving from what is sacrificial, what is connected with the dealing with sin, to the region of what is spiritual and eternal, so I think it directly answers to the crossings of the Jordan.<a name=15:6></a> He is moving over to the other side.<a name=15:7></a> The sacrificial side is on this side -- that is finished -- and He moves over and the disciples hear John speak and they go after Him.<a name=15:8></a> They follow the ark.<a name=15:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to take account of the fact that the people had had the ark in their midst and leading them for thirty-eight years.<a name=15:10></a> God's intention is to make Christ as the ark of the covenant very precious to us.<a name=15:11></a> That is what He has been about with us from the first moment when a ray of gospel light shone into our souls.<a name=15:12></a> We were thinking of our salvation, forgiveness and blessing, but what God was thinking about was connecting our affections with that Person who brought salvation, forgiveness and blessing to us.<a name=15:13></a> He is the ark of the covenant; all is secured in Him and presented to us in Him so that we might learn to value and love that Person, and be deeply interested in His movements.<a name=15:14></a>

		Then there is the wonderful presentation of Christ in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=15:15></a> It is to move us in our affections to the place where Christ is, to move us from earth to heaven.<a name=15:16></a> We may listen to ministry for long, but that does not set us in movement.<a name=15:17></a> We have often been reminded of that wonderful discourse in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>to which the two disciples listened, the most wonderful ministry that any one had ever heard.<a name=15:18></a> The whole of Scripture was opened to them by the Son of God, but it never turned their feet round.<a name=15:19></a> The ministry and exposition of Scripture did not move them, but when they had a sight of the Person, that moved them.<a name=15:20></a> He was leading

		We have been looking a little at the irresistible power of the ark in relation to Jordan, and in relation to the walls of Jericho -- a power so great that nothing can stand before it.<a name=38:1></a> I suppose the enemy very soon realised that his only chance was to corrupt the people of God in order that the power of the ark might not be practically available.<a name=38:2></a> We can see the power of the enemy at Ephesus; the walls of Jericho had fallen at Ephesus with a tremendous crash, but the enemy went to work in a subtle way to displace the ark in the affections of the people of God, so the Lord had to say that they had left their first love.<a name=38:3></a> If the ark lost its place in the affections of the people of God, as happened with Achan, the end must be the extinction of the light.<a name=38:4></a>

		We have considered the spiritual education that the people had for seven days going round Jericho in company with the ark, and listening all the time to the priestly trumpets sounding continually.<a name=38:5></a> They were to learn by this to take account of all the world power, but to take account of it in relation to Christ -- the ark -- so that at the end of the week they could shout.<a name=38:6></a> When we have had a spiritual education, we have to pass our examination at the end of the term.<a name=38:7></a> That is a fixed principle with God; there is always a test.<a name=38:8></a> If there is a special ministry of Christ among the people of God, He will send a test.<a name=38:9></a> God will give seven days of education, a full term, and perhaps His people will learn to shout; but sometimes we shout before we have reached in our hearts what we are shouting about.<a name=38:10></a> Achan perhaps was shouting, but he had not in his heart what he was shouting about.<a name=38:11></a> If he shouted it was in response to the priestly trumpets, and they no doubt announced the glory and the power of the ark.<a name=38:12></a> It is one thing to shout in response to the priestly trumpets  --  to appreciate current ministry and shout in response -- but it is another thing to have the power of it in one's soul.<a name=38:13></a> The test comes, the examination day comes, to see whether we have learned our lesson, whether we have it in our heart.<a name=38:14></a> If there has been a precious ministry of Christ in priestly holiness and power, and the people of God have been educated to the point of shouting in response to an enemy fallen publicly, we may depend on it the enemy will suddenly change his tactics and make another move, a more subtle move, because it is a move in the affections of the people of God, a

		CHAPTER 10
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is very interesting, because though the place the Gibeonites had taken in connection with Israel was taken deceitfully and through want of exercise and enquiry of God on the part of His people, yet God overrules it in order to bring all the force of the enemy into evidence so that they might be completely destroyed.<a name=55:10></a> It shows the wonderful way that God can overrule the introduction of unspiritual elements among His people in order to bring out the power of what is heavenly.<a name=55:11></a> The Gibeonites had no power; they were not able to defend themselves.<a name=55:12></a> They were among the people of God without liberty or power of sonship.<a name=55:13></a> They were like Lot, who had no power when the adversary came.<a name=55:14></a> He fell captive, and, if there had not been a spiritual man not far off with plenty of trained servants, he would have remained in captivity.<a name=55:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have noticed before that three parts of the conflict recorded in this book are brought before us in detail; that is, Jericho, Ai and Gibeon.<a name=58:5></a> All the rest of the conflict is not dwelt on in detail; it is simply recorded that Joshua and all Israel with him moved from one city to another in a course of victory, until it can be said at the end of chapter 11 that the land rested from war.<a name=58:6></a> There were details still to be dealt with, but practically the conflict is over.<a name=58:7></a> The different victories now recorded have the character of overcoming which is to mark the saints; they are to be marked by overcoming and victorious power.<a name=58:8></a> Many times it is said, "Joshua and all Israel" -- the whole company moves together.<a name=58:9></a> At Ai they moved sectionally and there was disaster, but after that they moved altogether.<a name=58:10></a>

		The character of overcoming that belongs to the assembly is typified here; we do not see individual overcoming.<a name=58:11></a> In Ephesians the conflict is assembly conflict, but in Revelation we have ruin and departure and the overcoming becomes individual.<a name=58:12></a> But we are in the light of Ephesians, and every part of the truth is vital in the estimation of all the saints; that is, it is so normally.<a name=58:13></a> If there is conflict in regard of dispossessing the enemy and breaking his power, it is a matter of personal interest to every saint on earth.<a name=58:14></a> Certain things are normal to the whole assembly and each one of us has to come to them individually; but these things belong to the assembly, not to any individual.<a name=58:15></a>

		This answers to the thought of overcoming in John's writings; it would help us if we took account of these chapters in that light.<a name=59:1></a> I believe that overcoming in John's writings is distinctly the warfare of the land, not wilderness warfare.<a name=59:2></a> We have the latter in Romans and Galatians, but in John it is warfare in the land, both in the gospel and in the epistle.<a name=59:3></a> In the gospel of John the Lord Himself is the great Overcomer.<a name=59:4></a> We begin by looking at the ark of Jehovah; we see the will of God brought in in a divine Person in manhood.<a name=59:5></a> We see the Son of God come in flesh; He is the great Overcomer and nothing can stand before Him.<a name=59:6></a> "I have overcome the world" -- that is almost His last word.<a name=59:7></a> He is the great Overcomer, and it is in keeping Him before us that we get power.<a name=59:8></a> I never get power by thinking of the man who cannot overcome, and I may get despondent over it; I shall never get power that way, but weakness.<a name=59:9></a> Power comes in considering the One who says, "I have overcome".<a name=59:10></a> In John's gospel we see the ark of Jehovah, not exactly the ark of the covenant that secures all for man -- that is Luke, but it is the ark of Jehovah, God's will absolutely secured in a Man, His own beloved Son, and nothing can touch that.<a name=59:11></a>

		In John's gospel we find not only the ark of Jehovah, One who can say, "The ruler of this world comes and has nothing in me", but He does not leave this world until He has secured a generation that is no more of the world than He is.<a name=59:12></a> That is the great truth of John's gospel.<a name=59:13></a> The ark of Jehovah is the Son of God.<a name=59:14></a> The man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>is a typical overcomer; he goes step by step in the path of light until he comes into the full light of the Son of God.<a name=59:15></a> In John we have the religious world, not the profane world.<a name=59:16></a>

		CHAPTERS 13 AND 14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of chapter 13 Jehovah says to Joshua, "Thou art old, advanced in days, and there remaineth yet very much land to take possession of".<a name=62:6></a> This seems to indicate the weakening of spiritual lead amongst the people of God.<a name=62:7></a> We find the contrast in Caleb in chapter 14, and this is very encouraging for us, because, if we have to feel deeply that we have no longer the leading of apostolic power, yet we can see in Caleb a spirit that goes through to the end.<a name=62:8></a> I think what is said of Joshua suggests the passing of the energy of spiritual leading found in the apostles.<a name=62:9></a> We can see that every power of darkness fell before the apostles; there was then a spiritual power for leading in the Spirit of Christ that nothing could stand against, but it was not God's way to continue it in the assembly.<a name=62:10></a> My impression is that Caleb represents a spirit that would go right through to the end.<a name=62:11></a> Paul and Timothy very much illustrate it.<a name=62:12></a> Paul was in prison and ready to depart old and advanced in days.<a name=62:13></a> That powerful spiritual leading was about to be removed, but Paul's great exercise was that Timothy should be a true Caleb.<a name=62:14></a> It seems to me an implied contrast between the failing strength of Joshua which is clearly suggested, and the undiminished strength of Caleb which was as strong for war as it was forty-five years before.<a name=62:15></a> There is an undiminished, undecayed energy in Caleb.<a name=62:16></a> It is the Caleb element that we want for the inheritance.<a name=62:17></a>

		Scriptures, but it is interesting to see that what does not pass away is the Caleb spirit.<a name=63:1></a> Joshua does not fight any more after chapter 11.<a name=63:2></a> Now it is a question of taking possession; the power of the enemy has been broken.<a name=63:3></a> In a sense we can say it has been broken by the power of the Spirit in the apostles.<a name=63:4></a>

		Now in the presence of Joshua being old and passing away God calls attention to the dividing of the land by lot.<a name=63:5></a> He calls attention to His own determinate purpose, His own purpose in grace, given to the saints in Christ Jesus -- that answers to the land being divided by lot.<a name=63:6></a> He says to Joshua, "Thou art old and advanced in days and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed of".<a name=63:7></a> Then there is a statement of various parts of the land and then God says, "I will dispossess them before the children of Israel.<a name=63:8></a> Only partition it by lot to the children of Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded thee", verse 6.<a name=63:9></a> This shows that what was in the purpose of God for His people comes into prominence at a time when spiritual leadership may be enfeebled so that when Paul writes 2 Timothy he most emphatically calls attention to the purpose of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=63:10></a> If Paul was going, the purpose of God was not to be changed, or diminished or defeated; it was to be carried through.<a name=63:11></a> Jehovah says here to Joshua, You are going, but I will secure the inheritance for my people.<a name=63:12></a> The point in 2 Timothy is that everything is secured on the line of divine purpose.<a name=63:13></a> That was brought in to encourage Timothy, who was a comparatively feeble vessel.<a name=63:14></a> We see a vessel of extraordinary energy in Paul, but in Timothy a man of tears who needs to be encouraged and exhorted not to be ashamed, exhorted to rekindle the gift that was in him.<a name=63:15></a> It seems to suggest that his faith was burning low because of all the conditions around him.<a name=63:16></a> Paul encourages and strengthens him, and tells him to be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; that goes back to God's purpose.<a name=63:17></a>

		<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#16">Proverbs  16</a>tells us, "The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole decision is of Jehovah".<a name=63:18></a> If it is a question of lot, Jehovah decides; that is firmly established in chapter 13, and in chapters 14 and 15 God works out His purpose through moral conditions.<a name=63:19></a> In Caleb and Achsah his daughter we see moral conditions which are necessary in order that God may effectuate His purposes.<a name=63:20></a> God could not consistently with Himself effectuate His purpose except in moral conditions which are suitable.<a name=63:21></a>

		These incidents which are dealt on in detail are no doubt of very great importance as giving us the principles and the power in which the inheritance can be possessed and enjoyed.<a name=68:15></a> We have considered Caleb in chapter 14, and have seen in him, not simply faith, but the energy of love in which he wholly followed Jehovah.<a name=68:16></a> It is love that can truly take account of the purposes and pleasure of God in regard to the inheritance.<a name=68:17></a> Caleb's heart was commanded by Jehovah, so, if Jehovah had purposed to give the land, it was to Caleb a very good land.<a name=68:18></a> His affections were centred in Jehovah; he really had the spirit of sonship.<a name=68:19></a> He said, "If Jehovah delight in us, he will give us the land"; that is, he looked at it from the standpoint of Jehovah's delight in His people.<a name=68:20></a> I think that it is only love that can enter into God's delight in blessing His people.<a name=68:21></a> Caleb

		It is very significant that this book ends with three burials.<a name=109:14></a> Joseph is buried, and Joshua, and Eleazar.<a name=109:15></a> It is God reminding His people at the very end that none of His thoughts will be effectuated apart from resurrection and a quickened people.<a name=109:16></a> He is reminding us at the end that Joshua did not bring the people into rest.<a name=109:17></a> If the thoughts of God are to be effectuated, it must be through life and incorruptibility being brought to light, and I have no doubt that Joseph had the faith of that.<a name=109:18></a> He realised the "dry bones" condition of Israel and that things could not be put right except in relation to resurrection power and a quickened people.<a name=109:19></a> He tells them to bring his bones into the land.<a name=109:20></a> God will not rest until He has verified every thought in regard to His people, but it will be verified on the principle of resurrection and quickening.<a name=109:21></a> The carrying of Joseph's bones all through the wilderness was the testimony to the people that God would carry through all His thoughts.<a name=109:22></a> He has introduced the covenant to His people, but has introduced it in the power of life and incorruptibility in Christ.<a name=109:23></a> In the meantime it is realised in our spirits as we have in our souls the power of life and incorruptibility in Christ.<a name=109:24></a>

		AN OUTLINE OF THE BOOK OF JUDGES
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Judges corresponds more with the present moment than the book of Joshua.<a name=113:1></a> In the latter we see how the land was entered upon and possessed under Joshua, who would represent the leadership of Christ by the Spirit through the apostles, securing the possession of the inheritance by spiritual power; but now the question arises as to what will happen when that extraordinary leadership of spiritual power is no longer present.<a name=113:2></a> That is the day we are living in.<a name=113:3></a> We have not the apostles now to lead us with the power of Christ, and to secure the inheritance to us.<a name=113:4></a> That was not intended to be permanent.<a name=113:5></a> Joshua grows old and dies, for he represents the order of things that passes away, and the book opens with what takes place after the death of Joshua.<a name=113:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The introduction of the book of Judges is important.<a name=113:7></a> Down to verse 5 of chapter 2 it is a preface which stands by itself, and it would appear that in this opening section of the book God would show us how things can be maintained when we have no longer apostolic authority and leading amongst us.<a name=113:8></a> The first principle is that it is still possible to enquire of God.<a name=113:9></a> It is a striking feature which is suggested to us at the opening of the book; the children of Israel asked Jehovah saying, "Which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?<a name=113:10></a>" They enquired of Jehovah; that is the first principle of security and of spiritual guidance -- the first principle on which the inheritance can be secured.<a name=113:11></a> Paul is our Joshua, and in bidding farewell to the Ephesian elders he says, "I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give to you an inheritance among all the sanctified", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:32">Acts  20:32</a>.<a name=113:12></a> It is a question of being directly cast on God; that is the first principle of security and blessing.<a name=113:13></a> In the Spirit of Christ things can be maintained, but it is a spirit of entire dependence.<a name=113:14></a> If apostles go, God remains.<a name=113:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The outlook of this chapter is that conflict is all before us.<a name=113:16></a> The enquiry is how the conflict is to be carried on.<a name=113:17></a> The enemies are all present, and it is a question now of how the war is to be carried on.<a name=113:18></a> With no Joshua to lead, they are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=114>[Page 114]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		directly cast on God.<a name=114:1></a> That is our position; we are directly cast on God, and that is our great security.<a name=114:2></a> It would preserve us from all defection.<a name=114:3></a> Before the history of failure is given, great principles are set forth that would preserve from failure; if we stand by them they will stand by us.<a name=114:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of that beautiful spirit of dependence in which they enquired is that God is with Judah.<a name=114:5></a> Divine principles can only be carried out in dependence.<a name=114:6></a> The more correct my principles are, the more I shall fail if I am not in dependence.<a name=114:7></a> There is often a great admixture of self-confidence when a person professes to be so sure of having the Lord's mind.<a name=114:8></a> It is often divorced from the spirit of dependence and readiness to be guided and built up by the word of His grace.<a name=114:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were directly enquiring of God; there is no priest mentioned here.<a name=114:10></a> That is our privilege.<a name=114:11></a> We cannot do as they did at Corinth; they wrote to the apostle, and had a long letter back, answering their questions authoritatively.<a name=114:12></a> We cannot do that; we have no apostles.<a name=114:13></a> We are directly cast on God, and I think it is expedient for us that we have not the apostles.<a name=114:14></a> The Lord has told us that it was expedient for Him to go away, and I think it is expedient that the apostles went, so that we might be cast on God directly.<a name=114:15></a> It is the rock principle, for possession of the inheritance -- to be cast on God.<a name=114:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second great preservative principle is that we recognise the brotherhood.<a name=114:17></a> A person might say, I go on with God, but are you going on with your brethren?<a name=114:18></a> We must not move without our brethren.<a name=114:19></a> While it remains true that we can get everything from God -- in an abstract sense everything comes from God, even help from the brethren -- but we not only get help from God, but from our brethren.<a name=114:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Judah needed help from Simeon his brother.<a name=114:21></a> Simeon had something Judah had not, but what Simeon had was necessary to Judah's success in getting the inheritance.<a name=114:22></a> It is a great principle of safety for us to recognise what is in our brother.<a name=114:23></a> When the Lord was going away He gave us a preservative commandment.<a name=114:24></a> He had been the centre for holding them together by the power of His own love, so when He was going away He said that the essential thing for us is to love one another.<a name=114:25></a> He would have us recognise the essentiality of the brotherhood.<a name=114:26></a> That is the principle that comes, not only into conflict, but into service.<a name=114:27></a> Judah showed his affection for his brother under circumstances that added lustre to it, because
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		he had to give up part of his inheritance to Simeon.<a name=115:1></a> He had such a big inheritance; but he is quite unjealous of Simeon, because he calls him in as a brother.<a name=115:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Judah derived pre-eminence from his prince -- Caleb.<a name=115:3></a> Caleb is the first man in the wilderness who showed that his heart was wholly set on the inheritance.<a name=115:4></a> What was before Caleb was the way Jehovah was moving, and Caleb was wholly following Him in it.<a name=115:5></a> The presence of Caleb at the head of Judah gave Judah pre-eminence in regard to the acquisition of the inheritance.<a name=115:6></a> It is not here so much a question of faith but of love.<a name=115:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here at the beginning we have these great principles which would safeguard the inheritance dependence on God, and the recognition of the brethren.<a name=115:8></a> I <i>need</i> my brethren, and then we have the Spirit as maintaining things in freshness.<a name=115:9></a> Historically this incident about Achsah took place before the death of Joshua, and that reminds us that Scripture was written by inspiration.<a name=115:10></a> Certain things are put together here morally.<a name=115:11></a> If we lose the leadership of the apostles we do not lose God, nor the brotherhood, nor the Spirit of God and what He can do for us; and all these things will enable us to overcome every hostile power.<a name=115:12></a> So the inheritance can be fully possessed, even though outwardly it is a day of weakness, and the apostles are gone.<a name=115:13></a> It is only through conflict that anything has been maintained; everything connected in any way with the inheritance has been fought for.<a name=115:14></a> If we personally have not fought for it, others have had to fight for us.<a name=115:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the book of Judges God said He would leave some of the enemies in the land so that there would be the necessity for conflict.<a name=115:16></a> That applies in principle to the church.<a name=115:17></a> God will never suffer the inheritance to be possessed without conflict.<a name=115:18></a> If we give up conflict, we give place to the Canaanite.<a name=115:19></a> Many of our brethren have secured a good deal of immunity from conflict; they have declined conflict, but they have lost the inheritance.<a name=115:20></a> Peace at any price is not the way to get the inheritance.<a name=115:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we cease to acquire fresh territory, the enemy will soon turn the tables on us.<a name=115:22></a> We see in this book how the enemy turned the tables on them.<a name=115:23></a> It first began by their not attacking the enemy, and it is not long before the Canaanite insists on dwelling there; he becomes aggressive.<a name=115:24></a> If we are not aggressive the enemy will be.<a name=115:25></a> But it is not fighting all the time; a time of conflict is followed by a time of rest.<a name=115:26></a> The land had
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=116>[Page 116]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		rest for so many years.<a name=116:1></a> If there is conflict, then there is rest, for God delights to give rest to His people, so that what is acquired by conflict can be enjoyed, not only possessed.<a name=116:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For instance, many years ago, when there was a ministry which sought to call attention to the blessedness of eternal life, that it might not be a mere word to us, but a life of blessedness to be enjoyed, what a battle there was!<a name=116:3></a> The question now is, Have we taken possession of what the battle was about?<a name=116:4></a> Have we the good now after forty years of what was fought for then?<a name=116:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The seven nations represent the complete power of evil, hostile to the pleasure of God in His people.<a name=116:6></a> The enemies are not altogether external -- the force of all these powers operates through the flesh.<a name=116:7></a> Whatever principle of evil there may be, there is that in my flesh that would join hands with it.<a name=116:8></a> I have to realise there is something in me that would be ready to join hands and tolerate any evil.<a name=116:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything goes on victoriously down to a certain point.<a name=116:10></a> In verse 19 we see the first sign of weakness: "He did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron".<a name=116:11></a> It is the first sign of weakness -- to be impressed by the strength and power of what is opposed to you.<a name=116:12></a> We ought to be impressed by the sense of the power of God.<a name=116:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Caleb was not in evidence then.<a name=116:14></a> He did not fail to take possession of his portion of the inheritance.<a name=116:15></a> Caleb is separated from the failure, and singled out as one who did not participate in it.<a name=116:16></a> It is good to know that Caleb does not die.<a name=116:17></a> Caleb is still alive.<a name=116:18></a> If Joshua dies, there is no mention in Scripture about the death of Caleb.<a name=116:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The upper and nether springs come in in connection with Caleb.<a name=116:20></a> His daughter, Achsah, represents the subjective state in the people of God that feels the need of the Spirit.<a name=116:21></a> She wanted springs of water.<a name=116:22></a> There is something positive about that; it is not exactly conflict, but springs of water are given for refreshment, that the land should be fertile; it is on the positive side.<a name=116:23></a> We should not be content to say we have the Spirit.<a name=116:24></a> As redeemed, and as believers on the Lord Jesus Christ, we have the Spirit, but we want springs, the flow of the upper and nether springs, and we shall not be preserved from the failure of the book of Judges if we have not the springs really flowing.<a name=116:25></a> The great fruit of the Spirit is eternal life;

		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is the demonstration of what the Spirit can do for the saints.<a name=117:1></a> Scripture says that eternal life is of the Spirit.<a name=117:2></a> "He that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:9">Galatians  6:9</a>.<a name=117:3></a> Caleb suffers no defeat; he is an overcomer.<a name=117:4></a> I trust we are anxious to be overcomers, lest the conflict find us out.<a name=117:5></a> If we do not overcome, we shall go under.<a name=117:6></a> Caleb never went under, and there is no need for <i>us</i> to go under.<a name=117:7></a> The Lord had to point out the sad condition of the assemblies in the book of Revelation, and He faithfully pointed out every defect.<a name=117:8></a> We shall see all the features of departure in this book of Judges, but He never left one assembly without an overcomer, showing that a state of things will never be permitted that will swamp what is of God.<a name=117:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I am wrong at one stage I shall not be able to go on to the next.<a name=117:10></a> We see here the extraordinary power that there was with the people to deal with an extraordinary power of evil, and they secured things of great importance.<a name=117:11></a> Jerusalem was taken, and Hebron secured.<a name=117:12></a> It is a great thing to clear away all pretenders and opposers, and to secure a place where the Lord's Name alone is to be honoured.<a name=117:13></a> Jerusalem in Scripture is the city of the great King, the place where Jehovah would set His Name.<a name=117:14></a> Then Hebron, meaning <i>Company</i>, would answer to the truth of fellowship.<a name=117:15></a> If we have what is due to the Lord's Name first, then we can have the truth of fellowship.<a name=117:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What one has proved in the past makes one tremble; and conflict is testing, because it is easy to get into a spirit in conflict which is not of God.<a name=117:17></a> We see here that what is of the flesh comes down -- the pretentiousness of the flesh even in the region of what is of God.<a name=117:18></a> There are things which exalt themselves against the knowledge of God.<a name=117:19></a> Such a man as Adoni-bezek had seventy kings under his table.<a name=117:20></a> He represents the extraordinary ascendency of the man after the flesh in a sphere which belonged to God, but when he comes to Jerusalem he dies.<a name=117:21></a> When what is due to the Lord's Name is recognised, all that kind of thing dies.<a name=117:22></a> There was no repentance, but he recognised the justice of his punishment, and all those who come under the government of God will have to own the justice of it.<a name=117:23></a> God is not mocked.<a name=117:24></a> We need not think anything will fail to produce its appropriate fruit.<a name=117:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking of the epistle of John in connection with Judges.<a name=117:26></a> John warns us against the inroads of the enemy, who has to be dispossessed, but he shows that we can have anything

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that a few saints can walk together without human order is marvellous.<a name=118:9></a> We can understand people keeping together with conditions of rule or worldly principles -- friends, plenty of amusement, social links, etc.<a name=118:10></a> -- but for people of different characters and temperaments to keep together in the truth is a great marvel; it is the power of God.<a name=118:11></a> No power could keep them together but the power of God.<a name=118:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen that the failure of the church came in after the apostles passed away; here it is after the death of Joshua.<a name=118:13></a> Evidently the first sign of weakness is that they could not drive out the enemy, "the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron"; but in the same verse we read that "Jehovah was with Judah".<a name=118:14></a> The power of God was there, but they did not take account of it, and I believe that was the first defection in the assembly -- failure to take account of the power of God by the Spirit.<a name=118:15></a> If Jehovah was with His people, what were chariots of iron!<a name=118:16></a> Thy might as well have been made of tissue paper.<a name=118:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Judah failed to recognise the power of God as present by the Spirit.<a name=118:18></a> That was the initial failure of the church.<a name=118:19></a> The Spirit was with the people of God, though dishonoured and ignored.<a name=118:20></a> In the earliest writings that followed the days of the apostles, we do not find the recognition of the presence and power of the Spirit.<a name=118:21></a> It is a great thing to recognise that the power of the chariots of iron is nothing if God is dwelling in His people by the Spirit.<a name=118:22></a> John speaks of it in relation to many antichrists; but then he says, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:4">1 John  4:4</a>.<a name=118:23></a>

		The recognition of the presence of the Spirit would produce suitable conditions.<a name=118:24></a> Does not Paul bring it before the Corinthians on that line?<a name=118:25></a> He calls them to recognise the presence of the Spirit as the means to bring about definite suitable

		Then there is this remarkable incident of Jael at the end of the chapter.<a name=134:19></a> Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, and her husband had made a move of separation.<a name=134:20></a> They had separated from those mentioned in chapter 1, verse 16, who "had gone up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad, and they went and dwelt with the people".<a name=134:21></a> There seems to have been an exercise to be in definite separation.<a name=134:22></a> So Heber leaves those mixed up with the people, and takes a more definite place of separation, and is a tent-dweller.<a name=134:23></a> There was a spiritual history behind Jael's act.<a name=134:24></a> There was a measure of separation; still, there is peace between Heber and Sisera.<a name=134:25></a> There is another link to be separated; Jael had another step to take.<a name=134:26></a> Souls often move in a measure of separation, and sometimes

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the history of Samson there is a very marked contrast between his exploits and his personal character.<a name=173:1></a> The Spirit of God would suggest to us that we must distinguish between what was done by Samson by divine power and the weakness that was in Samson himself.<a name=173:2></a> His personal weakness was a great contrast to his spiritual power.<a name=173:3></a> So it would seem as if his history is in two parts, which in a sense have to be looked at separately.<a name=173:4></a> We see in Samson something greater than the weakness that marked him as a man.<a name=173:5></a> Perhaps it would be well if we looked first at the incidents in his history which are characterised by spiritual actings; and then consider the other side, those incidents in which we see Samson beguiled again and again into utterly false positions.<a name=173:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noticeable that there are three occasions where it is said that the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him.<a name=173:7></a> There is a preliminary statement in the end of the previous chapter "the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him", chapter 13:25.<a name=173:8></a> That is before he came out in public service; it was in his own home.<a name=173:9></a> He is moved by the Spirit before he undertakes any exploits.<a name=173:10></a> We see the principle of that even in the Lord; there were spiritual movements in Him before He came out in public service.<a name=173:11></a> The private precedes the public.<a name=173:12></a> We are apt to put what is public forward, but we see Samson in private moved by the Spirit of God; there are exercises that no one knows anything about.<a name=173:13></a> "The child grew" -- that would suggest that he is growing up under the blessing of Jehovah and the Spirit moving him.<a name=173:14></a> I think the home circle is where spiritual movements will first be found.<a name=173:15></a> The prominent feature in Samson is strength; he is marked by power.<a name=173:16></a> What comes out in him is of the greatest importance to us in the last days.<a name=173:17></a>

		In 2 Timothy stress is laid on power, and we learn there the character of the Philistines, those who are opposed to the testimony of the Lord, not so much outside as inside.<a name=173:18></a> Divine power is needed to overcome them, so there is repeated reference to power.<a name=173:19></a> "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power", and then, "suffer evil along with the glad tidings according to the power of God" -- and in the last chapter, "the Lord stood with me and gave me power".<a name=173:20></a>

		The power spoken of in 2 Timothy is an inward power rather than what is outward.<a name=178:5></a> I have known several instances of men who have served and been used of God, but when they had been withdrawn from what is external it came to light that they had very little of what was internal.<a name=178:6></a> Samson was one with a most extraordinary power -- there is not a man in Scripture who externally had such strength -- but, notwithstanding that, he was conscious inwardly that his heart was unsatisfied and he was a thirsty man.<a name=178:7></a> He has to call, and then, in type, he gets the Spirit in a new way in connection with what is inward -- not power to do great exploits outwardly, but to satisfy his inward cravings.<a name=178:8></a> My impression is that in Samson calling on the Lord we see something morally greater than his killing thousands of Philistines.<a name=178:9></a> However much God is pleased to use me publicly, sooner or later the question is raised, Have I the thirst of my soul satisfied?<a name=178:10></a> Have I the Spirit inwardly, not only for outward power; that is "the caller's spring", a beautiful designation of the Spirit.<a name=178:11></a>

		We are so apt to go on with what is outward, but I believe a time comes with every one of us when we are brought face to face with this question: I have had meetings, and they have been very precious; I have had the companionship of the brethren, and it was very sweet; I have had ministry and it has been happy; I have had the power for service and it has been wonderful, but I am not satisfied.<a name=178:12></a> None of these things or all put together will give inward satisfaction.<a name=178:13></a> Inward satisfaction would not detract from the power God gives for service; it would add to it.<a name=178:14></a> I think it was a poet who said, "All great deeds flow from the centre of a quiet heart".<a name=178:15></a> It is from a quiet, restful, and satisfied heart that the most efficient service flows; we want the caller's spring.<a name=178:16></a>

		In connection with this incident we find a remarkable little phrase which often occurs in the Old Testament, "to this day".<a name=179:11></a> These words have a moral force and indicate that the matter which is spoken of has a permanent place in the ways of God with His people.<a name=179:12></a> It is available for us now.<a name=179:13></a> The spring subsists morally unto this day; the Spirit as "the caller's spring" is there to this day.<a name=179:14></a> I would encourage all our hearts to entertain thoughts of the Spirit as "the caller's spring".<a name=179:15></a> We know a little what it is to be supported in our testimony and in our conflicts; but what is inside me is more important as far as I am concerned personally than anything I do in conflict outwardly.<a name=179:16></a> We see in Stephen the two things.<a name=179:17></a> There was an extraordinary power in his testimony; he goes through the whole history of the people and presses their guilt on them at every turn, but, great as Stephen's testimony is, he himself inwardly is as great, when he kneels down while they batter him with stones.<a name=179:18></a> That angelic face shines with the light of heaven while their murderous stones batter on it, and he cries, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge".<a name=179:19></a> When you read that wonderful address, one of the most marvellous chapters in Scripture, you see the man in his extraordinary power.<a name=179:20></a> He is a king among men.<a name=179:21></a> When you see him kneel in prayer, you see the wonderful inwardness of him; Stephen inwardly is as great as Stephen outwardly.<a name=179:22></a>

		If we look at the weaknesses that come out in Samson, we find that he was tested in three ways.<a name=180:5></a> The Philistine woman in chapter 14 represents what is natural; the harlot of chapter 16 represents what is carnal; and Delilah represents what is Satanic, for from the outset she is identified with the adversary and does her utmost to destroy Samson.<a name=180:6></a> God by His ways delivers His servant from each of these three snares.<a name=180:7></a> Samson's weakness left him open to these influences, but that which was of God in him extricated him in each case from the snare.<a name=180:8></a> Satan will use either the natural or the carnal or the Satanic in order to undermine the truth of Nazariteship.<a name=180:9></a> He will try to rob us of our Nazariteship until he has done for us.<a name=180:10></a> But we see in Samson that, in spite of all the weakness that came out in him, there is something else there and God delivers him.<a name=180:11></a>

		God delivers him from the Philistine woman in chapter 14 by keen disappointment.<a name=180:12></a> Samson did not get what he expected; he was keenly disappointed when he found he had a woman who betrayed his secret, and he was disappointed when he found that she was given to his companion.<a name=180:13></a> Many of us have known what it is to be influenced on the line of what is natural, and we have found on that line nothing but disappointment; we did not get a single thing that we expected.<a name=180:14></a> That is how God delivered us from the natural.<a name=180:15></a>

		AN OUTLINE OF THE BOOK OF RUTH
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must all have noticed a striking contrast between the book of Judges and the one we have now before us.<a name=195:1></a> In Judges we see repeated departures of the people of God, and Jehovah's gracious intervention in raising up deliverers to relieve the oppression of His afflicted people.<a name=195:2></a> But we do not see anywhere in the book of Judges recovery to the normal enjoyment of the inheritance.<a name=195:3></a> The judges were not wholly types of Christ, even Gideon led the people into a snare.<a name=195:4></a> There are incidents in their history which may be viewed as typical of certain things connected with Christ, but the judges were marked by defects, though God used them as instruments to deliver His people in their generation.<a name=195:5></a> Not one of them was great enough to reinstate the people in the enjoyment of the inheritance according to God.<a name=195:6></a> But in the book of Ruth there is recovery of the inheritance.<a name=195:7></a> One is found great enough to exercise the right of redemption, to redeem the inheritance and to secure a seed to enjoy it.<a name=195:8></a> And there is a peculiarly attractive charm about the book which appeals even to those who are not able to perceive its spiritual import.<a name=195:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the book of Judges not only did no redeemer appear great enough to restore fully according to God that which had been departed from, but, on the other hand, moral conditions suitable to divine recovery were not present in the people.<a name=195:10></a> What marks Judges is the statement that every man did what was right in his own eyes.<a name=195:11></a> There could be no true recovery or reinstatement in such a condition; and, alas!<a name=195:12></a> it is a condition that very largely bars the way to recovery of the inheritance at the present time amongst the people of God.<a name=195:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Movement on the line of recovery is brought about by such dealings of God as are seen in <a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#1">Ruth  1</a>.<a name=195:14></a> Brokenness of spirit -- a broken and contrite heart under the dealings of God -- is an absolute necessity, and it is the preparation for all recovery.<a name=195:15></a> If we belonged to a profession that had not failed, and if we ourselves had not failed, there would be no such history as we see pictured in this chapter.<a name=195:16></a> But if it be true that we belong to a profession that has grievously failed and departed from

		God and lost the enjoyment of the inheritance, and we ourselves have so failed as to have personally contributed to the general state of departure, there is surely a loud call to humble ourselves in self-judgment before God.<a name=196:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing more common today than for people to assert that the churches are moving on, and that, indeed, things have greatly developed in a favourable direction.<a name=196:2></a> The false church says, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:7">Revelation  18:7</a>.<a name=196:3></a> We are surrounded by the boastings of Laodicea.<a name=196:4></a> "I am rich, and am grown rich, and have need of nothing".<a name=196:5></a> But the Lord says, "Thou art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:17">Revelation  3:17</a>.<a name=196:6></a> If there is no sense of departure there will be no desire for recovery.<a name=196:7></a> But if under the dealings of God our true condition is brought home to us, and we are humble and contrite in heart, there is something that God can acknowledge and restore.<a name=196:8></a> We see this in Naomi.<a name=196:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Elimelech means, Whose God is King, and Naomi means, My pleasantness.<a name=196:10></a> They represent the original state of Israel as called of God into His favour.<a name=196:11></a> God acted in kingly power to bring to pass His own thought of blessing.<a name=196:12></a> Balaam said of Israel in his parable, "Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in his midst".<a name=196:13></a> All through their history we can see that their God is King.<a name=196:14></a> Whether in His actings for them in Egypt, or in the wilderness, or His setting them in the land, all is the exercise of His kingly power.<a name=196:15></a> Then Naomi -- my pleasantness -- speaks of the people as a delight to God.<a name=196:16></a> That was how they came into the inheritance.<a name=196:17></a> God acted in kingly power doing everything for them, and on their side as responsive to Him in the bond of the covenant they were pleasant in His sight.<a name=196:18></a> That was their original status.<a name=196:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what a change in the chapter before us!<a name=196:20></a> We see here God the King acting governmentally according to the sorrowful conditions which existed among His people.<a name=196:21></a> There are two sides to the truth of the kingdom.<a name=196:22></a> As the "King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God" He acts to bring about the blessing of His people.<a name=196:23></a> But, on the other hand, His being King involves His government, and if conditions are present which are not pleasing to Him His governmental dealings in an adverse sense are inevitable.<a name=196:24></a> It was so in Israel; it is so in the assembly.<a name=196:25></a> Under the government of God there was famine even in Bethlehem -- the house of bread -- and Elimelech went

	<div class="paragraph">
		out from the inheritance to sojourn in the fields of Moab.<a name=197:1></a> It is sad when there is famine in the place where we would most expect to find food.<a name=197:2></a> But the government of God acts inevitably and universally according to the conditions present in His people.<a name=197:3></a> How good it is to see, as in the history before us, that even the government of God eventually subserves the purposes of His grace.<a name=197:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Naomi found herself bereft both of her husband and her sons.<a name=197:5></a> Famine-stricken, an exile from the inheritance, widowed, empty of all but the sad memory of better and brighter days in the past!<a name=197:6></a> What a pathetic picture!<a name=197:7></a> "I am in much more bitterness than you; for the hand of Jehovah is gone out against me".<a name=197:8></a> "Call me not Naomi -- call me Mara (Bitterness) for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.<a name=197:9></a> I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me home again empty.<a name=197:10></a> Why do ye call me Naomi, seeing Jehovah has brought me low, and the Almighty has afflicted me?<a name=197:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the dealings of God exercises were produced in the soul of Naomi -- a deep sense of what had been lost, and of the hand of God upon her.<a name=197:12></a> Such exercises as these are necessary before restoration can come about.<a name=197:13></a> No doubt this book has reference to God's dealings with Israel.<a name=197:14></a> Israel at the present moment is impoverished, scattered far and wide from the inheritance, bereft of all divine support and consolation, and in a future day they will have to pass through even more intense sorrow and tribulation, but God will eventually use these things to bring them into such true contrition that He will be free to reinstate them in full blessing through Christ.<a name=197:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if this book refers in a typical way to Israel's departure and restoration through Christ, the actings of grace which are brought out in such a sweet and touching way have their place also with saints who are of the assembly.<a name=197:16></a> The way of recovery is, in principle, the same for ourselves as for Israel.<a name=197:17></a> We cannot read the epistles without seeing how greatly the people of God in this period have departed from the truth, and lost the enjoyment of the inheritance that was freely given to them of God.<a name=197:18></a> The Lord's words to the assemblies in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 have a solemn bearing on this.<a name=197:19></a> An urgent call to repentance appears in five of them.<a name=197:20></a> If we have not some sense of departure we shall not fully appreciate the grace of recovery which shines so brightly in the book of Ruth.<a name=197:21></a> Alas!<a name=197:22></a> we are so often occupied in seeking our own things, and doing it in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Naomi sets forth the deep exercises which will be found in those who listen to the Lord's words to the assemblies, and who realise that they belong to a profession that has grievously failed, and that they are suffering the deprivation of much that was the enjoyed inheritance of saints at the beginning.<a name=198:2></a> The sad truth of the position was pressed home on the soul of Naomi; she was made to feel it deeply.<a name=198:3></a> Instead of the inheritance being abundantly fruitful in every good, it had ceased to yield its harvests.<a name=198:4></a> "There was a famine IN THE LAND".<a name=198:5></a> Strange and sad contrast to the fertility which had been pledged to obedient and faithful lovers of Jehovah!<a name=198:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For a Bethlehemite to be sojourning in the fields of Moab was far from the thoughts of God for His people.<a name=198:7></a> It was in itself the evidence that His people had departed from Him, and His blessing had been withdrawn from them.<a name=198:8></a> The inheritance had not only failed of the blessing of God, but they had left it, to go to a land whose inhabitants were of such a character under the eye of God that they were forbidden to come into His congregation; "even their tenth generation shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah for ever", <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#23:3">Deuteronomy  23:3</a>.<a name=198:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God's governmental dealings continued in the land of Moab.<a name=198:10></a> Elimelech died and also his two sons; no seed remained capable of taking up the inheritance.<a name=198:11></a> On the line of God's government all was lost, and there was no vestige of hope save in that pure sovereignty of goodness which caused God to act graciously for His people, not because of any deserving on their side, or any ability on their part to win back what had been departed from, but just because of what He was in Himself.<a name=198:12></a> It was wholly on this ground that Jehovah "visited his people to give them bread".<a name=198:13></a> And who could appreciate the tidings of this more than one who had learned in bitterness what it was to be alienated from the land, to be bereft and empty?<a name=198:14></a> Though Naomi was exiled, and bereft of all hope on the natural line, she still cherished Jehovah and the inheritance of Israel in her heart, so that as soon as she heard of His gracious visitation of His people it set her in movement.<a name=198:15></a> She yearned for good that had been known in the past; Jehovah and His land were still precious and attractive

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ruth came in as having no claim at all, for she was a Moabitess, but as one who had learned that it was blessed to trust under the wings of the God of Israel.<a name=199:3></a> If God's own people had forfeited the inheritance through lack of love for Him there was encouragement to believe that even a Moabite who loved Him would be graciously received.<a name=199:4></a> He would welcome a lover whatever the past history of that lover might have been!<a name=199:5></a> She and Naomi were both widows; there was no seed to inherit; the succession had apparently hopelessly failed.<a name=199:6></a> Then what remained?<a name=199:7></a> The attraction of Jehovah, the link with His people, all that had been brought to her, and represented to her, by those who loved Jehovah, though in exile and bereavement under His hand.<a name=199:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ruth was prepared to give up natural hopes in order to have part with the people of God even in sorrow and affliction.<a name=199:9></a> There were no outward prospects of any kind to attract her.<a name=199:10></a> Hers was a purely spiritual affection for that which in widowhood and sorrow had become more to her heart than the people and country and gods of Moab.<a name=199:11></a> Spiritual affections -- awakened in a heart that had no claim of any kind -- led her to breakaway from everything that was not of God, and to come to take refuge under His wings.<a name=199:12></a> In her father-in-law she had learned  -- may we not say?<a name=199:13></a> -- how kingly was Israel's God, how far above the degraded Chemosh of the Moabites, whose worship consisted in the grossest impurities.<a name=199:14></a> In her husband Mahlon (mild) she had learned to appreciate a character which became more attractive to her than the arrogance of Moab (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#16:6">Isaiah  16:6</a>.<a name=199:15></a>) She had dealt kindly with the dead -- evidently as appreciating what was set forth in them -- and this was a characteristic which only needed following up to bring her to full blessing.<a name=199:16></a> Then she had learned in Naomi how to value the God-given inheritance by seeing the deep exercises of one who had left it, and who was submitting in sorrow to the action of God's government, feeling the loss of the inheritance, but cherishing in her heart the thought of redemption.<a name=199:17></a> All this was binding her heart to Jehovah and to His people; it was forming her in

		The conduct of Ruth in chapter 3 represents that of souls who have learned that all depends on Christ exercising in favour and power the right of redemption.<a name=209:1></a> She came, encouraged by the favour shown her, and by Naomi, to claim that he should exercise that right on her behalf.<a name=209:2></a> She would avail herself of God's provision in grace, conscious that as towards her all was unmerited favour, but yet having the moral suitability of "a woman of worth"; this was known in all "the gate of my people", verse 11.<a name=209:3></a> She came to Boaz as "winnowing barley in the threshing-floor", reminding us of Him "whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:12">Matthew  3:12</a>.<a name=209:4></a> He will get rid of all chaff; He will burn it with fire unquenchable; what is morally worthless will have no place with Him.<a name=209:5></a> It is better to be winnowed by Christ than to be sifted by Satan.<a name=209:6></a> Christ winnows to get rid of the chaff; Satan sifts that, if possible, he may get rid of the wheat.<a name=209:7></a> A "woman of worth" would come to light as being prepared to face all that is involved in the winnowing process, and such would be acceptable in His sight.<a name=209:8></a> Christ would displace all that is unsuitable to Himself.<a name=209:9></a> There may be a good deal that seems to be suitable, but when tested under threshing it is found to be but chaff which has to be eliminated.<a name=209:10></a> Ruth represents one who is prepared to be winnowed.<a name=209:11></a> And on her side, as washed, anointed, and robed, there were suitable moral conditions.<a name=209:12></a> For all such He can be counted upon to "shew thee what thou shalt do", and to "complete the matter this day".<a name=209:13></a>

		It is striking that, as we have before remarked, Ruth takes the initiative in all this.<a name=209:14></a> The Spirit of God would bring prominently before us the fruit of His working, in that she moved affectionately and diligently after what was of God, and to acquire for herself all that was available through His favour.<a name=209:15></a> Spiritual things are available today; Christ is available, the Holy Spirit is available, the inheritance is available; in a certain sense we may say that the assembly is available.<a name=209:16></a> Now have we the state of heart seen in Ruth which will go in wholeheartedly for all that is available?<a name=209:17></a> Christ would say to us, "I love those that love me; and they that seek me early shall find me.<a name=209:18></a> Riches and honour are with me; durable wealth and righteousness.<a name=209:19></a> My fruit is better than

		Lowliness, subjection and modesty were seen in Ruth; she had beautiful moral qualities, but, withal, a state of heart that would miss nothing which divine goodness and wealth put within her reach.<a name=210:3></a> She got every encouragement from Boaz.<a name=210:4></a> "And now, my daughter, fear not; all that thou sayest will I do to thee"; and he gave her six measures of barley.<a name=210:5></a> She returned to Naomi enriched, and with evidence that she had his full approval in what she was pursuing.<a name=210:6></a> It is a comfort to know that the Lord Jesus recognises every spiritual desire, even in one who is not yet in full rest and liberty.<a name=210:7></a> Do you think it is nothing to Christ if one can really say, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man?<a name=210:8></a>" How much more if there is distinct desire for Himself?<a name=210:9></a> To such a one He would give a distinct expression of His interest and concern, and a pledge that He will see the matter through.<a name=210:10></a> Such may be learning and feeling that they have no rights and no power, but the Lord has His eye upon them, and He will surely see the matter through, and bring their exercises to fruition.<a name=210:11></a> When we have no one before us but Christ, He says, "I will do everything for you".<a name=210:12></a>

		When Ruth learned that the one who had been so gracious to her was a kinsman with the right of redemption she was encouraged to put herself in the place of one who needed him, and who desired to be under his wing.<a name=210:13></a> She had then no more to do in the matter; it all rested with him.<a name=210:14></a> "Be still, my daughter .<a name=210:15></a>.<a name=210:16></a>.<a name=210:17></a> for the man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day".<a name=210:18></a> When a divinely taught soul has its affections powerfully drawn to what is of God, and has come to the apprehension of Christ as the Kinsman with the right of redemption, and is ready to avail itself of Him, the whole matter then rests with Him.<a name=210:19></a> Everything must be taken up in such a way that the honour of it belongs alone to Christ.<a name=210:20></a> He will act for those who love Him, and secure to them all that their hearts desire, even at such a time as we are living in.<a name=210:21></a> When affections move simply and whole-heartedly towards Christ He undertakes everything.<a name=210:22></a>

		But then we have to learn that nothing but Christ and a definite personal link with Him, will avail.<a name=211:1></a> We have to learn under divine teaching the utter inadequacy of the legal principle, and this is brought out typically in chapter 4.<a name=211:2></a> Man has the knowledge of good and evil, and conscience applies this to responsibility.<a name=211:3></a> Every man knows he ought to do what is good, and not to do what is evil.<a name=211:4></a> The law put that into formal shape, and held men definitely responsible to God for their actions and even their desires.<a name=211:5></a> This is represented by the one who had the prior claim in the case of Ruth; the law is nearer to us naturally than Christ.<a name=211:6></a> It is true that Gentiles have never been put under the law by God, but obligation to do what is right is upon all men by the knowledge of good and evil, and by conscience.<a name=211:7></a> Many of us have the light of Christianity as the standard of what we ought to be and do.<a name=211:8></a> The natural man would say, That is quite enough.<a name=211:9></a> Many would tell us we have only to use our inward perceptions and keep a good conscience, and we shall be all right!<a name=211:10></a> But we have to learn that we have no power.<a name=211:11></a> The law, or any kind of obligation you can think of, cannot undertake to meet conditions which are exactly opposite to what they ought to be.<a name=211:12></a> That principle cannot do anything for a dead man so that his name shall be raised up upon his inheritance.<a name=211:13></a> If death has come in, the raising up of the name of the dead involves a power of life in Another on his behalf which is, typically, resurrection power, and it is such power that is in Christ as the true Boaz.<a name=211:14></a> The object of the statute in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#25:5">Deuteronomy  25:5</a>, 6, was that the inheritance might be secured to one upon whom death had come, "that his name be not blotted out from Israel".<a name=211:15></a> This was pure grace acting in regard of one dead; the legal principle could do nothing in such a case.<a name=211:16></a> So the nearest kinsman -- representing the law, or the legal principle -- says, twice over, "I cannot redeem it".<a name=211:17></a> He drew off his sandal, as much as to say, I have no standing in such a case as this; I must give place to another.<a name=211:18></a>

		And if, like Israel, the saints of the present period have lost the possession and enjoyment of their God-given portion, the way is open for Naomis and Ruths to return, and to find that a Kinsman lives who delights to secure to them in Himself as risen and glorified all the wealth that they have departed from.<a name=213:2></a> This book belongs to the time of the judges; that is, it stands in relation to a time of failure and departure.<a name=213:3></a> It shows how love will reach Christ and find Him sufficient for everything -- sufficient to secure the enjoyment of the inheritance for us, sufficient to answer perfectly every affectionate desire for what is of God, sufficient, by giving us the Spirit, to constitute us suitable heirs.<a name=213:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>we see that saints are suitable to inherit; they are sons and children, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ; the living seed is there.<a name=213:5></a> Estates fall into Chancery when there is no heir whose title can be established.<a name=213:6></a> Without heirs the inheritance would lapse; God's thought would be invalidated.<a name=213:7></a> This could never be, and the effect of reaching Christ as the true Boaz, and being married to Him, is that a seed is secured that is not under death, but which is capable of enjoying the inheritance.<a name=213:8></a> A son is born (chapter 4: 13) who has the right of redemption, for the women said, "Blessed be Jehovah who hath not left thee this day without one that has the right of redemption, and may his name be famous in Israel", verse 14.<a name=213:9></a> This refers to Obed, the son brought forth.<a name=213:10></a> It is a beautiful and interesting suggestion; the right of redemption is clearly viewed in two different ways.<a name=213:11></a> As attaching to Boaz it is typical of what is available in Christ as the Kinsman.<a name=213:12></a> But as attaching to Obed (Worshipper or Servant) it is typical of what comes to pass in the saints as the result of being brought in affection to Christ, and married to Him according to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>.<a name=213:13></a> The right of redemption becomes practically valid in the saints as they bring forth fruit to God in service and worship.<a name=213:14></a> Not only are things secured on God's side in Christ, but He brings about conditions on our side that are suitable in living heirs.<a name=213:15></a> A seed comes in that has manifestly right to the inheritance, having such a character as the children of God that they are suitable to be
