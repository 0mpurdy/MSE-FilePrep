		A SURE FOUNDATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To secure <i>a sure foundation</i> it is often needful to clear away a lot of rubbish.<a name=1:1></a> The wise builder digs "deep"; he removes all that is untrustworthy before he lays a single stone.<a name=1:2></a> This is exactly what I desire to do, and I entreat my reader to give earnest consideration to the weighty matters which I shall bring before him.<a name=1:3></a> There can be no solid peace until the whole truth of our lost condition as children of Adam is known and accepted.<a name=1:4></a> Peace founded upon ignorance and self-deception is common enough; but it is a slumber from which there will be a terrible awakening in ETERNITY, if never before.<a name=1:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that on such a subject human opinions are perfectly worthless.<a name=1:6></a> As to our souls' relations with God, we dare not allow the opinions of men to weigh with us for a single moment.<a name=1:7></a> Philosophers may speculate, theologians may reason and dispute, and rationalists may assert the sufficiency of the human mind to pronounce on these solemn questions, but we regard them all with equal distrust.<a name=1:8></a> We would as soon think of leaning on a straw, or of crossing Niagara on a spider's web, as of placing any reliance on our own abilities or mental powers in this matter.<a name=1:9></a> The Holy Scriptures must be our only authority and guide.<a name=1:10></a> We find there unerring truth which carries its own credentials with it, for it searches and exposes us as none but God could, and by so doing proves its divine origin more completely than all the volumes of "Evidences" that were ever written.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us then ponder well, and weigh as in the very presence of God, the following grave and momentous statements of Holy Scripture:

	<div class="paragraph">
		"By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:20">Romans  3:20</a>).<a name=2:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These are sweeping and comprehensive statements.<a name=2:6></a> They are too plain to be misunderstood, and it is impossible for any sober-minded person to regard them with levity or indifference.<a name=2:7></a> They do not assert that all Adam's children are alike as to <i>sinful actions</i>; but they do proclaim that all are alike "under sin", "subject to the judgment of God", and "come short of the glory of God".<a name=2:8></a> Sin displays itself in a thousand different forms in a thousand different individuals.<a name=2:9></a> It stalks unblushingly abroad at noonday in the open and profligate sinner.<a name=2:10></a> It makes itself obnoxious to men when it violently trespasses upon their interests or pleasures in the form of dishonesty or personal injury, or when it excessively outrages natural and moral decency.<a name=2:11></a> But the root-principle from which every sinful action proceeds is the same in every man, woman, and child of Adam's race.<a name=2:12></a> It would be difficult to find two lives that were exactly alike outwardly; but when we look beneath the surface, and consider man's <i>state before God</i>, we find "there is no difference".<a name=2:13></a> The amiable young lady and the industrious man of business are doing their own will and seeking their own pleasure.<a name=2:14></a> The drunkard and the thief are doing the same thing on a rather lower platform.<a name=2:15></a> It is true that

	<div class="paragraph">
		Instruction as to what is right and wrong is of no avail as a remedy.<a name=3:2></a> It has been tried.<a name=3:3></a> God has made known to man in the law what he ought to do, and what he ought not to do.<a name=3:4></a> Its only effect is to bring home to every awakened conscience "the knowledge of sin".<a name=3:5></a> I have no doubt the reader would admit that he had often done things he knew to be contrary to the mind of God.<a name=3:6></a> Does not this <i>prove</i> that there is something fearfully wrong?<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Additions or subtractions are of no use in such a case.<a name=3:17></a> You have tried to get rid of bad habits and to acquire good ones; but the weeds grow faster than you can pluck them up, and the flowers you fain would cultivate wither before they come to perfection.<a name=3:18></a> You are slowly beginning to realise that the soil is bad -- that no half measures will do -- that you have not only done many wrong things, but that you are <i>all wrong yourself</i>.<a name=3:19></a> What is the use of adding religion or morality to a man who still remains "subject to the judgment of God"?<a name=3:20></a>

		The first thing that an awakened sinner feels is that God must be righteous in all His ways.<a name=4:9></a> If grace is to reign it must be "through righteousness".<a name=4:10></a> Any supposed blessing which does not rest upon a secure basis of righteousness is absolutely worthless.<a name=4:11></a> Hence the sure foundation of all blessing is that wondrous act in which the righteousness of God is declared -- THE DEATH OF CHRIST.<a name=4:12></a>

		I can see God's way of dealing with sin in the death of Christ; I see all that is due to God in respect of sin maintained in that death; in a word, I see His righteousness there.<a name=5:3></a> But it is all in my favour.<a name=5:4></a> I can fall in with God's righteousness -- with God's way of dealing with sin -- and find that it secures my blessing for ever.<a name=5:5></a> On the ground of the death of Christ, God is as righteous in justifying the ungodly sinner who believes in Jesus as He will be righteous in condemning everyone who has not "faith in His blood".<a name=5:6></a> You must learn God's righteousness either in grace or in judgment.<a name=5:7></a> The believer learns it in the death of Christ; the unbeliever will learn it in the awful light of the great white throne.<a name=5:8></a> Apart from "the precious blood of Christ", the whole weight of God's righteousness must be against you.<a name=5:9></a> Thank God!<a name=5:10></a> that precious blood is available for you; you may by faith come under its cleansing efficacy and sheltering power; and then "the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ" will be upon you, making your blessing eternally sure.<a name=5:11></a>

		"WHAT MEANEST THOU?"

	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been estimated that over seventy-five per cent of the inhabitants of this country have no concern about the salvation of their souls.<a name=7:1></a> They are not atheists or infidels, nor do they make any profession of being saved; they are simply indifferent to the whole matter.<a name=7:2></a> If the thought of having to do with God comes into their minds, they solace themselves by a comparison of their own state with that of their fellows, and they conclude that as they are not worse than others, and perhaps better than many, there is no reason why they should have any concern as to their spiritual state.<a name=7:3></a> Any occasional alarm is speedily stilled by the thought that God is merciful -- a sentiment which in the mind of an indifferent sinner means that he likes to think of God as One whose judgment of sin is not much more severe than his own.<a name=7:4></a> It is to this large body of people, and to each individual in it, that the following plain words are addressed.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You are not indifferent to things which affect your health, your circumstances, the prosperity of your business, or your future in life.<a name=7:6></a> Nor are you uninterested in current events and great social movements.<a name=7:7></a> You are in deep concern when your child is sick and lies on the border-line between life and death.<a name=7:8></a> You spend hours in thought about the interests of your political party.<a name=7:9></a> You have regard to the maintenance of your credit, character, and reputation.<a name=7:10></a> Then why so indifferent to that which is of vastly greater importance than all these things put together -- your eternal salvation?<a name=7:11></a> A friendly voice asks you the question which stands at the head of this paper -- a question which once rang on the startled ear of Jonah -- "What meanest thou, O sleeper?<a name=7:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would have you to consider carefully that <i>indifference</i> to the gospel is a sin of no ordinary kind; it is pure and simple wickedness.<a name=10:3></a> To rightly estimate this we must call to mind <i>what</i> it is that men treat with indifference.<a name=10:4></a> It is the claims <i>of God</i> that are set at naught, and the grace <i>of God</i> that is despised.<a name=10:5></a> The gift of the Son of God, His work of infinite love at Calvary, the glory which that work has thrown open, and all the present blessings of the Salvation of God, are so many <i>trifles</i> to the indifferent sinner; he can afford to treat them all with contemptuous disregard, if not disdain.<a name=10:6></a> After all the resources of divine love have been taxed to the utmost; after the heart of God has told itself out in the most wonderful way; after all the treasures of heavenly grace have been presented for acceptance, after the invitation has gone forth in its fulness -- "Come, for all things are now ready" -- the insulting answer which goes back to the Giver of the feast is, "I pray thee have me excused; I have other and more important matters in hand; I cannot come".<a name=10:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Many people greatly disliked the preaching of a "common salvation".<a name=27:4></a> It might be thought that the announcement of a salvation available for <i>all</i> was a generous display of divine grace which must secure the admiration of every heart.<a name=27:5></a> But such is not the case, and the reason is not difficult to find.<a name=27:6></a> If God provides salvation for all it must be because <i>all are lost</i>.<a name=27:7></a> If only <i>some</i> had been lost, there would have been no need to provide salvation for <i>all</i>.<a name=27:8></a> "The grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared".<a name=27:9></a> High and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, refined and depraved, sensitive and sensual find themselves here on a <i>common</i> level, and God writes over them "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God".<a name=27:10></a>

		God is not willing that you should perish, or that you should remain under the bondage of sin or the law, and He directs you to certain words whereby you and your house may be saved -- saved from the wrath to come, from the power of Satan, and from the world; saved for glory, for the eternal company of Christ in the Father's house, and for the life and liberty of divine grace here on earth.<a name=40:1></a> Dear reader, would you not like to have this wonderful blessing?<a name=40:2></a> You are surely conscious that you need something you have not got.<a name=40:3></a> The world with its fleeting pleasures has failed to satisfy your heart, and many a stain of sin is upon your soul.<a name=40:4></a> Will you not listen with living interest to words of salvation?<a name=40:5></a> You may have <i>security</i> which no storm of infernal wrath can ever impair -- which no decree of divine judgment will ever assail; you may have undisturbed and everlasting <i>peace</i>; you may have joy, compared with which all earthly joys are times of mourning.<a name=40:6></a> What a glorious train of blessing -- all consequent upon certain "words" whereby you and your house may be saved!<a name=40:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then let us learn from Cornelius the way in which God's message should be received.<a name=41:1></a> Speaking to Peter, he says, "IMMEDIATELY therefore I sent to thee" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:33">Acts  10:33</a>).<a name=41:2></a> Have you such a sense of your need as to wish for an immediate settlement of this great question?<a name=41:3></a> There is incalculable peril in delay, and the issues at stake are too tremendous to be trifled with.<a name=41:4></a> The possibility of lying under the judgment of God for ever is so fearful, that to contemplate it for a single moment ought to be sufficient to awaken in the heart of every sinner an intense desire to hear "immediately" words whereby he may be saved.<a name=41:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, notice, it was to GOD that Cornelius turned as the only source of blessing.<a name=41:6></a> It was true that he had sent for Peter as the appointed channel of blessing, but he says distinctly, "Now therefore are we all here present <i>before God</i>, to hear all things that are commanded thee <i>of God</i>" (verse 33).<a name=41:7></a> We see, then, three things in Cornelius.<a name=41:8></a> He was a man (1) who knew his need of salvation; (2) who wished to be saved "immediately"; and (3) who was before God as one whose expectation was alone from God.<a name=41:9></a> If my reader is likeminded, I can answer for it that he will obtain blessing.<a name=41:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us then, as in the very presence of God, listen to these "words" of Peter: "<i>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons</i>" (verse 34).<a name=41:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was a great thing for Peter to say this.<a name=41:12></a> He had had to learn, as we read in this chapter, that the grace of God was above all ceremonial and external distinctions.<a name=41:13></a> God would as readily, in His grace, make a Gentile clean as a Jew.<a name=41:14></a> It had pleased Him, for special reasons, to separate the Jew from the Gentile, and to confer privileges on the former which were not possessed by the latter, but there was "no difference" in the sight of God between them.<a name=41:15></a> Both were alike sinners, and could only be blessed by the grace of God.<a name=41:16></a> The religious Jew thought himself very much better than

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is still true that God is no respecter of persons.<a name=42:3></a> God is not influenced by the distinctions and differences which prevail in society and in the religious world.<a name=42:4></a> An unconverted bishop is just the same before the eye of God as an unconverted sexton; one has a high place in the religious world, and the other a very humble place, but in the eye of God they are both lost sinners on their way to hell.<a name=42:5></a> On the other hand, a shoeblack exercised about his soul would be as great an object of interest to God as a monarch who was in the same anxiety.<a name=42:6></a> God has concluded ALL under sin, and it is on this common platform alone that He approaches sinners in His wondrous grace.<a name=42:7></a>

		"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom", and whenever a soul bows in the fear of God, and acknowledges his own worthlessness and ruin before God, he is in a condition upon which God can look with pleasure.<a name=42:9></a> His working of righteousness is not the proud activity of a legal spirit, but the lowly bringing forth of "fruits meet for repentance", and he is "accepted" with God.<a name=42:10></a> "There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth".<a name=42:11></a> The sinner is now in the state of one who will rejoice to hear of sovereign mercy and redeeming grace.<a name=42:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first item in the commission is to "open their eyes".<a name=46:2></a> This brings before us the plain fact that none are convicted of sin except by the grace of God.<a name=46:3></a> It is not <i>natural</i> for any of us to be brought to a sense of our true condition before God; it is as great a miracle as the raising of a dead man when a child of Adam begins to feel the burden of sin.<a name=46:4></a> When a man comes into anxiety about the need of his soul it is a great miracle -- it is the finger of God.<a name=46:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those whose eyes are opened really know that they are sinners before God.<a name=46:6></a> Many will say, "We are all sinners"; they have been taught to say so, and there is enough Christian light abroad to make people willing to admit in word that they are sinners.<a name=46:7></a> But it is not a reality to them; they are not a bit troubled about it.<a name=46:8></a> If you tell a man that his house is on fire, it makes a great impression on him; it is too serious a matter to trifle with.<a name=46:9></a> If his children are stricken down with some deadly disease, he will spend his last penny to get the best advice and the most suitable things for them.<a name=46:10></a> If he finds that his money is in a bank that is not trustworthy, he will not leave it there.<a name=46:11></a> But when it is a question of his soul, and of the affairs of eternity, he will admit that his condition is bad and his peril great, and yet he is not sufficiently concerned even to take the matter into serious consideration.<a name=46:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a question of your mind being convinced by an intellectual process, but of your giving in to God and taking your true place before Him.<a name=47:6></a> Job had intellectual difficulties for a long time.<a name=47:7></a> If you want to see a masterpiece of philosophical argument read the book of Job.<a name=47:8></a> Job and his three friends discussed these matters until the Lord came in and asserted His place in Job's conscience; then the discussion was silenced, and the intellectual difficulties vanished like shadows of the night before the sun.<a name=47:9></a> Then Job cried, "Mine eye seeth thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes".<a name=47:10></a> If you get into the dust and ashes of self-judgment your soul will get blessing from God.<a name=47:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next item in the commission is "to turn them from darkness to light".<a name=47:12></a> It is not enough that men should find out they are sinners; they must also be shown God's way of salvation; for when the eyes of sinners are opened they often say: "I must reform my life, I must change my habits; I must sign the pledge; I must join the church; I must take up some good work; I must give something to religious causes", and so on.<a name=47:13></a> They think that by this they will get into God's favour, and that their sins will be blotted out.<a name=47:14></a> All this is <i>darkness</i>, because such things as these have no efficacy to cleanse from sin -- they do not bring salvation.<a name=47:15></a> You must have the salvation question settled before you begin to think about serving God.<a name=47:16></a> You may change your manner of life by an act of your own will.<a name=47:17></a> A piece of lead might be made to look like a five-shilling piece.<a name=47:18></a> It might be a perfect imitation, but it would be of no value.<a name=47:19></a> That is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Salvation has been secured by the precious atoning work of the Son of God.<a name=48:4></a> There will be multitudes in glory that no man can number, and if they were asked how they got there, each one would point to the Lamb in the midst of the throne, and say, "He did it".<a name=48:5></a> He bore the judgment of God and went into death, and He is now in resurrection-triumph at the right hand of God.<a name=48:6></a> The very fact that He is seated on the throne of God proclaims the value of His work, and if you rest on that work it will secure to you a purged conscience.<a name=48:7></a> May Jesus' precious work be the present and eternal resting place of your soul!<a name=48:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another says: "It is not works that I wish to have, but I want to be sure that the Spirit of God has really wrought in my soul; I want to feel the evidences of His working in my heart".<a name=48:9></a> In this case the darkness is all the more subtle because there is an element of truth connected with it.<a name=48:10></a> It is true that there must be a work of the Spirit of God in the soul, and indeed without His work none would ever be convicted of sin.<a name=48:11></a> But the first work of the Spirit is rather to make you feel that you are utterly unfit for God and deserving of hell.<a name=48:12></a> This is the Spirit's work when He awakens a sinner, and if you are convinced of this, it is the best evidence that the Spirit has wrought in you.<a name=48:13></a> Spiritual experiences and emotions are very blessed, but they are not the foundation of faith.<a name=48:14></a> People are often deceived by their feelings and experiences, and Satan can go a long way in imitating these things.<a name=48:15></a> It is something outside ourselves which brings assurance, even the Word of God.<a name=48:16></a> Innumerable scriptures assure the believer of eternal safety and blessing, and these scriptures are unchanging.<a name=48:17></a> Whether you are groaning in the valley or singing on the mount with God, His Word remains unchanged.<a name=48:18></a> It was the key of promise that opened the dungeon of Doubting

		There is another form of darkness which troubles many.<a name=49:7></a> They are not sure that theirs is the <i>right kind</i> of faith.<a name=49:8></a> Such persons are unconsciously making a saviour of their faith -- taking the crown from the brow of Jesus and putting it on their faith.<a name=49:9></a> The wrong kind of faith is faith which rests in a wrong object.<a name=49:10></a> If your faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ it is the right kind of faith.<a name=49:11></a> Faith is the eye that looks at Jesus, and the fact that you see beauty and attractiveness in Him is the proof that you have faith.<a name=49:12></a> Then turn from the darkness into the light.<a name=49:13></a> What glorious light!<a name=49:14></a> Light shining in a Saviour's face!<a name=49:15></a> May that glory shine upon you even now!<a name=49:16></a>

		"From the power of Satan unto God".<a name=49:17></a> Many souls have really been convicted of sin, and have bowed in secret before God with desire to be saved, but they have not got the blessing because there is something from which they cannot break away.<a name=49:18></a> Something of the world holds them.<a name=49:19></a> They are not prepared to turn from the things which keep them from Christ and from God.<a name=49:20></a> It may be worldly friends, or some form of pleasure; it may be reading, music, drink, gambling -- a thousand different things in a thousand different cases; but whatever it is that thus keeps the soul from turning to God, it is "the power of Satan".<a name=49:21></a> The prodigal had to arise and go to the father; he had to turn from the far country and the husks.<a name=49:22></a> There is a decisive moment when, by God's grace, the sinner turns to Him; the misery and pressure

		JACOB'S DREAM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Jacob "went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:10">Genesis  28:10</a>), he was fleeing from the consequences of his sins as recorded in the previous chapter.<a name=51:1></a> The prophet Hosea says, "Jacob <i>fled</i> into the country of Syria" (12: 12).<a name=51:2></a> He was leaving Beersheba, which means "the well of the oath" -- a place of refreshment and satisfaction -- and was going toward Haran, which means "a parched, dry place".<a name=51:3></a> He represents a sinner, afraid of the consequences of his sins, but turning to the world for comfort and satisfaction instead of to God.<a name=51:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the course of his journey "he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:11">Genesis  28:11</a>).<a name=51:5></a> In this sleeping man can be seen a true picture of the state in which thousands are found today.<a name=51:6></a> They have sinned; their faces are towards the world; but, with unbelief for a pillow, they are in a profound slumber of spiritual indifference.<a name=51:7></a> But as God came in to awaken Jacob, so He still comes in to awaken the slumbering consciences of men.<a name=51:8></a>

		Without attempting to <i>interpret</i> Jacob's dream -- which, I believe, has special reference to the blessing of God's earthly people Israel -- I think we may see in it three things which are eminently characteristic of the gospel: (1) God was revealed in grace; (2) heaven was brought into view and put in communication with earth; and (3) man was found in a place which was "none other but the house of God" and "the gate of heaven".<a name=52:7></a>

		It is thus that God declares Himself in the gospel of His grace.<a name=53:2></a> Everything is in perfect contrast to the principle of the law.<a name=53:3></a> A divine <i>claim</i> upon man for moral perfection could only expose the fact that man is a moral bankrupt, and has "nothing to pay".<a name=53:4></a> Thus "by the law is the knowledge of sin".<a name=53:5></a> But according to grace we have to do with A GIVING GOD.<a name=53:6></a> "God so loved the world that he GAVE his only begotten Son" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>).<a name=53:7></a> God has provided infinite blessing for man in absolute grace, and puts it all within the reach of man as a GIFT.<a name=53:8></a> "The scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be GIVEN to them that believe" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:22">Galatians  3:22</a>).<a name=53:9></a> "I WILL GIVE unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life FREELY" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:6">Revelation  21:6</a>).<a name=53:10></a> Hence on our side it is not a question of doing or paying, but of RECEIVING.<a name=53:11></a> "That they may RECEIVE forgiveness of sins" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:18">Acts  26:18</a>).<a name=53:12></a> "Through his name whosoever believeth in him shall RECEIVE remission of sins" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:43">Acts  10:43</a>).<a name=53:13></a> "That we might RECEIVE the promise of the Spirit through faith" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:14">Galatians  3:14</a>); "That we might RECEIVE the adoption of sons" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:5">Galatians  4:5</a>).<a name=53:14></a>

		SAMSON'S RIDDLE

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness".<a name=59:1></a> -- <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#14:14">Judges  14:14</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The riddle which Samson put forth to his guests, and which they could not expound, is very suggestive of the truth of the gospel.<a name=59:2></a> And the incident upon which it was founded is a striking picture of what has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus.<a name=59:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Samson was on the way to secure the object of his affections, when "a young lion roared against him, and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand".<a name=59:4></a> Then on a subsequent occasion "he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion".<a name=59:5></a> This circumstance gave rise to the riddle which so puzzled Samson's guests, and we may be sure that God gave it a place in Scripture as being figurative of Christ's great victory and its infinite results in blessing.<a name=59:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God has come forth into this world to secure blessing for man, and to bring men into the circle of divine love, but on His way to accomplish this He had to meet and overcome the power of death.<a name=59:7></a> This was absolutely necessary, because all those whose blessing was in view were under the sentence and power of death.<a name=59:8></a> Whatever may be your position in society, or however excellent your conduct as a man amongst men, you are under the sentence of death.<a name=59:9></a> Nor is death a merely natural event which follows upon the operation of certain natural processes of disease and decay.<a name=59:10></a> Men would like to regard it as being only this, but Scripture makes it very clear that death is the wages of sin, the power of Satan, and the judgment of God.<a name=59:11></a>

		When you committed your first sin you forfeited your title to live upon the earth, and but for God's mercy you would have died that moment.<a name=60:1></a> Death has "passed upon all men, for that all have sinned" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>).<a name=60:2></a> Death is no part of the course of nature as God constituted it, it is "the wages of SIN".<a name=60:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we read in Scripture of "him that had the power of death, that is, the devil" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>).<a name=60:4></a> By reason of the fall, and in consequence of sin, the devil has acquired power over man.<a name=60:5></a> The devil sought to accomplish man's destruction from the place in which God set him as in favour and blessing on the earth, and having succeeded in bringing man under sin he has so far gained his point.<a name=60:6></a> The truth and righteousness of God necessitate that the pronounced sentence should be executed.<a name=60:7></a> And thus the devil has a claim, if we may so say, upon man, he has acquired a right to demand that death should come upon man.<a name=60:8></a> Satan, in this sense, wields the power of death.<a name=60:9></a> Man's sin has invested him with the right to claim the execution of the sentence of death upon man.<a name=60:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It thus appears most clearly that death is not, as people say, the "debt of nature".<a name=60:11></a> It is the solemn judgment of God upon a fallen creature -- a judgment which cannot be reversed or modified in any way.<a name=60:12></a>

		Here we see, in figure, the activity of God's grace.<a name=68:12></a> If the sinner cannot remedy his own imperfections, and if he is at a distance from God without desire to seek after God, blessing must come in altogether from God's side.<a name=68:13></a> In the gospel of His grace God approaches men as they are and where they are, and makes Himself known as a Saviour God.<a name=68:14></a> It is by the gospel that God brings men to a knowledge of Himself.<a name=68:15></a> Then it is of all importance that we should know the true nature of the gospel of God.<a name=68:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Briefly stated, the gospel is (1) the presentation of a Person; (2) the declaration of what that Person has undergone, and of God's actings towards Him; and (3) the proclamation of repentance and remission of sins in His Name.<a name=68:17></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The Person whom the gospel presents is THE SON OF GOD.<a name=69:1></a> By sending His Son into the world God presented Himself in grace to men.<a name=69:2></a> There was no form of human need that He was not able and willing to meet; there was no kind of pressure upon man that He could not relieve.<a name=69:3></a> He "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>).<a name=69:4></a> He came not to condemn the world, not to impute trespasses to men, but to present in the excellence of His own Person the all-blessing grace of God.<a name=69:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was also in Him the complete setting forth of everything that was according to God's good pleasure in a Man.<a name=69:6></a> He was the beloved Son, in whom the Father was well pleased.<a name=69:7></a> Every divine perfection was brought near to men in pure grace in that blessed and holy Person.<a name=69:8></a> And every one whose heart was attracted by His grace, and believed on Him, obtained forgiveness of sins and found the knowledge of God.<a name=69:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. But this wondrous grace must reign <i>through righteousness</i>, and it could only be presented to men in One who was willing and competent to charge Himself with the liabilities of men.<a name=69:10></a> The Lord Jesus could speak of forgiveness of sins because He was about to bear sins in His own body on the tree; He could heal every disease, and rescue men from the power of death itself because He had come in grace to undergo all that was due to men in consequence of sin.<a name=69:11></a> In the days of His flesh the accomplishment of all this was future, but it is now past, and the gospel declares what He has undergone on man's behalf.<a name=69:12></a> He has borne and suffered for sins, has been made sin, and has tasted death.<a name=69:13></a> He charged Himself with the liabilities of men, and has undergone the holy judgment due to sin.<a name=69:14></a> And all this in absolute grace, that the grace of God might flow out in righteousness to men.<a name=69:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the gospel declares further how God has acted towards the One who thus came in grace into man's condemnation.<a name=69:16></a> GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, so that He saw

		no corruption, and He lives for evermore beyond the reach of sin and death.<a name=70:1></a> Man, in the Person of the Lord Jesus, has an entirely new place with God, and is found in a state to which no imperfection or condemnation can ever attach.<a name=70:2></a> Nothing has been overlooked or compromised.<a name=70:3></a> Sins have been borne, sin has been judged, death has been suffered, Satan's power overthrown, and all this by One who is now raised from the dead as the glorious Witness to the complete triumph of grace.<a name=70:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. Now we get the proclamation of forgiveness of sins.<a name=70:5></a> "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him, all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:38">Acts  13:38</a>, 39).<a name=70:6></a> God thus approaches men in unmingled grace, as One who "will have all men to be saved".<a name=70:7></a> He is made known through the Lord Jesus Christ as a Justifier and a Saviour God.<a name=70:8></a> He sets forth what He is that He may be known and believed on in that character.<a name=70:9></a> And "all that believe are justified from all things".<a name=70:10></a> If we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, righteousness is imputed to us.<a name=70:11></a> And "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=70:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by this wondrous and blessed gospel that God approaches man in his ruin and distance.<a name=70:13></a> This gospel, received by faith, gives man the knowledge of God in grace, and brings him away from the world where God is unknown.<a name=70:14></a> He leaves Lo-debar for the courts of royal grace.<a name=70:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed to know that <i>the kindness of God</i> is toward men because of what CHRIST is, and on the ground of what He has accomplished!<a name=70:16></a> It has no respect to merit, or worthiness of any kind, in the sinner.<a name=70:17></a> David's kindness to Mephibosheth was according to the worthiness of another.<a name=70:18></a> "That I may shew him kindness <i>for Jonathan's sake</i>", and "I will

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thought we may gather from the picture before us is that the known grace of God not only separates a man from the world of the ungodly, but it gives him a true judgment of himself.<a name=71:5></a> In the presence of David's grace Mephibosheth could only say, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?<a name=71:6></a>" This is repentance -- the judgment which a sinner has of himself in the presence of divine grace.<a name=71:7></a> "Repentance and remission of sins" are both preached in the Name of a risen Saviour.<a name=71:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, we see here in picture the purpose which God has in view in making known His grace to men.<a name=71:9></a> "As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of <i>the king's sons</i>".<a name=71:10></a> It is God's purpose and pleasure that we should receive SONSHIP (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:5">Galatians  4:5</a>).<a name=71:11></a> This is not to meet our need, but to gratify His own heart.<a name=71:12></a> He is "bringing MANY SONS to glory" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=71:13></a>: 10).<a name=71:14></a> The love of God will find its satisfaction in having a company "conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>).<a name=71:15></a> And God delights that even here His children should know, by the Spirit, the liberty with which THE SON makes free.<a name=71:16></a> Liberty to be in the <i>home circle</i> of divine affections, and to respond to those affections with the cry of sonship, "Abba, Father".<a name=71:17></a> May God affect our hearts by His grace and love!<a name=71:18></a>

		THE LAW, THE PROMISES, AND THE GOSPEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was after the reading of the law and the prophets that Paul stood up to preach the gospel.<a name=78:1></a> The law and the prophets were excellent in their place, but they did not meet the need of a sinner.<a name=78:2></a> The law brought home to men the knowledge of sin, and the prophets contained promises of grace and blessing to come.<a name=78:3></a> But neither the law nor the prophets really met the condition of men.<a name=78:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"By the law is the knowledge of sin".<a name=78:5></a> The law is the probe which shows the depth of the wound; it is the plumb-line which shows the crookedness of the wall; it is the candle which reveals all the filth and corruption of a sinner's heart; it is the sharp eye which detects the disease; it is the judge who passes sentence of "Guilty before God" upon every member of the human family.<a name=78:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the prophets took it for granted that it was all over with man on the ground of law-keeping, and they were full of promises of future blessing on the ground of grace.<a name=78:7></a> The law had nothing but judgment for a sinner; the prophets had a promise of salvation for him.<a name=78:8></a> But a promise of deliverance is a very different thing from being delivered.<a name=78:9></a> The English residents in Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny, surrounded by thousands of foes who thirsted for their blood, had a promise of deliverance which, no doubt, filled their hearts with hope painful by its intensity, but it was a very different thing when they beheld their foes fleeing before the impetuous onslaught of the 78th Highlanders.<a name=78:10></a> Deliverance promised is a great thing, but deliverance accomplished is vastly greater.<a name=78:11></a> The prophets brought a promise of salvation, but the gospel declares that the promise has been fulfilled.<a name=78:12></a>

		This is of great importance.<a name=79:1></a> For lack of seeing it many are strangers to the joy and peace of the gospel.<a name=79:2></a> "Of this man's seed hath God according to promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus".<a name=79:3></a> "And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus" (verses 23, and 32, 33).<a name=79:4></a> The Spirit of God insists upon the fact that the promise has been fulfilled.<a name=79:5></a> Many a one will say, "I am trusting to the promises".<a name=79:6></a> Well, it is good if their faith has laid hold of God's grace in any measure, but there is a more excellent way.<a name=79:7></a> Indeed, those who talk thus will generally confess to having doubts and fears, more or less.<a name=79:8></a> They are really hoping for salvation instead of enjoying it.<a name=79:9></a> It cannot be otherwise.<a name=79:10></a> If someone promises you a book that you want you look forward with hope to the time when you will get it.<a name=79:11></a> You trust to the promise and hope for its fulfilment.<a name=79:12></a> But when the promise is fulfilled you cease to hope, and you enjoy that which was promised.<a name=79:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the prophets we find many promises of salvation, such as, "I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:6">Isaiah  49:6</a>); and again, "All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#52:10">Isaiah  52:10</a>); and again, "It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#25:9">Isaiah  25:9</a>).<a name=79:14></a> So in Old Testament times it was "good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Lamentations.htm#3">Lamentations  3</a>).<a name=79:15></a> This was what Simeon and Anna were doing (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>); but when the aged saint received the infant Jesus into his arms he said, "Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace .<a name=79:16></a>.<a name=79:17></a>.<a name=79:18></a> for mine eyes have seen thy salvation".<a name=79:19></a> The promise was fulfilled: God had raised up a Saviour.<a name=79:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has raised up a Saviour -- JESUS -- and is now sending out glad tidings concerning Him.<a name=80:4></a> "Whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent".<a name=80:5></a> If you have no fear of God before your eyes, you will care little for His salvation.<a name=80:6></a> But to those who have entered into fellowship with the dying thief -- who addressed his railing comrade with the words, "Dost not thou fear God, seeing we are in the same condemnation?<a name=80:7></a> and we indeed justly" -- the message of salvation is a joyful sound.<a name=80:8></a> Never was lifeboat more valued by the drowning, or fire-escape more welcomed by the inmates of a burning house than the message of salvation is valued and welcomed by the sinner who really fears God.<a name=80:9></a> If you want to know what it is to fear God read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>.<a name=80:10></a>

		The rulers of Judaea had no thought that they were fulfilling the Scriptures when they condemned the Son of God.<a name=80:11></a> So far as they were concerned, they were gratifying the envy and hatred of their own wicked hearts, but God made the stormy wind of their evil passions to fulfil His word.<a name=80:12></a> They numbered Jesus with the transgressors, and appointed Him to death, though they found no cause of death in Him.<a name=80:13></a> Pilate said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just person"; the dying thief bore witness, "This man hath done nothing amiss"; the Spirit of God declared that He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth; and even Judas had to confess, "I have betrayed innocent blood".<a name=80:14></a> But in thus condemning the guiltless they were fulfilling the Scriptures.<a name=80:15></a> It was the will and purpose of God that Christ should suffer all that was written of Him, otherwise men would have had

		"But God raised him from the dead".<a name=81:3></a> His atoning work was done: He had suffered for sins and died for sinners, and now God raised Him to be a Saviour in resurrection.<a name=81:4></a> He is now beyond the reach of Satan, beyond the touch of sin, beyond the power of death, in resurrection triumph, and this is the essence of the gospel.<a name=81:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The promises could refer to no other than Christ.<a name=81:6></a> The "sure mercies of David" were connected with One who was not to see corruption -- One who was to be "as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:4">2 Samuel  23:4</a>, 5).<a name=81:7></a> And now the light of that cloudless resurrection morning has come.<a name=81:8></a> Death's dark night, which for a brief space enveloped the anointed One, has passed for ever, and He has risen as the Sun of an endless resurrection day.<a name=81:9></a> Death has won no spoil from Him; corruption -- the emblem of death's victory -- touched Him not.<a name=81:10></a> Blessed, victorious Saviour, well may sinners bow at Thy feet!<a name=81:11></a>

		Now we get the proclamation of grace.<a name=81:12></a> "Be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins".<a name=81:13></a> The grace that is thus presented to men can only be measured by the Person in whom it is set forth.<a name=81:14></a> If we think of His glory, His greatness, all His perfections, the infinite value of His atoning death, and His resurrection triumph, we may find sufficient cause and ground in Him for this blessed proclamation.<a name=81:15></a> Merit or excuse we have none.<a name=81:16></a> The accumulated burden of our sins might justly sink us to the lowest hell.<a name=81:17></a> But in Him we find One who is a propitiation for the whole world.<a name=81:18></a> On the ground of what He is, the forgiveness of sins can be universally proclaimed.<a name=81:19></a>

		1. <i>He "ware no clothes</i>".<a name=90:6></a> Clothing in Scripture is symbolical of righteousness.<a name=90:7></a> For example, it is written, "He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61:10">Isaiah  61:10</a>).<a name=90:8></a> It is because man has fallen under the power of sin that righteousness is necessary for him.<a name=90:9></a> Man in innocence needed no clothing.<a name=90:10></a> But the moment Adam had sinned, he became conscious that he needed something to fit him for God's presence.<a name=90:11></a> When once sin had come in there could be no return to innocence, and man's need could only be met by "the gift of righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:17">Romans  5:17</a>).<a name=90:12></a> No self-made aprons of fig-leaves will suffice; man's most earnest efforts to put himself right are unavailing, and in spite of them all he remains "naked" before God.<a name=90:13></a>

		3. <i>He wanted nothing to do with Jesus</i>.<a name=91:11></a> This is the crowning proof that man is the willing servant of the power of evil.<a name=91:12></a> Not only does he rebel against God's authority and transgress God's commandments, but when God comes near to him in grace as a Saviour God he despises and rejects Him.<a name=91:13></a> If I were asked to give an example of the power of sin I would not point to the thief, the drunkard, or the profligate.<a name=91:14></a> These are examples patent to every eye.<a name=91:15></a> I would rather describe an upright, amiable, and altogether well-behaved person, who prefers the world and its things to the Lord Jesus Christ and the all-blessing grace of God.<a name=91:16></a> Little things, and what people call innocent things, may keep the soul from Christ.<a name=91:17></a> But can anything be called innocent that keeps a precious and immortal soul from the knowledge of God in grace?<a name=91:18></a> No!<a name=91:19></a> depend upon it, that which does so is nothing but the awful power of sin, however it may disguise itself.<a name=91:20></a> Little things that hold the heart in the world are often more deadly than greater evils, for the conscience slumbers over them while grave iniquities would awaken it to activity.<a name=91:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have no means of knowing what kind of man Simon was before he became a disciple of Christ, though we may gather that he was a conscientious and God-fearing Jew from the fact that he could say, "I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:14">Acts  10:14</a>).<a name=103:3></a> Nothing leads us to suppose that he was an immoral or irreligious man.<a name=103:4></a> He was, nevertheless, <i>a sinner</i>, and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:1">Luke  5:1</a> - 11 tells us how he came to be convicted of sin.<a name=103:5></a>

		The Lord Jesus was teaching by the side of the lake, and such numbers gathered to hear the word of God, that they pressed upon Him.<a name=103:6></a> Whereupon He stepped into Simon's boat and -- asking him to thrust out a little from the shore -- sat down and taught the multitude out of the boat.<a name=103:7></a> It does not appear that the sermon took much effect upon Simon, but what happened afterwards wrought a complete revolution in his soul.<a name=103:8></a>

		When Jesus had left speaking to the people, He turned to Simon, and said, "Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught".<a name=103:9></a> Simon did not seem to have much faith, for he said, "Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net".<a name=103:10></a> No sooner had they done so than the net was filled, even to breaking, with fish; and when they began to gather them in, so great was the quantity

		Such an experience has been, or will be, the experience of every human soul.<a name=104:4></a> The moment a sinner is brought consciously into the presence of God, he knows he is not fit to be there.<a name=104:5></a> Simon cried, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord".<a name=104:6></a> So long as a man walks in his own little circle, and in the light of sparks of his own kindling, he may talk with great swelling words, and have much self-confidence.<a name=104:7></a> But let him be brought consciously into God's presence, and in the soul-searching light of that presence the only thought left in his heart will be, "I am utterly unfit to be here".<a name=104:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The light of God makes things manifest as they really are.<a name=104:9></a> The sinner out of God's presence may be well-pleased with himself; but the moment he comes into the light, every bit of self-righteousness and self-satisfaction withers up as the moth's flimsy wing shrivels in the flame.<a name=104:10></a> His comeliness is turned into corruption, and all his self-complacent thoughts and feelings give place to the supreme conviction, "I am a sinful man".<a name=104:11></a>

		DECISION FOR CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would not speak of decision for Christ to a careless sinner who had neither felt the burden of his sins nor believed in the Lord Jesus.<a name=116:1></a> Harm is often done by calling upon ungodly sinners to decide for Christ, and perhaps to stand up in token that they have done so.<a name=116:2></a> The effect is to occupy them with some act of their own, rather than with Christ and the grace of God.<a name=116:3></a> They feel <i>they</i> have done something, and this is very injurious to them spiritually, even when there is a real work of God in them.<a name=116:4></a> Alas!<a name=116:5></a> many have "decided for Christ" just as they might have taken a temperance pledge, without any sense of their lost condition, or any real work of God's Spirit in their souls.<a name=116:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there are many souls who have been truly convicted of sin, and whose hearts have turned to the Lord Jesus as their Saviour, who have not had courage to confess His name; they have not come to the point of definitely taking a stand for Christ.<a name=116:7></a> It is with this class in view that I desire to say a few words on decision for Christ.<a name=116:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with this I may say that Satan always does his best to hinder souls from taking THE NEXT STEP.<a name=116:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is true from the beginning to the end of the soul's history.<a name=116:10></a> God takes us up in His grace and leads us on step by step, and whatever may be the next step that God would have us take is just the very point at which all Satan's forces will be concentrated to hinder us.<a name=116:11></a> For instance, when one begins to be troubled about his sins Satan will bring in a hundred things to stop the exercise.<a name=116:12></a> Friends will be more entertaining than ever, one's attention will be diverted perhaps to politics, to some form of pleasure one never thought of before, to some interesting book, to some hobby or other, to some religious work, to some scheme for doing

	<div class="paragraph">
		But if soul-concern cannot be dismissed by these means -- and, thank God, it cannot when His Spirit is at work -- if in spite of all this the sense of need continues and the distress of soul deepens, Satan falls back a step and rallies all his hosts at another point.<a name=117:2></a> He does all he can now to darken the gospel by turning souls in upon themselves -- their works, prayers, experience, feelings, repentance, faith, etc.<a name=117:3></a>, etc.<a name=117:4></a> Whole regiments of doubts, fears, questionings, and misapprehensions confront the anxious one to hinder him from looking only and altogether to CHRIST.<a name=117:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But grace triumphs in the end, and the believer looks away from himself to Jesus.<a name=117:6></a> He finds the whole foundation of his confidence in Another.<a name=117:7></a> He sees that God has provided a Saviour worthy of all his trust.<a name=117:8></a> He accepts for himself the faithful saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.<a name=117:9></a> He believes on God who raised that blessed One from the dead, and, having righteousness imputed to him, and being justified by faith, he enters into peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=117:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now he is ready for a third step, and the warfare wages round another movement.<a name=117:11></a> It is at this point the question of decision for Christ comes plainly to the front.<a name=117:12></a> Now Satan's object will be to hinder him from confessing Christ.<a name=117:13></a> He will heap all kinds of real or imaginary difficulties in the way of taking a stand for the Lord.<a name=117:14></a> He will make it apparently the most difficult thing in the world to come out simply and decidedly for Christ.<a name=117:15></a> He knows well how to work on the timidity of the flesh, and to use the fear of man to ensnare the soul.<a name=117:16></a> The pride of the flesh is also a great hindrance.<a name=117:17></a> We are often so painfully sensitive as to what people may say or think of us -- so terribly unwilling to make fools of ourselves in the eyes of our worldly friends.<a name=117:18></a> And in some

		And further, you would be supported by the power of God.<a name=118:8></a> A believer who does not take a stand for the Lord does not get divine support.<a name=118:9></a> If I went to some foreign country and by carefully concealing the fact that I was an Englishman, led everybody to conclude that I was a native of that foreign country, I could not complain if, when troubles arose, the British Government did not interfere on my behalf.<a name=118:10></a> In such a case they might justly say, "We will support with all our power the honour of the British flag, but we will not support a man who is ashamed of that flag".<a name=118:11></a> All the power of God will support the honour of the Name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=118:12></a> Divine support, and security for the believer against all the power of evil, are connected with the fact that he confesses the Lord Jesus.<a name=118:13></a> He has come under a lordship of blessing and gracious power of which he is not ashamed.<a name=118:14></a> And he gets the support of that power by the Spirit to maintain him against all the power of evil here.<a name=118:15></a> Rahab "bound the scarlet line in the window" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#2">Joshua  2</a>), and thus put herself under the protection of Jehovah.<a name=118:16></a> It was the confession that she submitted to His righteousness, and put her trust

		We may see in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>a picture of how the Spirit of God would detach our hearts from old associations: "And the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah" (verse 53).<a name=133:4></a> No doubt the jewels and the raiment came from Abraham's house -- from the place where Isaac was; and invested with that which came <i>from him</i>, she was made consciously suitable <i>for him</i>.<a name=133:5></a> This is how the Spirit would work.<a name=133:6></a> He would invest us with conscious suitability <i>for</i> Christ because deriving everything from Him.<a name=133:7></a> Thus was Rebecca prepared to face the question "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=133:8></a>" and to give the decisive answer, "I will go".<a name=133:9></a> It involved breaking with her own people and her father's house, and a journey of perhaps 500 miles across the desert, but she was prepared for all this.<a name=133:10></a> The attractions of Isaac had eclipsed everything else for her heart, and she was free in affection to go to him because conscious of suitability for him.<a name=133:11></a> Beloved brethren, are we prepared to take the moral journey of which hers was such a striking type?<a name=133:12></a> The Spirit of God is here to conduct us to Christ where He is.<a name=133:13></a> I do not mean when we die or when He comes.<a name=133:14></a> The Spirit would lead our hearts to Him NOW.<a name=133:15></a> But this involves a moral journey; it involves heart-separation from things and associations here.<a name=133:16></a>
