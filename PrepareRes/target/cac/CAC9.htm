	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:1></a>C.<a name=1:2></a> We have been seeing in the book of Numbers what an important place the service of God has.<a name=1:3></a> We have been considering the place and ordering of the levites, the appointment of their service, the cities they dwelt in, and the universal distribution of the levitical character of things among the people of God.<a name=1:4></a> It was thought well that we might consider the One who is the true Servant; that we might engage ourselves for a little time with Him and the character of His service.<a name=1:5></a> One feels assured that nothing is acceptable service to God that is not after the pattern of Christ.<a name=1:6></a> God, having brought in what is for His full delight, cannot possibly accept anything of a different order.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very touching to see that all is presented to us as glad tidings -- not in the way of demand -- but as glad tidings designed to have a very happy effect on all who read it.<a name=1:8></a> None of the other evangelists begin their gospel with "the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God", but Mark is so full of the happy character of it, and it so possesses him, that he bursts out with it in the first sentence.<a name=1:9></a> "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=1:10></a> He plunges at once into the very heart of what is before him.<a name=1:11></a> It is as much as to say, 'Every word I have to utter about Him is "glad tidings"'.<a name=1:12></a> You feel at once you are in the presence of what is of God, and it is brought in in perfection, He is God's anointed Son.<a name=1:13></a> Mark counts on its being a source of real gladness to contemplate Him and to consider how He moved, how He acted, how He spoke.<a name=1:14></a> We can see that what Mark wrote is designed to have a very happy effect upon those who read it.<a name=1:15></a>

		C.A.<a name=1:19></a>C.<a name=1:20></a> Yes, it is "concerning his Son", and He is declared to be Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by resurrection of the dead.<a name=1:21></a> What Mark has before him is the blessed way in which the Lord came in and moved through this world in service.<a name=1:22></a> This is the gospel for saints, the gospel or glad

		tidings for any who fear God: it is the presentation of that blessed One, the way in which He comes in and moves through this world, delighting God in every way and serving man in every way.<a name=2:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Two Old Testament prophets are cited, Malachi and Isaiah, as showing how He was heralded by John.<a name=2:2></a> His messenger precedes Him; all must be suitably prepared, so that He may not be hindered.<a name=2:3></a> His way is really Jehovah's way.<a name=2:4></a> In the desert there is to be "a highway for our God".<a name=2:5></a> How important the preparation of His ways is!<a name=2:6></a> His way is prepared.<a name=2:7></a> The idea of preparing the way is that He must not be hindered from a plain course, He is coming to serve and He must not be hindered; so a voice cries, "All flesh is grass".<a name=2:8></a> That is the preparation of His way.<a name=2:9></a> We get one man out of the way altogether; <i>all</i> flesh is grass, not some flesh but all flesh.<a name=2:10></a> What a preparation of His way!<a name=2:11></a> There is nothing to hinder Him then.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:13></a> Is that why baptism is introduced so soon?<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:15></a>C.<a name=2:16></a> I thought so.<a name=2:17></a> From the messenger we may learn the state of man, the one who says, "All flesh is grass".<a name=2:18></a> That voice comes out in preaching baptism and repentance for the remission of sins.<a name=2:19></a> They could publicly take the ground of repentance.<a name=2:20></a> The Jews were accustomed to baptise proselytes, but now every one must take entirely new ground; there is no escape.<a name=2:21></a> The glad tidings are all concerning the second Man.<a name=2:22></a> Speaking morally, it is impossible for God to have two men before Him of different orders.<a name=2:23></a> The first man and second Man cannot both be for God's pleasure because they are of different orders, so John's mission is essential that all the pretensions of man after the flesh should go down into death.<a name=2:24></a> I think John came definitely with that mission to prepare the way of Jehovah and to make in the desert a highway for our God.<a name=2:25></a> God wants a highway; He says, I must have everything cleared out of My way.<a name=2:26></a> It is not a by-road, but a highway that is secured by the pretensions of man being set aside.<a name=2:27></a> John's testimony is a wilderness testimony.<a name=2:28></a> His whole character and appearance, what he said and did, showed that there was nothing here for God apart from the attitude of repentance.<a name=2:29></a> If man takes up an attitude of repentance there is a highway for God.<a name=2:30></a>

		C.A.<a name=3:1></a>C.<a name=3:2></a> I thought so.<a name=3:3></a> His raiment and food are suited to wilderness conditions.<a name=3:4></a> The Lord spoke of him as not wearing delicate raiment, He contrasts him with "those who wear delicate things", who "are in the houses of kings", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:8">Matthew  11:8</a>.<a name=3:5></a> They are making themselves comfortable and luxurious in the world, but John was not like that at all.<a name=3:6></a> John's was a wilderness testimony and his raiment and food were in keeping with this.<a name=3:7></a> There is a severity about John, a severity of separation and Nazariteship; he walked apart from all the resources of man.<a name=3:8></a> The camel's hair garment speaks of separation; the leathern girdle of a certain severity of restraint on himself, restraint upon nature.<a name=3:9></a> His food was clean; locusts are among clean creatures; they have legs above their feet.<a name=3:10></a> And wild honey would be honey out of the rock.<a name=3:11></a> Nothing is prepared by man, but they are things of a distinctive character found in the wilderness by God's ordering.<a name=3:12></a> John is independent of man altogether.<a name=3:13></a> "A man sent from God, his name John".<a name=3:14></a> If God sends a man it is to clear away every obstacle, that there may be a highway for Himself, so that His anointed Son may come in and fill up His blessed life of service for God and man.<a name=3:15></a>

		Ques.<a name=3:16></a> Would verse 5 be anything like going forth without the camp?<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:18></a>C.<a name=3:19></a> It is that principle.<a name=3:20></a> Judaea and Jerusalem were not the places now where God's favour was known; it is a wilderness position.<a name=3:21></a> It was said of old, "In Judah is God known .<a name=3:22></a>.<a name=3:23></a>.<a name=3:24></a> in Salem also is his tabernacle"; but it is not so now, it is the wilderness.<a name=3:25></a> They must go out away from what had status even according to God -- all that has to be given up.<a name=3:26></a> It is the giving up of everything that one naturally looks to, and going out into the wilderness to find only a voice.<a name=3:27></a> John seems to hasten to hide himself behind the One who was coming and the great service which He would render.<a name=3:28></a> John was the greatest servant.<a name=3:29></a> The Lord says of him that there was no greater born of women, yet he hides himself behind Another.<a name=3:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:33></a>C.<a name=3:34></a> I think so.<a name=3:35></a> John is a beautiful example of a true servant.<a name=3:36></a> He says, "He must increase, but I must decrease"; that is a fine model for a servant.<a name=3:37></a> "John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true".<a name=3:38></a> That is a fine testimonial for a servant.<a name=3:39></a> It is a great test.<a name=3:40></a> So here he says so beautifully, "There comes he that is mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:7></a>C.<a name=4:8></a> Yes, His service transcends John's altogether.<a name=4:9></a> John says in verse 8, "I indeed have baptised you with water, but <i>he</i> shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit".<a name=4:10></a> That is the great service of the Son of God.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:12></a> Do we get the difference between the two baptisms in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:14></a>C.<a name=4:15></a> Yes, it is very plain that they knew John's baptism but not the baptism of Jesus Christ the Son of God.<a name=4:16></a> I think John's baptism is, in figure, the setting aside of the pretensions of man; and Christian baptism is the burial, typically, of that man.<a name=4:17></a> If he is buried he is off the scene.<a name=4:18></a> Then the baptism of the Spirit connects one with another world altogether, it connects one with the divine world.<a name=4:19></a> The baptism of the Spirit connects one with heaven.<a name=4:20></a> It was not until the Lord went to heaven that He baptised with the Holy Spirit: therefore the baptism of the Holy Spirit connects us with heaven and with Christ as in heaven; that is how the kingdom of God comes in.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:22></a> Is going out into the wilderness the great test for Christians?<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:24></a>C.<a name=4:25></a> Yes, a great many have not gone out morally from the city, so there is no taking of new ground, and there is more or less of wearing of delicate raiment in king's houses.<a name=4:26></a> Paul said to the Corinthians, "Ye reign as kings".<a name=4:27></a> You do not find John in a king's house.<a name=4:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:31></a>C.<a name=4:32></a> I suppose repentance properly understood would bring us to wilderness conditions, because if I judge myself I shall also judge the whole system which I have been living in.<a name=4:33></a> Repentance is not merely judging myself but all my associations, like Isaiah who said, "I am a man of unclean lips", but he did not stop there, he went on to say, "I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips".<a name=4:34></a> He not only judged himself but all his associations.<a name=4:35></a> I do not think you have reached repentance

		fully until you have done that; then you are prepared to go out.<a name=5:1></a> Peter says on the day of Pentecost, "Be saved from this perverse generation", not only from yourselves, but from this untoward generation, this perverse or darkened generation.<a name=5:2></a> If people wake up to realise that the generation of the world is a darkened generation, and that there is no divine light there, they will soon want to move out.<a name=5:3></a> We not only find evil in ourselves, but we find evil in the system around us.<a name=5:4></a> It was more testing for a Jew to find that the whole system of things in which man moves and acts is all wrong, because he was accustomed to connect all with God.<a name=5:5></a> So now a great many people live in a sort of respectable Christianity which is part and parcel of the world and which is all bound up in the wrong man, not God's Man.<a name=5:6></a> To go out in that sense as judging the world and myself as forming part of it is a very necessary preparation, and then we get the highway of God; there is nothing to hinder God then.<a name=5:7></a> God says, 'Clear My way, prepare in the wilderness a highway for God'.<a name=5:8></a> The beautiful effect of considering the path of the Lord is that you feel you have got a way where you can move with Him safely.<a name=5:9></a>

		C.A.<a name=5:12></a>C.<a name=5:13></a> Yes.<a name=5:14></a> The first thing which the Lord gets when He takes His place with those that fear God is the conscious support of heaven.<a name=5:15></a> It is what <i>He</i> saw in this gospel, "And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him".<a name=5:16></a> "Harmless as doves", it is gentle, dove-like.<a name=5:17></a> It is what <i>He</i> saw.<a name=5:18></a> Then in the next verse it is what <i>He</i> heard, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=5:19></a> It is addressed to Himself here, not to others; it is what He saw and heard Himself.<a name=5:20></a> It is very beautiful to see that.<a name=5:21></a>

		Ques.<a name=6:2></a> Why does it say that Jesus came from Nazareth to be baptised?<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:4></a>C.<a name=6:5></a> It is very beautiful that Nazareth was His place, not Jerusalem.<a name=6:6></a> That is, a despised place was His place, and He only moves out of that place to identify Himself with the divine movement.<a name=6:7></a> It is very touching that there could not be a public movement without the Lord identifying Himself with it.<a name=6:8></a> There was no occasion for Him to repent or be baptised, no necessity for Him to take that ground, but they took new ground, and it was ground where He loved to be with them in the spirit of what is said in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>, "I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts".<a name=6:9></a> It is beautiful to see that spiritual movements attract the Lord.<a name=6:10></a> As soon as we begin to move spiritually, even if it is as poor sinners giving up our pretensions, as soon as that movement begins, He joins Himself with us, and then heaven confirms Him.<a name=6:11></a> It is very wonderful that heaven should come in at that moment, at the moment when He takes His place with that repentant crowd, just there He gets this wonderful approbation of heaven.<a name=6:12></a> It is as if the delight of God could not be kept in any longer.<a name=6:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=8:16></a>C.<a name=8:17></a> There is a peculiar urgency here that is very striking: it is as if the Spirit were eager, if we may so say, to have His affections tested at once.<a name=8:18></a> The Spirit realised that His blessed service could not begin until this testing was over, so there is an urgency about it from that point of view.<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Lord can be known of all.<a name=72:1></a> In the passage across the sea we seem to see the course of the testimony in the absence of Christ: He is interceding on high, and then in the fourth watch of the night we get what immediately precedes the morning.<a name=72:2></a> When the Lord rejoins the disciples the storm is still, and when they reach the shore we find universal healing.<a name=72:3></a> I suppose, strictly speaking, it applies to the time when the Lord rejoins the remnant and by His power puts an end to all the difficulties that the testimony has had to meet during His absence.<a name=72:4></a> But in principle it applies to the assembly, because there is a great analogy between the movements and actings of the Lord in reference to the remnant, and His movements and actings in reference to the assembly.<a name=72:5></a> We suggested last week the peculiar character of the Lord's movements in the fourth watch of the night.<a name=72:6></a> I have no hesitation in saying that we have reached the fourth watch of the night now, so that what marks the present time is a peculiar movement of the Lord in which He presents Himself in such a way as to test the affections of those in the boat -- He would have passed by.<a name=72:7></a> This intimates to me clearly that one may expect such movements in the fourth watch of the night.<a name=72:8></a> My impression is that is what is going on at the present moment; and I think Scripture warrants us in expecting what may be called extraordinary movements.<a name=72:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>there was a movement at midnight and the cry went forth, "Behold, the bridegroom".<a name=72:10></a> It was calling attention to a Person, not an event, and I think what happens in the fourth watch brings you a little nearer to the morning.<a name=72:11></a> The Lord comes walking on the water, and declares Himself in absolute supremacy, in all the power and blessedness and grace of His own Person -- He is absolutely supreme.<a name=72:12></a> The sea is a path for Him, neither winds nor waves affect Him.<a name=72:13></a> He draws near in a peculiar way to test the affections of His saints.<a name=72:14></a> Those who have observed the Lord's movements have recognised a spiritual movement of that kind on the Lord's part for many years, a remarkable presentation of Himself to His saints.<a name=72:15></a> I have no doubt there have been remarkable unfoldings from the Scriptures of the Person of Christ, and of what stands connected with Him in the purpose of God, a clearing up of dispensational difficulties and development of truth, but not only that; there has been a spiritual movement of the Lord Himself which did not take place in the previous watches of the night.<a name=72:16></a> He was there on the mountain top

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been following the history of Israel and Judah down to the point when they were carried away captive on account of their departure from God.<a name=197:1></a> It is now thought well to read the books which speak of the return of a remnant from captivity.<a name=197:2></a> Jehovah had in mind that there should be recovery.<a name=197:3></a> He had been prophesying of it by His servants, and providing for it by His ways in government, even before the iniquity of His people had reached its height.<a name=197:4></a> In applying this to ourselves of the present period it is good to see that, while the christian profession was following a downward course in the direction of apostasy, God had in His mind the thought of a remnant being brought back to the truth as it was in the beginning.<a name=197:5></a> The epistles to Sardis and Philadelphia both suggest movements of recovery, for Sardis is addressed as having "received and heard".<a name=197:6></a> There had been a divine giving and speaking which it was necessary to "keep" if the Lord's favour in so giving and speaking was to have a right response.<a name=197:7></a> This we believe to have reference to that part of the christian profession which benefited so greatly by what is known as the Reformation, which was clearly on God's part a movement of recovery.<a name=197:8></a> Then Philadelphia is addressed as having a little power, and as having kept Christ's word, and as having not denied His name, and as having kept the word of His patience.<a name=197:9></a> It is evident that this implies recovery to that which was from the beginning, so that it speaks of true assembly conditions being found at the end so that Philadelphia becomes the subject of Christ's complacent love and commendation.<a name=197:10></a> This speaks to us of recovery as clearly as Jeremiah's prophecy spoke of seventy years being accomplished in the desolations of Jerusalem.<a name=197:11></a> It was Daniel understanding by books the number of the years that led him to make confession of the sin of his people, and to cry so earnestly to Jehovah to cause His face to shine upon His sanctuary which was desolate, and to favour the city and the people that were called by His name, see <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:1">Daniel  9:1</a> - 19.<a name=197:12></a>

		years ago God stirred up many hearts to pray, and to search the Scriptures, that they might return to what was in His mind -- with regard to His saints ever since Pentecost, but which had been grievously departed from.<a name=198:1></a> God has no thought of setting up anything new; He would have all His saints to return to His original thoughts, in which they are all entitled by His grace to have part.<a name=198:2></a> All that is the outcome of the death of Christ, and that is connected with the presence of the Spirit here; all that is bound up with the lordship and headship of Christ, and that enters into the truth of the assembly and the service of God, is there for saints to return to if their spirits are stirred up to do so.<a name=198:3></a>

		There was scripture to justify great expectations in the time of Daniel and Ezra, just as there was scripture to justify great expectations when the assembly revival began over a hundred years ago.<a name=198:4></a> I suppose there was also an intuitive sense that it would not be like God to leave things as they were until the rapture.<a name=198:5></a> For it was written that "the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=198:6></a> This in itself would suggest that something would be found at the end having the true character of the bride, and able to say, Come, in concert with the Spirit.<a name=198:7></a> I have no doubt that this, apprehended either intelligently or intuitively, led many saints to cry to God to favour His people, and to move in restoring mercy so that a remnant might be recovered to the divine centre, and that the truth of the house of God and of the service of God might be set up again in the faith and love of His people after being desolate in any spiritual sense for many centuries.<a name=198:8></a> I have no doubt that it was in answer to much exercise and prayer, founded upon the Scriptures, that God gave such a precious ministry of His own thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly more than a hundred years ago.<a name=198:9></a> This ministry, continued by His grace ever since, has stirred up many hearts, and encouraged many hearts, to return from what is really Babylonish captivity to have a part in the setting up of the true service of God in accord with the truth of the assembly.<a name=198:10></a> Where there is confession of departure and confidence in God that He will do something for His name and for His house, we may be sure that He will do something which answers in this day to what He did for His people in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah.<a name=198:11></a> I think we can say, very humbly but very thankfully, that He has done so.<a name=198:12></a>

		I am afraid we do not think sufficiently of how God has moved in His government of the world in order to make a way for His people to return from Babylonish captivity.<a name=199:10></a> In certain countries, at any rate, God has brought about conditions in the world which are favourable to the return from captivity of all those whose spirit is stirred up in relation to His house.<a name=199:11></a> God foresaw what He was about to do in a spiritual way, and in restoring mercy to His people, and He made provision for it in His ordering of human events.<a name=199:12></a> A certain liberation has been granted in this and other lands, so that the world power does not hinder; it gives liberty for the working out in a practical way of what is in the mind of God.<a name=199:13></a> Not very long since we might, according to the law of this land, have been put in prison or punished severely if we had not conformed to that order of religious service which the world approved.<a name=199:14></a> But God has moved in the sphere of political things, and He has brought about conditions which give liberty for spiritual movements.<a name=199:15></a> Not a single saint, in England at any rate, is hindered by the world power from returning to the divine centre, or from working out with his brethren the truth of the house of God.<a name=199:16></a> No one is held captive in Babylon by the political powers that are in authority in the world.<a name=199:17></a> This is an immense favour from God which has been brought about by His faithfulness, and it is also the answer to the faithfulness and prayers of a remnant

		If God opens a great door, and an effectual one, there are sure to be many adversaries, and we see something of their activities in <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#4">Ezra  4</a>.<a name=222:10></a> They came with good words and fair speeches.<a name=222:11></a> "We would build with you; for we seek your God, as ye; and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who brought us up hither" (verse 2).<a name=222:12></a> Spiritual judgment would find such people out, as it was said to the angel of the assembly in Ephesus, "thou hast tried them who say that themselves are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:2">Revelation  2:2</a>.<a name=222:13></a> This was at a time when the true apostles had not all gone.<a name=222:14></a> Paul also speaks of some at Corinth as "false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:13">2 Corinthians  11:13</a>.<a name=222:15></a> What took place at the beginning of the church's history has appeared in the day of revival at the end.<a name=222:16></a>

		When the help of "the people of the land" was refused they came out in their true colours, and "weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building; and they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia" (verses 4, 5).<a name=223:9></a> "The people of the land" have a form of piety, but they represent those who wish to maintain things as they are in the christian profession, and are therefore adverse to any ministry which would build up what is distinctively of God.<a name=223:10></a> How many 'counsellors' have been hired to write books and pamphlets in opposition to what has been brought out from Scripture during the last century!<a name=223:11></a> I suppose that every part of the truth which has been brought out by the Spirit of God has been attacked as error, and has had to make its way in face of constant opposition.<a name=223:12></a> Many hands have been weakened by these efforts of the adversaries; many have been troubled in building.<a name=223:13></a>

		An interval of about fifteen years had transpired during which time no progress had been made in building the house.<a name=224:5></a> But when the prophetic word came it made no reference to the external difficulties; it addressed itself to the state of the people, and made manifest the real hindrance to the work.<a name=224:6></a> There are always difficulties in the way of anything being done for God, and it is easy quietly to accept them, and to regard them as an indication that we should let things stand as they are.<a name=224:7></a> When God's chief interest ceases to be our chief interest some form of self-consideration inevitably comes in.<a name=224:8></a> Jehovah speaks of His house lying waste while they dwelt in wainscoted houses.<a name=224:9></a> It was very sad that Paul had to say of those about him at Rome, "all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:21">Philippians  2:21</a>), Timothy stood out as a bright exception to this, caring with genuine feeling how the saints got on.<a name=224:10></a>

		What is needed is that we should do as the remnant did in that day.<a name=225:19></a> They "hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, according as Jehovah their God had sent him, and the people feared before Jehovah", <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:12">Haggai  1:12</a>.<a name=225:20></a> As soon as they took this ground the message was sent to them, "I am with you, saith Jehovah".<a name=225:21></a> All that is needed on our part is that we should hearken to what God says; that is, be in the spirit of obedience before

	<div class="paragraph">
		God would have us to know what He thinks of His house.<a name=227:7></a> He is going to shake everything with a view to His house being here filled with glory.<a name=227:8></a> Every divine shaking at the present time has in view the freeing of what will contribute to His house.<a name=227:9></a> We know that there will be a terrible shaking presently to prepare the way for God to bring in the First-begotten into the habitable world, and when He comes in there will be found material that will fill the house with glory.<a name=227:10></a> But at the present time there is much precious material in the world, and God claims it all for Himself and for His house.<a name=227:11></a> "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts" (verse 8).<a name=227:12></a> The silver and the gold today are the saints secured for God as the fruit of redemption and as in new creation.<a name=227:13></a> "The desire of all nations" (verse 7) refers to everything that is precious and truly desirable in all the nations.<a name=227:14></a> It refers to apprehensions and appreciations of Christ brought by the work of God into the hearts of His saints everywhere, so that Christ has become "the preciousness" to them.<a name=227:15></a> This is what has value before God, and He intends that it should all come to His house to enrich it with glory.<a name=227:16></a> So what God has in mind is not diminishing glory, but increasing glory.<a name=227:17></a> "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts" (verse 9).<a name=227:18></a> Each brother and sister can bring more of the glory in; it is the divine thought that we should be continually moving "from glory to glory".<a name=227:19></a> If God shakes the nations it is with a view to what is precious coming to light as the glory of His house; it is that men and saints may be shaken out of

		Then two months later Haggai got another prophetic word, and this time it was a solemn warning against what is unclean.<a name=228:2></a> This is just the opposite to acquiring glory, and it seems to suggest that if we are not acquiring features of glory we shall be very likely to become unclean by contact with the uncleanness that is all around us here.<a name=228:3></a> The question raised by Jehovah (verses 11 - 13) brought to light that holy things have no power to make holy what is not holy in itself, but what is unclean can quickly impart its own characteristic to anything which it touches.<a name=228:4></a> It is a warning against touching what is unclean, see <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>.<a name=228:5></a> If we want to be suitable to the house of God, and to have features of glory, we must keep from the touch of what is unclean.<a name=228:6></a> The people in running to their own houses were really unclean; the state of their hearts in allowing the house of God to lie waste while they pursued their own interests was one of uncleanness, and it brought upon them the severe governmental dealing of God.<a name=228:7></a> This is very much the state of the christian profession at the present time.<a name=228:8></a>

		The effect of the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah was that Zerubbabel and Jeshua rose up and began to build the house of God, "and with them were the prophets of God, who helped them".<a name=229:11></a> They did not wait for the sanction of Darius; they went on with the work as an obligation to which they were called by God, so that even onlookers could see that something was being done.<a name=229:12></a> It was reported to Darius the king that "the house of the great God" was "being built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is being carried on with diligence, and prospers in their hand", <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#5:8">Ezra  5:8</a>.<a name=229:13></a> There is a fairness in this report which does not appear in the letter written to Artaxerxes some years before.<a name=229:14></a> When faith moved in relation to the building of the house, God moved providentially to secure favourable conditions for His servants, and He also brought out His mind more fully, and in greater detail, as to the house and its service.<a name=229:15></a> The matter being referred to Darius brought to light the original decree of Cyrus when Jehovah charged him to build the house.<a name=229:16></a> This was the word of God for the time, for the commandment of

		"Let the house be built for a place where they offer sacrifices" (verse 3).<a name=230:3></a> It is well for the youngest believer to know that he is called to be built up along with his brethren as "a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>.<a name=230:4></a> The apostle Peter would have even "newborn babes" to think of this.<a name=230:5></a> Does it not appeal to our hearts when we are assured that we can offer something to God, and that He will be pleased with it?<a name=230:6></a> We are part of the holy priesthood; we are not merely spectators of what others offer; each of us is privileged to have part in the offering service.<a name=230:7></a>

		But this requires that "foundations be solidly laid" (verse 3); which means that Christ alone is to be before us as the One chosen of God and precious.<a name=230:8></a> If there were any admixture of self along with Christ nothing could be really <i>solid</i>.<a name=230:9></a> But "he that believes on him shall not be put to shame.<a name=230:10></a> To you therefore who believe is the preciousness".<a name=230:11></a> All the preciousness of Christ is for us as the basis of all our relations with God in His house.<a name=230:12></a> We are there according to the value and adornment of the chief Corner-stone.<a name=230:13></a> The thought of the foundation and the chief Corner-stone are brought together in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:6">1 Peter  2:6</a>, 7.<a name=230:14></a> He blends <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28:16">Isaiah  28:16</a> and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118:22">Psalm  118:22</a>.<a name=230:15></a> The solidity of what we rest upon is combined with the preciousness and attractiveness to God which are found in Christ.<a name=230:16></a> "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:11">1 Corinthians  3:11</a>.<a name=230:17></a> Paul had laid this foundation in his ministry at Corinth, and any solid building must be on that foundation.<a name=230:18></a> Whatever is built upon it must correspond with it or be found worthless.<a name=230:19></a> For responsible service in building is before us in the scripture which we are considering; it is what is done by means of the ministry of the word.<a name=230:20></a> The first essential for service in building is to be impressed by the fact that Jesus, God's anointed Man, is the foundation.<a name=230:21></a> There is to be no thought of building anything on man after the order of Adam; there must be the introduction of Jesus Christ as a foundational matter in the souls of saints.<a name=230:22></a> Paul's ministry left no uncertainty as to this.<a name=230:23></a>

		Ezra represents a ministry which brings out from Scripture increased light as to the service of God, a ministry which has in view that the house shall be spiritually beautified.<a name=237:10></a> This requires attention to detail.<a name=237:11></a> Priestly sensibilities will lead to particular attention being given to "the law", which, for us, includes the whole of Scripture.<a name=237:12></a> Ezra was "an accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens" (verse 12); he had an accurate acquaintance with the law, and would be able to bring the law to bear on every detail of the service.<a name=237:13></a> "The law", for us, includes all that God has made known as His will.<a name=237:14></a> An "accomplished scribe" can bring it out, and call attention to features which will beautify the house.<a name=237:15></a> When saints first began to break bread apart from any sectarian position, there was much yet to learn as to the assembly as the house of God, and its holy service.<a name=237:16></a> But saints in separation from human systems were in a position where they could learn, and as they were prepared to receive light it was given to them.<a name=237:17></a> Wherever there is faithfulness to light that has been given, God vouchsafes further light as to His will.<a name=237:18></a> The last century has witnessed a continual accession of spiritual light.<a name=237:19></a> Attention has been called to one thing after another which needed adjustment.<a name=237:20></a> God has not failed to provide a ministry which has brought out His mind with increasing clearness and fulness.<a name=237:21></a> He has given much help as to details connected with His service, and He will no doubt continue to do so.<a name=237:22></a> All the positive ministry which makes God better known, and which exalts His beloved Son, and which

		No thoughtful person can consider what has been furnished in ministry, even in our own time, without being impressed by the fact that it has tended to 'beautify' the house of God, and to enhance His service.<a name=238:3></a> Even conflicts which have arisen, and difficulties which have had to be met, have been the means of bringing out further light and giving increased knowledge of God, and this beautifies the house and helps its service.<a name=238:4></a> Sorrowful as conflicts are -- and particularly when they result in saints missing their way -- they are enriching when we see that something that is precious to God is at stake.<a name=238:5></a> This must be the case if there is any spiritual element at all in a conflict.<a name=238:6></a> It is in looking out for spiritual gain, and for what makes more of divine Persons, that we shall find safety and enlargement.<a name=238:7></a> Who can measure the gain that has come to saints through light being given as to eternal life and the Lord's sonship in manhood?<a name=238:8></a> Yet these great realities were not established in the faith and affections of saints without conflict.<a name=238:9></a> Enrichment lies in the positive ministry which God gives, and this is the thing to look out for.<a name=238:10></a> We must, in principle, keep near to Ezra and his companions; we must hold to that ministry which brings out the mind of God, and which adds to the beauty of His house and the richness of its service.<a name=238:11></a>

		It is touching to see God putting an earnest care for His house and its service into the hearts of many at a time when even those whom He had delivered from captivity had proved unfaithful, as we learn from chapter 9.<a name=238:12></a> The great provision of silver and gold and vessels which Ezra brought to Jerusalem was certainly not because the remnant at Jerusalem was in a good condition.<a name=238:13></a> It was far otherwise.<a name=238:14></a> The whole matter was the fruit of God's mercy and grace; it was a fresh movement of revival at a time when sad defection had taken place at Jerusalem.<a name=238:15></a> If God did not renew His work of revival from time to time it would most certainly die down, and He generally revives His work by bringing in some spiritual element that was not there before.<a name=238:16></a> I have no doubt that in the corrective epistles to Galatia and Corinth, and the protective epistle to Colosse, much was brought in that was in addition to what the saints had known before.<a name=238:17></a> And in the recovery of the truth it

		God does not work merely by truth or principles, but by persons in whom the truth abides.<a name=239:6></a> So we find a goodly number of persons in chapter 8 who were prepared to move with Ezra.<a name=239:7></a> We are thankful for all ministry of the truth, but truth is very ineffective unless persons move with it in a practical way.<a name=239:8></a> Ezra surveyed the company gathered together (chapter 8: 15) "and found none of the sons of Levi there".<a name=239:9></a> It is sad to think that, when God is moving so graciously to revive His work, there should be a lack of levites.<a name=239:10></a> I think it touches a weak spot even today.<a name=239:11></a> Ezra expects the "chief men" and the "men of understanding" to move in the matter.<a name=239:12></a> There must be "ministers for the house of our God" (verse 17).<a name=239:13></a> It was a matter for exercise and movement.<a name=239:14></a> When the Lord said, "the workmen are few".<a name=239:15></a> He told His disciples to "supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workmen unto his harvest".<a name=239:16></a> I suppose we are all conscious of the fewness of the labourers.<a name=239:17></a> Let us pray that "by the good hand of our God upon us" (verse 18) more may be furnished.<a name=239:18></a> Nethinim are also needed as well as levites.<a name=239:19></a> They have a subordinate, but very necessary, place as helping the levitical service.<a name=239:20></a> It is a comfort to know that there is room for service that is, perhaps, not so highly thought of as the public ministry of the word, but which helps that ministry in a somewhat lower grade of service.<a name=239:21></a> Not one who engages in such service is overlooked: "all of them were expressed by name".<a name=239:22></a> If we cannot exactly take the place of being levites, let us by all means be Nethinim, and help the levites!<a name=239:23></a>

		The exercise about "a right way" in verses 21 - 23 is very touching.<a name=239:24></a> The fact that God's good hand had been upon Ezra in a remarkable way did not diminish his exercise as to the path before him.<a name=239:25></a> "And I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of

		built, and provision made for its beautifying and the carrying on of its service, unfaithfulness of a serious character manifested itself amongst the returned remnant.<a name=241:1></a> The "princes" had to report to Ezra that, "The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations .<a name=241:2></a>.<a name=241:3></a>.<a name=241:4></a> for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and have mingled the holy seed with the peoples of the lands; and the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this unfaithfulness" (verses 1, 2).<a name=241:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "princes" were those who, like the house of Chloe at Corinth, discerned the unfaithfulness that had come in.<a name=241:6></a> One would gather that the prophetic ministry of Haggai and Zechariah had ceased at this time, so that no powerful voice from God had been raised to check the mixture of "the holy seed with the peoples of the lands".<a name=241:7></a> It is of deep interest to see that in the divine ordering of the assembly provision was made for ministry in each locality of a prophetic character (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>).<a name=241:8></a> This would assure that, along with what was for positive building up, there would be the calling attention, on God's part, to any influence which might tend to corrupt His temple.<a name=241:9></a> Those who prophesied would discern the incoming evil, and would bring in the good to counteract it, long before it showed itself in any glaring way.<a name=241:10></a> At Corinth the more showy speaking with tongues had evidently overshadowed the exercise of prophetic gift, and a moral state had developed which would have been checked in its beginnings if prophecy had had its due place in the assembly.<a name=241:11></a> One can understand that it was not a mere detail when Satan succeeded, in the very early days of the church, in setting up the clerical system so that meetings for the exercise of prophetic gift as contemplated in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>became impossible.<a name=241:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no doubt that corrupting influences will always be at work.<a name=241:13></a> Salvation lies, in the first place, in the ability to discern that they are at work.<a name=241:14></a> This was found with the "princes" when Ezra came to Jerusalem.<a name=241:15></a> So long as this element is present there is hope.<a name=241:16></a> For if it is pointed out that an evil is present, not only will priestly sensibilities become active, as they did in Ezra, but all who tremble at the words of God will be powerfully affected.<a name=241:17></a> Then, if full confession is made, the enemy's work may be so counteracted that complete restoration may be brought about.<a name=241:18></a> Indeed, it is a comfort to

		see that, notwithstanding the unfaithfulness that had to be mourned over and confessed, there is evidence of a much deeper work of God in the souls of His people in the last two chapters of this book than had been seen in the earlier chapters.<a name=242:1></a> The lesson of all this is most important for ourselves, for we often have sorrowful reminders that, in spite of much divine favour, the same kind of unfaithfulness shows itself amongst the returned remnant today.<a name=242:2></a> How often do we see links with the world formed, or links with believers not walking in the truth, either by marriage or friendship, or by association for mutual advantage, sometimes even by joining in worldly pleasures, or by the reading of worldly literature!<a name=242:3></a> If these things go on, "the holy seed" does not preserve its own distinctiveness and separation, and the consequences are spiritually disastrous.<a name=242:4></a> For these things being carried on are the clear evidence of unfaithfulness to the Lord.<a name=242:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noticed that the "foreign wives" with which the holy seed had mingled were of the very nations that had to be overcome in Joshua's day.<a name=242:6></a> After long centuries they were still present to exercise a baneful influence on the returned remnant.<a name=242:7></a> The very things by which the church was corrupted in its early days are the things which will be a snare to the remnant in our day.<a name=242:8></a> They are all "of the world", though presenting themselves in varied forms.<a name=242:9></a> "Foreign wives" taken by the people of God represent, for us, not only those personal alliances to which we have referred, but also principles or associations which are contrary to what should mark "the holy seed".<a name=242:10></a> For example, the legal principle, which Paul had to combat in the assemblies of Galatia, is one of the "foreign wives" which may be taken today.<a name=242:11></a> It is a principle which, over the greater part of christendom, has displaced the true knowledge of God.<a name=242:12></a> The world often ensnares by taking on a religious form suited to man after the flesh.<a name=242:13></a> But worldly religion always gives some place to the man that was crucified with Christ; it sets up again what God has condemned.<a name=242:14></a> And it always takes away from the enjoyment of the blessings of grace, liberty in Christ Jesus, sonship, and the Spirit of God's Son in our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=242:15></a> The loss of spiritual joy is a danger signal which should warn believers from continuing on the line of religious flesh.<a name=242:16></a> Paul said to the Galatians, "What then was your blessedness?<a name=242:17></a>" They had turned to law, to circumcision, to observing days and months and times and years, but

		Satan does not always use religious or legal flesh to turn us aside.<a name=243:2></a> Perhaps more often in our day he allures by something that appeals to our natural and carnal tendencies.<a name=243:3></a> What a terrible thing it is for one who has known something of the privileges of the assembly to give them up for some bit of fleshly gratification!<a name=243:4></a> It was by such means that he brought about unfaithfulness at Corinth in the early days, and he will use the same things now.<a name=243:5></a> Paul brought the truth of the temple before the Corinthians to correct their unholiness, and their association with the unclean and idolatrous world, and he brought the truth of the body before them to correct their tendency to form sects and parties or to act independently.<a name=243:6></a> Sectarianism is a carnal thing; it is the practical denial of that one body which the Spirit has formed.<a name=243:7></a> To adopt a sectarian principle today is really to take a "foreign wife"; it is to espouse a principle which is alien to the present working of God, for, according to truth, we are all part of a divinely formed organism, in which each member has its appointed place, and functions for the benefit of the body.<a name=243:8></a> Where the sectarian principle is adopted the clerical principle generally goes with it.<a name=243:9></a> I suppose the latter got a footing in the early days of the church through the readiness of the many, in a day of spiritual decline, to let another do the service which was really the privilege and responsibility of all the believing men.<a name=243:10></a> It is really a form of unfaithfulness, however unwittingly done.<a name=243:11></a>

		Then at Colosse there was a tendency to be led away "through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ".<a name=243:12></a> The human imagination delights in such things as worshipping angels, and prying into what is unseen, but Paul says that the one who would do this is "vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh".<a name=243:13></a> But philosophy and human imagination and ordinances and ascetic austerities are really of the world.<a name=243:14></a> Those who take up such things are really being fraudulently deprived of their prize; they are being carried away from Christ.<a name=243:15></a> They are as guilty of unfaithfulness to God as were those who took "foreign wives" in Ezra's day.<a name=243:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a beautiful touch of grace in "the evening oblation" being brought in here.<a name=244:9></a> A well-known servant of the Lord said, 'If you want a man to judge himself you must minister Christ to him'.<a name=244:10></a> I think it is on that principle that "the evening oblation" is mentioned here.<a name=244:11></a> The "evening oblation" was the offering by fire to Jehovah for a sweet odour of a lamb as a continual burnt-offering, with its oblation and drink-offering.<a name=244:12></a> "It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:42">Exodus  29:42</a>.<a name=244:13></a> God would have His people to know that the sweet odour of Christ is the ground on which He dwells in their midst, and is their God.<a name=244:14></a> It is there that He meets His people.<a name=244:15></a> Now God had not left this ground, though there had been great unfaithfulness on the part of His people, and He would have their repentance and confession to be in the light of it.<a name=244:16></a> We might, perhaps, without unduly straining the type, regard the "morning" oblation as setting forth God's precious thought at the beginning of the assembly day, and the "evening oblation" as having its place at the end of that day.<a name=244:17></a> Such an application is justified because there cannot possibly be any change in the ground on which God's people are before Him as accepted.<a name=244:18></a> He was with His saints at the beginning of this "accepted time" according to the infinite sweet odour and acceptance of the offering of Christ, and He is still with them on precisely the same ground.<a name=244:19></a> In the light of this what do we think of our links with the world, of the "foreign wives" by whom we have been ensnared?<a name=244:20></a> It is in seeing what we have

		So we can understand the very deep sorrow and confession of Ezra.<a name=245:2></a> He had in mind the wonderful place of the people as identified in God's thoughts with the sweet odour of the burnt-offering.<a name=245:3></a> As remembering this he could not do other than go down to the very lowest point in confession.<a name=245:4></a> He felt how unfaithful the people had been to the God who had set the burnt-offering among them throughout their generations.<a name=245:5></a> God has fully blessed us through Christ, and in Christ, and has not departed from any of His thoughts about us.<a name=245:6></a> Why should we not, in the sense of this marvellous grace, fully and deeply own our shame in forming links with the world which displace Christ in our hearts?<a name=245:7></a> God does not want us to judge ourselves legally, but from the standpoint of the immense favour in Christ in which He has called us.<a name=245:8></a> It was on this ground that He appealed to His erring saints in Galatia and at Corinth and elsewhere, and it is on this ground that He appeals to us.<a name=245:9></a> It is in getting a revived sense of His grace in Christ that we are brought down to the very bottom in the judgment of ourselves for having yielded to the influence of things which are really worthless.<a name=245:10></a> Whatever may be the form which unfaithfulness has taken in any one of us Christ is the power for self-judgment and confession, and also for courage and decision in putting away the influence that has ensnared us.<a name=245:11></a> As Christ is brought in and gets His right place with us once more, there is power to detect what is contrary to Him, and to feel its true character before God.<a name=245:12></a> What Ezra expressed in his prayer and confession was what the Spirit of Christ felt about the state of things that existed.<a name=245:13></a> If we truly return to a sense that Christ is everything for us before God we shall urgently desire to move into company with the Spirit of Christ about everything that has been a snare to us.<a name=245:14></a> We shall want to gather to Ezra as feeling that we have been a grief to Christ, but we want now to be a comfort to Him.<a name=245:15></a> Let us all really face before God the truth as to our state and associations.<a name=245:16></a>

		C.A.<a name=382:1></a>C.<a name=382:2></a> We were speaking last week of what Paul calls the testimony of our Lord.<a name=382:3></a> I think he dignifies the glad tidings by speaking of it in that way.<a name=382:4></a> We were seeing that it concerns the purpose and grace of God given to the saints in Christ Jesus before the ages of time, so that God has brought in, in His grace, life and incorruptibility.<a name=382:5></a> There is a living character of things introduced that cannot be corrupted, and Paul brings this before Timothy as encouragement in view of the corruption of everything in the christian profession.<a name=382:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Life and incorruptibility were ever in God's purpose, but were manifested by the appearing of Jesus Christ and His annulling death.<a name=382:7></a> Now the important thing is that what was in the purpose of God in Christ Jesus before the world was should be livingly in the saints by the Holy Spirit.<a name=382:8></a> That is really Paul's glad tidings and its results.<a name=382:9></a> The glad tidings are to this end, that what was in the purpose of God in Christ Jesus before the world was should now be vitally in the saints by the Holy Spirit.<a name=382:10></a>

		Paul speaks of the testimony of Christ in chapter 1, and the testimony of God in chapter 2 (1 Corinthians).<a name=383:2></a> The testimony of Christ was as much as to say that the candlestick was there and all its vessels, but the oil had not been furnished for the light and the lamps were burning dim.<a name=383:3></a> The testimony of the Christ was there established in the saints and not anywhere else, but they needed to be spiritual in order to preserve the light to the testimony; it needed spiritual persons.<a name=383:4></a> We can look at the thought of "in Christ Jesus" first from the side of divine purpose; there could be nothing defective or enfeebled on that side because it was given to the saints before the world began, and nothing that has happened in the history of the world or the history of individual believers could invalidate it.<a name=383:5></a>

		"In Christ Jesus" suggests to me that God has another Man before Him, and that in the sovereignty of His mercy, grace and power He has transferred the saints to that Man.<a name=383:6></a> He has transferred us vitally to Christ risen by giving us the Spirit.<a name=383:7></a> The blessing of Abraham has come to the gentiles in Christ Jesus that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:14">Galatians  3:14</a>.<a name=383:8></a> "In Christ Jesus" is connected with the presence of the Spirit in the saints.<a name=383:9></a> I cannot think of anything likely to be more establishing than that saints should consider Paul's use of the term "in Christ Jesus"; it is a great stay for the heart.<a name=383:10></a>

		One supremely important matter is brought before us in verse 8, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings".<a name=395:2></a> There is an immense amount in that.<a name=395:3></a> We might have thought, Why should he have had to say such a thing to Timothy?<a name=395:4></a> It is not remembering a fact, it is not remembering that He was raised (the Authorised Version of the Scriptures is a little misleading), but that he should remember Him raised.<a name=395:5></a> That is, we do not merely remember a fact, but we remember a Person in a certain condition.<a name=395:6></a> It is an important part of spiritual understanding to keep that Person in remembrance.<a name=395:7></a> All God's ways in the past, and the promises, are verified and substantiated now in that Person raised from among the dead.<a name=395:8></a> It is of supreme importance that we should remember Jesus Christ in resurrection conditions; we have to keep it ever in mind every day, not the fact that He is risen but that He is in resurrection conditions.<a name=395:9></a> That is the One we have to do with.<a name=395:10></a> This is the very root of deliverance from all that is of man in the religious profession today; it lies in remembering Jesus Christ raised from the dead.<a name=395:11></a> This moves the affections and spiritual understanding of the saints into a new region altogether.<a name=395:12></a> Man cannot take in resurrection.<a name=395:13></a> F.<a name=395:14></a>E.<a name=395:15></a>R.<a name=395:16></a> used to say that he was astonished at the religious world observing Easter; he could understand their observing Good Friday because the death of the Lord has come into the knowledge of man, but it was always a puzzle to him that they should celebrate Easter, because resurrection opens up a sphere which is entirely outside the range of man's thoughts and capacities.<a name=395:17></a> One could not link the risen Man with things here.<a name=395:18></a> The religious system has grown through forgetfulness of Jesus Christ raised from among the dead; that simple and blessed reality has been forgotten instead of being remembered.<a name=395:19></a> It is not the fact that has been forgotten; all professing Christians have it in their creeds that He rose the third day, they look on it as a matter of history; but Christ raised from among the dead does not belong to this world's history at all, it belongs to a region only known to faith.<a name=395:20></a> That is what made the breach between Paul and the Jews.<a name=395:21></a>

		Nothing but this will bring us to take up the ground of having died with Christ -- that is the real secret of everything.<a name=396:15></a> Have we died with Christ?<a name=396:16></a> Paul speaks of it here with an 'if', and the 'ifs' of Scripture are things to be very carefully noted.<a name=396:17></a> It is seeing the greatness of the Person who is on the other side of death, and seeing the greatness of all that is substantiated in Him, that prepares the heart to take up this attitude of having died together with Him.<a name=396:18></a>

		C.A.<a name=402:1></a>C.<a name=402:2></a> I think it applies rather within the professing church, not to the heathen as in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6">2 Corinthians  6</a>"Come out from among them, and be ye separate .<a name=402:3></a>.<a name=402:4></a>.<a name=402:5></a> and touch not the unclean thing".<a name=402:6></a> There it is primarily the profane idolatrous world; we get the contrast, Christ and Belial, light and darkness, righteousness and unrighteousness, the temple of God and idolatry.<a name=402:7></a> Saints are called out of this heathen world, but then Scripture contemplates iniquity in the sphere of the christian profession.<a name=402:8></a> It is a very solemn thing how little is thought of what is due to divine Persons.<a name=402:9></a> I was greatly affected a few years ago in Wigtown by seeing a monument to two women who were tied to stakes at low water to be drowned, the old one far out and the young one of eighteen near, so that she could see the old one drowned and be given an opportunity to recant.<a name=402:10></a> The inscription on the monument was, 'They died to maintain the rights of Christ in His assembly'.<a name=402:11></a> The point of righteousness is that you maintain the rights of Christ.<a name=402:12></a> If I call Jesus Lord the first principle with me must be to maintain what is due to Him.<a name=402:13></a> All else is unrighteousness and we are called to withdraw from it.<a name=402:14></a> It is a test for every one of us; we ought not to assume we have done it, but to see it is a divine obligation on every one of us.<a name=402:15></a> It might involve martyrdom even.<a name=402:16></a> I have often been struck by the fact that the martyrs frequently died for what might be called a very small point; if they would have changed a word or an expression, sometimes they could have been saved; it often all hung on a word and they might save their lives.<a name=402:17></a> Many died for what we, in a cold blooded way, call a non-essential.<a name=402:18></a> We are in a terrible day now; the whole talk is of the rights of man.<a name=402:19></a> We would like to hear about the rights of God and of Christ.<a name=402:20></a> If christians were in the spirit of these two women there would be some testimony for God.<a name=402:21></a> Things may look well in the eyes of men, but if the rights of Christ are not maintained it is iniquity, because He is the <i>Lord</i>, and He is the only One who has any rights.<a name=402:22></a> Maintaining the rights of Christ is the mark of the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=402:23></a> It is not the primary defect that the rights of Christ are not maintained, but the primary defect is that no place is given to the Spirit.<a name=402:24></a> The man who speaks by the Spirit says <i>Lord</i> to Jesus.<a name=402:25></a> The Holy Spirit does not lead in any uncertain way, but the mark of His leading is that we own the lordship of Christ.<a name=402:26></a> "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit".<a name=402:27></a> Supposing the Spirit had His

		It conveys that the Lord would have the local assemblies to correspond in their public position with the way in which He Himself is known as the candlestick in the holy place.<a name=435:8></a> The public position of the tribes round the tabernacle was intended to correspond with the place they had in the breastplate; they had an inside place in the breastplate and their outside position was to correspond with it.<a name=435:9></a> The Lord is known as the candlestick in the holy place; He could hardly be spoken of as the candlestick when He was here, for we do not think of a candle or lamp when the sun is shining!<a name=435:10></a> When the Lord was here the Dayspring from on high visited men, so He spoke of His time here as "the day".<a name=435:11></a> It was a measured period -- "Are there not twelve hours in the day?<a name=435:12></a>" -- but there was a brief period when the light of day shone before men in the Person of the Son of God; whether the darkness could apprehend it or not, the light of day was there.<a name=435:13></a> Now the Lord being absent brings in the candlestick period; the Lord Jesus Christ as the candlestick is known in the holy place.<a name=435:14></a> The candlestick in the tabernacle was never seen except by priestly eyes, and that is the position of the Lord as the candlestick.<a name=435:15></a> The Revelation views the saints as priests, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father", and as priests we are privileged

		Correspondence is brought about in the first place by accepting that according to the truth each local assembly is to have "golden lamp" character.<a name=436:10></a> It may be said that it was so at the beginning; the local assemblies were then golden lamps, but things are very different now!<a name=436:11></a> But the golden lamps show what local assemblies are according to the mind of the Lord.<a name=436:12></a> We may be sure that, if the local assemblies were golden lamps in His mind at the beginning, they are golden lamps in His mind at the end; He would not give up the divine thought.<a name=436:13></a> I believe the last chapter of this book intimates that there will be local assemblies at the end.<a name=436:14></a> "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies.<a name=436:15></a> <i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star.<a name=436:16></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=436:17></a>

		It is evident that the object of the Lord in addressing the assemblies in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 was to bring about repentance and recovery.<a name=437:5></a> There is no suggestion in the seven epistles to the assemblies of His executing present judgment upon them; He speaks of what He will do if there is no repentance, but He ever speaks in the present with the object of producing repentance.<a name=437:6></a> Whatever has come in to dim the brightness of the golden lamps -- and much has come in -- the Lord points out that these things are to be the subject of repentance; and true repentance would mean recovery, so that the Lord's thought right through was recovery.<a name=437:7></a> I believe He is working now, in the last days, in a special way to recover not only individual saints to Himself personally, but to recover the golden lamp character in local assemblies; perhaps outwardly in a small way in a remnant, but as we have often been told, a remnant is a bit of the original, a remnant has a distinctive place as a reserved portion for the Lord.<a name=437:8></a>

		Bearing in mind that the saints are viewed in this book as priests it might well be expected that they would have spiritual sensibilities.<a name=437:9></a> If a person has spiritual sensibilities, what will be the effect upon him if the Lord as Son of man says, Such and such a thing does not please me?<a name=437:10></a> Will he not be sure to repent?<a name=437:11></a> Is not this to be expected, especially if He puts His estimate of things in writing?<a name=437:12></a> What we see here is that the Lord is so concerned about the local assemblies that He causes His servant John to <i>write</i> to them.<a name=437:13></a> He would put His moral judgment of them in writing so as to give the opportunity of sitting down quietly and looking at it, and going over it again and again.<a name=437:14></a> When there is a heart to consider what He says, and, having considered, to repent, there will be recovery.<a name=437:15></a> I do not say how many out of the mass will repent, but those who repent and are recovered become the true remnant; they carry

		I do not want to stress a point, the evidence of which is outside Scripture, but it is of interest to know that it is generally supposed that the apostle John spent the last years of his life, and wrote his gospel and epistles in this very district where the seven assemblies were.<a name=438:2></a> The general tradition is that he spent his closing years in Ephesus, right in the midst of the Asiatic assemblies.<a name=438:3></a> If this was so, it would confirm the thought that the Lord intended his ministry to be a corrective of all that was amiss in the local assemblies.<a name=438:4></a> John has been called the Lord's reserve man, and his ministry would, through the working of God, restore the golden lamp character in local assemblies.<a name=438:5></a>

		The Lord in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 is communicating His moral judgment of local conditions to the assemblies; it is communicated in such a way as to exercise the heart and conscience.<a name=438:6></a> The Lord is saying, 'I approve of this and disapprove of that, and if you do not repent of what I disapprove I must judge it'.<a name=438:7></a> It is a communication from the Lord to our hearts and consciences in order that we may be confirmed in everything that pleases Him, and corrected in everything that displeases Him; the object in view being that the golden lamp character may be preserved or restored, and the local light be undimmed.<a name=438:8></a>

		If there is one overcomer in a place, no one can tell what the result will be.<a name=440:5></a> We are apt to look at the overcomer as only acquiring something for himself, but I think the result of overcoming would be that others get the benefit.<a name=440:6></a> Overcoming in the Old Testament was almost invariably for the benefit of others, and it was clearly so in the case of the Lord Himself.<a name=440:7></a> One overcomer often becomes a deliverer to many; David and his mighty men were overcomers, but all Israel got the benefit.<a name=440:8></a> An overcomer in a local assembly might effect deliverance for the whole assembly.<a name=440:9></a> J.<a name=440:10></a>N.<a name=440:11></a>D.<a name=440:12></a> was a great overcomer; he met in conflict a great deal that was opposed to the interests of Christ; we might say he slew many Philistines, but the whole church benefited, and thousands in a very direct way, who would perhaps never have had the energy to fight such battles for themselves.<a name=440:13></a> Of course there must be exercise on the part of all, and one must be something of an overcomer oneself to take up the benefit of what an overcomer secures, but it seems to me that the Lord values the overcomer as standing in a way that is really beneficial to the whole assembly.<a name=440:14></a>

		We have to come back to what is seen in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>; the Lord as in the character of the Son of man is seen in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=441:5></a> I have no doubt that there is a reference in this to <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:9">Daniel  7:9</a>, 10, 13, 14: "I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, and its wheels burning fire.<a name=441:6></a> A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him .<a name=441:7></a>.<a name=441:8></a>.<a name=441:9></a> .<a name=441:10></a> I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<a name=441:11></a> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed".<a name=441:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The consideration of this gives great force to the fact that the Lord is seen in the midst of the golden lamps in the character of the Son of man; indeed the characteristics of the Ancient of days and the Son of man seem to be blended in Him as thus seen; Daniel tells us that the Son of man reached unto the Ancient of days (chapter 7: 13, N.<a name=441:13></a>T.<a name=441:14></a> note).<a name=441:15></a> The Ancient of days is seen sitting in judgment; when that comes to pass we may be sure that everything will be dealt with according to the majesty of the One who sits; then the Son of man comes and is brought near as One who reaches to the Ancient of days -- how wonderful!<a name=441:16></a> It implies that His judgment of everything is equal to that of Him who sits in judgment.<a name=441:17></a> None but One who was Himself a divine Person could reach to the Ancient of days; it is One who is eternally divine who now as like the Son of man stands and walks in the midst of the local assemblies.<a name=441:18></a>

		I should like to say a word on the mystery in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:20">Revelation  1:20</a>; it is most instructive for exercised hearts.<a name=443:8></a> "The mystery of the seven stars which thou hast seen on my right hand, and the seven golden lamps".<a name=443:9></a> It would be worth our while to think it over.<a name=443:10></a> There is no mystery about church failure; it is written large in a thousand books of church history; but there is a mystery in the seven stars being seen on the right hand of the Son of man.<a name=443:11></a> He would have us to be acquainted with that mystery.<a name=443:12></a> He would have us to know that there is strength in His right hand to hold every responsible element in local assemblies, so that there may be complete correspondence with Himself.<a name=443:13></a> Every responsible element having been brought down to death at His feet, the strength of His right hand can be experienced; then the stars will find their right place in the hand of the Son of man.<a name=443:14></a> If held in that mighty hand, do you not think that they will be equal to responsibility?<a name=443:15></a> Before they could be in the right hand of the Son of man every one of them has learned that as to himself he must fall as dead at the feet of the Son of man.<a name=443:16></a> He has had to learn that all strength, support, and sufficiency flows out from Christ, all comes from there.<a name=443:17></a> So that strength for local assembly responsibilities is derived directly from the right hand of Christ; it is there for us, however little we may believe it,

		Although the Lord has favoured us with a good deal of light as to the assembly, we still need to be reminded of the special place which local assemblies have in His mind.<a name=445:1></a> We are all apt to be too individual, and to forget that the Lord is concerned about assemblies -- local companies of saints.<a name=445:2></a> Such companies are of great interest to Him because this is the particular form which the work and testimony of God takes at the present time.<a name=445:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remember that Solomon is spoken of in Ecclesiastes as the Preacher, and in the margin of the New Translation the word 'preacher' is said to mean 'a former of assemblies'.<a name=445:4></a> The Lord would have us to consider Him in that light; it is the key to what took place in the early days of the church's history, and to what is taking place now.<a name=445:5></a> It is one of Christ's excellent designations that He is 'a former of assemblies'; when the voice of Christ is listened to, assemblies will be formed.<a name=445:6></a> It was so at the beginning, the speaking of Christ was heard, and the result was, not only that people were converted and brought into the blessing of the gospel, but local assemblies were formed; Christ was known to be the 'former of assemblies'.<a name=445:7></a> It was so at Corinth; Christ spoke in Paul (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:3">2 Corinthians  13:3</a>) and the result of His speaking was that an assembly was formed in that city, and it became a "golden lamp" -- a vessel of spiritual light; that is the proper ideal of a local assembly.<a name=445:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of local assemblies has very largely disappeared in Christendom.<a name=445:9></a> There are great national systems of religion, and sects, some with a little more light than others, but all constituted by influences other than the speaking of Christ.<a name=445:10></a> The local assembly viewed according to the mind of God is constituted by the speaking of Christ, and as a vessel of spiritual light it is spiritual in its constitution.<a name=445:11></a> We must begin with this idea; it does not do for us to derive our thoughts from the confused and disorderly state of Christendom; we must view this matter according to the divine conception; if that is before us it will steady our souls.<a name=445:12></a> It is a help to get the thought

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=446>[Page 446]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that according to God each local assembly is a vessel of spiritual light, and there is but that one vessel of spiritual light in a city.<a name=446:1></a> There was such a vessel in Corinth, and it had its counterpart in every other city and place where the Lord's name was called upon.<a name=446:2></a> Spiritual light was there, and it was nowhere else; outside was darkness.<a name=446:3></a> It should be our desire to be identified with that which is locally a vessel of spiritual light; that is what we want to look for.<a name=446:4></a> We can understand how Satan would desire to obscure such lights, and to introduce into local assemblies elements of darkness, but we may be sure that the Lord will never give up the original divine thought, nor will He acquiesce in anything that is contrary to it.<a name=446:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may learn from the verses read the kind of material of which the local assembly is formed; it is composed of persons who have the consciousness of the present love of Christ.<a name=446:6></a> In each local assembly you could hear such an utterance as this, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=446:7></a> Those who can say that have a spiritual constitution.<a name=446:8></a> The first feature of the local assembly is that it is a company of persons in the consciousness of the present love of Christ; then they can say, He "has washed us from our sins in his blood".<a name=446:9></a> He sets us together in the very place where we had been sinners, in the complete cleansing which His blood effects; all that made up our former history is washed away.<a name=446:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He "has .<a name=446:11></a>.<a name=446:12></a>.<a name=446:13></a> made us a kingdom"; that intimates that we are not sinning now.<a name=446:14></a> Having been washed from our sins in His blood, He has made us a kingdom; He has constituted us a realm for God.<a name=446:15></a> To be a kingdom is a contrast to sinning; it is truly a blessed thing to be a realm for God.<a name=446:16></a> In every place where there is a local assembly there is a bit of territory which constitutes a divine realm.<a name=446:17></a> That is an important spiritual element, and, as we have said, if there is to be a local vessel of spiritual light, spiritual elements are essential to it.<a name=446:18></a> Anyone who loves God would delight to know that there is a bit of territory in the place where he lives that is an ordered realm for God, a realm where insubject or unruly elements are not tolerated, a kingdom -- not a democracy, and that as having been subdued to God by His grace he forms part of it.<a name=446:19></a> That is how Christ forms assemblies.<a name=446:20></a> As these spiritual features are present -- the consciousness of Christ's present love, of being washed from every stain of what pertained to our former history, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we walk together locally as a kingdom, a realm for God, and as delivered from the lawlessness of sin, we are free to understand that Christ has made us priests to God and His Father.<a name=447:2></a> That is another element; we have spiritual constitution Godward; that is the thought of priests.<a name=447:3></a> It is not merely that we are spiritual enough to refuse the flesh and to be separate from the world -- that would be involved in being a kingdom -- but there is something further; He has made us priests to God; there is spirituality Godward.<a name=447:4></a> It is in taking account of these elements that we get a right and divine idea of the local assembly.<a name=447:5></a> When these elements are present there is a vessel of spiritual light locally, a number of persons who can stand in priestly service in the presence of Christ's God and Father, having ability to serve intelligently in prayer and praise and worship.<a name=447:6></a> The speaking of Christ leads to our having a place as priests with His God and His Father, though believers are often slow to follow the leading of Christ in this respect.<a name=447:7></a> If we read the gospels we see how the speaking of Christ was all designed to lead men in their thoughts and affections to His God and Father.<a name=447:8></a> One great end for which He came was that men might be constituted priests to His God and Father.<a name=447:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the local assembly the headship of Christ is recognised.<a name=447:10></a> There are many large and fine buildings where the name of Christ is mentioned, but what spiritual persons would look for is the recognition of the headship of Christ.<a name=447:11></a> Where it is recognised, there is something locally that has assembly character, and priestly service to His God and His Father will be found there.<a name=447:12></a> Where these elements are found there will be locally a vessel of spiritual light -- a golden lamp.<a name=447:13></a> I trust that each one of us has a desire to be identified with what has that character, and to contribute to it as being an integral part of it; surely none of us would care to be an unattached unit!<a name=447:14></a> We desire to be thoroughly committed to what is of Christ and of God, to be part of the local vessel of spiritual light, not merely to be near it, but part of it.<a name=447:15></a> This is a real exercise for young people and for any who have not definitely taken their part and place in the local assembly; it is for them to consider whether they are not robbing the Lord of His due and God of His realm.<a name=447:16></a> As we learn from Scripture the divine thought as to local assemblies it becomes our privilege and responsibility to confess

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was before me on this occasion to dwell on the immense resources that are available for support in local assemblies.<a name=448:3></a> It is evident that assemblies <i>can</i> be maintained as vessels of spiritual light; we see that in Smyrna and Philadelphia, both of which came under the eye of the Son of man without rebuke.<a name=448:4></a> Our dear brethren who do not recognise the local assembly, and who do not identify themselves with it, miss the peculiar grace which there is on the part of divine Persons for the assemblies; I believe it surpasses the grace that there is for individuals.<a name=448:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This comes out here very plainly in verse 4: "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth".<a name=448:6></a> Think of that grace!<a name=448:7></a> Favourableness on the part of each Person in the Godhead, not here towards individuals, but flowing out upon the saints assembly-wise, for it is to "the seven assemblies".<a name=448:8></a> There is grace commensurate with the position, so that if much responsibility attaches to local assemblies as being golden lamps, there is corresponding grace.<a name=448:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God in His eternal unchangeableness -- "Him who is, and who was, and who is to come"; God in His eternal faithfulness, is favourable to local assemblies.<a name=448:10></a> It is in writing to a local assembly that Paul says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", and in chapter 10, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear".<a name=448:11></a> It is the faithfulness of God as pledged to those who are walking in the fellowship that finds expression in the local assembly.<a name=448:12></a> The faithfulness of God is a very good 'ground of gathering'.<a name=448:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is grace from "the seven Spirits which are before his throne".<a name=448:14></a> This is the Spirit of God not viewed as indwelling persons, or as the one Spirit baptising all saints in one body, but regarded in His relation to the throne.<a name=448:15></a> Perfection is there as intimated by the number seven, but seen figuratively as

		"lamps of fire, burning before the throne", chapter 4: 5.<a name=449:1></a> It suggests the maintenance in a judicial way of what corresponds with the throne.<a name=449:2></a> The seven Spirits are viewed objectively in the unlimited power that attaches to a divine Person to maintain what is due to the throne.<a name=449:3></a> The fact that grace and peace come to the local assemblies from the seven Spirits would assure us of divine help in matters relating to the throne, that is the rights of God.<a name=449:4></a> Questions do sometimes arise that are like an Amalekite hand on the throne; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:16">Exodus  17:16</a>.<a name=449:5></a> The seven Spirits of God would not tolerate any defiance of divine rights, but they are favourable to the assemblies as being resource for us in matters which require to be judged as being contrary to the throne.<a name=449:6></a> Then we read that the Lamb's eyes "are the seven Spirits of God which are sent into all the earth" (chapter 5: 6), so that in the seven Spirits of God there is a power of discernment which will soon search all the earth, but it is at the present time favourable to the assemblies as being divine resource for the distinguishing of good and evil.<a name=449:7></a> There is this in an unlimited way in the seven Spirits of God.<a name=449:8></a> The Spirit as indwelling the saints may be grieved or even quenched, and in that way the gain of His presence be largely missed, but no limitations can ever be put upon the seven Spirits of God; it is a comfort to know that the Son of man has the seven Spirits of God; chapter 3: 1.<a name=449:9></a> The perfection of spiritual power is with Him, whatever may be the state of the church.<a name=449:10></a> He has a power which can act sovereignly for the assemblies, whatever the conditions are here.<a name=449:11></a> I think we must recognise that there are sovereign and varied actions of the seven Spirits of God.<a name=449:12></a> I do not think the Spirit speaking to the assemblies is quite His action as in the body, but His action as at the disposal of Christ, and as in accord with the throne.<a name=449:13></a> There are no limitations to what the seven Spirits can do, and Christ possesses them.<a name=449:14></a> There is always the plenitude and perfection of spiritual power with Him, but it is there for the good of the assemblies; there is with Him spiritual power commensurate with all assembly responsibility.<a name=449:15></a> If the golden lamps fail as vessels of spiritual light, He has the seven Spirits of God, as well as the seven stars; we can connect power with Him in an undiminished way, and He still has the seven stars.<a name=449:16></a> I take that to mean that there are still responsible elements which He can own and use; this gives a wonderful idea of resource.<a name=449:17></a> When we think of walking in local assemblies we become

		Then lastly, "and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth".<a name=450:5></a> This brings together what He was, what He is, and what He will be, and shows that in every character He is favourable to the local assemblies.<a name=450:6></a> There is grace for us according to all that Jesus Christ was as "the faithful witness"; there was no failure there, no obscuring element, nothing that came short in any way of the full testimony that God would have to be rendered.<a name=450:7></a> Then as "first-born from the dead" we see Him as pre-eminent in resurrection; all the power of resurrection is known in Him from whom grace and peace come to us; that power is equal to anything.<a name=450:8></a> As "prince of the kings of the earth" He will order all for the pleasure and glory of God in a coming day.<a name=450:9></a> These varied titles are brought in to show how rich is the fund of grace that can be drawn upon.<a name=450:10></a> There is no need to be discouraged if we meet with difficulties; they are not insurmountable if compared with the resources which are available.<a name=450:11></a> We have to notice, as was remarked before, that the Lord has preserved us from thinking that assemblies in local responsibility will always be a failure, because He has shown us that out of seven assemblies there are two concerning which He has no word of rebuke; showing that those are contemplated who utilise divine resources and are thus preserved from failure.<a name=450:12></a> We should covet to be without rebuke, that when the Lord comes in and looks around the local assembly He might find us so sustained by divine resources that He has no need to rebuke.<a name=450:13></a>

		That leads me, finally, to say a little about the end of chapter 1, where the Lord brings out what a resource He is.<a name=451:1></a> John saw the Son of man in His majestic glory, and he says, "I fell at his feet as dead".<a name=451:2></a> John had long before this heard the Lord's words -- I have no doubt they sank deeply into his heart -- "without me ye can do nothing"; but now John comes to the experimental realisation of it, and we all have to come to it, especially as to our assembly exercises.<a name=451:3></a> All this has in view assembly exercises.<a name=451:4></a> We have to learn experimentally that without Him we can do nothing.<a name=451:5></a> Nothing will pass the divine scrutiny except what has its source in Himself.<a name=451:6></a> It is only thus that there can truly be a golden lamp; a vessel of spiritual light must derive everything from Christ; there cannot be a contribution from nature or the flesh.<a name=451:7></a> John was made to realise that he must derive everything from Christ.<a name=451:8></a>

		Then, "he laid his right hand upon me" -- that is power.<a name=451:9></a> The Lord is ever ready to lay His right hand upon us.<a name=451:10></a> I believe it requires some measure of spiritual vitality to fall at His feet as dead; there must be a certain sensitiveness to divine impressions.<a name=451:11></a> If we realised that the judgment of the Ancient of days had actually come into the present in regard of the assemblies the result would be that we should at once be prepared to admit that nothing will stand that judgment but what is derived from Christ.<a name=451:12></a> Then He puts His right hand on us, and where the right hand of the Son of man comes there is power.<a name=451:13></a> He speaks next of what there is in Himself; "Fear not; <i>I</i> am the first and the last"; that is as much as to say, 'John, you must begin and end with Me'; then, "and the living one"; I understand that to convey that He is the source of life for us.<a name=451:14></a> "The living one" is the gospel of John in three words.<a name=451:15></a> Then "I became dead"; He had to go that way in order that we might live in Him, but He adds, "behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=451:16></a> He has the key in chapter 3 to open the door to let us in to all the treasuries of precious things, but here He has the keys of death and hades to liberate us from everything that belongs to the domain of death, or to the evil powers of the invisible world; in short, from everything that is hostile to Himself and to God.<a name=451:17></a>
