		There is one thing I think must strike the most casual reader of Scripture and that is God knew the end from the beginning.<a name=3:1></a> You see the first page of Scripture and the last are in perfect harmony with each other.<a name=3:2></a> We get the tree of life and the river in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>and the tree of life and the river in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>.<a name=3:3></a> Now that shows me from the beginning to the end God has the same things before Him.<a name=3:4></a> God does not change His ways.<a name=3:5></a> His dispensations may change but God does not.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>we have a picture of the work of God in connection with His counsels.<a name=3:7></a> You may say it is a picture of creation, but it is a wonderful picture of God's work which leads right on to the rest of God.<a name=3:8></a> The beginning of Genesis gives a description of the work of the six days, and it ends with the sabbath of rest, and it is thus a picture of the end to which God is really working.<a name=3:9></a> He is working up to a certain point and that is to secure rest and satisfaction for Himself in the full blessing of man.<a name=3:10></a> Depend upon it, that is God's object.<a name=3:11></a> In chapter 2 we come to the unfolding of God's ways.<a name=3:12></a> God has been pleased to take certain ways in order to reach His end, and in the ways of God it was necessary that man, God's creature, should be the subject of testing.<a name=3:13></a> I think that is very plain.<a name=3:14></a> When God made man He put him in the garden of Eden to test him.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People get strange ideas of what a beautiful place the garden of Eden was but, though that garden was a beautiful place, it was a place of testing and was intended to be so.<a name=3:16></a> The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was there and it was

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		forbidden them.<a name=4:1></a> It was the test of man's obedience and confidence in God and the penalty of death was attached to disobedience.<a name=4:2></a> So that the garden of Eden, beautiful as it was, was a place of testing for man, and I suppose everybody can see that when man was thus tested he turned out a complete failure through disobedience, and thus fell under the power of sin and came under death as the judgment of God.<a name=4:3></a> And then when God was pleased to set up government and put the sword of government in the hand of Noah after the flood, man despised His government, and when God gave him His law he broke it, and when He sent prophets man evilly treated them, and when He last of all sent His Son, Him they rejected and crucified.<a name=4:4></a> And now that He causes His gospel to be preached in this world, what do men do with it?<a name=4:5></a> They resist the Holy Spirit and will not receive the glad tidings of the grace of God.<a name=4:6></a> God is testing man from the beginning to the end and the result of the test is that at every point man turns out a complete failure.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not know whether that is the conclusion come to by everyone here, but with that book in your hand how can you come to any other?<a name=4:8></a> At every part of man's history he is an utter failure.<a name=4:9></a> The test began in the garden of Eden and is still going on, and that test is not the law but Christ.<a name=4:10></a> The question for everyone is, "What think ye of Christ?<a name=4:11></a>" They who believe on Him are the children of God, and the rest are accursed.<a name=4:12></a> You know there is a solemn scripture connected with the gospel, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>).<a name=4:13></a> There is only one of two things for the sinner; if he will not have the blessing he must have the curse.<a name=4:14></a> And why not be blessed?<a name=4:15></a> Because they love the world and love to have their own way and will not submit themselves to God.<a name=4:16></a> But the end of this is death.<a name=4:17></a> Death comes in as the result of the testing of man.<a name=4:18></a> The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was forbidden, and forbidden because man was not fit to touch it.<a name=4:19></a> It was too great a matter for man to touch, and God knew very well if man attempted to touch the question of good and evil he

		would involve himself in utter ruin, so God forbad it.<a name=5:1></a> Well, they disobeyed God and the result has been a world of sin and sorrow and death; and the world is established thus, as it were, under God's eye today.<a name=5:2></a> That is the result of the testing of man.<a name=5:3></a> He has plunged himself, and we have all plunged ourselves into sin and death and Satan's power.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let me say there were two things in the garden not connected with the testing of man; they had a place on another line altogether.<a name=5:5></a> The first was the tree of life and the second was the river.<a name=5:6></a> These had nothing to do with the testing of man.<a name=5:7></a> They were symbolical of what was in the mind of God; and I do not think it can be difficult in the mind of any Christian to see that the tree of life was a figure of Christ.<a name=5:8></a> I think it is equally clear that the river was typical of the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:9></a> So that on the first page of Scripture we see in emblem Christ and the Spirit as God's provision for man.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not see there could have been much meaning in the tree of life for Adam in innocence.<a name=5:11></a> I do not think it could have meant anything to him.<a name=5:12></a> What would be the good of the tree of life to a man not under death?<a name=5:13></a> It seems to me the tree of life could only have its place when sin and death had come in, and not before.<a name=5:14></a> But it is very interesting to see that before man had come under sin and before he is tested, God had a provision in His own mind that was in store for man against the time when sin and death should come in.<a name=5:15></a> And I believe, beloved friends, the whole of Scripture is the history of how God has brought in Christ and the Spirit that there might be infinite blessing for man, and at the same time real satisfaction and rest for God.<a name=5:16></a> And I think we get the climax in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>.<a name=5:17></a> There you get the tree in the midst of the street of the city and of the river, and the river of the water of life flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.<a name=5:18></a> That is the climax.<a name=5:19></a> It is a picture of the garden of Eden; when worked out in all its blessed fulfilment you get the tree and the river again.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we see really the consequences of Adam having eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we shall
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		find the thought of the tree of life very precious.<a name=6:1></a> And I do not think anyone would think much of the tree of life until he had realised what was meant by the other tree.<a name=6:2></a> You see sin came in in connection with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and death by sin, and not only that, but Satan's power.<a name=6:3></a> People do not think of it, but it is a reality that Satan is the god and prince of this world.<a name=6:4></a> They think as they look at members of parliament and cabinet ministers that they are ordering everything as they like; but there is a secret invisible power behind the scenes moving everything in this world, and that power is the power of Satan.<a name=6:5></a> The Lord spoke of him as the prince of this world; and Paul calls him the god of this world, and he speaks of him as the ruler of the authority of the air, and the spirit that works in the sons of disobedience.<a name=6:6></a> A man thinks he is doing his own will, but he is not; he is doing Satan's will and using the power of Satan.<a name=6:7></a> Now these facts have to be recognised.<a name=6:8></a> Sin has come in and death by sin, but people regard death as a natural event; it is the most unnatural event possible to happen.<a name=6:9></a> To call it the course of nature is an abominable lie and a libel upon God.<a name=6:10></a> Not a bit of it!<a name=6:11></a> It is the judgment of God upon sin.<a name=6:12></a> People do not die in the course of nature but under the judgment of God.<a name=6:13></a> "The wages of sin is death".<a name=6:14></a> God never created man to be a dying man; death came in by sin.<a name=6:15></a> Sin has come in and death has come in and Satan's power has come in.<a name=6:16></a> Now we are all involved in this matter; every one of us is deeply affected because sin has come into the world.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A young man once said to an old Christian, 'I have found original sin in the Bible'.<a name=6:18></a> The old man replied, 'Have you found it in your own heart?<a name=6:19></a>' Now we have found sin in our own heart and not only in the Bible, and we have come under death and as children of Adam we have fallen under Satan's power.<a name=6:20></a> Why I dwell on this is to show that before Christ could be the tree of life for us and before we could receive the Spirit which answers to the river, this terrible question must be settled, the question of sin and death and Satan's power.<a name=6:21></a> These things must be settled.<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved friends, I do not know whether they are settled for you or not, but I know they are settled for God; and the way they have been settled is such that the full blessing of it is available for us.<a name=7:1></a> Christ is the tree of life, and He is that after settling every question that came in by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=7:2></a> How was it done?<a name=7:3></a> Take the question of sin; that is the first point.<a name=7:4></a> I found myself as a natural man in company with Simon Peter in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>crying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:8">Luke  5:8</a>).<a name=7:5></a> Mark that word "sinful".<a name=7:6></a> How ready people are to say, 'Oh yes, we are all sinners', but how few have the sense of being a "sinful" man  --  full of sin.<a name=7:7></a> Now how is that to be met?<a name=7:8></a> Why, only by Christ: it can only be met by a holy sacrifice; and Christ, God's beloved Son, came into this world, born of the virgin, born in holy flesh, that He might go to the cross and be made sin, and in His sacrifice put it away.<a name=7:9></a> Has it been accomplished?<a name=7:10></a> Yes, blessed be God, it has.<a name=7:11></a> There has been a sacrifice offered, atonement made, and the benefit of it is open for every sinner in this world.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then take death; you see, death has come in through sin.<a name=7:13></a> Well, we could not meet it.<a name=7:14></a> It is no use talking of meeting death.<a name=7:15></a> Suppose you had all the medical men with all the medical science in the world: ask them if they can meet the question of death and set it aside?<a name=7:16></a> Why, they would laugh at you.<a name=7:17></a> But Christ has come into the world and gone into death and has tasted death for every thing.<a name=7:18></a> The Son of the blessed God, upon whom death had no claim, for He was without sin, and hence over Him death could have no power, for He was the Prince of life, He has come into this world and tasted death for every thing.<a name=7:19></a> What a wonderful thing!<a name=7:20></a> The very judgment that rested upon you and upon me has been taken in love by the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what about Satan's power?<a name=7:22></a> There is the universal power of Satan.<a name=7:23></a> Has Christ been able to deal with that?<a name=7:24></a> Yes, He has.<a name=7:25></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>God says, 'The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head'.<a name=7:26></a> No one can meet Satan but Christ.<a name=7:27></a> You know there is a great deal of wickedness in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		way people speak of Satan  --  even among Christians.<a name=8:1></a> People speak of him in a frivolous way and in a very light way that they would be afraid to do if they knew what a great dignitary he is.<a name=8:2></a> You know the archangel Michael would not bring against him a railing accusation (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#9">Jude  9</a>).<a name=8:3></a> There is only one Person who could bruise the serpent's head, and that is Christ.<a name=8:4></a> He came into this world and into the place of sin, and was there to bruise the serpent's head.<a name=8:5></a> True, the serpent bruised His heel; but at that very moment his head was crushed beneath that victorious heel.<a name=8:6></a> Thus Christ has annulled him that had the might of death, that is the devil, and broken the power of Satan for ever.<a name=8:7></a> Beloved friends, that is why Satan is not god and prince in my heart and has no possession there, because the One who has broken his power has a place there; and that is the only way Satan is displaced.<a name=8:8></a> It is by Christ coming in.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see when these things came in by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, sin, death and Satan's power were all met by Christ going into death, and now Christ in resurrection is the tree of life.<a name=8:10></a> Mark that, it is Christ in resurrection.<a name=8:11></a> It is in resurrection that Christ is really precious to a sinner.<a name=8:12></a> When Christ was on earth the question of sin was not settled, nor the question of death and Satan's power.<a name=8:13></a> But after He had been to the cross, He came back in triumph, and it is really in resurrection that He becomes the tree of life.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the scripture says, life and incorruptibility were brought to light through the gospel (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a>), through a risen Christ.<a name=8:15></a> Beloved friends, what a joy it is to think that Christ is the tree of life!<a name=8:16></a> I am not now burdened by the thought of sin.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see Christ having come into death and been raised again by the glory of the Father; all the power of Satan was broken at the cross, and the One who broke that power is now known by faith in my heart as the tree of life.<a name=8:18></a> What a wonderful thing to see that risen Person!<a name=8:19></a> Christ is the wisdom and the power of God.<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may remember in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#3:18">Proverbs  3:18</a> we read, "She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is he

	<div class="paragraph">
		that retaineth her".<a name=9:1></a> Christ is the wisdom of God to meet sin and death and Satan's power, and as I lay hold on Christ, I lay hold really upon the tree of life.<a name=9:2></a> It is such a wonderful thing to have a Person outside yourself!<a name=9:3></a> Many a true Christian is looking inside half his time, but if you begin to look inside you are sure to get dull and down in your soul and into darkness.<a name=9:4></a> It is a great thing to keep the eye on Christ.<a name=9:5></a> Christ is the tree of life, Christ in resurrection.<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in connection with that I want to speak a moment on what Christ has brought in.<a name=9:7></a> He has brought in what I may call the conditions of life, and I think we get them in figure in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, so that He might prepare the way to bring life into the world.<a name=9:8></a> It is very interesting to see that there are four conditions of life in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=9:9></a> For instance in verse 3, "God said, Let there be light.<a name=9:10></a> And there was light".<a name=9:11></a> Light is the first condition of life.<a name=9:12></a> I suppose there could be no question as to that.<a name=9:13></a> If light could be excluded from the earth for a very short time all animal life would come to an end, for light is the first condition of life; and that is the first thing in creation; and that is the first thing Christ brings in.<a name=9:14></a> There is no natural life apart from light, and no spiritual life apart from spiritual light, and Christ brings it in.<a name=9:15></a> He brings in the knowledge of God in grace, and that is the first thing I need as a poor dark sinner.<a name=9:16></a> What is the good of talking to me about man's intellect?<a name=9:17></a> I want the light of God; and where is it?<a name=9:18></a> I find it in Christ.<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=9:20></a> And in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a> He says, "I am the light of the world".<a name=9:21></a> And now He is risen and glorified at God's right hand, the apostle Paul can say, "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>).<a name=9:22></a> Beloved friends, light has come in and has come into every Christian's heart here tonight.<a name=9:23></a> It is the first condition of life.<a name=9:24></a> There is no spiritual life if no light.<a name=9:25></a> How do you know God?<a name=9:26></a> You know him in Christ.<a name=9:27></a> Christ is the image of the invisible

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now look at verse 6 of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>"And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters".<a name=10:7></a> It is really the atmosphere.<a name=10:8></a> God thus created the atmosphere  --  first light and then the atmosphere.<a name=10:9></a> I suppose every child can see that if there was not an atmosphere there could be no life.<a name=10:10></a> We require an atmosphere to breathe.<a name=10:11></a> Now Christ has brought in a new atmosphere for us to live in, and if I may so describe it, I should say the atmosphere of a Christian's life is made up of peace and love.<a name=10:12></a> When Christ came into this world these two things, peace and love, came in His blessed Person.<a name=10:13></a> Divine peace and divine love came in for the first time.<a name=10:14></a> He brought the atmosphere of it.<a name=10:15></a> How wonderful that is!<a name=10:16></a> And He then introduced His disciples into that atmosphere of heaven.<a name=10:17></a> I have no doubt one thing the disciples knew while with Him was what it was to breathe the atmosphere of heaven.<a name=10:18></a> When the Lord asked them, "Will ye also go away?<a name=10:19></a>" Peter answers, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=10:20></a> thou hast words of life eternal" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:67">John  6:67</a>, 68).<a name=10:21></a> He knew then what it was to breathe the atmosphere of heaven around that blessed Person.<a name=10:22></a> But then to have it fully we must go on to resurrection; the ground of peace was not laid until Christ died; but then every disturbing element was removed, every foe defeated, and the blessed Victor comes into the midst of His disciples with that sacred brow decked with the laurels of triumph and says, "Peace be to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>).<a name=10:23></a> It was a new atmosphere, an atmosphere of peace.<a name=10:24></a>

		Christ was here entirely apart from all the confusion of this world.<a name=23:3></a> He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness, and therefore was anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions.<a name=23:4></a> If men are led by Christ it will certainly be in the paths of righteousness, and only in those paths can true happiness be found or enjoyed.<a name=23:5></a> Christ is Lord of all and Head of every man, and in confessing and obeying Him we get outside the confusion of the world, and into the sphere of true blessing.<a name=23:6></a> In a coming day He will have universal sway, and all confusion will be at an end.<a name=23:7></a> He will order everything in righteousness, lawlessness will cease, and therefore every hindrance to the full blessing of man will be removed.<a name=23:8></a> Inconceivable happiness will pervade the universe when everything is subjugated by the gracious power of Christ to the will of God.<a name=23:9></a> Every kind of misery and suffering will be set aside, and the supreme goodness of God will be the satisfaction and happiness of men.<a name=23:10></a> Then shall be brought to pass what is written in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:3">Genesis  12:3</a>, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed".<a name=23:11></a> Every element of confusion and evil will be displaced by order and goodness, and everything will minister to the unalloyed happiness of men.<a name=23:12></a>

		In the world to come, death will no longer be a dark cloud resting upon everything here.<a name=24:15></a> The blessing will be commanded, even life for evermore (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:3">Psalm  133:3</a>).<a name=24:16></a> The righteous will enter into life eternal.<a name=24:17></a> Men will enjoy without a cloud the favour of God; death will be swallowed up in victory.<a name=24:18></a> All this has been made known in the way of promise, and there is not a single promise of which Christ is not the crown.<a name=24:19></a> It is He, and He alone, in whom and by whom all will be fulfilled.<a name=24:20></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>God requires Abraham to offer up Isaac "for a burnt-offering".<a name=43:11></a> The burnt-offering was an offering which went up altogether as a sweet-smelling savour to God, and it was for the <i>acceptance</i> of the offerer.<a name=43:12></a> It sets forth the ground on which God sets His called and chosen saints before Him for His own glory, and for the gratification of His own heart.<a name=43:13></a> But before we consider the burnt-offering it may be as well to look briefly at the sin-offering, for if we do not know the efficacy of the latter we shall hardly be prepared to enter into the blessedness of the former.<a name=43:14></a> Read <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4:1">Leviticus  4:1</a> - 12.<a name=43:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing I call your attention to is that the offerer identified himself with the victim by laying his hand upon its head.<a name=43:16></a> It was as much as to say, 'This bullock dies for <i>me</i>'.<a name=43:17></a> Have you ever thus identified yourself by faith with the death of Christ?<a name=43:18></a> Of course it is impossible to do so until you see how He has in grace identified Himself with you by coming under that to which you were liable by reason of sin.<a name=43:19></a> I should like you to think of three things: your position, your practice and your prospect.<a name=43:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fall brought about an immense change in man's position.<a name=43:21></a> Before any judgment was executed, or one word had been said by God about what had happened, Adam and Eve hid themselves behind the trees of the garden.<a name=43:22></a> God had to ask the question, "Where art thou?<a name=43:23></a>" Sin had put distance

		Then our practice was consistent with our position.<a name=44:3></a> As sinners alienated from God we walked in trespasses and sins, "according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience: among whom we also all once had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing what the flesh and the thoughts willed to do, and were children, by nature, of wrath, even as the rest" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:1">Ephesians  2:1</a> - 3).<a name=44:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Occupying such a position and characterised by such a practice, what could be our prospect?<a name=44:5></a> It is declared in the words, "Dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:19">Genesis  3:19</a>).<a name=44:6></a> "The wages of sin is death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:23">Romans  6:23</a>).<a name=44:7></a> All our greatness and pleasure ends in death, after which there is the judgment of God upon us for the deeds done in the body, when we shall be judged according to our works (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20:13">Revelation  20:13</a>).<a name=44:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us see how perfectly the Lord Jesus has identified Himself with us in wondrous grace and love.<a name=44:9></a> I trust it is clear to every one of us that the Lord Jesus "knew no sin".<a name=44:10></a> From the manger to the cross He was ever an object of deepest delight to the heart of God.<a name=44:11></a> His position was a perfect contrast to that of the sons of Adam.<a name=44:12></a> But the bullock of the sin-offering had to go forth without the camp (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4:12">Leviticus  4:12</a>).<a name=44:13></a> It had to go into a position which denoted the distance at which man was from God by sin.<a name=44:14></a> "Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:12">Hebrews  13:12</a>).<a name=44:15></a> The literal position "without the gate" was a type of the far-off place in which He became the Forsaken One for us, and had to cry as the Sin-bearer, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=44:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then not only had sin put distance between us and God, but our sins justly rendered us liable to His holy judgment.<a name=44:17></a> The fire by which the bullock of the sin-offering was consumed prefigured this.<a name=44:18></a> The Lord Jesus has endured that holy

		Let us also bear in mind for our comfort and profit that in these actions of Joseph which we are considering he is not only a type or figure of Christ, but we see in him the spirit and mind of Christ, shining out in a beautiful and precious way, both in his words and in his actions.<a name=60:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph's words, indeed, at times seemed harsh, "He spoke roughly unto them", and some of his dealings appeared severe; but he had one definite object and end before him in it all, which was, as we know, that when they were humbled and subdued, he might lavish his love upon them and have them in enjoyed nearness to himself -- fear and distance removed, so far as he could effect it.<a name=60:4></a> But the probing and testing must come first, to lead them to repentance and confession as regarding the past.<a name=60:5></a> When this is effected, the pent-up feelings of Joseph in yearning love can be expressed; and his delight was to say, "Come near to me, I pray you", speaking to their hearts and giving them the kiss of reconciliation and love, and finding his joy in so doing.<a name=60:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In all this, was it not indeed the spirit and mind of Christ in Joseph, enabling him to "overcome evil with good" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:21">Romans  12:21</a>)?<a name=60:7></a> We know from the prophetic word how, in a future day, the blessed Lord Himself -- the true Joseph, as we speak -- will with His earthly people Israel repeat and accomplish in the fullest and most blessed way all that which is typified and

		shadowed forth so admirably in Joseph.<a name=61:1></a> His (the Lord's) brethren, as He will call them in marvellous and infinite grace, He will deal with in perfect wisdom and love, first to bring them to repentance and mourning and confession; as so graphically described in <a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#12:10">Zephaniah  12:10</a>: "And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look on me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn".<a name=61:2></a> "And one shall say unto him, What are those wounds in thy hands?<a name=61:3></a> And he will say, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends" (chapter 13: 6); and in verse 9: "And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried.<a name=61:4></a> They shall call on my name, and I will answer them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God", and thus leading on to, and making possible, the fulfilment of these prophetic words of exquisite beauty and preciousness in <a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:17">Zephaniah  3:17</a> addressed by the prophet to Israel.<a name=61:5></a> "Jehovah .<a name=61:6></a>.<a name=61:7></a>.<a name=61:8></a> will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing".<a name=61:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, Joseph's way with his brethren is indeed typical and illustrative of the manner in which that chosen and elect nation will be brought to full confession of all their guilt, and to true repentance under the hand and dealings of the Lord; who "shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:3">Malachi  3:3</a>), for His dealings will be on the line of, and characterised by, redemptive grace; as we read elsewhere: "The ransomed of Jehovah shall return" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#35:10">Isaiah  35:10</a>).<a name=61:10></a> "And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#130:8">Psalm  130:8</a>).<a name=61:11></a>

		There are also, however, important differences (never to be lost sight of) between what we have dwelt upon in the case of Joseph, and the Lord's dealings in a future day to bring Israel back to Himself; gathering them as "the great shepherd of the sheep" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:20">Hebrews  13:20</a>) -- in their case, "the lost

		This may appear a digression from the subject we are considering, but it is really intimately connected with it.<a name=63:4></a> God was from the very first finding pleasure in any and every expression of the spirit of Christ in His people; but, in every case, it was the fruit of the work of the Holy Spirit (in sovereign grace) in order that some of the beautiful moral features of Christ should be displayed, well pleasing in His (God's) sight: "The God of peace .<a name=63:5></a>.<a name=63:6></a>.<a name=63:7></a> perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:20">Hebrews  13:20</a>, 21).<a name=63:8></a>

		As we apprehend this and ponder over it, and look back to see all the way by which our gracious God has led us (which, at the time, we knew not) to bring us to the knowledge of Christ, and of His fulness to meet all our need and misery (for "of his fulness we all have received", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:16">John  1:16</a>), we can then use, as expressive of our own personal experience, the words of the apostle in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:11">Romans  5:11</a>, "And not only that, but we are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=66:7></a> The time is fast approaching too, when, for those of His earthly people Israel, who will then, through His sovereign mercy, His governmental dealings with them, and His work in them by His Spirit, have been brought to repentance, and to fear the Lord and think upon His Name (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>), "The Sun of righteousness (will) arise with healing in his wings" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#4:2">Malachi  4:2</a>); when, for them, will be fulfilled the ancient and glorious prophecy in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:28">Deuteronomy  33:28</a>, 29, "Israel shall dwell in safety alone, The fountain of Jacob, in a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, I think, we have a picture or type of what is meant by "we shall be saved in the power of his life" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:10">Romans  5:10</a>), for have we not the present ceaseless activities of the life of Christ and His shepherd care, previously described in such detail in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23">Psalm  23</a>?<a name=67:11></a> The believer, whose conscience and heart are in the light and confidence of all this, can take up and appropriate the triumphant challenge of the apostle in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:35">Romans  8:35</a>, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=67:12></a>" and declare, like him, his persuasion that "neither

		The fragrant graces of the Spirit of Christ are not acquired in a practical way apart from exercise, and that blending which is described typically as being "after the work of the perfumer".<a name=121:3></a> In result there is a holy anointing oil which becomes a hallowing of all the vessels of service.<a name=121:4></a> The service of God cannot go on apart from this hallowing.<a name=121:5></a> And when we think of the service of God it is important to remember its greatness and universality.<a name=121:6></a> The service of God is really what pertains to the whole assembly as anointed.<a name=121:7></a> It does not pertain to the saints as a small company, but as a great and hallowed company.<a name=121:8></a> Even if there are only two or three actually together in a locality they are privileged to voice the praises proper to the whole assembly, and thus to represent it in character for the present pleasure of divine Persons.<a name=121:9></a>

		THE NEW MEAT-OFFERING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23:1">Leviticus  23:1</a> - 21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we get at the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>is the "new meat-offering" -- the fulfilment of what was typified in the feast of Pentecost.<a name=125:1></a> The new meat-offering refers to Christians, as set together in the power of the Holy Spirit, and I have turned to this scripture because it brings before us, in a figurative way, different things which need to have their moral effect upon us, if we are to be found here truly as part of the new meat-offering.<a name=125:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are four feasts mentioned in the verses I have read: the passover, the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of first-fruits, and Pentecost.<a name=125:3></a> It is in connection with the latter that the new meat-offering comes in.<a name=125:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just a few words about what we find at the beginning of the chapter -- "the sabbath to Jehovah" (verse 3).<a name=125:5></a> When God looked upon everything that He had made, and found it "very good", He rested on the seventh day from His work (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:31">Genesis  1:31</a>; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:1">Genesis  2:1</a> - 3).<a name=125:6></a> But it is interesting and important to see that God did not make known the sabbath to men until redemption was accomplished in type -- that is, until He had brought Israel out of Egypt (see <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#20:12">Ezekiel  20:12</a>).<a name=125:7></a> But from the beginning it was the mind of God to have a rest for Himself, and to have men to share His rest.<a name=125:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God rests in what is "very good", and when sin came in there could be no rest for God in anything that sin touched.<a name=125:9></a> The coming in of God's beloved Son introduced that in which God could rest.<a name=125:10></a> Of Him He could say, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>).<a name=125:11></a> That blessed One went into death that sin might be dealt with and removed to the glory of God.<a name=125:12></a> Now He has "ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:10">Ephesians  4:10</a>).<a name=125:13></a>

		<a name=126>[Page 126]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's purpose is to head up all things in Christ, and thus bring about a sabbath -- a perfect rest -- for Himself, and He will have His saints to enter into that rest and share it with Him.<a name=126:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People think Christians are narrow-minded, but it is the man of the world who is narrow-minded; he is occupied with small things which will soon pass away; but the Christian is occupied with great things which will be permanent -- he looks forward to the time when Christ will fill the universe with glory, and bring in perfect rest for God.<a name=126:2></a> This is the great end of all God's ways.<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now let us look at the four feasts.<a name=126:4></a> The passover comes first.<a name=126:5></a> We cannot go farther until we know the import of this feast.<a name=126:6></a> "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>).<a name=126:7></a> Taking up the type of the passover I attach great importance to the words, "The blood shall be for you as a sign".<a name=126:8></a> The other side is often spoken of: "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:13">Exodus  12:13</a>).<a name=126:9></a> But I want to speak now of the blood as God's great token to men.<a name=126:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has provided for His own glory in the death of Christ, and the blood is the token of this.<a name=126:11></a> God's will and thought is to bring men into grace and blessing, and the great token of this is the blood -- that is, the death of Christ.<a name=126:12></a> The blood is God's great token to men of what is in His mind; it is that by which He speaks to men in grace.<a name=126:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of what is it the token?<a name=126:14></a> Well, it shows me, first, that I am under death and judgment.<a name=126:15></a> If Christ must needs have suffered that blessing might reach me, it shows in the most solemn way that I am under death and judgment.<a name=126:16></a> Why should He -- the holy, spotless Lamb of God -- die and bear the judgment if we were not under it?<a name=126:17></a> Many have not peace with God because they have never learned this.<a name=126:18></a> Think much, my friend, of the precious blood of Christ!<a name=126:19></a> What you are, and what you deserve, is seen by the fact that nothing but the death of Christ could make blessing possible for you.<a name=126:20></a> To see this produces true repentance towards God.<a name=126:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have heard of some missionaries who went to Greenland, and sought for a long time to bring the natives to repentance by speaking to them about their sins and pressing the claims of the law.<a name=127:1></a> No result was produced until one day -- almost by accident, as men speak -- they spoke of the death of Christ as a sacrifice for sin.<a name=127:2></a> This did what all their previous efforts had failed to accomplish.<a name=127:3></a> Many were broken down in repentance and a work of God began.<a name=127:4></a> It is a great thing to learn the depths of your ruin and distance from God by the death of Christ.<a name=127:5></a> The blood is a token to you of this.<a name=127:6></a> Your condition is such that only by the death of Christ could blessing reach you from God.<a name=127:7></a> But if the blood is a token of my state and condition as under death and judgment, it is also a token that divine love has reached me there.<a name=127:8></a> God has sent His Son to die and bear the judgment.<a name=127:9></a> Love brought Him where sin brought me; He has gone into it all and under it all for me.<a name=127:10></a> By this I know divine love.<a name=127:11></a> How blessed to have such a wonderful token!<a name=127:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing.<a name=127:13></a> Not only has divine love reached me, but divine righteousness is in my favour.<a name=127:14></a> Now that Christ has died, the righteousness of God is in favour of man, and is made known in the gospel.<a name=127:15></a> Righteousness has been established by love and is in favour of man.<a name=127:16></a> The blood is the token of this.<a name=127:17></a> God's great voice to men is the death of Christ.<a name=127:18></a> The blood is the great token of His love and righteousness as a Saviour God.<a name=127:19></a> Have we kept the passover?<a name=127:20></a> Have we learned the great and blessed meaning of God's token?<a name=127:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the next thing is the feast of unleavened bread.<a name=127:22></a> This was in close connection with the passover -- as soon as the passover had ended the feast of unleavened bread began.<a name=127:23></a> All leaven had to be put away (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#13:6">Exodus  13:6</a>, 7).<a name=127:24></a> Leaven invariably typifies what is evil.<a name=127:25></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:2">1 Corinthians  5:2</a> - 8: "Ye are puffed up".<a name=127:26></a> That is what leaven does.<a name=127:27></a> The Corinthians were not keeping the feast of unleavened bread; they had not purged out the old leaven.<a name=127:28></a> This is a far deeper thing than dealing with the wicked person.<a name=127:29></a> They needed to deal with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was the working of leaven.<a name=128:3></a> This is a deeply solemn thing.<a name=128:4></a> If Christ has gone into death for us as our passover, how can we be puffed up or glory in the flesh which He died to remove?<a name=128:5></a> How can I wish to be a big man here, or to show myself off where Christ died for me?<a name=128:6></a> To do so is unrighteousness.<a name=128:7></a> If I have learned the meaning of the passover I must purge out the old leaven.<a name=128:8></a> I cannot allow self-importance.<a name=128:9></a> It may be there; I find it in my flesh, but I do not allow it; I judge it, and turn from it.<a name=128:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God allowed the case of this wicked person to arise that the condition of the whole company might be exposed, and that they might purge out the leaven that was working amongst them.<a name=128:11></a> If saints are puffed up they have no capacity to judge what is evil.<a name=128:12></a> There had been no allowance of the flesh, or of what was merely natural in the preaching of the apostle (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:17">1 Corinthians  1:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:1">1 Corinthians  2:1</a> - 5).<a name=128:13></a> "Wisdom of word" would have emptied the cross of Christ of its meaning.<a name=128:14></a> It would have given a place to the man who was set aside there.<a name=128:15></a> God will not have flesh to glory in His presence.<a name=128:16></a> It is a terrible thing to think that man will use even divine gifts to exalt himself.<a name=128:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the feast of the first-fruits.<a name=129:11></a> This speaks of a risen Christ; Christ is the first-fruits in resurrection (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:20">1 Corinthians  15:20</a>, 23).<a name=129:12></a> The sheaf of first-fruits was waved on the next day after the Sabbath (verses 10, 11), that is, on the first day of the week -- the resurrection day.<a name=129:13></a> There is a moral order in these feasts.<a name=129:14></a> I do not think one comes to the apprehension of Christ as the First-fruits of a resurrection order until the Passover is known, and the feast of unleavened bread kept.<a name=129:15></a> Paul presented the cross to bring the Corinthians to self-judgment, before he spoke to them of Christ in a resurrection order.<a name=129:16></a>

		C.A.<a name=151:1></a>C.<a name=151:2></a> My thought in suggesting this scripture was that the Lord might help us, as together, to realise that we have to do with a holy system of things which is entirely of God.<a name=151:3></a> It is not simply something that is a little better or more moral than what is going on around us in the christian profession, but we are called to be in relation to things which are entirely of God.<a name=151:4></a> God would have us to be increasingly conscious of that.<a name=151:5></a> On the divine side everything is complete.<a name=151:6></a> We read of the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man.<a name=151:7></a> There is no element of the world in it, no element of the flesh.<a name=151:8></a> So that what we find in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>is that the twelve princes who offered were men who had a profound appreciation of the holy character of the system that was set up amongst them -- the glory system as seen in the tabernacle in type.<a name=151:9></a> And as having an appreciation of it they could, without any specific instruction, act in relation to it.<a name=151:10></a> They could offer what was suitable and they could dedicate the altar.<a name=151:11></a> Now it seems to me that that is our side.<a name=151:12></a> And I would suggest that in the princes we get the principle of a spiritual lead given in every tribe.<a name=151:13></a> There is no such thought contemplated as a tribe without a prince.<a name=151:14></a> And we have suggested here the thought that in every tribe there is a spiritual lead given which is suitable to the testimony.<a name=151:15></a> It is suitable to the divine system which had been initiated and hallowed by Moses, indicating to my mind that the Lord intends that in every local assembly there shall be a spiritual lead, so that what is suitable shall be found in each.<a name=151:16></a>

		What view have you got from your watch-tower?<a name=234:4></a> Habakkuk had a view of things as God had secured them for His own pleasure: "Although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive shall fail .<a name=234:5></a>.<a name=234:6></a>.<a name=234:7></a>" -- although desolation shall mark the whole scene before me, "Yet shall I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation".<a name=234:8></a> Then he says, "He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and He will make me to walk upon my high places".<a name=234:9></a> What a bright contrast to what we have been regarding!<a name=234:10></a> Here we have spiritual energy, no old age, and a man able to scale up to high places.<a name=234:11></a> There are for us all the blessed privileges peculiar to the assembly in our high places, but it needs hinds' feet -- spiritual vigour to rise to them.<a name=234:12></a> Now Habakkuk can sing, "To the chief Musician.<a name=234:13></a> On my stringed instruments"!<a name=234:14></a> That is the end of a man's path who through exercise rose to the possibilities of the day in which he lived.<a name=234:15></a> A spiritual man ends with hinds' feet, high places and stringed instruments.<a name=234:16></a> You have them all in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>in our apostle, and how exhilarating to hear his call to us!<a name=234:17></a> There is no idea of retiring from the race here, and no note of depression.<a name=234:18></a> Instead of decline there is increase: "Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss".<a name=234:19></a> His taste is with him -- no grey hairs, no waning affection or enfeebled vision; he sees clearly.<a name=234:20></a> And it is all Christ and Christ <i>in heaven</i>, and so Paul is full of joy.<a name=234:21></a> He rejoices in the Lord.<a name=234:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To have "a double portion" of the Spirit of the Man taken up into heaven is one of the great outstanding wonders which Scripture presents to us.<a name=237:1></a> This marvellous gift is set before us as something to be desired in a very distinctive way by lovers of Christ.<a name=237:2></a> It is for those who apprehend Christ as taken into heaven, and who wish to be empowered to represent Him here.<a name=237:3></a> "Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee.<a name=237:4></a> And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.<a name=237:5></a> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:9">2 Kings  2:9</a>, 10).<a name=237:6></a> Elisha loved Elijah enough to want a double portion of his spirit.<a name=237:7></a> Now the question is, Do we love Christ in heaven enough to want a double portion of His Spirit?<a name=237:8></a> Those who have never had much exercise about the Spirit, or any great desire to have Him, cannot be said to have qualified for the reception of the Spirit.<a name=237:9></a> There was desire on the part of Elisha, and yet there was an "if" on Elijah's part, and he told Elisha that he had asked "a hard thing".<a name=237:10></a> This is to let us know that a double portion of the Spirit of the Man in heaven is not a small thing with God, and it will not be upon us apart from genuine exercise.<a name=237:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that the thought of having "a double portion" of the Spirit is that those who have it are distinguished as the firstborn was distinguished (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:17">Deuteronomy  21:17</a>).<a name=237:12></a> But it is a distinguishment which is open to every believer who desires it, and who apprehends Christ in heaven as "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit".<a name=237:13></a> The Lord as risen spoke to His disciples of "the promise of the Father" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:4">Acts  1:4</a>),
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=238>[Page 238]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		but before that promise could be fulfilled to the disciples Jesus had to receive it as exalted by the right hand of God (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>).<a name=238:1></a> The promise of the Father has been received by the exalted Man in heaven.<a name=238:2></a> And I believe there must be some apprehension of Him as in heaven, and as receiving the promise of the Father there, to qualify, if I may use the word, to receive a double portion of His Spirit.<a name=238:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence Elijah says, "If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee".<a name=238:4></a> It was conditional on seeing him when taken.<a name=238:5></a> For us it would imply a definite apprehension of Jesus as taken up into heaven, and as receiving there of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit.<a name=238:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust we can all see how great a matter this is.<a name=238:7></a> If Jesus were not in heaven He would not have received the Holy Spirit as the promise of the Father, and there would have been no double portion of His Spirit to be upon His lovers here.<a name=238:8></a> He imparts to His lovers here who desire it a double portion of what He has received of the Father in heaven -- not, of course, that they have twice as much as He has, but they have what He has in a wonderful and distinguishing way.<a name=238:9></a> But this is not something to make us important as men living upon the earth, for Elisha had gone through Jordan with Elijah before he asked for a double portion of his spirit.<a name=238:10></a> It is as accepting death here that we can be truly distinguished in relation to Christ in heaven, for the Spirit is the Spirit of an exalted Man in heaven.<a name=238:11></a> We should think much of the Spirit in this connection.<a name=238:12></a> The Lord when here said, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him" or, as it may read, "the Father, who from heaven will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>).<a name=238:13></a> He put stress upon the fact that the Spirit would be given from heaven -- a conscious, inward link with heaven given by the Father, but given to them that ask Him, showing that the Lord would awaken interest in this great gift, and a desire for it.<a name=238:14></a> If it has never been the subject of desire, and of asking, it can hardly be rightly appreciated.<a name=238:15></a>

		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>tells us how the Lord was taken up into heaven, and chapter 2 makes known how the Spirit was poured out by Him with the result that such a powerful testimony was given that about three thousand souls were added to the believers in one day.<a name=239:1></a> "Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=239:2></a> For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call".<a name=239:3></a> They would all understand that this heavenly gift was a present reality; the evidence of it was there before their eyes and sounding in their ears.<a name=239:4></a> Each one of them would be intensely concerned to have part in this great "promise".<a name=239:5></a> We cannot suppose that one of them would be content to be uncertain whether he had received the promised gift or not.<a name=239:6></a> The apostles were special vessels of the power of the Spirit, and afterwards Stephen and Philip, but the gift of the Spirit was expressly declared to be a matter of promise to "as many as the Lord our God may call".<a name=239:7></a> No believer should think that this wondrous gift is not for him, or that he has no need to concern himself about it.<a name=239:8></a>

		The place of Artaxerxes in <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#2">Nehemiah  2</a>is that of one on whom Nehemiah was dependent for all that he desired to do for Jerusalem.<a name=247:1></a> So that he appears to represent divine actings providing for the city and its wall being built.<a name=247:2></a> He only appears in this chapter and in a brief mention in chapter 13, God providing but using a Persian king as acting on His behalf.<a name=247:3></a> He was a king set up by God and every such king in some sense represents divine authority.<a name=247:4></a> I think the teaching of it for us is that in a day of departure and ruin we must have divine authority for what we do.<a name=247:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nehemiah's desire was to have written authority, and the reference to every scripture being divinely inspired in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>would correspond in our circumstances.<a name=247:6></a> Nehemiah introduces himself as the king's cupbearer.<a name=247:7></a> His office was to minister to the king's pleasure.<a name=247:8></a> Note the references in 2 Timothy: "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God"; "He shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master"; "A bondman of the Lord"; "The man of God".<a name=247:9></a> The one who will be serviceable in a day of ruin must be characterised thus.<a name=247:10></a> And he will be a sad man, spiritually sad, because he is thinking of the ruin of God's city and its walls and gates.<a name=247:11></a> Nehemiah had not been thus before; it was a new exercise to him.<a name=247:12></a> Perhaps it is new to many of us, but we shall not serve God's interests if we do not take it up.<a name=247:13></a> Nehemiah had a good reason to be sad, and we have more reason, for the ruin is more terrible today than it was then, because the thing ruined was so much more beautiful and glorious in its original state.<a name=247:14></a>

		But we find opposition -- men grieved that the welfare of the children of Israel should be sought.<a name=248:12></a> Nehemiah keeps his exercises to himself.<a name=248:13></a> He goes out by the valley-gate, which suggests a lowly spirit, a spirit of meekness.<a name=248:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fountain-gate and the king's pool seem to suggest supplies of refreshment formerly known but now inaccessible.<a name=248:17></a> The fountain-gate is near Siloam (chapter 3: 15) and the king's garden.<a name=248:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is to see the extent of the ruin privately, but to go out and come in by the valley-gate.<a name=248:19></a> Paul goes out by the valley-gate to see the ruin at Corinth.<a name=248:20></a> "Out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears".<a name=248:21></a> "And now tell you even weeping".<a name=248:22></a>

		John, before writing to the assemblies, has to fall at His feet as dead.<a name=248:23></a> The jackal-fountain or dragon well would have reference to evil teaching -- no resurrection of the dead, the teachings of men and law teaching; that woman Jezebel; the doctrine of Balaam, of Nicolaitanes, many antichrists, etc.<a name=248:24></a> They have to be driven out; they are all in Scripture.<a name=248:25></a> The dung-gate is the absolute rejection of what might be a gain to us according to flesh (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>).<a name=248:26></a>

		This gate is hallowed; that is, it regards the saints as apart from sinful flesh and characterised by the work of God.<a name=249:11></a> It is, speaking generally, how John regards the sheep.<a name=249:12></a> They are seen as belonging to the Father and given by Him to the Shepherd Son, so that none perish, but have life eternal.<a name=249:13></a> To view the saints as born of God is a very holy view of them: they are, indeed, hallowed.<a name=249:14></a> Nothing could give a more intense thought of the holiness of the city than to see that we can only enter into it as the sheep of Christ.<a name=249:15></a>

		First we have to learn to compare Him with the sons of men.<a name=316:15></a> I take it that the sons of men are those that have fair features before God.<a name=316:16></a> We are told that Moses was 'fair to God', and all down the ages there have been those sons of men who have had divine features.<a name=316:17></a> But He has outshone all the saints.<a name=316:18></a> An Enoch and an Abraham and a Joseph and a Moses and a David were fair sons of men, but here is One who is fairer.<a name=316:19></a> "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=316:20></a>" They counted Him as one of the sons of men, John, Elias, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.<a name=316:21></a> They had not learned that He was fairer than all the earth-born race.<a name=316:22></a> For every feature of beauty that had been seen directly in them shone in full splendour in Him and in perfection.<a name=316:23></a> He is altogether lovely.<a name=316:24></a>

		The exercises of the previous Maschil Psalms having been gone through, a peculiar and blessed knowledge of Christ becomes the portion of the heart.<a name=318:1></a> It is "good matter" composed in the heart before it is manifested in glory.<a name=318:2></a> That is, the heart is engaged with Christ as He will be publicly known in the world to come.<a name=318:3></a> The epistle to the Hebrews gives the corresponding knowledge of Him.<a name=318:4></a> God has brought in an all-surpassing excellence -- One without peer or rival -- and He has presented His own grace through the lips of that glorious One.<a name=318:5></a> It is in this way that all is set aside in our hearts that is not marked by truth and meekness and righteousness.<a name=318:6></a> All goes out by the expulsive power of the knowledge of Christ.<a name=318:7></a> Everything must give way to Christ.<a name=318:8></a> So we get the sword and the arrows and the right hand of victorious power: the enemies are all to be the footstool of His feet.<a name=318:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get the throne, the sceptre and the anointing.<a name=318:10></a> The kingdom of God is set up in a Man where moral qualities are suitable to God.<a name=318:11></a> He rules by bringing His people to love what He loves and to hate what He hates.<a name=318:12></a> So that He gets not only subjects but companions -- Christ's assembly all of one with Himself.<a name=318:13></a> Then we begin to appreciate the fragrance that lies in the anointing.<a name=318:14></a> Myrrh -- His suffering love -- but aloes go along with it in the burial of the Lord.<a name=318:15></a> They seem to be connected with the Lord as having been in death.<a name=318:16></a> The rare fragrance of that death is connected with such a Person going into death.<a name=318:17></a>

		There are no spices in Matthew, Mark or Luke: a clean linen cloth in Matthew, fine linen in Mark and Luke.<a name=318:18></a> But in John the spices are prominent: it is simply "linen with the spices", the fragrance connected with His being in death.<a name=318:19></a> He brought fragrance there for God and man.<a name=318:20></a> Cassia, I would suggest, may refer to all the fragrance of His life here which

		GOD'S LOVE LEADING TO PRAISE

		<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:17">Isaiah  38:17</a> - 20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the dealings of God with Hezekiah, God brought the weight of death on his spirit, but it was really that he might learn how God could intervene in the power of resurrection, so that he might go up on the third day to the house of Jehovah.<a name=380:1></a> Before going up, however, there must be the application of the "cake of figs".<a name=380:2></a> It is clear from Scripture that the characteristic of the fig is sweetness -- see <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#9:11">Judges  9:11</a>.<a name=380:3></a> So that the "cake of figs" would be a symbol of the sweetness of divine intervention where all was apparently hopeless.<a name=380:4></a> Hezekiah wrote after he had recovered, "But thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction", and, "Jehovah was purposed to save me" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:17">Isaiah  38:17</a>, 20).<a name=380:5></a> He learned the love of God at the low point to which he was brought.<a name=380:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is terrible to us naturally to realise that death is upon us as before God, but it is just there that the love of God is brought home to us.<a name=380:7></a> "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly.<a name=380:8></a> For scarcely for the just man will one die, for perhaps for the good man some one might also dare to die; but God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:6">Romans  5:6</a> - 8).<a name=380:9></a> The thought prominent in this scripture is not that the claims of God have been met -- that aspect of the truth is seen in the blood as put upon the mercy-seat -- but here it is that God's love has been expressed in Christ having died for us, and this love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.<a name=380:10></a> The love of God is thus applied to us as the cake of figs was applied to Hezekiah.<a name=380:11></a> How wonderfully sweet it is to find that Christ has been into death to give expression to the love of God, and this is made a personal reality to each one who has the Spirit.<a name=380:12></a>

		Those who live by the Spirit in relation to God, as having God's love shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, know that it is in death that that love has reached them.<a name=381:1></a> "Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: .<a name=381:2></a>.<a name=381:3></a>.<a name=381:4></a> but death reigned from Adam until Moses"; "Death reigned by the one"; "Sin has reigned in the power of death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:12">Romans  5:12</a>, 14, 17, 21).<a name=381:5></a> It is as the full weight of this comes on our spirits, we are prepared to appreciate that this dreadful thing -- death -- has become in the death of Christ the expression to us of the love of God.<a name=381:6></a> The Holy Spirit delights to apply that love to us by shedding it abroad in our hearts.<a name=381:7></a> The death of Christ thus becomes to us peculiarly full of sweetness.<a name=381:8></a> It is not simply that we believe that God loves us, but the Spirit pours His love into our hearts, and it becomes a power of life there.<a name=381:9></a> We are then amongst "the living", who can praise God for His love, known through the death of Christ.<a name=381:10></a> The assembly is made up of such living persons.<a name=381:11></a> Normally, one who has the Spirit is occupied with God and with Christ and with the death of Christ.<a name=381:12></a> Of course, if we grieve the Spirit by some allowance of the flesh, we may be as unhappy as if we had not the Spirit at all.<a name=381:13></a>

		There is something more.<a name=381:14></a> "On the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#20:5">2 Kings  20:5</a>).<a name=381:15></a> That implies the power of resurrection.<a name=381:16></a> The sign of it was that Jehovah "brought the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#20:11">2 Kings  20:11</a>).<a name=381:17></a> God alone could reverse the whole natural course of things.<a name=381:18></a> This was the wonder which was done in the land.<a name=381:19></a> The fact that the shadow went backward ten degrees intimates that death is removed in the power of resurrection in a way that is known to faith, before the time when death will be publicly swallowed up in victory.<a name=381:20></a> While we are still here in the responsible life, where death is still manifestly upon all men, and, as to what is seen publicly, upon us too, we may know the power of Christ's resurrection, and we may be risen with Him by the faith of the working of God who

		Going up to the house of Jehovah would be for us entering into the privileges of the assembly.<a name=382:4></a> The youngest should understand that we come together in assembly first of all to think of the great witness of divine love in the death of Christ.<a name=382:5></a> Then it is our privilege to magnify Christ in every aspect of His person and glory, and in all that He is to the assembly as her glorious Head.<a name=382:6></a> Even the youngest and feeblest believer can say 'Amen' to every utterance which praises and magnifies Christ.<a name=382:7></a> This would prepare us in a very blessed way to "go up" into conscious association with Him as risen with Him, and to know that even as ascended to the Father, He owns us as His brethren.<a name=382:8></a> It is well to ask ourselves whether all this is known to us as a spiritual reality.<a name=382:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How could any lover of Christ keep away from the assembly if he realised that such precious things could be known there and enjoyed experimentally?<a name=382:10></a> It is sorrowful to think that any believer could willingly remain away from the Lord's supper, for it is the Lord's own personal appeal of love, intended to rally all His own.<a name=382:11></a> He would not have us to think that His supper is everything; He would have us to know something of what the "third day" speaks of and of going up.<a name=382:12></a> "And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:20">Isaiah  38:20</a>).<a name=382:13></a> As we "go up" in association with Christ as His brethren, there is an answer to God's great thought, and He is praised in the same way that Christ praises Him as having come up out of death (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:22">Psalm  22:22</a>).<a name=382:14></a> "Stringed instruments" suggests that a great variety of notes can be sounded and that spiritual skill is evidenced by those who play upon them.<a name=382:15></a>

		Amos was the bearer of Jehovah's message at a time when the people of God were in a sad state of departure; therefore the time corresponds very much with the present time.<a name=425:1></a> Amos represents the sovereign action of God in giving suitable prophetic words, and shows how God can take up anyone.<a name=425:2></a> Amos was just a farm labourer, not of much account in Israel; he was following his daily toil when Jehovah took him up and bade him prophesy.<a name=425:3></a>

		In chapter 9: 9 we have the next thing.<a name=436:7></a> That is, God's faithfulness to preserve what has the character of smallness.<a name=436:8></a> He is not out to preserve what is great, it is obnoxious to Him, He is out to preserve what is small.<a name=436:9></a> His faithfulness comes out in this, though His providential ways may be a shaking, and He is shaking His people -- shaking them to and fro -- but not the least grain of His own work will be lost.<a name=436:10></a> It is to bring us down to the dimensions of His own work in us, and then we shall always realise that we are small.<a name=436:11></a> Oh, beloved brethren, do we not covet to bear such a character that it is God's pleasure to preserve us, so that not the least grain falls upon the earth?<a name=436:12></a>

		Habakkuk is particularly a record of the exercises of faith in a time of great trial, and the result of these exercises in blessing and joy before any obtained deliverance -- that is the book of Habakkuk in one word.<a name=465:1></a>

		The object God had in view in disappointing the prophet (verses 1 - 4) was that he might engage himself with what God was doing (see verse 5).<a name=465:4></a> It is God's answer to his exercise.<a name=465:5></a> Though it looked outwardly as if God were doing nothing, He was doing something and He wanted faith to be occupied with what He was doing and to marvel at it.<a name=465:6></a> God is never quiescent.<a name=465:7></a> At present (1943) He has brought a great scourge upon Europe, but it is really for the correction of His people, it is for their good (verses 6 - 11).<a name=465:8></a> Instead of the prophet being overwhelmed and quaking he is just turned to God.<a name=465:9></a> He says, "Art thou not from everlasting, Jehovah my God, my Holy One?<a name=465:10></a>" It leads Him to take personal possession of God.<a name=465:11></a> And that is really what God would bring us to at the present time.<a name=465:12></a>

		In quiet times we are apt to forget Him.<a name=465:13></a>

		Those who fear Him and honour Him will never be objects of His anger; He will always be for them.<a name=465:14></a> Looking at the Chaldeans, he might say, 'We shall die', but looking at God -- the eternal God -- faith says, "We shall not die".<a name=465:15></a> To come to the reality of God is a great thing, and the trials and testings of the present time are all to bring us to that.<a name=465:16></a> Faith is assured that if any trial or pressure comes, it is for the good of God's people; it is impossible that it should be anything else.<a name=465:17></a>

		The proper reaction to this is, I am to watch, I am to listen, God has something to say to me in this.<a name=466:7></a> It is a fine thing to know there is always a tower you can get up into and hear something you never heard before.<a name=466:8></a> When God is correcting His people it intimates there is always something in us needful for correction.<a name=466:9></a> "What shall I answer?<a name=466:10></a>" That is, he is under reproof and what is the thing to answer?<a name=466:11></a> God expects His people to understand and answer intelligently.<a name=466:12></a> On the tower he leaves all below and turns to hear what God has to say to him.<a name=466:13></a> God has something of reproof to say to Habakkuk, and he says, I want to know how to answer it.<a name=466:14></a> At a time like this there is a general call to His faithful people to get up on the tower and consider, each one for himself and herself, What does this mean?<a name=466:15></a> And when we get light from God we know how to answer.<a name=466:16></a> The psalmist says, "Before I was afflicted, I went astray"; and again, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:67">Psalm  119:67</a>, 71).<a name=466:17></a> I do not see what the good of trouble is to anyone if we do not learn something; we might as well not have it.<a name=466:18></a>
