		That believers on the Lord Jesus Christ should be established according to Paul's glad tidings is one of the greatest spiritual needs of the present time.<a name=1:1></a> It is by the grace and power of God alone that this can be brought about; but, under His good hand, the prayerful consideration of Paul's epistle to the Romans will greatly contribute to it.<a name=1:2></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle presents to us God's glad tidings, not exactly as preached to the ungodly, but as unfolded to saints.<a name=1:10></a> It begins on the note of divine calling.<a name=1:11></a> Paul was a called apostle, and he wrote to those in Rome who were the called ones of Jesus Christ, saints by divine calling.<a name=1:12></a> This gives God His place as the prime mover in the work of grace.<a name=1:13></a> God has called certain persons, and the effect of the calling is that they have an appreciation of Jesus Christ.<a name=1:14></a> Now God would have all such to understand and be established in the great principles of His actings in grace through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:15></a> Therefore we have this wonderful epistle to establish us in the grace that has come to us.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The calling is entirely on the divine side.<a name=1:17></a> "Whom he has predestinated, these also he has called", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:30">Romans  8:30</a>.<a name=1:18></a> It is helpful for the youngest believer who has an appreciation of Christ to know that the calling of God brought it about.<a name=1:19></a> An apprehension of God's calling imparts stability to the soul.<a name=1:20></a> In addressing even an unspiritual people like the Corinthians the apostle laid emphasis on the calling.<a name=1:21></a> They, like those in Rome, were "called saints".<a name=1:22></a> It is "to them that are called" that Christ becomes "God's power and God's wisdom".<a name=1:23></a> He counsels the saints to consider

		their calling, and to see that it did not include "many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>, 24, 26.<a name=2:1></a> What dignifies the saints is the divine calling.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God calls men by the gospel.<a name=2:3></a> Paul said to the Thessalonians, "He has called you by our glad tidings to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=2:4></a> Whatever the instrument used, it is God who calls; it is not the preacher but God.<a name=2:5></a> Paul speaks here of saints as "called ones of Jesus Christ", verse 6.<a name=2:6></a> It is very sweet to think that if I have appreciation in my heart of Jesus Christ it, is because I am one of His called ones.<a name=2:7></a> There has been a personal activity on His part in relation to me that has singled me out from amongst men to be for Him and for God.<a name=2:8></a> It was not the preacher -- not the one who spoke to me about my soul -- but Jesus Christ Himself.<a name=2:9></a> He has spoken in a direct and personal way to me, and the sense of that moves the affections.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of His call is that, Jesus Christ becomes a personal reality to one.<a name=2:11></a> The most, wonderful preaching in the world could not of itself bring that about.<a name=2:12></a> I do not say the Lord could not use it, but it is His own personal and powerful voice that makes Him a reality to the soul.<a name=2:13></a> A person called does not always come to light in a moment, but he has a secret in his heart that is powerful enough to break through every hindrance eventually.<a name=2:14></a> It has been known for a seed dropped into a crevice in a rock to have such power that even a huge rock has been rent by its growth.<a name=2:15></a> The call of Jesus Christ brings about something in the soul that must work its way out.<a name=2:16></a> We have examples in Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea.<a name=2:17></a> They were called ones of Jesus Christ, and the effect
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was that they came into view eventually as having appreciation of Him in spite of every natural hindrance.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something direct and personal in being called of Jesus Christ.<a name=3:2></a> It is easy to see that a "called apostle" was one whom the Lord took up personally, and upon whom He conferred grace and apostleship.<a name=3:3></a> But He has also called each saint.<a name=3:4></a> The calling is a divine one, and all the exercises and experiences of the soul stand connected with it.<a name=3:5></a> The effect of the call is that Jesus Christ is known by the soul as God's salvation.<a name=3:6></a> The greatest good has been brought in by God for men by "the one man Jesus Christ".<a name=3:7></a> That Man "borne witness to by God .<a name=3:8></a>.<a name=3:9></a>.<a name=3:10></a> by works of power and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him", is now made Lord and Christ in heaven.<a name=3:11></a> And the glad tidings of the day of Pentecost was, "Repent and he baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit".<a name=3:12></a> How blessed to think of the saints as being "the called ones of Jesus Christ"!<a name=3:13></a> To such He has become a great and precious reality.<a name=3:14></a> One to whom there could not possibly be a rival, for none but He could deal with sin and death so as to be God's salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=3:15></a> He is the One in whom God has met the whole situation that has been brought about by sin and Satan's power, and the One by whom the blessing of God for men has come in.<a name=3:16></a> Every one who knows Him thus, and believes on Him, has been called by Jesus Christ.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That call separates one from all the schemes, devices, and methods that, men have for putting things right.<a name=3:18></a> Every sane person would admit that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this is a world where things are wrong, and most would admit that they are wrong themselves, but the world is full of schemes to put things right.<a name=4:1></a> When Paul wrote this epistle there were all kinds of things in the world, as there are now, which were thought of some value.<a name=4:2></a> There were moralists and philosophers, and an ancient religion that had been originally of God.<a name=4:3></a> But Paul stands out as a man separated from all these things, separated to God's glad tidings.<a name=4:4></a> He has a theme, but it admits of no mixture.<a name=4:5></a> God's glad tidings stands by itself, and will not link itself on to any other supposed good for man.<a name=4:6></a> Paul is not at liberty to mark out his own course; he is a "bondman"; he belongs altogether to Jesus Christ.<a name=4:7></a> For Paul there was but one Man -- the Son of God, Jesus Christ.<a name=4:8></a> He alone, as God-given, can meet the situation.<a name=4:9></a> As subjects of the divine call we realise that everything centres in that one Man.<a name=4:10></a> The one called of Jesus Christ may have to learn ten thousand things, but he is assured that everything hangs on Him.<a name=4:11></a> The apostles had the sense that all hung on Him, spite of much dullness and ignorance; they said, "To whom shall we go?<a name=4:12></a>" The saints -- called such by God -- have the conviction in their souls that His Son, Jesus Christ, is the one Man who can bring in everything on God's part for men.<a name=4:13></a> He can deal with everything that men are under by reason of sin.<a name=4:14></a> Whatever men are under, He can bring them out of it in a holy way.<a name=4:15></a> It is proved because He could bring people out of death, and if He can do that He can do anything.<a name=4:16></a> We need to get in our souls with God a sense of the reality of Jesus Christ.<a name=4:17></a> That is the starting point of everything, and nothing can be built in the soul except on that foundation.<a name=4:18></a> Paul says to

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Corinthians -- "Jesus Christ is in you": he says, "Prove your own selves, do ye not recognise yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?<a name=5:1></a>" They could not deny it.<a name=5:2></a> One called of Jesus Christ cannot deny that Jesus Christ is in him.<a name=5:3></a> This is not a thing that can be blown away by a gust of wind; the calling of God is a substantial divine reality that not all the power of Satan can disannul.<a name=5:4></a> The call of Jesus Christ is a call from heaven; nothing could be more effective than that.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should like every young believer to get a sense of the reality of it.<a name=5:6></a> If we have an appreciation of Jesus Christ, we have it as a result of His call which establishes a personal link with Him.<a name=5:7></a> The initial thing from the point of view of Romans is the divine call.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glorious Person to whom Paul was bondman came in on the line of all the ancient promises, on the line of God's faithfulness.<a name=5:9></a> The holy writings had contained promises for many long centuries, and the coming of the Son of God into Manhood was according to all that had been previously announced by God.<a name=5:10></a> He came of David's seed according to flesh.<a name=5:11></a> I have been struck by the fact that, in regard to the stability of David's seed, God uses the figures of the sun and moon.<a name=5:12></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:29">Psalm  89:29</a> says, "I will establish his seed for ever and his throne as the days of heaven"; and verse 35 says, "Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie unto David.<a name=5:13></a> His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me: it shall be established as the moon for ever, and the witness in the sky is firm".<a name=5:14></a> God uses heavenly figures to set forth the stability connected with David's Seed.<a name=5:15></a> If everything on earth were shaken

		to pieces it would not affect the stability of the sun and the moon in the heavens.<a name=6:1></a> The blessing that has come in now is described as "the sure mercies of David", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#55:3">Isaiah  55:3</a>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:34">Acts  13:34</a>.<a name=6:2></a> The calling links one with all the stability of that.<a name=6:3></a> What has come in on God's part by Jesus Christ is marked by the stability of resurrection.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object of this epistle is to confirm and establish us in the blessedness of what God has brought in for men in His faithfulness to His promises, and in His grace as a Saviour God.<a name=6:5></a> Faith is necessary on our side, as we see in verse 5.<a name=6:6></a> The calling is on the divine side, but along with it there is the obedience of faith on our side.<a name=6:7></a> This wonderful Person, this one Man, God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord, becomes the Object of faith.<a name=6:8></a> Men come into obedience to God that way.<a name=6:9></a> God has made obedience very attractive by showing that it is the way of infinite and everlasting blessing.<a name=6:10></a> When we see the blessedness of what God proposes in the glad tidings, it leads us to judge our self-willed distrust of Him, and to come into obedience by way of repentance and faith.<a name=6:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The intent of this epistle is that we should be built up in the knowledge of God, and that we should see Jesus Christ in relation to God.<a name=6:12></a> God has intervened in that One man, His own Son; He has brought in a Man able to deal in divine holiness and power with everything that has been the fruit of sin.<a name=6:13></a> Jesus Christ can secure everything that is for the pleasure of God, and He can do it in a holy way.<a name=6:14></a> He was "marked out Son of God in power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection of the dead".<a name=6:15></a> The glad tidings come to us in all the value of the Person of the Son of God, and of the holiness that resided in

		Him.<a name=7:1></a> In Him holiness and power were found together.<a name=7:2></a> It is to be noted that resurrection power in the Son of God is "according to the spirit of holiness".<a name=7:3></a> The disciples had a profound sense that He was "the Holy One of God".<a name=7:4></a> He came in to touch everything under which man has lain, and to touch it in holiness, so that men might be set free from the power of everything they had become subject to through sin.<a name=7:5></a> Whether our state is one of just, lawlessness, or weakness, He can take us out of it.<a name=7:6></a> In the light of this we can understand the apostle being "separated to God's glad tidings".<a name=7:7></a> It stood apart from everything else and it had no rival.<a name=7:8></a> If the Son of God can take persons out of death, <i>He can do anything</i>.<a name=7:9></a> It is not Christ's resurrection that Paul speaks of here, but of dead persons; the word "dead" is in the plural.<a name=7:10></a> I may be under a terrible power of sin, but if the Son of God can take men out of death itself, He can take me out of everything that is a manifestation of the power of evil, and He can do it in a holy way.<a name=7:11></a>

		The service of the glad tidings is in behalf of Christ: when here He was the blessed Servant.<a name=7:12></a> In Mark's Gospel we see the perfection of His personal service towards men, but now the same character of service is continued in the apostle -- "By whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name".<a name=7:13></a> The blessed service of Christ is being carried on, though He is not here personally.<a name=7:14></a> The grace of it was there as well as the divine commission.<a name=7:15></a> Paul had a divine commission and could come into the world as an ambassador for Christ, but the grace of the service was there also.<a name=7:16></a> He was prepared to labour, to suffer, to go through every kind of difficulty

		and sorrow and trial to carry on the service of the glad tidings so that men might know God.<a name=8:1></a> "His name" implies that Christ is personally absent: but the service is carried on in His behalf.<a name=8:2></a> When here Christ was not only prepared to serve but to suffer, and Paul had grace as well as apostleship to carry on the same kind of service.<a name=8:3></a> Apostleship is official, but if the vessel of gift is to be in correspondence with the gift there must be grace too.<a name=8:4></a> Paul got both the grace and the apostleship directly from Christ, and his activities were the activities of Jesus Christ representatively.<a name=8:5></a> He would say to the Corinthians, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me", etc.<a name=8:6></a> If Jesus Christ were in them it was a proof that Christ spoke in Paul.<a name=8:7></a> It is in that way that God's testimony comes to men; it is really a continuation of Mark's Gospel.<a name=8:8></a> And it is in that way that God is delivering men from lawlessness and bringing them into obedience.<a name=8:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When people came into contact with Paul they saw a man who was imbued with divine compassions -- a man prepared to suffer that they might be blessed.<a name=8:10></a> He was prepared to suffer every indignity, to be put in prison, stoned, beaten with rods; he was ready to go through all kinds of perils that men might know God: that was the gospel livingly presented.<a name=8:11></a> Think of God taking that way to bring men into obedience!<a name=8:12></a> That God should assert His rights, and what is due to Himself, in that way is very wonderful.<a name=8:13></a> He has approached men in a way that, wherever there is faith, rebukes all the lawlessness of man, and his self-willed distrust of God, and brings him into obedience.<a name=8:14></a> That is the object of the gospel.<a name=8:15></a> By way of faith man comes into right relations with God, because

		God can never cease to be God, In becoming a Saviour God and a Justifier, He is still God, and is entitled to command, and it is for the creature to obey, The preaching of Jesus Christ is according to the command of the eternal God, and it is for the obedience of faith.<a name=9:1></a> God would bring His lawless and disorderly creature into right relations with Himself by setting forth His authority in the way of grace and blessing through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=9:2></a> Faith is a new moral link between the creature and God.<a name=9:3></a> There was the original link of creation, but that link has been morally broken by the fall -- though man has not ceased to be responsible.<a name=9:4></a> Now God proposes to put the link on again, and this time by His own wonderful intervention through Jesus Christ.<a name=9:5></a> God has come in by Jesus Christ where all was ruined by sin and death; He has brought in an object of faith -- One in whom His grace and salvation are brought near to men, and faith in that blessed Person establishes a new link on man's part with God.<a name=9:6></a> The calling of God and of Jesus Christ brings faith into action.<a name=9:7></a> God has made known the glad tidings of Jesus Christ His Son, and they go forth "among all the nations".<a name=9:8></a> They are not limited to the Jew; and wherever repentance and faith are brought about it is the evidence of divine calling; wherever there is a work of God in man it manifests itself by repentance and faith.<a name=9:9></a> There was not the testimony of the glad tidings in the Old Testament: God gave many promises, but now we have the glad tidings.<a name=9:10></a> Paul says to the Galatians, "Before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith about to be revealed .<a name=9:11></a>.<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a> .<a name=9:14></a> But faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor".<a name=9:15></a> From Moses the public

		God has introduced a new principle according to which He can be known, and man can become righteous with Him.<a name=10:4></a> It is a principle that would never occur to the mind of man, for man would never have thought of being righteous with God except on the ground of his own works.<a name=10:5></a> But God in the glad tidings proposes to justify man without his making a single contribution.<a name=10:6></a> If the light of that comes into a man's soul, and God becomes known to him in that way, it is seen to be the most blessed thing possible to be in obedience.<a name=10:7></a> It secures every blessing -- righteousness, salvation, and the knowledge of God so that one can worship Him -- and all brought near in pure and perfect grace, which is available for all men, for God is too great to be limited to the Jew.<a name=10:8></a> The creature having become fallen and guilty, if he is to be placed in righteousness with God it must be brought about entirely by God Himself, and how He does it is made known in the glad tidings.<a name=10:9></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is of great importance in relation to the glad tidings: what underlies it is the necessity for repentance.<a name=31:3></a> This is essential for every one because there is no acceptance of persons with God; God only regards moral conditions; it would not be suitable for Him to do otherwise.<a name=31:4></a> Moral conditions are summed up in faith and repentance.<a name=31:5></a> The first chapter of this epistle brings out the indispensability of faith as being man's moral link with God as known in grace, and as being the principle on which the righteousness and salvation of God are available to men.<a name=31:6></a> But another principle is equally important, and that is the absolute necessity for repentance.<a name=31:7></a> Any gospel that leaves that out will leave the soul weak and unestablished in its relations with God, and exposed to the power of the enemy.<a name=31:8></a>

		Every one who has sinned is responsible to repent, and the fact is established here that he is inexcusable.<a name=31:9></a> In chapter 1 the fallen creature is inexcusable in the presence of the testimony of creation.<a name=31:10></a> But in this chapter man is inexcusable because he knows how to judge others when they do wrong, which proves that

		he has the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=32:1></a> No characteristic of man is more general than the ability to judge that others do evil, and that renders him inexcusable.<a name=32:2></a> One sinner can judge evil in another, but the Spirit of God says to every one who does it, You are just as bad yourself; you do the same things.<a name=32:3></a> It turns the eye of the conscience in on self.<a name=32:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The soul must take the ground of judging itself.<a name=32:5></a> Paul says, You have a judgment about such things, but you do them yourself; you do the very things you judge in others.<a name=32:6></a> If you can judge they are evil, you may be sure that God's judgment is not less accurate than yours, and how are you going to escape the judgment of God?<a name=32:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle is of universal application, "O man, every one who judgest".<a name=32:8></a> It applies to every one who has ability to judge the evil that another does.<a name=32:9></a> This chapter supposes light as to God's goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering.<a name=32:10></a> Verse 7 supposes Christian light.<a name=32:11></a> We might use any light that we have from God in the way of judging others; this is usually done with a view to excusing ourselves; but it really renders us inexcusable.<a name=32:12></a> There is necessity for man to take the ground of repentance because he is the same kind of being as the one he judges.<a name=32:13></a> Paul does not hesitate to say, "Thou that judgest doest the same things".<a name=32:14></a>

		The glad tidings includes a good deal that, we are, perhaps, not disposed to put into it; for instance, part of the glad tidings is that God is going to judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.<a name=32:15></a> What glad tidings can there be in that?<a name=32:16></a> It forces on man the absolute necessity of repentance, and that is the way man can get morally right with God.<a name=32:17></a> For man to get right

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no true repentance without faith.<a name=33:2></a> Any change in a man's course or conduct without faith would be simply reformation, or turning over a new leaf, It could only lead to a man going about to establish his own righteousness.<a name=33:3></a> It would not have reference to God.<a name=33:4></a> There must be some light from God in the soul to produce repentance.<a name=33:5></a> Repentance is a change of mind produced by the knowledge of God in grace, so that man takes account of his sinful course and of all the evil he has done, and takes up a new attitude in regard to it.<a name=33:6></a> Instead of justifying it and going on with it, he condemns it and separates himself morally from it.<a name=33:7></a> He judges it in presence of divine goodness, and in presence of the grace revealed in the glad tidings.<a name=33:8></a> We have been seeing how God in righteousness can justify men who have sinned, but this requires repentance.<a name=33:9></a> It would not be a righteous act on God's part to justify an unrepentant sinner.<a name=33:10></a> Repentance, where it is genuine, is "towards God"; the soul begins to review its state and course in relation to God; it is not merely a question of how we have behaved before men, but like <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51:4">Psalm  51:4</a>, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done what is evil in thy sight".<a name=33:11></a>

		But then on the ground of the death of Christ it is a righteous thing with God to exercise goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, and He waits in His goodness that men may take the ground of repentance.<a name=33:12></a> But if they will not, if they are hard and impenitent, they are inevitably moving on to the day of wrath.<a name=33:13></a> God's goodness leads to repentance; He is so good

		Abraham was the first one in Scripture in whom the principle was established of having righteousness put to account on the principle of faith.<a name=63:2></a> It pleased God to call Abraham and to make him the father of the family of faith.<a name=63:3></a> Adam was not exactly called, nor Abel, but Abraham was; the principle of divine calling first appeared in the ways of God in his case, and also the principle of having righteousness on the ground of faith.<a name=63:4></a> This is the principle on which alone man can become possessed of righteousness.<a name=63:5></a> Abraham was not the first righteous man, nor the first one who had faith.<a name=63:6></a> Abel was the first to be spoken of as righteous, and Noah was righteous too, and he became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith; but neither Abel nor Noah was constituted the father of the faith family as Abraham was.<a name=63:7></a> And in Abraham the principle was definitely introduced of having righteousness reckoned through believing God.<a name=63:8></a> "And he believed Jehovah and he reckoned it to him righteousness", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:6">Genesis  15:6</a>; he did no works, he believed God.<a name=63:9></a> If Abraham have been justified on the principle of works he would have whereof to boast; but this could not be before God.<a name=63:10></a> It is necessary to be a child of Abraham to have blessing from God; it is necessary to believe on God.<a name=63:11></a> In this chapter it is entirely a question of believing on God, not on Christ.<a name=63:12></a> In chapter 3 we get the faith of Jesus Christ, and the faith of Jesus, but here it is believing on God: the soul is put into direct relation with God, as known through the glad tidings.<a name=63:13></a> Through the glad tidings we know God as justifying the ungodly, and we could

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the greatest importance that all who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ should take up the truth of this chapter, not merely as a matter of doctrine, but as taught of God to know it in moral reality, Nothing could be more serious or practical than the raising of the question, "Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?<a name=102:3></a>" Paul had been speaking of the over-abounding of grace where sin abounded, and that might suggest to a carnal mind that if we continued in sin grace will go on abounding, But he meets this by stating at once in the most definite way the relation in which the believer stands to sin: "We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?<a name=102:4></a>" He does not pause to explain how it came about, but he assumes as an undeniable fact that "we" -- believers -- have died to sin.<a name=102:5></a> This is, indeed, the only relation to sin which can be contemplated for God's called ones who live in relation to Him as justified, and who, as having received the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the One Jesus Christ.<a name=102:6></a> Such persons "have died to sin".<a name=102:7></a> This is not reached on the line of demand, for I do not think you will find that it is ever enjoined upon us that we ought to die to sin.<a name=102:8></a> It is grace that brings us to it under the influence of Christ.<a name=102:9></a>

		The value of these three chapters (9, 10, 11) is very great; not only in their dispensational bearing, but as forming our souls in the appreciation of divine compassions, so that these compassions may be the ground on which we are appealed to in chapter 12: 1.<a name=192:5></a> The question has to be raised in every soul, Why am I blessed?<a name=192:6></a> What caused me to have exercises Godward?<a name=192:7></a> How came I to repent and believe, when millions do neither?<a name=192:8></a> The answer is that God has shown mercy.<a name=192:9></a> No one is in his right place with God, or truly humble and self-distrustful, until he knows this.<a name=192:10></a> Without it he cannot be a worshipper, or a man who holds his body as dedicated to God.<a name=192:11></a> Any measure of faithfulness there is with us is, as to its origin, purely of God's mercy.<a name=192:12></a> Hence Paul speaks of himself as "having received mercy of the Lord to he faithful"; he never lost the sense of mercy.<a name=192:13></a> We of the nations who have faith have come in as having no claim or title to blessing whatever; it has been purely the compassion of God.<a name=192:14></a> God blessed a remnant of Israel in spite of the state of the nation as a whole; then He made the unbelief of Israel the occasion for mercy to go out to the nations; presently He will take occasion by the unbelief of the nations to resume His dealings in mercy with Israel.<a name=192:15></a> As Paul surveys it all he breaks out in this lofty ascription of glory to God.<a name=192:16></a>

		It is very encouraging to see that believers can be addressed and exhorted as they are in this chapter.<a name=193:1></a> God would have us to derive from it a stimulating sense of the spiritual abilities which His grace has conferred upon us.<a name=193:2></a> The saints are viewed here as having become the intelligent servants of divine pleasure.<a name=193:3></a> They are set together as "one body in Christ", so that the will of God may be worked out in them as a united company.<a name=193:4></a> We are not exhorted to anything in this chapter that we have not spiritual ability to carry out, or that is not the way of true liberty for us.<a name=193:5></a> It can only be worked out in a spirit of complete dedication on the part of those to whom it has become a pleasure to be wholly for God.<a name=193:6></a> At the bottom of the exercises of every awakened sinner is the conviction that he has not been for God, and he now realises that it is high time he began to live for God.<a name=193:7></a> Every ray of gospel light that comes to him intensifies the desire to be for God until, in the liberty of grace and by the Holy Spirit indwelling, that desire issues in the presentation of his body as a living sacrifice.<a name=193:8></a> This is an action of intelligent affection brought about by the knowledge of God in grace, and under a deep sense of His compassion.<a name=193:9></a>

		In writing to the Corinthians, who were carnal and self-indulgent, Paul insists on the rights of Christ and of God in regard to the body.<a name=194:4></a> He says, "Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ?<a name=194:5></a> .<a name=194:6></a>.<a name=194:7></a>.<a name=194:8></a> Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?<a name=194:9></a>" He lays it plainly down that they were not their own; they were bought with a price, and were the absolute property of the One who had bought them.<a name=194:10></a> Hence he says, "Glorify now then God in your body", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:15">1 Corinthians  6:15</a>, 19, 20.<a name=194:11></a>

		But in this epistle to the Romans he is bringing out the normal fruit of the knowledge of God in grace and compassion.<a name=194:12></a> So he speaks of the bodies of the saints as being, if we may so say, at their own disposal, and he beseeches us to take advantage of the wondrous opportunity which we have of dedicating them wholly to God.<a name=194:13></a> It is, surely, fitting that we should do so, and it is the noblest and most exalted use which we can make of our bodies.<a name=194:14></a> They are to be presented to God "a living sacrifice", and as having been presented and accepted they cannot be recalled; they are ever to retain the character of a dedicated gift.<a name=194:15></a> The believer, as having thus presented his body, is ever to minister in a living way to the pleasure of God.<a name=194:16></a> There is nothing spasmodic or sentimental about this; it is the settled and definite purpose of an "intelligent service".<a name=194:17></a>

		The apostle does not appeal to the saints at Rome to make a contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem.<a name=236:4></a> He had appealed to those at Corinth, and also to the assemblies in Galatia, his own personal labours amongst them having given him a claim upon their affections.<a name=236:5></a> But to those at Rome, where he had not laboured, he does not appeal in the same way, but he tells them how other Gentile assemblies had been "well pleased to make a certain contribution".<a name=236:6></a> And he adds, "They have been well pleased indeed, and they are their debtors; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also in fleshly to minister to them".<a name=236:7></a> It is a very fine touch, bringing to bear upon the saints at Rome a sense of their obligation in regard to their Jewish brethren, but doing it with that admirable delicacy which is so characteristic of Paul.<a name=236:8></a> Not saying, <i>You</i> ought to do so and so, but telling them what others had done, and observing that it was only right that they should do what they had done.<a name=236:9></a> God would not have us, as Gentiles, to forget that the spiritual things in which we participate belonged primarily, according to promise, to the Jew.<a name=236:10></a> We are "their debtors".<a name=236:11></a> It was the Lord Himself who said, "Salvation is of the Jews", <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:22">John  4:22</a>.<a name=236:12></a> To remember this is a wholesome check upon Gentile pride.<a name=236:13></a>

		Anything that contributes to the practical establishment between saints of divine bonds is worth a great deal to secure.<a name=238:2></a> The apostle linked up the Roman saints with himself in these truly assembly exercises.<a name=238:3></a> It was important, in view of universal assembly conditions, that all feelings of estrangement and distance between Jewish and Gentile brethren should be removed.<a name=238:4></a> And in principle this applies to every divergence and disagreement between saints.<a name=238:5></a> Natural influences and personal feelings come in and cause estrangements.<a name=238:6></a> They can only be got rid of by the grace of God being bestowed on both parties; He must work on both sides of the breach.<a name=238:7></a> Very often sufferings and distresses are permitted -- like the poverty at Jerusalem -- to prepare the way for differences to be removed, and for the saints to be more closely knit together.<a name=238:8></a> We have to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace, but this can only be done "with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:2">Ephesians  4:2</a>, 3.<a name=238:9></a> The fact is that often we get occupied with what we regard as wrong things done by others, and get into strong feelings about it, when perhaps the Lord has permitted the circumstances just as a test of the state of our own spirits.<a name=238:10></a> And if we begin by being faithful with ourselves, we should have to admit that our own spirits were wrong.<a name=238:11></a> God always comes in for a self-judged person, and it is on the line of self-judgment that breaches are healed.<a name=238:12></a>

		The more spiritual brethren are, the more they will appreciate any characteristics which it might be suitable to mention.<a name=240:4></a> Phoebe was "minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea"; she was marked by active service for the assembly, which would intimate that she had been the ready servant of the whole company.<a name=240:5></a> She had been a helper of many, and of Paul himself.<a name=240:6></a> Higher commendation could hardly be given to a sister, and yet her qualities were such as every sister might possess.<a name=240:7></a> All may in some way serve the assembly and be a help to others.<a name=240:8></a> Phoebe was to be received in the Lord worthily of saints, and assisted in whatever matter she had need of the brethren.<a name=240:9></a>

		They were set together at Rome, like all other "assemblies of the nations" (verse 4), to take up locally their mutual relations.<a name=241:1></a> These references to "assemblies" clearly imply that the saints in Rome were walking according to the truth and principles of the assembly as found in the first epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=241:2></a> No other order could be spiritually recognised anywhere, for that epistle had in view "all that <i>in every place</i> call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>, as well as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=241:3></a> All assembly truth is universal in its application, for "in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>.<a name=241:4></a> Neither sectarianism nor independency could have place in such an order of things, for all the local saints were of the local "assembly", and they were all part of a company that was "one body in Christ".<a name=241:5></a>

		The assemblies are not spoken of in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16">Romans  16</a>as "the assemblies of God", but as "the assemblies of the nations"; thus, in keeping with the whole truth of the epistle, emphasising the grace which had secured assemblies in so many parts of the Gentile world.<a name=241:6></a> They were local companies of Gentiles, set together in assembly order by the grace which had called them.<a name=241:7></a>
