		Being assured that "every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>); and also bearing in mind that "as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:4">Romans  15:4</a>), it was sought in the readings -- of which this "Outline" is largely the substance to have help from God as to the present bearing of this important part of the Holy Scriptures.<a name=1:1></a> If this volume should lead, by the grace of the Lord, to increased prayerful consideration of the last book of the Pentateuch, the prayer with which it is sent forth will be answered.<a name=1:2></a> Quotations from Scripture are generally, throughout this book, from the New Translation by J.<a name=1:3></a> N.<a name=1:4></a> Darby.<a name=1:5></a> <br>C.<a name=1:6></a>A.<a name=1:7></a>C.<a name=1:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Old Testament is a great help to us because it presents things in a form which, according to the wisdom of God, is divinely suited to convey the truth to us, while presenting it in a way that exercises our spiritual understanding.<a name=1:9></a> I have no doubt that Deuteronomy was written primarily for us and not for Israel When I say primarily I mean that we who are God's people at the present time are the first to get the good of this book.<a name=1:10></a> No doubt Israel will get the good of it later on in great measure, but, we take precedence of them in getting the spiritual gain of it.<a name=1:11></a> It is the word of God to us.<a name=1:12></a> "For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:4">Romans  15:4</a>).<a name=1:13></a>

		journey"!<a name=2:1></a> Horeb, according to this chapter, was the place where Jehovah spoke to His people of what He had in His heart to give them.<a name=2:2></a> What answers to it for us is that God has made known the purpose of His love to give us a wondrous inheritance in Christ.<a name=2:3></a> Remission of sins and inheritance are linked together in the glad tidings, as we see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:18">Acts  26:18</a>.<a name=2:4></a> Our first consciousness of the love of God is when that love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:8">Romans  5:8</a>).<a name=2:5></a> But God's object in shedding abroad His love in our hearts is that we may love Him, and if we love Him we shall be interested in the things which He has prepared for them that love Him, and those things are the inheritance.<a name=2:6></a> There is no great distance, morally speaking, between <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:6">Romans  5:6</a> and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>which answers to "the land of Moab" of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:6">Deuteronomy  1:6</a>.<a name=2:7></a> The love of God would bless His people infinitely, and in a way worthy of Himself, but man is marked naturally by unbelief, and its workings appear even in those who are the subjects of God's mercy and grace.<a name=2:8></a> The way was clear on the divine side, and the journey short, but unbelief extended it to forty years.<a name=2:9></a> What a warning there is in this!<a name=2:10></a>

		These opening statements give character to the whole book.<a name=2:11></a> It is a book in which the government of God appears from first to last.<a name=2:12></a> The blessings and benefits proposed are to be enjoyed conditionally on obedience and faithfulness.<a name=2:13></a> A turning away of heart from God will be followed by the most serious consequences.<a name=2:14></a> Hence this book is of great importance in a day when the general tendency is not to think enough either of the blessedness or the seriousness of the government of God in relation to His people.<a name=2:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The early part of Deuteronomy is largely a review of the past history of the people -- of God's ways with them, and of their behaviour in connection with those ways.<a name=2:16></a>

		It suggests what is deeply interesting; namely, that a point is reached in soul-history when the people of God are prepared to review their past, and to take account of it under the instruction of Christ, of whom Moses was undoubtedly a type.<a name=3:1></a> We are not capable of taking a spiritual review of God's ways with us, or of our own behaviour relative to those ways, until we reach a position which answers to "the land of Moab".<a name=3:2></a> There must be spiritual capacity to receive the instruction of Christ, and that could only be found with those who have availed themselves of the brazen serpent aspect of the death of Christ, and seen in it God's condemnation of sin in the flesh.<a name=3:3></a> Israel in "the land of Moab" had also known what it was to sing to the well (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:16">Numbers  21:16</a> - 18).<a name=3:4></a> They were, typically, "according to Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:5">Romans  8:5</a>), and had been able to overcome Sihon and Og -- two giant-kings who represent the flesh in its desire for self-display or for self-indulgence.<a name=3:5></a> It is by the power of the Spirit alone that these giants can be smitten, and those who have overcome them are prepared to sit down at the feet of Christ, and to receive of His words (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a>).<a name=3:6></a> As knowing His love we come under His instruction.<a name=3:7></a>"In the land of Moab began Moses to unfold (or expound) this law".<a name=3:8></a> Moses is here typical of Christ, not as Lord, but as the Teacher or Instructor of His saints.<a name=3:9></a> "For one is your instructor, and all ye are brethren .<a name=3:10></a>.<a name=3:11></a>.<a name=3:12></a> one is your instructor, the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:8">Matthew  23:8</a>, 10).<a name=3:13></a> That indicates precisely the Deuteronomic position; the brethren are viewed as under the instruction of Christ.<a name=3:14></a> The saints at Ephesus are addressed by Paul as having known this blessed instruction.<a name=3:15></a> "But <i>ye</i> have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:20">Ephesians  4:20</a>, 21).<a name=3:16></a>

		It is a very blessed thing to have the thoughts of God brought before us by ONE who loves us, and who is able

	<div class="paragraph">
		to give us spiritual understanding in regard to our past history, and to tell us what the mind of God has in view for us, and how His government will act in regard to us, whether as prospering us if faithful and obedient, or as visiting upon us the consequences of departure from Him.<a name=4:1></a> The people of God are viewed all through this book as loved by Him -- "Yea, he loveth the peoples" (chapter 33: 3) -- but it is love that acts governmentally according to the fidelity or the unfaithfulness of those loved.<a name=4:2></a> And at the end of the book we are shewn how He will ultimately bring to pass the full blessing of His people according to His determinate counsel and foreknowledge.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall find in this book -- if helped of God to do so -- much instruction as to the inheritance, and the conditions on which we can enjoy all that the love of God proposes to bring us into.<a name=4:4></a> For this book does not contemplate what will be enjoyed in our heavenly future, but what may be enjoyed in a <i>heavenly present</i> when suitable and spiritual conditions are found amongst the people of God.<a name=4:5></a> It is important to bear in mind that -- though it is the privilege of God's called ones to touch spiritually things which are outside responsibility -- we ourselves, as long as we are down here, are never outside responsibility, with all the sobering exercise that attaches to it.<a name=4:6></a> Therefore the government of God goes on in relation to His people, and the way in which it acts is a prominent feature of this book.<a name=4:7></a> We see it plainly, too, in the epistles to Colossians and Ephesians, where the risen and heavenly position of the saints is developed.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But; what is peculiarly precious in Deuteronomy is that all these things are presented as being learned under the personal instruction of Christ -- the blessed One who

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		loves us, and who knows perfectly all the thoughts of divine love in regard to us, and who delights to impart those thoughts to us.<a name=5:1></a> The consideration of this must, surely, awaken the most lively interest in this book on the part of all those who love God, and who love the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God would have His people to enter upon the inheritance as imbued with the affections and intelligence of children and sons, and this would include a holy judgment of all that has been displeasing to Him in our past.<a name=5:3></a> Under the instruction of Christ we learn what God has proposed to us, and His ways with us consequent upon our unbelief.<a name=5:4></a> We learn how we have been hindered in our spiritual progress.<a name=5:5></a> This book is not the history of the circumstances we have passed through, and of our behaviour in them but it suggests all being reviewed under the instruction of Christ with a view to our being formed in the spiritual features which are proper to the children -- the joint-heirs of Christ.<a name=5:6></a> We have all behaved badly, but we learn it in Deuteronomy in the presence of One who loves us, and who instructs us in order to bring every thought of our hearts into correspondence with Himself.<a name=5:7></a> It is most blessed.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The review begins by making mention of what Jehovah had spoken in Horeb.<a name=5:9></a> He would have had them take their journey, and go straight into the land which He had set before them, and this in its full extent, even "unto the great river, the river Euphrates".<a name=5:10></a> Jehovah would have had them to go straight from Horeb into possession of the land.<a name=5:11></a> Therefore the long delay had been occasioned entirely from their side.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The secret was that the covenant did not really fill and govern their affections: and this is why Moses later on in the book enlarges so much upon it, and on the favour God had shewn them in it.<a name=5:13></a> The secret of long

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		delay as to the possession and enjoyment of the inheritance lies in the fact that the love of God, as known in the glad tidings, does not really govern our affections.<a name=6:1></a> This leaves room for the workings of unbelief, which disclose the true character of what we are naturally, even in presence of the most blessed actings of God in love.<a name=6:2></a> This turns, in the end, to our learning self more fully, and the unmendable character of our flesh.<a name=6:3></a> <i>That</i> generation, ever marked by unbelief and rebellion, cannot inherit with Christ.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reviewing our past history with Christ we learn how we have missed things, and been delayed in reaching what was in God's mind for us.<a name=6:5></a> We have not kept in view the blessed proposals of the love of God.<a name=6:6></a> All manifestations of the flesh are the fruit of unbelief; they shew that God has not His place with us.<a name=6:7></a> So the Holy Spirit appeals to us not to harden our hearts, and sneaks of a generation with whom God was wroth as always erring in heart.<a name=6:8></a> And we are exhorted to see that there be not in us "a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:7">Hebrews  3:7</a> - 12).<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It came to light "at that time" (verse 9) how much there was in the people which was not in accord with the covenant; and which was, therefore, quite unsuited to the inheritance.<a name=6:10></a> Moses had to say, "I am not able to bear you myself alone .<a name=6:11></a>.<a name=6:12></a>.<a name=6:13></a> .<a name=6:14></a> How can I myself alone sustain your wear, and your burden, and your strife ?<a name=6:15></a>" The blessing of God was there, truly, multiplying them as the stars of heaven, but what contrary and hindering elements were there also!<a name=6:16></a> On God's side Horeb and the land -- the covenant and the inheritance!<a name=6:17></a> On their side wear, and burden, and strife!<a name=6:18></a> What a terrible contrast!<a name=6:19></a>

		Is it not serious to reflect that the first item in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this review of the past calls attention to the great proneness of the people of God to have difficulties and matters of strife with one another?<a name=7:1></a> Such things shew how little we are really governed either by the love of God or by the prospect of the inheritance.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this condition of things is mentioned here to bring out the fact that divine provision is made for the adjustment of all differences amongst God's people.<a name=7:3></a> It is not God's way that differences should go on unsettled.<a name=7:4></a> We may be quite sure that the provision for dealing with such things is not less in the assembly than it was in Israel.<a name=7:5></a> There are "wise and understanding and known men" who can be set over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.<a name=7:6></a> The Lord's administration provides everything that is needed for the adjustment of differences, and -- failing everything else -- there is always the Lord Himself as the final court of appeal.<a name=7:7></a> The assembly at Corinth was not a very spiritual one, but Paul speaks to them as having amongst them the ability to judge in matters which one might have against another.<a name=7:8></a> He even says, "If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set those to judge who are little esteemed in the assembly.<a name=7:9></a> I speak to you to put you to shame.<a name=7:10></a> Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!<a name=7:11></a>" Paul would not allow that this was possible.<a name=7:12></a> If there was a "wise and understanding and known" man for every ten in Israel we may be sure that such are always within reach.<a name=7:13></a> The assembly is always furnished with such as have the confidence of their brethren; their uprightness and freedom from personal bias makes them "known men".<a name=7:14></a> "The judgment is God's", but when we are wrong we are very apt to go to unspiritual persons who will take our side, and fall in with our view of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the matter.<a name=8:1></a> But is it not far better to have a judgment which will be in accord with God and with heaven?<a name=8:2></a> For this I must go to one who is spiritually "wise and understanding", and I must submit my case to him.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing could be of greater practical importance than to see that the divine principle on which all differences between the people of God are to be settled is that of <i>subjection</i>.<a name=8:4></a> On no other principle would this divine arrangement work.<a name=8:5></a> Whether it were thousands, hundreds, fifties, or tens, the spirit of subjection was requisite throughout all Israel.<a name=8:6></a> "Submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:21">Ephesians  5:21</a>); I understand that to mean that we recognise Christ in the brethren, and hence we respect their judgment.<a name=8:7></a> We have to beware of looking for vindication rather than for divine adjustment.<a name=8:8></a> The flesh always wants to be vindicated, but a truly upright soul looks for adjustment.<a name=8:9></a> It is well to recognise that ability for judgment is in the assembly, and it is my privilege -- if I think I have a grievance -- to assume that the brethren are likely to have a more spiritual judgment than mine, and to submit myself to their judgment, as acknowledging the goodness and wisdom of God in providing such a safeguard for me.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spiritual review of such conditions as are here contemplated would surely lead us to see how much time has been lost through our being marked by self-consideration or self-assertion, and insisting on what is due to us.<a name=8:11></a> Even where real wrong has been done, the apostle says, "Why do ye not rather suffer wrong?<a name=8:12></a> why are ye not rather defrauded?<a name=8:13></a>" A heart governed by the love of God could afford to pass by many personal wrongs.<a name=8:14></a> Is it not sad to think of prolonged attention being given to petty differences, which attention
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		might have been fixed on the inheritance?<a name=9:1></a> If there are "causes" between brethren which need to be heard, by all means let them be heard and settled.<a name=9:2></a> But how many things would silently drop if love worked in the heart!<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When "causes" have to be heard what an exercise it is to "judge righteously", not to "respect persons", to "hear the small as well as the great", not to be "afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's"!<a name=9:4></a> Judgment is to he according to a divine standard; it is to be of the same character and impartiality as it will be when "the saints shall judge the world".<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is almost incredible how much distraction and preoccupation of mind is caused amongst the people of God by personal differences, often really of the most trivial nature.<a name=9:6></a> How much time has been lost spiritually in this way!<a name=9:7></a> How foolish we have been to hold things in our hearts, and allow them to eat up -- like the palmer-worm, and the locust, and the canker-worm, and the caterpillar of <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#1:4">Joel  1:4</a> -- our spiritual prosperity!<a name=9:8></a> Do we not feel how we have been hindered by such things?<a name=9:9></a> Probably ninety per cent of the differences amongst the people of God are caused by things not worth five minutes' consideration.<a name=9:10></a> But provision is made for "causes"that really need to be heard; it is for us to subject ourselves to the judgment of the saints, not to waste our time by going on with things unsettled.<a name=9:11></a> To do the latter is really an action of unbelief.<a name=9:12></a>

		The "great and terrible wilderness" was "on the way to the mountain of the Amorites".<a name=9:13></a> No doubt it had its place in the ways of God.<a name=9:14></a> The more terrible the wilderness was the more desirous should they have been to reach the land.<a name=9:15></a> Probably many of the inscrutable ways of God with His people -- peculiar trials, intense sorrow -- are designed to lead their affections and hopes into the region of His love's purpose.<a name=9:16></a> This is the answer

		Then there were certain "brethren" who were not to be attacked -- the children of Esau.<a name=18:3></a> They were not in the line of God's testimony, they had not known deliverance from Egypt as Israel had, nor what it was to have the tabernacle in their midst, nor the exercises of a people and priesthood identified with the movements of the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness.<a name=18:4></a> But they were to be regarded as "brethren" who had a portion assigned to them by God, and which they had occupied as a result of former conflicts in which Jehovah had destroyed certain enemies before them.<a name=18:5></a> This is deeply interesting and instructive, for there are those today who occupy precisely such a position.<a name=18:6></a> They are truly in family relationship with the people of God, and have promises of blessing -- for "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob <i>and Esau</i> concerning things to come" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:20">Hebrews  11:20</a>) -- and they hold territory which has been given to them by God, and gained through former conflicts and victories.<a name=18:7></a> But they have never really known deliverance from the world system, nor what it was to be identified with that divine system which was set forth typically in "the tabernacle of the testimony".<a name=18:8></a> The reformation was a great battle, and it resulted in certain territory being possessed.<a name=18:9></a> No spiritual person can doubt that the victory in that conflict was given by God, and the ground won from the enemy was an assigned portion given by God.<a name=18:10></a> We have to recognise

		When John speaks of the "old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning", he is referring to what was true in Christ; but be goes on to speak of "a new commandment", and says of it, "Which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:7">1 John  2:7</a>, 8).<a name=112:3></a> I think the "ark of wood" in Deuteronomy is typically expressive of the "new commandment" as that which being true in Christ can also be true in those who abide in Him.<a name=112:4></a> It is striking how John puts the saints, as it were, in Christ's place, and says of them what he had said of Christ.<a name=112:5></a> We are more ready to believe that the thoughts of God are secured in Christ than we are to recognise that, by the work of God, what is true in Christ becomes true in those who are His.<a name=112:6></a> But the elect of God are sanctified to the obedience of Jesus Christ.<a name=112:7></a> The one born anew can say, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:22">Romans  7:22</a>).<a name=112:8></a> And it is through the "obedience of faith" that we receive the glad tidings.<a name=112:9></a> Where there is obedience, righteousness, and love, there is moral correspondence with Christ as the "ark of wood".<a name=112:10></a> The covenant will be made good in the heart of Israel in a coming day, and surely the spirit of it is made good in the saints in this, the Spirit's day.<a name=112:11></a> Or are we to accept that there will be a fuller result for the pleasure of God in saints who are of Israel than there is in saints who are of the assembly?<a name=112:12></a>

		A parenthesis is introduced in verses 6 and 7 mentioning circumstances which took place historically long after what Moses bad been speaking of, but which are brought in here by the Spirit of God to call our attention to two things of great importance.<a name=113:8></a> First, the necessity for the priestly service of Christ in view of the: land being entered and possessed.<a name=113:9></a> Aaron's exercise of priesthood was limited to the wilderness, but Eleazar is a type of Christ as Priest in relation to entrance upon the inheritance.<a name=113:10></a> Aaron represents Christ as exercising priesthood in relation to wilderness needs and weaknesses, but Eleazar represents Him as Priest in relation to the inheritance.<a name=113:11></a> Joshua was to stand before him, and he would enquire for Joshua "by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:21">Numbers  27:21</a> ).<a name=113:12></a> Eleazar is a type of Christ as Priest in relation to all that which, from the Deuteronomic standpoint, can be described as "good

		Then the "land of waterbrooks" speaks of a region where there is the flow and activity of the Holy Spirit.<a name=114:7></a> The people themselves do not often bring divine thoughts before us; it is generally far otherwise; but the incidents that occurred on their journey are often freighted with rich meaning.<a name=114:8></a> And this "land of waterbrooks" to which they came immediately after the transfer of the priesthood to Eleazar was a remarkable anticipation of "the land" as described in chapter 8: 7.<a name=114:9></a> It speaks of the copiousness and variety of the refreshings of the Spirit as known even on the wilderness side of Jordan.<a name=114:10></a> God is pleased to give to His people manifestations of the Spirit in the assembly viewed as in wilderness conditions, as in 1 Corinthians.<a name=114:11></a> He gives ministry in freshness and power there that His saints may be incited to move forward energetically into that which is peculiarly the domain of the Spirit.<a name=114:12></a> To experience the activities of the Spirit as described in 1 Corinthians would be a great inducement to go on to know what His activities are amongst the saints viewed as over Jordan.<a name=114:13></a> There are

		Then we get in verses 8, 9 the separation of the tribe of Levi.<a name=115:2></a> "The tribe of Levi" represents the element that, is distinctly "for Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:26">Exodus  32:26</a>), and which preserves what is of God, and what is due to God, They consecrated themselves to Jehovah, and brought on themselves a blessing.<a name=115:3></a> The overcomers all through have been the true "tribe of Levi"; they have risen superior to what was natural; they have been able to gird on the sword, and to shew that God and His things were more to them than the influence of nature.<a name=115:4></a> What should have been true of all Israel was realised in Levi, and Jehovah took them in a peculiar way for Himself.<a name=115:5></a> They represented in Israel something which is greater than the inheritance, namely, the direct service of God.<a name=115:6></a> This was given to them as peculiar distinction and privilege, and they remained as a separated tribe, not participating in the inheritance like the other tribes, but representing in all Israel what was due to God; and to His holy service.<a name=115:7></a> The inheritance was held by the people largely that it might minister to them, and that the service of God in their hands might be fully maintained.<a name=115:8></a>

		Their service was threefold -- "To bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to do service unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day".<a name=115:9></a> These things are distinguished for us from the inheritance, and they represent what the inheritance is intended to support, as we shall see later in this book.<a name=115:10></a>

		Then "to stand before Jehovah to do service unto him" refers to sanctuary service -- ordering the lamps and the shewbread, burning incense, presenting offerings and sacrifices, and carrying on the service of song.<a name=116:7></a> We are apt to think that what serves man is more Important than the service of God, but this is not so.<a name=116:8></a> The result of our being in the good of what God has given to us will be that we shall have tithes and offerings.<a name=116:9></a> We shall minister fully to the "tribe of Levi", and the service of the sanctuary will be sustained.<a name=116:10></a> The inheritance is bestowed in order that there may be a result for God in levitical and priestly service.<a name=116:11></a>

		Then, finally, "and to bless in his name" would indicate that God will have the last word, and that word is always a word of blessing for His people.<a name=116:12></a> If He is served according to what is due to Him in His house it will surely result in full blessing, according to the greatness of His Name, flowing out upon His people.<a name=116:13></a> It is no small part of the privilege of the "tribe of Levi" to be able to express towards His faithful people the blessed thoughts that fill the heart of God toward them.<a name=116:14></a> It is the glory of His Name to be known as blessing.<a name=116:15></a>

		These things are distinguished for us from the inheritance by the separation of the tribe of Levi, to whom they pertained, from all the other tribes, and by the fact that "Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance according as Jehovah thy God told him".<a name=117:1></a> Our Instructor would remind us that, wonderful as the inheritance is, it is bestowed in view of God being served according to His pleasure, and that He would delight to be to us greater, and more to be gloried in, than all He gives.<a name=117:2></a> Jehovah was Levi's inheritance, and he was separated to represent in Israel what was due to Jehovah in holy service.<a name=117:3></a> We must not think of the tribe of Levi merely as representing certain persons distinguished from others as God's servants, but as representing a spiritual condition and service which the inheritance has to support.<a name=117:4></a> God would have us to be concerned, not only about the possession and enjoyment of the inheritance, but about His holy service, and the maintenance of all that is due to Him.<a name=117:5></a> He would have us to remember that the inheritance is not everything, but that it is given so that it may yield support for "the tribe of Levi".<a name=117:6></a> He would have us see to it that what that tribe represents is maintained and ministered to in ourselves and in others.<a name=117:7></a> This is the first mention of the tribe of Levi in this book, but we shall find that it occupies an important place in the subsequent teaching.<a name=117:8></a>

		We are again reminded in verse 10 of how much we owe to the intercession and advocacy of Christ.<a name=117:9></a> It is a persistent service of faithful love which He carries on through the whole period which is typified by the "forty days and forty nights" of Moses intercession.<a name=117:10></a> Many a secret unrighteousness that might have developed into open failure or public departure has been the occasion of His advocacy, and in result has been judged, and our soul has escaped like a bird from the snare of

		At the moment to which Moses refers here the people, on their side, had lost all title to the land, but Jehovah listened to the intercession of Moses, and said to him, "Rise up, take thy journey before the people, that they may enter in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them".<a name=118:8></a> What a testimony to the grace and faithfulness of God, and to the fact that His people owe all to His mercy through the Mediator and Intercessor!<a name=118:9></a> Many of the people sinned unto death and fell in the wilderness, but those who went in and possessed the land did so on the ground of God's faithfulness to His promise and oath, and on the ground of the intercession of Moses.<a name=118:10></a> To speak in John's language, God gave them life.<a name=118:11></a>

		The tithe of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#14:22">Deuteronomy  14:22</a> - 27 is clearly additional to that spoken of in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#18">Numbers  18</a>, which was to be given to the children of Levi for their service.<a name=178:2></a> The first charge upon spiritual prosperity is the support of what is levitical.<a name=178:3></a> The temporal support of those who serve the Lord in spiritual things has its place (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9">1 Corinthians  9</a>), but the tithes would represent rather that spiritual prosperity is to yield an abundant supply for the sustenance in a spiritual way of service for God.<a name=178:4></a> The levitical element in ourselves, and in the saints generally, is to be nourished and supported.<a name=178:5></a> If we have the wealth of the land, what answers to corn, new wine, oil, firstlings -- a supply of what is connected with Christ and the Spirit and with spiritual increase -- let us not forget that it is all to be tithed for service.<a name=178:6></a> If we do not render the tithes we rob God, and we shall lose His blessing.<a name=178:7></a> See <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3">Malachi  3</a>.<a name=178:8></a> If those who have increase in spiritual blessing are not found serving the Lord proportionately in diligent zealousness and fervency of spirit they will assuredly lose what they have.<a name=178:9></a> The maintenance of service is perhaps more important than it is generally supposed to be; it is a definite mark of sons of God.<a name=178:10></a>

		In presence of much fleshly activity in the Christian profession it is greatly for the pleasure of God that we should diligently maintain spiritual and devoted service.<a name=178:11></a> It is the practical evidence of spiritual prosperity.<a name=178:12></a> We were taken account of for service from the outset, as the Levites were numbered from a month old, but every year should see us coming to greater maturity in that respect.<a name=178:13></a> All the elements of what is levitical are seen in Romans, but they are seen in full maturity in Philippians.<a name=178:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our first exercise should be to acquire spiritual substance, but then it is given that it may be tithed for the support of service.<a name=179:4></a> If what we suppose to be spiritual gain does not promote what is levitical there is something wrong about it; the tithes are not being rendered.<a name=179:5></a> Whenever we get any spiritual increase it must always be a definite exercise that it shall contribute to direct service to God and to His people.<a name=179:6></a> This is the first charge on the wealth of the inheritance.<a name=179:7></a>

		The provision for cases in which the way might be "too long" intimates that it may not always be easy to avail oneself of assembly conditions.<a name=180:10></a> Fellowship with God's people according to the truth of His assembly is not always easily obtainable, We are in "difficult times", but it is peculiarly pleasing to the Lord to see that we value what is of Himself even when it makes unusual demands.<a name=180:11></a> It has often happened that when believers have found themselves at a distance from privileges of assembly character they have been tempted to give up the truth, and to fall in with a human order of things.<a name=180:12></a> But difficulties are not to be succumbed to, but surmounted.<a name=180:13></a> The full value of the tithe is to go to God's appointed centre.<a name=180:14></a> The two going to Emmaus gathered in much on that eventful resurrection day, but we may say that they carried their tithe to the common fund with those who were "gathered together"

		Then "at the end of three years" there is another tithe; it suggests the result of a prolonged experience of the wealth of the land.<a name=181:4></a> The third year is called specifically "the year of tithing" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26:12">Deuteronomy  26:12</a>).<a name=181:5></a> And this tithe is to be laid up "within thy gates; and the Levite -- for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee -- and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest".<a name=181:6></a> The result of three years' enjoyment of the plenty of the inheritance is that one becomes qualified for a very large-hearted ministry to those who have need.<a name=181:7></a> A solemn affirmation as to this has to be made, as we see in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26:13">Deuteronomy  26:13</a> - 15, from which we may learn how important as a condition of blessing was the faithful rendering of those hallowed things to those for whom they were appointed.<a name=181:8></a>

		Moses and Hoshea came from the tent of meeting, and from the presence of Jehovah there, to teach this song to all Israel.<a name=358:8></a> It is most important that we should set our hearts "unto all the words" (verse 46).<a name=358:9></a> "For it is no vain word for you, but it is your life".<a name=358:10></a> No part of the Lord's instruction is a "vain word".<a name=358:11></a> It is wonderful grace on God's part to communicate His mind to us; now it is for us to set our hearts to His words.<a name=358:12></a> Christians are apt to ignore what they do not wish to obey.<a name=358:13></a> But "every scripture is divinely inspired"; it is not only absolutely dependable as being of God, but there is the breath of divine life in it.<a name=358:14></a> The letter of Scripture may be, in itself, empty of result, but if we set our hearts to the words as having the power of life in them they will convey to us the knowledge of God as revealed in Christ, and that will be life to us.<a name=358:15></a> This wonderful book unfolds in a typical way the conditions in which the brethren can enjoy the inheritance together.<a name=358:16></a> Let us set our hearts to it that it may not be a vain word for us, but that it may be our life.<a name=358:17></a> Our spiritual being needs to be quickened according to God's words, so that they may be worked out in life amongst the brethren.<a name=358:18></a> What a conception it gives of the assembly to think of it as a company of persons capable of taking up the mind of God, and answering to it in a living way in collective enjoyment of "the land"!<a name=358:19></a>

		The closing section of this chapter brings out in a striking way the governmental character which is impressed on the whole of this book.<a name=359:10></a> It gives us what is, perhaps, the most solemn and impressive instance of the government of God which Scripture contains.<a name=359:11></a> For Moses was a most eminent servant of God, who enjoyed personally great divine favour.<a name=359:12></a> But he was not allowed to go into the land because he trespassed in failing to hallow Jehovah at Meribah-Kadesh.<a name=359:13></a> The more eminent and faithful any servant of God may be the more incumbent it is upon him to hallow God at all times in the midst of His people.<a name=359:14></a> What a discipline for Moses, that faithful servant of Jehovah and true lover of Israel, to be forbidden to enter the "pleasant land"!<a name=359:15></a>

		But it is encouraging to see that, while the government of God was not relaxed, even in favour of Moses, he got peculiar personal favour from Jehovah which must have been compensation to him in the deprivation which he felt so keenly.<a name=359:16></a> He was permitted to behold the land.<a name=359:17></a> Jehovah Himself shewed it to him in detail, as we shall see in chapter 34.<a name=359:18></a> The government of God may be Revere, and its results may never be escaped from down here, but at the same time opportunity may be given to faithful hearts to get what they desire.<a name=359:19></a> God regarded,

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is, in the principle of it, great encouragement for the moment in which we live.<a name=360:5></a> Publicly privileges are forfeited; this was largely true before the apostles finished their course; the government of God is dealing out just retribution for many a trespass, and for much that has failed to hallow Him amongst His people.<a name=360:6></a> But faithful hearts may still have unique opportunities to see the land, and to know its wealth.<a name=360:7></a> Spiritually we may have as full a view of God's purpose and grace in Christ Jesus as ever saints had.<a name=360:8></a> John wrote particularly for a day of public departure when many antichrists should be present.<a name=360:9></a> But he brings out the wealth of what can be enjoyed with God by those who love Him.<a name=360:10></a> In, his precious Gospel Jesus is seen as in the bosom of the Father, and His loved disciple is seen in His bosom.<a name=360:11></a> Personal intimacy remains, and can be enjoyed to the full by faithful lovers.<a name=360:12></a> In this connection we may note that the word "loveth" in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a> -- a word which occurs nowhere else -- means "to have in the bosom".<a name=360:13></a> It suggests peculiar nearness.<a name=360:14></a> The faithful need not look to be publicly distinguished -- to be anything outwardly -- but a poor and afflicted people; that is the position that has to be accepted.<a name=360:15></a> But in private intimacy there is not a bit of "the land" that cannot be seen in spiritual vision.<a name=360:16></a> What a transcendent, privilege!<a name=360:17></a> The sovereign favour of God abounding, and conferring supreme blessedness, notwithstanding all that takes its course governmentally!<a name=360:18></a>
