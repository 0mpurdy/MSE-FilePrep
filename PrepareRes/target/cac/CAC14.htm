		Between the British and Spanish territories at Gibraltar there is a quarter of a mile of land which belongs to neither, and is called <i>neutral ground</i>.<a name=7:1></a> It is to be feared that many people think there is a wide piece of neutral ground between those who are saved and those who are lost.<a name=7:2></a> They dare not say that they are saved, and they will not admit that they are lost.<a name=7:3></a> So the devil -- old arch-deceiver that he is -- cheats them alike out of the blessings of the believer and the opportunities of the sinner.<a name=7:4></a>

		You may be able to say that you are as good as, or better than, most of your neighbours; and it is perhaps your opinion that if you do not get to heaven many others will stand a poor chance.<a name=7:8></a> That may be true; but there is an awful possibility that you may find yourself shut out along with them.<a name=7:9></a> Suppose that a recruiting sergeant came to your town to enlist soldiers for the Life Guards.<a name=7:10></a> Twenty young men apply to be enlisted, and while they are waiting for the sergeant to bring his measuring standard they begin to measure themselves by one another.<a name=7:11></a> One finds he is half an inch taller that another.<a name=7:12></a> 'I have a better chance than you', he says.<a name=7:13></a> He measures himself with another and finds that he is an inch taller.<a name=7:14></a> 'Well', says he, 'if I don't pass you will stand a poor chance'.<a name=7:15></a> He goes on until he

		In the third chapter of Romans we read these solemn words,"<i>there is no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</i>"; and in the same chapter "all the world" is pronounced "<i>guilty before God</i>".<a name=8:5></a> Whatever you are before men, or in comparison with others, you are

		If you refuse to accept this fourfold description as being true of yourself, you thereby shut yourself out from the saving value of Christ's death.<a name=10:3></a> It was for those who could by no means save, or help to save, themselves that Christ died.<a name=10:4></a> It was for ungodly sinners, yea for those who were enemies to God in their mind, that He gave His life; and if you are not such a one you have neither part nor lot in the blessings which flow from His death.<a name=10:5></a> A life-boat is for the drowning, a physician is for the sick, and a <i>Saviour is for lost sinners</i>.<a name=10:6></a>

		for your sins, I should be glad to think that some who will read this book are as anxious to have the knowledge of forgiveness as an elderly lady to whom I once put the question, 'Are your sins forgiven?<a name=12:1></a>' I shall never forget the wistful look that came into her eyes and the earnest trembling tones of her voice, as she said, 'Sir, I would give all that I possess to know that'.<a name=12:2></a> I found that she had long known her need of pardon, and that she prayed, and read her Bible, and went to church, and was hoping that it might be well at last.<a name=12:3></a> She knew not the grace of God, nor the value of the precious blood of His Son.<a name=12:4></a> Many are in a similar state, and it is to such I now speak.<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me assure you, at the outset, that pardon for sins cannot be bought with money, or earned by good works, or won by tears and prayers.<a name=12:6></a> If you spent all your life in reading the Bible and in prayers; if you wept out the contrition of your heart in an ocean of penitential tears; yea, if you gave all your goods to the poor, and your body to be burned: none of these things would secure the pardon of your sins.<a name=12:7></a> Nay, I will go further, and say that <i>if you could</i> by some means acquire to yourself the combined merits of all the saints of God who ever lived on earth, there is not value enough in all their holy living and dying to absolve one of your sins.<a name=12:8></a>

		God's word is plain -- "<i>It is the blood</i> that maketh an atonement for the soul", <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#17:11">Leviticus  17:11</a>.<a name=12:9></a> There is, there could be, no pardon without atonement, no remission apart from redemption.<a name=12:10></a> "Without shedding of blood is NO REMISSION".<a name=12:11></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:22">Hebrews  9:22</a>.<a name=12:12></a>

		Satan's object is gained if he can induce sinners to <i>despise Christ</i> on the one hand, or to <i>despair of Him</i> on the other.<a name=14:9></a> The first he accomplishes by filling the heart with the world and the things that are in the world, so that the blessed Saviour is unthought of and neglected by those for whom He died.<a name=14:10></a> The latter he seeks to effect by bringing before us our sins, unworthiness, weakness of faith, inconsistency, and so on.<a name=14:11></a>

		There is a peculiar sweetness about the gospel by Luke.<a name=49:1></a> It is pre-eminently the gospel of Grace.<a name=49:2></a> Written by a Gentile who was the companion of Paul -- the Apostle of the Gentiles -- I believe it contains a presentation of the gospel as, in a special way, God would have it to be made known to the Gentiles.<a name=49:3></a> This is not fanciful, because the gospel is addressed to a Gentile -- Theophilus -- whose name means, Lover of God, and no doubt the Holy Spirit indicated thus that this gospel has special claims upon the attention of Gentile "lovers of God".<a name=49:4></a>

		This gospel is the unfolding of the dispensation of Grace.<a name=49:5></a> In its opening chapters we have the dawn of a new day, as it is said, "The dayspring from on high hath visited us".<a name=49:6></a> Chapter 1: 78.<a name=49:7></a> A day of heavenly light and blessing has dawned upon this dark, lost world and the Gentile "lover of God" is to "know the certainty of those things".<a name=49:8></a>

		In this gospel every blessing is wholly of God, and therefore purely of grace, and the only link that man has with it is <i>faith</i>.<a name=49:9></a> Hence the gospel opens by a striking contrast between Zacharias and Mary -- unbelief and faith.<a name=49:10></a> Zacharias, a type of the Jew, reasons and doubts, with the result that he is dumb until the period of faith is ended.<a name=49:11></a> He completely failed both as a witness and a worshipper until the time of faith ended; that is, until John was born.<a name=49:12></a> Zacharias at the beginning of the gospel history and Thomas at the end both set before us the guilty, reasoning unbelief that often clings even to saints.<a name=49:13></a> They both failed as witnesses and worshippers all through what was typical of the period of faith.<a name=49:14></a> The Jews are exactly in

		It is well for us to remember that we are living in a period when every blessing is of pure <i>grace</i>, and can only be apprehended by <i>faith</i>.<a name=50:5></a> Mary sets forth the blessedness of faith; see chapter 1: 45.<a name=50:6></a> She does not reason; she anticipates no difficulty; her spirit rejoices in God her Saviour; she enters into the character of the new day which was just dawning; she knows that men of low degree are to be exalted, and the hungry are to be tilled with good things.<a name=50:7></a> How truly do we speak of her as the blessed virgin!<a name=50:8></a> The new day of grace had lighted up her heart, and there was not a cloud of unbelief to dim the joy of her happy spirit.<a name=50:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice, too, that in this gospel we have not visions and dreams as in Matthew's.<a name=50:10></a> The communications come directly from heaven, and they relate to a new order of things in which heaven delights -- an order of things in which everything is of God -- connected with a Person who is not only the Seed of the woman, but the Second Man out of heaven.<a name=50:11></a>

		First of all, it is my earnest desire that our hearts may be attracted by the glories and perfections of the One who is the Proclaimer of Grace.<a name=62:2></a> In Chapter 3 we see how He was sealed with the Holy Spirit as the object of God's delight.<a name=62:3></a> The whole of His matchless life from the manger to the baptismal waters of Jordan was covered by the Father's "<i>well pleased</i>".<a name=62:4></a> It could not be otherwise, for from His conception by the Holy Spirit He was the true meat offering, the "fine flour mingled with oil".<a name=62:5></a> In connection with this I may say that there were three distinct forms in which the meat offering was prepared; <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#2">Leviticus  2</a>.<a name=62:6></a> It might be "baken in the oven", or "in a pan", or "in the frying-pan".<a name=62:7></a> The increasing severity of the tests to which the personal devotedness of the Lord Jesus would be subjected seems to be indicated thus.<a name=62:8></a> The first might cover the thirty years of His private life; the second might apply to the three years and a half of His ministry; while the third might have reference to that last awful time of trial in which the personal devotedness of that blessed One was tested to the full -- that dreaded hour of the power of darkness preceding and including the cross.<a name=62:9></a> How blessed

		How sweet it is to see, too, that the grace which He proclaims is all wrapped up in His own Person!<a name=64:2></a> It is not <i>blessings</i> only which are presented, but a BLESSER.<a name=64:3></a> He says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon ME"; "He hath anointed ME"; "He hath sent ME".<a name=64:4></a> Let me put it to your hearts, my brethren!<a name=64:5></a> Do you think of, and rejoice in, your blessings more than the Person in whom you have them?<a name=64:6></a> If you only think of blessings there is a wonderful charm about them when they are new, and they sustain the soul for a certain time, but when the first joy of them passes away, a settling-down process commences.<a name=64:7></a> Every new bit of blessing may seem to put a new bit of life into you, but it gradually loses its lustre and power, and you become what I fear I must speak of as an <i>ordinary</i> Christian -- you make no progress.<a name=64:8></a> It is as we take Christ by faith into the affections of our hearts that we make spiritual progress.<a name=64:9></a> It is as HE occupies an enlarged place in our affections that we get on.<a name=64:10></a> The devil often deceives us by filling our heads while he empties our hearts.<a name=64:11></a> The head may be filled with theological information without producing one spark of heart-affection for Christ, and the soul remains in a state of spiritual starvation.<a name=64:12></a> All the blessings of the dispensation of grace are wrapped up in a Person, and we make progress as our hearts learn to find everything in Him -- the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself for us.<a name=64:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		everything that stood against the poor sinners who believe on His Son.<a name=65:1></a> "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace".<a name=65:2></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:7">Ephesians  1:7</a>.<a name=65:3></a> And not only does that grace meet all our need, but it enriches us with eternal blessings such as only the heart of God could think of.<a name=65:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. "To heal the broken-hearted".<a name=65:5></a> Here is a man broken-hearted!<a name=65:6></a> Why?<a name=65:7></a> Because everything that his heart was set upon has been blighted.<a name=65:8></a> He says, 'I set my heart first on one thing and then another, but something has come in to spoil it all, and my heart is crushed and desponding'.<a name=65:9></a> The grace of God would bring healing to that broken heart.<a name=65:10></a> There is everlasting "consolation and good hope through grace", and by faith in the Son of God it may be yours.<a name=65:11></a> There is a Person who can save you from all your sins, and sympathize with all your sorrows, and support you in all your weakness, and make His love the portion of your heart.<a name=65:12></a> Is not such a Person worth knowing?<a name=65:13></a> Oh, the comfort and the joy of knowing that God is for us: that His blessed Son has been here and subjected Himself to every indignity that He might tell us of eternal blessings, and secure then for us by His own death!<a name=65:14></a> The blessings which Jesus gives to those who believe on Him are connected with a world that never knows any changes or any disappointments -- a blessed world of joy and peace and glory -- and Grace would bring the things of that world into your heart, and it would be bound up and healed.<a name=65:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. "To preach deliverance to the captives".<a name=65:16></a> Every person on this earth out of Christ is a captive.<a name=65:17></a> Some have very rough iron chains, and others have beautiful golden ones, but all are captives.<a name=65:18></a> A man may say, 'I am not a captive; I do just as I like; I am my own master'.<a name=65:19></a> Yes!<a name=65:20></a> you are the slave of your own will, and behind that will is all the power of the devil.<a name=65:21></a> If you desired to live a holy life you would soon find what a captive you were.<a name=65:22></a> The chain which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. "Recovering of sight to the blind".<a name=66:3></a> How many blind people there are!<a name=66:4></a> The grace of God shines upon them; His beloved Son passes before them; salvation with all its blessings is put before their eyes; but they cannot see these precious things, because of the blinding power of sin.<a name=66:5></a> The grace that brings the blessing has also to give the sinner eyes to see it.<a name=66:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>"Else, sweetly as it suits our case, <br>The gift had been in vain".<a name=66:7></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		FAITH is spiritual sight.<a name=66:8></a> It enables us to see things which to nature are invisible -- the riches and the glory of the Grace of God.<a name=66:9></a> We were once blind to these things: for ever let us praise the Saviour who has opened our eyes!<a name=66:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5. "To set at liberty them that are bruised".<a name=66:11></a> These are the captives who have lain in the dungeon so long that the irons have eaten into their flesh, and they are helplessly maimed -- worn out in the service of the devil.<a name=66:12></a> Anybody else but the Son of God would give them up, but there is grace in <i>His</i> heart for them.<a name=66:13></a> One day George Whitfield said in his preaching that the Lord Jesus would receive the devil's castaways.<a name=66:14></a> Afterwards some of his lady friends objected to the expression, but while they were talking about it there was a knock at the door; a woman was asking if she might see Mr.<a name=66:15></a> Whitfield.<a name=66:16></a> He went to her; she stood before him trembling -- a poor, utterly wasted creature from the London streets, worn out in the devil's service.<a name=66:17></a> Through her sobs and tears she said, 'Mr.<a name=66:18></a> Whitfield, I heard you say that the Lord Jesus would take in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this wondrous blessing is proclaimed in the dispensation of grace, which is here called "the acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=67:6></a> What an unfolding of the Grace which has come into this poor fallen world in the person of the Son of God!<a name=67:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not enough that GRACE is PROCLAIMED: it must also be ILLUSTRATED.<a name=67:8></a> These sinners at Nazareth could appreciate the doctrine of Grace, and "wonder at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth".<a name=67:9></a> A sermon about the grace of God <i>in general</i> would be tolerated anywhere, but the Lord Jesus did not leave the matter thus.<a name=67:10></a> He would have them to know what the character of GRACE really was, and on what terms they might receive it.<a name=67:11></a> So He brings forward from the Scriptures two illustrations of Grace.<a name=67:12></a> Some people do not like illustrations, because they often come home to the heart and take a grip on the conscience, while doctrines fly over the head.<a name=67:13></a> These people at Nazareth did not like illustrations, especially when they made it so plain that Grace would bless a poor Sidonian widow or a Syrian leper if it chose to do so, without considering that the widows and lepers of Israel had any previous claim.<a name=67:14></a> These people were not prepared to allow God to be gracious when His grace was shown in its activity.<a name=67:15></a> If the children of Israel had fulfilled their side of the covenant they might, indeed, have claimed much from God, but their whole history had proved them to be as bad as their guilty neighbours, and more criminal, because of having more light.<a name=67:16></a> GRACE can only act on the ground that all are alike in deserving nothing.<a name=67:17></a> A religious Israelite could only have the blessings of Grace on the

	<div class="paragraph">
		ground that he deserved nothing; and if that was so, how could he find fault if God blessed a poor Sidonian widow or a Syrian before himself?<a name=68:1></a> It was purely Grace for all alike, and surely Grace had the right to choose its objects where it would!<a name=68:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look for a moment at the illustrations.<a name=68:3></a> Volumes of grace and blessings are bound up in the histories of the Sidonian widow and the Syrian leper.<a name=68:4></a> I have no doubt that we have here -- brought into the compass of three verses -- an epitome of what Grace will do for its objects.<a name=68:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember the condition in which the prophet found the widow -- reduced to extremity -- brought down to a handful of meal and a cruse of oil!<a name=68:6></a> reduced to a point when there was nothing between her and death but that which typified Christ and the Holy Spirit.<a name=68:7></a> It is a blessed thing to be reduced to that point.<a name=68:8></a> David was brought to a point when he had to say, "There is but a step between me and death".<a name=68:9></a> Have you been brought to realize that if Christ and the Holy Spirit were taken away there is nothing between you and death?<a name=68:10></a> When you reach that point you will find that you need nothing more.<a name=68:11></a> Christ known by the Holy Spirit as a Saviour is all you need.<a name=68:12></a> The Lord God of Israel said, "The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth".<a name=68:13></a> The time of famine and need is the time of Grace, and that grace will never fail its objects until the famine is over.<a name=68:14></a> By and by there will be a dispensation of righteousness, when the earth will be mown by the scythe of judgment, and then the King of glory will "come down as rain upon the mown grass, and as showers that water the earth" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72:6">Psalm  72:6</a>), and until then the meal and the oil neither waste nor fail.<a name=68:15></a> Christ as a Saviour, and the Holy Spirit to make Him known, is the provision of Grace for the famine of souls.<a name=68:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the widow must learn that Grace goes deeper still
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=69>[Page 69]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		because her need is deeper still.<a name=69:1></a> She must learn that Grace will not only save from death, but <i>through</i> death and out of death.<a name=69:2></a> Her son sickens and dies.<a name=69:3></a> Depend upon it, brethren, we never really learn the depths of Grace until we find ourselves under the power of death.<a name=69:4></a> Our sin has brought death upon us in the twofold character of the power of Satan and the judgment of God, and Grace would fail to meet our case if it did not remove us from the power of death and give us a life which death cannot touch.<a name=69:5></a> How this is accomplished we see in figure in the case of the widow's son.<a name=69:6></a> First, he was laid in the prophet's bed.<a name=69:7></a> Sleep is a figure of death, and the child was identified with the prophet in the place which was a figure of death.<a name=69:8></a> The prophet was a type of that blessed Saviour who has been -- not in figure only, but in actual fact -- in the place of death, and each believer has been identified with Him in His death.<a name=69:9></a> We have died with Christ: God has seen us identified with Christ's death, so that all that we were as children of Adam has gone out of His sight in the death of Christ!<a name=69:10></a> This is a glorious truth, my brethren!<a name=69:11></a> God has seen you laid in the prophet's bed -- identified with Christ in His death.<a name=69:12></a> Have you seen yourself there?<a name=69:13></a> Have you entered into that of which baptism is a figure -- that you have part in Christ's death?<a name=69:14></a> Have you by faith eaten the flesh and drunk the blood of the Son of man, so that you have identified yourself with His death, and it has become part of the faith of your soul that you have died with Christ?<a name=69:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the prophet stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the Lord, and the soul of the child came into him again.<a name=69:16></a> The same striking action was repeated by Elisha in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4">2 Kings  4</a>, in connection with the Shunammite's son, and I think it answers, as a type, to the action of the blessed Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=69:17></a> Having passed through death, He came into the midst of His own, and breathed

		into them, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit".<a name=70:1></a> In the old creation God breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of life, and he became a living soul.<a name=70:2></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>the Son of God as the last Adam associated His brethren with Himself in the possession of a life which death can never touch -- a life which is in Himself, and which He gives to all who believe on Him.<a name=70:3></a> Have you by faith passed out of your old life as a child of Adam by having died with Christ, and entered upon a new and eternal life which is beyond all the power of death, and which is in the Son of God?<a name=70:4></a> This is the glorious end of sovereign grace; for we read that "where sin abounded GRACE did much more abound: that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign, through righteousness, unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=70:5></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:21">Romans  5:21</a>.<a name=70:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another illustration is needed to complete the picture, and it is furnished by Naaman, the Syrian leper.<a name=70:7></a> The question might be raised, does Grace work such spiritual wonders for our souls, and do nothing for our bodies?<a name=70:8></a> We have bodies with the seeds of corruption in them.<a name=70:9></a> It has been said that we no sooner begin to live than we begin to die.<a name=70:10></a> It is part of the heritage which sin has bequeathed to us that we have mortal bodies, carrying within them the seeds of disease, decay, and death.<a name=70:11></a> This condition of things was strikingly exemplified in Naaman.<a name=70:12></a> His body was corrupted by a disease which perhaps more plainly than any other stamps the body as being 'mortal'.<a name=70:13></a> The leper sees his members eaten away until they drop off; his whole existence is a living death; he manifests plainly the condition to which sin has reduced man's body.<a name=70:14></a> Is there to be no remedy for this?<a name=70:15></a> Is Grace going to bestow infinite blessings on the soul and leave the body to be the spoil of corruption?<a name=70:16></a> Never!<a name=70:17></a> Seven times plunged beneath the waters of Jordan, and the flesh of the leper becomes as that of a little child.<a name=70:18></a> His body was rescued from the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me assure you that the triumph of Grace will never be complete until our bodies partake of the efficacy of Christ's death, and are entirely freed from what Scripture calls "the bondage of corruption".<a name=71:2></a> This will be when the Lord returns.<a name=71:3></a> The bodies of God's saints which have been sown in weakness and dishonour and corruption during the last six thousand years will be raised in power and glory and incorruption.<a name=71:4></a> As for us who are living when the Lord comes, the power by which He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself will be put forth upon us, and in the twinkling of an eye we shall be <i>changed</i>.<a name=71:5></a> These vile bodies will be fashioned like unto His glorious body, and as we rise to meet Him in the air "we shall be <i>like him</i>, for we shall see him as he is".<a name=71:6></a> The "many brethren" will be fully conformed to the image of the Son of God -- Himself the First-born among them.<a name=71:7></a> And, remember, GRACE does all this.<a name=71:8></a> You will find all that I have spoken of attributed to God's "own purpose and grace" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:9">2 Timothy  1:9</a>, 10), according to which death has been abolished and <i>life</i> and <i>incorruptibility</i> brought to light by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=71:9></a>

		If blessing is on the ground of grace it could not be admitted that the privileged Israelite had any more claim to it than a condemned Sidonian or "a Syrian ready to perish", and God chose to vindicate the sovereignty of His grace by blessing these outcasts, and He does so still.<a name=71:10></a> He passes by the pretensions of men and blesses the needy.<a name=71:11></a> He fills the hungry with good things, but the rich He sends empty away.<a name=71:12></a> Is this the Grace that you delight in?<a name=71:13></a> or do you think that God should have some respect to your goodness, your morality, or your religion?<a name=71:14></a> Alas!<a name=71:15></a> man's goodness and religion always make him hate grace.<a name=71:16></a> I will venture to say that these sinners at Nazareth had not too

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1.

		2.

		But in this scripture (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1">2 Corinthians  1</a>) it is not law that is before us, but <i>promises</i>.<a name=109:7></a> Promises are the announcement of what God would effect for His own pleasure in carrying out His purposes.<a name=109:8></a> But how could God's purposes for man be carried out in the face of man's complete breakdown, and the apparent triumph of sin and death in the world?<a name=109:9></a> Our total ruin as under sin and death could not be ignored.<a name=109:10></a> All the questions raised by the fall and sin must be righteously settled.<a name=109:11></a> God must be glorified as to sin and death, and by the complete removal from before Him of man in the flesh -- the corrupt and irretrievable man in whom not one of God's thoughts could ever be established.<a name=109:12></a> This is the work of the cross.<a name=109:13></a> God has been glorified about sin by One who has borne its full judgment, and the man in whom sin was is ended before God in the death of Christ.<a name=109:14></a>

		But there is something else which it is of the deepest importance for our hearts to apprehend.<a name=110:8></a> God has established all His own thoughts and purposes in Christ, and has done it for His own glory; but observe that it is "unto the glory of God <i>by us</i>".<a name=110:9></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:20">2 Corinthians  1:20</a>.<a name=110:10></a> <i>We</i> are linked up with all that God has established in Christ.<a name=110:11></a> Paul could speak of himself and Timothy and the Corinthians as having been stablished in Christ by God.<a name=110:12></a> The thought conveyed is that of being firmly attached to Christ, and for this the work of God in our souls is necessary.<a name=110:13></a> Nothing will satisfy God but that we should be stablished in what He has established in Christ -- that it should be so in our souls as to be "to the glory of God <i>by us</i>".<a name=110:14></a> He has effected His purposes in Christ, and now His whole work in our souls is to the end that we should be stablished in -- firmly attached to -- what He has effected.<a name=110:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can only briefly touch upon three steps in soul-experience by which this is reached.<a name=110:16></a> First, we learn what sin is before God by knowing the One who alone could bear its judgment, and what it cost Him to bear it.<a name=110:17></a> This is the Passover.<a name=110:18></a> We learn that the judgment due to us has been borne by Another.<a name=110:19></a> Then, in the next place, we learn what it is to be justified, which answers to the passage of

		<a name=111>[Page 111]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Red Sea.<a name=111:1></a> We learn that God will not impute sin to us, but that He does impute righteousness -- righteousness measured and expressed by Christ risen.<a name=111:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the third great step brings us to what is typified by the brazen serpent.<a name=111:3></a> Many a justified man might describe his experience in words like these: 'I fully recognize, and rejoice in the fact, that I am righteous before God according to Christ risen; and this being so, nothing but Christ can be my standard of holiness or rule of life.<a name=111:4></a> If I could only walk up to it I think I should be a perfectly happy man.<a name=111:5></a> But it is one failure after another; and when I think I have got on a bit, something turns up, and I find myself as bad as ever, and the thought of this damps all my spiritual joy'.<a name=111:6></a> In this stage of spiritual experience there are continual discoveries of self which make self more and more repulsive, and there is also the presentation of Christ again and again in which the soul finds increasing delight.<a name=111:7></a> It is a kind of John the Baptist experience -- "He must increase, but I must decrease".<a name=111:8></a> Christ is increasing, and self decreasing, in the estimation of the believer's heart.<a name=111:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This repulsion and attraction go on together until the soul accepts with God the reality of the incorrigible badness of the flesh.<a name=111:10></a> Then comes a burst of glorious light.<a name=111:11></a> We see that the death of Christ severs us from our old self, and that Christ is our life.<a name=111:12></a> We are free by the cross from the man who is so repugnant to us, and we discover with untold delight that the One who has so attracted our hearts is our life.<a name=111:13></a> "Christ liveth in me".<a name=111:14></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=111:15></a> We are stablished in Christ.<a name=111:16></a> Christ is written in our hearts.<a name=111:17></a> And this is the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=111:18></a> The anointing (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>) is the power according to which we are stablished in Christ.<a name=111:19></a> It is not a theory or a doctrine grasped by the mind; it is a reality in the soul by the Spirit.<a name=111:20></a>
