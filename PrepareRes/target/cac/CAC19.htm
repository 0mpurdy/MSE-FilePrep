		I trust it may be helpful to us all, and especially to the young believers present, to look at the divine principles which are set forth in these chapters.<a name=5:2></a> I need hardly say that we do not get the light of Christianity in the book of Proverbs; but we get principles and encouragements and warnings which can be viewed now in the light of Christianity, and which are full of instruction.<a name=5:3></a> We see in principle the characteristics of those who take hold of "the path of life", and how they are delivered from "the ways of darkness".<a name=5:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge" (1: 7).<a name=5:5></a> The natural man cannot know the things of God, because he lacks that which is "the beginning of knowledge" -- there is no fear of God before his eyes (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:11">Romans  3:11</a>, 18).<a name=5:6></a> This being the case, it is evident that there must be a work of God in man to prepare him for the reception of divine knowledge.<a name=5:7></a> The new birth is an absolute necessity.<a name=5:8></a> A man who is "born anew" has the fear of God before his eyes, and he begins to look at things from an entirely new standpoint.<a name=5:9></a> The natural man judges of things without any reference to the will of God; he does what he likes -- so far as he has opportunity -- and is a god to himself, He may be moral or religious, if that be the bent of his mind; but he does not really fear God, and therefore has neither a just sense of what sin is, nor a true appreciation of grace.<a name=5:10></a>

		The one "born of water and of the Spirit" hates evil (see <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:13">Proverbs  8:13</a>), though he may have to say, "What I hate, that do I" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:15">Romans  7:15</a>), and he hates it because it is displeasing to God.<a name=6:1></a> "By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#18:6">Proverbs  18:6</a>).<a name=6:2></a> It is this holy fear that causes those born anew to cease practising evil and to separate themselves from the company and ways of the ungodly, thus bringing forth "fruits meet for repentance".<a name=6:3></a> It also causes them to abhor themselves because they discover that sin dwells in them, and that in them -- that is, in their flesh -- dwells no good thing (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:18">Romans  7:18</a>).<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, "In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.<a name=6:5></a> The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#14:26">Proverbs  14:26</a>, 27).<a name=6:6></a> Those who fear God are always marked by confidence in Him, of which prayer is the expression.<a name=6:7></a> That it can be said, "Behold he prayeth", is one of the first and surest signs that a divine work has begun in a soul.<a name=6:8></a> It is man -- the needy and guilty sinner -- turning to God for relief and refuge and salvation.<a name=6:9></a> The fear of God never leads a man to despair, but to "strong confidence" in God, so that however vile and guilty he may have been, he has an instinctive sense that he may look to God with confidence for pardon and salvation from the power of evil.<a name=6:10></a> The fear of the Lord thus becomes "a fountain of life", for it not only causes a man to hate evil and to depart from the snares of death, but it turns him to God as the Source of life and every blessing.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, "His children shall have a place of refuge" is very full of meaning if we connect with it (as we surely

		may) the thought of all that is provided for man by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=7:1></a> He has made atonement by the sacrifice of Himself, and God has raised Him from the dead; and now the forgiveness of sins is preached in His Name, and by Him all who believe are justified from all things.<a name=7:2></a> Such was the gospel preached by Paul at Antioch to those who feared God (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>).<a name=7:3></a> Judaism stood condemned by its rejection of Christ, and the heathen world was fully ripe for the judgment of God.<a name=7:4></a> But there was then, and there is now, "a place of refuge" for those who fear God.<a name=7:5></a> CHRIST is made known, in the day of His rejection by Israel, as the Saviour of the world.<a name=7:6></a> It is not a Christ accepted and honoured here -- a Christ after the flesh -- whom we have to do with.<a name=7:7></a> It is a Christ rejected and crucified here, but who has at the moment of His entire rejection by man accomplished redemption, and who is now raised again and set at God's right hand.<a name=7:8></a> He has been in the place of evil, as made sin for us, so that everything contrary to God might come under judgment.<a name=7:9></a> Evil has neither been ignored nor compromised in any way.<a name=7:10></a> It has been fully dealt with according to divine holiness in the death of Christ, so that grace might reign through righteousness.<a name=7:11></a> And Christ risen is the glorious Witness that redemption is accomplished, that sin is judged, that sins are purged, that God is glorified, that grace is triumphant, and, in short, that God as a Saviour God has removed every barrier that stood in the way of man's blessing.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is now proclaimed in the gospel, and "made known to all nations for the obedience of faith".<a name=7:13></a> Those who believe find "a place of refuge" in God Himself -- revealed in grace as a Saviour God.<a name=7:14></a> The gospel

		tolerates no mixture of self-righteousness or self-confidence in any form; God alone is the confidence and boast of His children.<a name=8:1></a> And as He alone is the Refuge of His saints, so His thoughts and His love are the only measure of their blessing.<a name=8:2></a> It is of the greatest importance that we should be simple in our sense of GRACE, and that we should not allow the enemy to divert us from it.<a name=8:3></a> To turn back to the consideration of ourselves -- our feelings, works, attainments, etc.<a name=8:4></a> -- or to suppose that religious observances, sacraments, and law-keeping are necessary or advantageous in addition to Christ and the Grace of God received by faith, is really to leave the ground of Christian blessing and to become fallen from grace (see the Epistle to the Galatians).<a name=8:5></a> The gospel by which we were begotten to the knowledge of God was a gospel of absolute grace, and it brought to our hearts the joy of blessings conferred by pure grace.<a name=8:6></a> It was no question of what we were, or of what we could do, but of what GOD was, and what GOD would do for the gratification of His own heart.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with this we may apply the principle of the words, "My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#1:8">Proverbs  1:8</a>, 9).<a name=8:8></a> We have been begotten by the testimony of grace.<a name=8:9></a> Whatever servant or instrument God might be pleased to use, it was the testimony of His grace by which we were begotten, according to <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:23">1 Peter  1:23</a> - 25, "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<a name=8:10></a> For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower

		of grass.<a name=9:1></a> The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.<a name=9:2></a> And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you".<a name=9:3></a> In this sense the testimony of Grace is our father, while "Jerusalem which is above" -- the whole blessed system of heavenly grace which is established and set forth in Christ in glory -- "is the mother of us all" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:26">Galatians  4:26</a>).<a name=9:4></a> The Galatians were slipping quite away from the gospel by which they had been begotten, and had "fallen from grace".<a name=9:5></a> They had, for the time, become deaf to the instruction of their father, and had forsaken the law of their mother, and the result was that they had lost their ornaments of grace.<a name=9:6></a> They must have quite lost the sense of sonship, and lacked the "fruit of the Spirit".<a name=9:7></a> If we depart from Grace we depart altogether from God, and from everything which can maintain freshness, power, and spiritual joy in our souls.<a name=9:8></a> In short, we lose our divine ornaments, and drop down to the level of religious flesh.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is as being "under grace" that we can walk in liberty and joy in the fear of the Lord.<a name=9:10></a> The fear of the Lord is the practical recognition in the soul that we are now to be here for God's will and not our own.<a name=9:11></a> Just as self-will is characteristic of the flesh, the fear of the Lord is characteristic of those born of God.<a name=9:12></a> It is really the spirit of obedience and subjection to God.<a name=9:13></a> It has been said that "obedience is the only exercise, save praise, of life to God".<a name=9:14></a> As we walk in the fear of the Lord, under His eye and in subjection to His will, we get practical deliverance from mere human expediency and from the motives and principles of action which control men in the world.<a name=9:15></a>

		I put it to every one here, Do you know the grace and love of God, so that you can trust Him with your happiness?<a name=10:1></a> You have trusted Him for the eternal blessing of your soul, but can you trust Him with your happiness day by day?<a name=10:2></a> A desire may arise in your mind for something that you would not like to pray for.<a name=10:3></a> Now you may be quite sure that anything you cannot pray for, and that you cannot receive from God in grace and love, will not minister in the smallest degree to your true happiness.<a name=10:4></a> God would have our confidence in Him to be so strong that we should be afraid to touch anything that we could not take as directly from Him.<a name=10:5></a> It was so with our blessed Lord.<a name=10:6></a> The devil said, "If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread".<a name=10:7></a> Was not bread a good thing for a hungry man?<a name=10:8></a> Had He not power to do what was suggested?<a name=10:9></a> Yes, indeed, but He would not depart from subjection to God.<a name=10:10></a> He would not make a loaf for Himself without a word from God.<a name=10:11></a> He set Jehovah always before Him.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While walking in the fear of the Lord, and with godly exercise, it is deeply important that we should keep very simple in the sense of grace.<a name=10:13></a> We fail in many things, and then the enemy seeks to take away the sense of grace, so that distance may come in between us and God, But

		and as we know this we are encouraged to go straight to God even when we have failed.<a name=10:14></a> He is "the God of all grace".<a name=10:15></a> We have to "judge ourselves", but we do so in the presence of infinite grace.<a name=10:16></a> The lowest point in the universe is death, and we see grace there, for

		Jesus "by the grace of God tasted death".<a name=11:1></a> The highest point is the throne of God, and grace is seen in glory there, for Jesus is there.<a name=11:2></a> So Christ fills all things in the moral universe, and we cannot look at any point between the dust of death and the throne of God's glory without seeing there the blessed Witness of Grace.<a name=11:3></a> How this encourages confidence in God as "the God of all grace"!<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an important word here which I commend to every young believer.<a name=11:5></a> "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#1:10">Proverbs  1:10</a>).<a name=11:6></a> The secret of many an unhappy and unfruitful life can be found in the inability to say "No".<a name=11:7></a> If you want an accomplishment that will be of practical service to you as a Christian, cultivate the power to say "No".<a name=11:8></a> There are many sinners around, and there is also a sinner within, ready at all times to entice you from "the paths of life".<a name=11:9></a> They only consult to cast you down from your excellency, and to move you away from your true happiness.<a name=11:10></a> You must not parley with them; you must not compromise; you must say "No".<a name=11:11></a> When a neighbour, or acquaintance, or fellow-worker in the shop or the office asks you to go here and there for worldly pleasure, or offers to lend you a worldly book, that is the time to say "No".<a name=11:12></a> It does no good to get out of such things by making excuses.<a name=11:13></a> If you make excuses they will keep on at you, but if you quietly and graciously tell them you cannot do as they desire, and why, it is very probable that they will not trouble you again.<a name=11:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as I have said, there is a sinner within.<a name=11:15></a> The desires and tastes of the flesh may often appeal for gratification.<a name=11:16></a> The flesh in us is as fond of the things

		of the world as ever.<a name=12:1></a> The first qualification of a disciple of Christ is the ability to say "No" to himself.<a name=12:2></a> "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:24">Matthew  16:24</a>).<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we get the voice of Wisdom addressing itself to men (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#1:20">Proverbs  1:20</a> - 33).<a name=12:4></a> Every divine testimony is the voice of Wisdom, and if men be willing to hear that voice, and to turn from their sin and folly, the Spirit of Wisdom is poured out unto them, and Wisdom's words are made known to them.<a name=12:5></a> The voice of Wisdom today is the gospel of God concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and those who hear it receive the Holy Ghost.<a name=12:6></a> It is when we have heard Wisdom's voice, and received Wisdom's Spirit, that we are free in conscience and heart to make wisdom, understanding and knowledge the great object of our pursuit and search.<a name=12:7></a> "My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee, so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#2:1">Proverbs  2:1</a> - 5).<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I greatly desire that all our hearts may be attracted by the blessedness of this.<a name=12:9></a> The world's philosophers profess to be searching for wisdom, but with them it is a mere abstraction -- certain conceptions of their own minds in which they can take pleasure.<a name=12:10></a> For those born of God wisdom is set forth in the Person of Christ, the Son of God, and God would have us to enrich our souls by searching out the priceless treasures that are enfolded in Him.<a name=12:11></a> He is "unto the Jews a stumbling-block,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read that wisdom was with God "from the beginning, or ever the earth was .<a name=13:2></a>.<a name=13:3></a>.<a name=13:4></a>.<a name=13:5></a> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:23">Proverbs  8:23</a>, 30, 31).<a name=13:6></a> Would you not like to know more of the Person in whom God's wisdom is now presented to men?<a name=13:7></a> More of the Blessed One whose heart was so set upon you that He would go to the cross to die for you, that He might have you for and with Himself for ever?<a name=13:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is the Wisdom of God in view of all the questions which sin had raised, and which appeared to make the blessing of man and the accomplishment of the purposes of divine love impossible.<a name=13:9></a> How perfectly has God solved every problem and removed every difficulty, taking away in holy judgment by the death of Christ the man in whom sin had fully displayed itself, so that Christ in resurrection might be the Head and Centre of a new world for God's pleasure and glory!<a name=13:10></a> Christ is the Wisdom of God for all this; and not only do we see in Him a Resource which was more than equal to every difficulty that stood in the way of love's eternal purpose, but we also find in Him the perfect and blessed Revelation of God.<a name=13:11></a> "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=13:12></a> To "find the knowledge of God" is the great prize set before us, to be sought as silver and searched for as for hid treasure (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#2:4">Proverbs  2:4</a>, 5).<a name=13:13></a> And where can

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I should like you to note three things which characterize the one whose heart is set upon the acquisition of "wisdom".<a name=14:2></a> First, he has Wisdom's Spirit.<a name=14:3></a> Of this we have a distinct intimation in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#1:23">Proverbs  1:23</a>.<a name=14:4></a> I do not think anyone goes after Christ with much spring and energy of soul, or becomes very deeply affected by a desire to have "the knowledge of God", until be has received the Spirit.<a name=14:5></a> To believe the gospel and to receive the Spirit by the hearing of faith is the beginning of our Christian history; but it is only the beginning.<a name=14:6></a> We have to come under divine teaching, and to feed upon proper spiritual food, in order to grow and be formed in divine capacity to understand divine things.<a name=14:7></a> And this is subsequent to the reception of the Spirit.<a name=14:8></a> Nothing can be more injurious to souls than the supposition that they have reached full Christian stature because they have the Spirit.<a name=14:9></a> I admit that every one who has the Spirit is complete, just as a new-born babe is complete.<a name=14:10></a> But the babe must feed and grow in order to come to full stature, and so must the saint.<a name=14:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		True growth is by the knowledge of God revealed in His beloved Son.<a name=14:12></a> It is of Him that the Holy Ghost ever delights to speak.<a name=14:13></a> "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>); "He shall testify of me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>); "He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.<a name=14:14></a> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto

		you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a>, 15).<a name=15:1></a> We have received Wisdom's Spirit that we may be interested in these blessed things, and capable of apprehending them.<a name=15:2></a> "The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:27">1 John  2:27</a>).<a name=15:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father has been perfectly revealed in the Son, and now the Holy Ghost abides in us as a divine anointing, to teach us to find the fulness of grace and truth in Him.<a name=15:4></a> Everything that constitutes "wisdom" is to be found in Christ.<a name=15:5></a> People sometimes talk about "development" in Christianity, but everything that goes beyond, or is added to Christ is really apostasy; it is simply departure from the truth and is of the father of lies.<a name=15:6></a> The effect of having Wisdom's Spirit is that we find all truth -- everything that constitutes "wisdom" -- set forth in Christ the Son of God.<a name=15:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, having such an unction to teach us, how is it that we have not gained more of the knowledge of Christ?<a name=15:8></a> We know much of other things, but oh!<a name=15:9></a> how little do we really know of Christ!<a name=15:10></a> How is this?<a name=15:11></a> I think we may find the answer by looking at the second characteristic of those who are set upon getting "wisdom".<a name=15:12></a>

		We need not suppose that Wisdom's voice is silent today.<a name=16:9></a> In wonderful grace God has maintained and revived the ministry of Christ amongst His saints.<a name=16:10></a> To this end gifts have been given -- "some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>, 12).<a name=16:11></a> It is wonderful how the Lord has maintained in ministry amongst His saints that which is really the voice of Wisdom, especially when we consider how numerous and powerful are the influences which tend to silence that voice.<a name=16:12></a> None of us here can say that God has failed to bring before us in ministry that which is of Himself -- the ministry of Christ.<a name=16:13></a> The question is, Have we had the inclined ear and the applied heart?<a name=16:14></a> If believers -- young or old -- do not get enlarged in the knowledge of Christ, it is not because help and ministry are lacking, but

		<center>1.<a name=22:3></a> DEPENDENCE</center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding".<a name=22:4></a> Dependence is no way of pleasantness and peace to an unconverted man; it is a dreadful moment to him when he is compelled to realize his dependence on God; he never turns to God unless he is in dire extremity -- on a sinking ship or something of that kind.<a name=22:5></a> The reason of this is that he has no confidence in God.<a name=22:6></a> There is nothing more galling than to be dependent on someone we have no confidence in; and on the other hand, nothing gives such rest and peace to the heart as dependence, if there be perfect confidence in the person on whom we depend.<a name=22:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Dependence is the first lesson in the school of God; it is the way of our earliest blessing.<a name=22:8></a> We had to be entirely dependent on God for pardon, assurance, peace, and all the blessings which filled our hearts with the joy of salvation; so long as we leaned to our own understanding we got nothing.<a name=22:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have said, there can be no happy dependence if there is not confidence.<a name=22:10></a> Now what is the first mark of confidence in God?<a name=22:11></a> To find the answer to this question let us read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32:6">Psalm  32:6</a>: "I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.<a name=22:12></a> I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin".<a name=22:13></a> God had

	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust we all understand something of having this confidence in God; but let me remind you that it is of deep importance that it should be maintained all the way through.<a name=24:3></a> When failure comes in, and in many things we all offend, it is always Satan's effort to undermine our confidence in God -- to keep us from turning at once to God about it.<a name=24:4></a> "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not", said the Lord to His disciple who was so soon to deny Him (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>).<a name=24:5></a> The great thing for us when we fail is to turn at once to God about it.<a name=24:6></a> That is the true secret and power of holiness.<a name=24:7></a> The man who has such confidence in the grace of God that he turns to God at once about his sins is a holy man.<a name=24:8></a> The man who says he has not sinned for a week is a self-deceived hypocrite.<a name=24:9></a> Having to do with God is the true power of holiness, and this is based on confidence in Him.<a name=24:10></a>

		Then as to our circumstances and the difficulties of the path.<a name=24:11></a> If we are not walking in dependence we are walking in self-will and sin.<a name=24:12></a> If we had more confidence in God we should be more in the spirit of dependence about everything.<a name=24:13></a> Perhaps you may say, I should like to have more confidence in God, but how am I to get it?<a name=24:14></a> You must get to know Him better.<a name=24:15></a> The way to get our faith increased is by increasing our knowledge of God.<a name=24:16></a> Make it the supreme business of your life to get better acquainted with God.<a name=24:17></a> He has told Himself out; He has expressed Himself fully.<a name=24:18></a> All that God is has come out in the Person of His Son,

		But before speaking of these things it may be helpful to glance at certain events in the previous history of the children of Israel.<a name=56:5></a> Thirty-eight years before, God had brought them out of Egypt that He might carry out His purpose of blessing according to the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<a name=56:6></a> They were not redeemed because they were better than the Egyptians, for there was no difference in nature and practice between the Israelites and the Egyptians (see <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#20:5">Ezekiel  20:5</a> - 9).<a name=56:7></a> Both alike deserved the judgment of God, but God wrought for His Name's sake, and in grace and sovereign mercy He put a division ("redemption", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#8:23">Exodus  8:23</a>, margin) between His people and Pharaoh's people.<a name=56:8></a> It is God's grace and sovereign mercy that makes a difference between His called and chosen people and the world of the ungodly.<a name=56:9></a> But this could only be on the ground of atonement, and therefore the lamb must be slain and the blood sprinkled on every

		Then, after being sheltered by the blood of the Lamb, the people had to learn the glorious power of Jehovah as a Saviour God.<a name=57:9></a> God is for His people against all the power of evil.<a name=57:10></a> On the ground of atonement God can claim His people for Himself, and act in victorious power on their behalf against every foe.<a name=57:11></a> So, at the Red Sea, they had to "stand still and see the salvation of the Lord".<a name=57:12></a> The divided waters, the dry land on which they passed through the Red Sea, the overshadowing cloud of Jehovah's presence, and the complete overthrow of the Egyptians in the midst of the sea, were all the blessed testimony of God's mighty power as a Saviour God.<a name=57:13></a> What answers to this for us can be found in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:24">Romans  4:24</a> - 5: 1.<a name=57:14></a>

		Consequent upon these wondrous actings of God in sovereign grace and mercy, the people found themselves in the wilderness.<a name=58:8></a> Canaan was their destiny and their inheritance according to God's purpose, but He led them forty years in the wilderness, as we read in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:2">Deuteronomy  8:2</a>, to humble them, and to prove them, to know what was in their heart.<a name=58:9></a> There was, indeed, another side to the wilderness, for it was the place of divine resources and care, and where nature could only see a barren desert, faith saw God.<a name=58:10></a> But it was the place where the true character of the flesh came out.<a name=58:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed to see that sinful flesh has been condemned in the death of Christ!<a name=60:10></a> It was in boundless divine love and grace that He became a Sacrifice for sin.<a name=60:11></a> Nothing but His death could make an end of sinful flesh, but in that precious death it has been utterly condemned.<a name=60:12></a> Are you glad to know this?<a name=60:13></a> If you have not learned to hate yourself, you will not care to know the meaning of the cross.<a name=60:14></a> But if you have been harassed and troubled by sinful flesh until you abhor yourself, you will rejoice to know that it was condemned when the Son of Man was lifted up.<a name=60:15></a>

		The subject which is before me tonight, is that of affection for Christ, or the state of heart which the Spirit is here to produce in the saints, and by which they answer to the present thoughts of Christ.<a name=84:1></a> I am afraid that when we speak of being <i>here for Christ</i> it is often the thought of our service or conduct that is prominent, and therefore it is well to be reminded that there is something over which Christ is more jealous than He is over our conduct or our service.<a name=84:2></a> It is that "garden enclosed", that "spring shut up", that "fountain sealed", from which all others but Himself are excluded -- the hidden spring of those affections which alone satisfy His heart, or render conduct and service acceptable to Him.<a name=84:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is very strikingly expressed in the words which we have just read, where we see the object of the true evangelist.<a name=84:4></a> He is a man bent upon <i>a present result for Christ</i>.<a name=84:5></a> He is not anxious to have a number of converts whom he can count as his own; he is not thinking of himself, but of his Master; he is wanting those whom he can present "as a chaste virgin to Christ".<a name=84:6></a> It is not that he loses sight of the eternal result, but the immediate object on which his heart is set, and for which he longs with intense fervency, is a present result in a people whose affections are altogether for

		This is a great object before the heart of God at the present time -- to have a people saved not only from judgment and the lake of fire, but from the world; saved not only for heaven by-and-by, but for the heart of Christ now.<a name=85:3></a> The work of Christ on the cross has settled every question that sin raised between God and our souls, and the future is bright with the glory of God, into which we shall be brought according to all the value of that work.<a name=85:4></a> But there is another thing, and that is the interval between the cross and the glory -- an interval marked, so far as this world is concerned, by the dishonour and rejection of Christ.<a name=85:5></a> Satan cannot touch the value of the work of the cross, nor can he mar the perfection of the eternal glory, but the whole force of his power is put forth to hinder a present result for Christ.<a name=85:6></a> On the other hand, all the energy of the Holy Ghost is active to produce a present result for Christ.<a name=85:7></a> Every believer is looking to be to the satisfaction and joy of Christ in the eternal future; and surely none of us would like to say that we did not care whether we were to His satisfaction now or not, and yet, alas!<a name=85:8></a> <i>practically</i> it very often comes to this.<a name=85:9></a>

		What a wonderful thing it is to get into His company to learn there how He loves; because His love does not ignore what the flesh is, nor does it forget our liability to be influenced and defiled by what is around us here.<a name=108:2></a> Yet He loves, and loves to the end.<a name=108:3></a> It is a blessed thing to know that His love has secured to itself the title to regard us apart from everything that is unworthy of that love.<a name=108:4></a> He has gone into death to remove from us divinely and for ever all traces of unsuitability to Himself.<a name=108:5></a> His death has set Him free, if we might say so, to love us, and as we appropriate His death it sets us free to be loved.<a name=108:6></a> On His side love is free, and as we appropriate His death we appropriate that which sets us free in spirit from all the sin and imperfection of the flesh, and we are free to be loved.<a name=108:7></a> The Lord Jesus looks upon us according to the thoughts of His love, and according to the perfect sanctification of His death, and thus apart from every trace of imperfection.<a name=108:8></a> When He "loved the church and gave himself for it", do you think He saw it in guilt and ruin?<a name=108:9></a> No, He saw it in its beauty, according to the thoughts of His own love.<a name=108:10></a> For us to enter into this there must be the appropriation of His death, and this sets us free to be loved.<a name=108:11></a> There can be nothing more blessed than to be free to enter into the love of divine Persons.<a name=108:12></a> It is eternal life, and the effect of it comes out in love one to another.<a name=108:13></a> Thus the saints are bound together in affection.<a name=108:14></a> It will be so perfectly and for ever in the Father's house.<a name=108:15></a> All hearts there will be full of divine love, and bound together in that love by the all-pervading Spirit.<a name=108:16></a> What

		THE CHRISTIAN'S DESIRES: AN INDEX TO CHRISTIAN CHARACTER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to bring before you tonight a most interesting subject, viz.<a name=116:1></a>, The Desires of a Christian.<a name=116:2></a> A man's true character comes out when you get to know his desires.<a name=116:3></a> If you knew a man's desires you would know the man; they are the true index to what he is.<a name=116:4></a> What a man has or what he is outwardly does not constitute his character: for this you must go beneath the surface to the hidden springs of the heart.<a name=116:5></a> In the Word of God man in the flesh is exposed right down to the very roots of his being.<a name=116:6></a> Not only is divine light thrown upon his actions and words, but the very desires of his heart are dragged out from their secret hiding-places and exhibited in their true and hideous nature, so that we know not only what man has done, but what he is -- we know his character.<a name=116:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a similar way we have in the Epistle to the Philippians the unfolding of the desires of a Christian's heart; and in connection with this I may remark that nothing is more wonderful than the way in which God developed the life and experience of a Christian in the beloved Apostle Paul, so that the most exalted truths are not here stated in a doctrinal way, but are presented as having been worked out in the life and experience of a man subject to like passions as we are.<a name=116:8></a> In this epistle the heart of the man in Christ is uncovered, the very core of his moral being is laid bare, his inmost desires are exposed, and thus we learn here not so much what are the privileges, or the activities of the Christian,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as we learn what constitutes the character of a Christian.<a name=117:1></a> May the Lord's blessing attend our meditations on this subject!<a name=117:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. "According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also, Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:20">Philippians  1:20</a>).<a name=117:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consider for a moment the peculiarly trying circumstances in which Paul was found when these words were penned.<a name=117:4></a> Think of him with all his natural energy of character, and with all the burning desires of a heart that had been saturated with the love of Christ, and longed to carry the fulness of the blessing of Christ to every saint and sinner under heaven; and think what it must have been to him to be hemmed in by the four walls of a Roman prison!<a name=117:5></a> Such had been his position for at least two years, and yet he expresses no desire to have his circumstances altered.<a name=117:6></a> His one care and desire was that CHRIST might be magnified in his body in any circumstance -- whether by life or by death.<a name=117:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Did you never find yourself making your circumstances an excuse for your lack of devotedness to Christ?<a name=117:8></a> The poor man thinks, If I were rich I could magnify Christ a great deal; the weak one thinks, If I were strong and robust, what an amount of service I could render; the one who has not much gifts thinks, If I could speak as well as So-and-so I could honour Christ much more than I do; others say, If I were in another family, If I had a different occupation, If my circumstances were changed a little, Christ might be magnified more largely in me.<a name=117:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the simple fact is that this is all self-occupation,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=118>[Page 118]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and these are the wretched excuses made by the flesh to justify a lack of devotedness to Christ.<a name=118:1></a> Look at them, and you will find that they all centre round self.<a name=118:2></a> It is if I this, and if I that, I would be a wonderful Christian, and of course I should have the credit of it, and, in result, I would be magnified.<a name=118:3></a> The soul in this state has not really done with self -- that wretched old I -- and if circumstances permitted many works and much Christian activity, the result would be something like <a href="../bible/Job.htm#29">Job  29</a>.<a name=118:4></a> If you read that chapter you will find the occurrence about fifty times of the words "I", "me", and "my".<a name=118:5></a> Job had been in circumstances which favoured a great deal of benevolent activity, but you notice it all centred round himself, and you might justly entitle this chapter, Self Magnified.<a name=118:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An immense advance upon this may be found in a remarkable utterance of John the Baptist; "He must increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:30">John  3:30</a>).<a name=118:7></a> Himself one of the last and greatest saints of a dispensation which recognized man in the flesh, John was taught of God to express what was not only true of himself personally, but true of him as the representative of man in the flesh.<a name=118:8></a> The very presence on earth of the Second Man out of heaven was morally the setting aside of the old order of man in the flesh.<a name=118:9></a> Here was One who had come from above -- from heaven -- and contrasting this One with himself -- the MAN of the new order with the man of the old -- John says, "HE must increase, but I must decrease".<a name=118:10></a> As the glories of the Person of Christ passed before the eyes of faith, He eclipsed everything that was of the first man.<a name=118:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in <a href="../bible/Job.htm#29">Job  29</a>we have self magnified; in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>self decreasing, one mere step and we find self gone.<a name=118:12></a>

		"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=119:1></a> At the cross the One who knew no sin was made sin for us.<a name=119:2></a> It was, so to speak, as the Representative of the race of Adam that He died.<a name=119:3></a> The deep, dark waters of death flowed over and covered Him -- as once they flowed over the created earth -- and the end of all flesh came before God.<a name=119:4></a> That was the end of man in the flesh in the sight of God, and every believer in Jesus is entitled to take account of himself as having "died with Christ".<a name=119:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the starting-point of true Christian experience.<a name=119:6></a> When first converted I suppose we all, with more or less earnestness, endeavoured to be what we felt we ought to be.<a name=119:7></a> We struggled and prayed and resolved, and were grievously disappointed to find that we could not succeed in our purpose.<a name=119:8></a> We found that there was something within us which would not be brought into subjection to the will of God.<a name=119:9></a> We discovered that we had not only been guilty of doing many bad things, but that we were bad ourselves.<a name=119:10></a> It was not sins that troubled us at this stage of our experience, but self.<a name=119:11></a> At last we despaired of making ourselves better: we reached the point that another had reached hundreds of years before us, and could only cry, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=119:12></a> who shall deliver me from this body of death?<a name=119:13></a>" We became sensible that we needed as complete a deliverance from self as we did from sins.<a name=119:14></a> When we reached that point God showed us the Blessed One who was lifted up upon the cross -- Antitype of the brazen serpent -- and we were prepared to accept

		the precious truth of the gospel, that "our old man has been crucified with him", and that "we have died with Christ".<a name=120:1></a> We appropriated the death of Christ and reckoned it as our own; at the same time discovering that Christ as the living, Risen One was our life.<a name=120:2></a> Now the Holy Ghost, if ungrieved, would maintain us in the liberty of "life in Christ Jesus".<a name=120:3></a> As we walk in the Spirit we are kept in communion with God as to "our old man", and he never comes back before God -- he has been condemned and set aside for ever in the stupendous judicial act of Calvary.<a name=120:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then not only does Christ live in us, but He becomes the motive Object of our life as Christians.<a name=120:5></a> The law is no longer our motive or rule of life.<a name=120:6></a> It is entirely displaced by a Person, and that Person "the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=120:7></a> Henceforth the soul has got a new centre -- it is no longer self-centred but Christ-centred.<a name=120:8></a> Christ is the motive Object and not self.<a name=120:9></a>

		The Epistle to the Philippians starts on this level.<a name=120:10></a> If we do not know <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a> in our souls, we are not at all prepared for Philippians.<a name=120:11></a> The "I's" and "me's" of Philippians (about ninety in number) are very different from the "I's" and "me's" of <a href="../bible/Job.htm#29">Job  29</a>or <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=120:12></a> It is the Christian, as such, who speaks in this epistle, and the desires and experience spoken of are those of one who knows what it is to be "a man in Christ".<a name=120:13></a> With such a one it is no longer a question of circumstances, or of what may happen to him; but the desire that, whatever happens to him, CHRIST may be magnified, becomes the supreme concern of the heart.<a name=120:14></a> He counts that the "old man", who would have rivalled Christ, and who desired to magnify himself, has been

		In reference to Paul it is with bated breath one would speak of such a distinguished servant of God; but it was the action of his will that landed him in prison; but when God allowed him to be fastened up in a place where his will and activity were checked, he says, "It is all right; this shall turn to my salvation".<a name=140:8></a> God's way with him was preserving him from the action of his own will; and, beloved friends, we shall find that it is so in our experience.<a name=140:9></a> A beloved servant of the Lord, now with Him, used often to say that if Christians were wise they might discover where their wills had a tendency to work, for it was exactly at that point God would continually check and hinder them.<a name=140:10></a> If you find you are always checked and hindered at a certain point, you may depend upon it that it is a point where your will has a tendency to work.<a name=140:11></a> You would like to go in that direction, but God says, No!<a name=140:12></a> And why?<a name=140:13></a> Because He wants you to be saved.<a name=140:14></a> What does salvation mean?<a name=140:15></a> It means deliverance from all the power of evil, and I do not know anything more evil, or that I dread more, than my own will.<a name=140:16></a> Salvation in a practical and experimental sense is found in being set free from our own

		I think it is beautiful how he regards these Philippians as being in partnership with himself.<a name=142:1></a> In the early part of the chapter he thanks God for their "fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now"; and when he says, "Through your prayer", it is as much as to say, I know you will pray for me, that CHRIST may be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death, and this is what I desire.<a name=142:2></a> They were partakers of the same grace that was in Paul.<a name=142:3></a> He was at the front -- the special target for the enemy's power, but the reserves at Philippi were supporting him with their prayers.<a name=142:4></a> Both he and they felt the need; there was the demand and the supply -- the "supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".<a name=142:5></a> Whenever the demand becomes a reality in our hearts, we may have the "supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".<a name=142:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now see how this works out!<a name=142:7></a> The Man of God's good pleasure has been rejected from the earth and set in glory at God's right hand, and God works in His saints in this world, and by His gracious way with them He brings them to feel the absolute need of divine support, so that God's good pleasure may be worked out in them.<a name=142:8></a> They are in the line of God's good pleasure, and they feel the need of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in order to work it out.<a name=142:9></a> They pray, and then the supply comes.<a name=142:10></a> If we are to be here for God's good pleasure, it is not by making efforts and stirring ourselves up that it will come to pass.<a name=142:11></a> Confessing failure and resolving to do better for the future is not sufficient.<a name=142:12></a> Nothing will put us in the line of God's good pleasure but "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".<a name=142:13></a> We must have a fresh supply for the necessity of the day, or the hour, or the minute, and how infinite

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is the supply available for us!<a name=143:1></a> Through that supply we get inward support.<a name=143:2></a> That is the first effect, as it was with the apostle in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=143:3></a> He prayed three times that the Lord would take away the thorn.<a name=143:4></a> But the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness".<a name=143:5></a> He says first, "My grace is sufficient for thee".<a name=143:6></a> By this I understand that the Lord would give Paul such a supply of His grace that Paul would be content to be reduced to nothing by the thorn; and then when Paul was so inwardly supported that he was content to be reduced to nothing, Christ's power would tabernacle over him, and accomplish infinite results through his weakness.<a name=143:7></a> Having this wonderful supply the apostle could say, I will "glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me".<a name=143:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is support outwardly, as we get in the end of the chapter.<a name=143:9></a> "And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God" (verse 28).<a name=143:10></a> The thought of salvation here, and in fact all through the epistle, is that we are for the good pleasure of God.<a name=143:11></a> Delivered from the working of our own will and from all that is evil in the world, we are for the good pleasure of God, and the power of God's salvation keeps us in the presence of our adversaries.<a name=143:12></a> We thus have the power of God, not only for inward support in our own spirits, but also for outward support, so that the adversaries around are not able to crush or dismay us, or turn us aside.<a name=143:13></a> The salvation of God is with us, and that is a very great thing.<a name=143:14></a>

		I purpose to make a few remarks on the seven things which the Queen of Sheba saw during her visit to Solomon.<a name=151:1></a> I need hardly say that I do not intend to dwell on these things in a merely historical way, but as figurative of certain things which are now made good in Christianity in connection with Christ risen and glorified.<a name=151:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that she saw was "the wisdom of Solomon".<a name=151:3></a> One of the first great lessons that, we have to learn in Christianity is that Christ is the Wisdom of God.<a name=151:4></a> This comes out in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>.<a name=151:5></a> We have to see that every human resource and activity has been brought to nothing.<a name=151:6></a> Corinth was second only to Athens as a centre of learning, and as the headquarters of different schools of philosophy; and the saints were evidently affected by the atmosphere around them, as we all are more or less.<a name=151:7></a> Hence the apostle found it necessary to insist that the cross set man in the flesh completely aside with all his wisdom and power.<a name=151:8></a> There is nothing in the cross in which man can boast.<a name=151:9></a> No man could boast in the fact that he was under death.<a name=151:10></a> Human wisdom is of no account whatever in the things of God.<a name=151:11></a> Yet it is deeply rooted in people's minds that a preacher must be a learned man; his mind must be trained, and so on.<a name=151:12></a> The cross is very little understood.<a name=151:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It follows from this that the wisdom of God does not come within the cognizance of man's natural powers.<a name=152:3></a> It is "hidden wisdom", "the wisdom of God in a mystery".<a name=152:4></a> It can only be known by the Spirit (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>).<a name=152:5></a> The thought of "wisdom" is the revelation of God in all the blessedness and perfection of counsels and resources that no power of evil can baffle.<a name=152:6></a> The fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ the glorified Man (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>).<a name=152:7></a> The effect of apprehending Christ as the Wisdom of God is to make us not only independent of man's wisdom, but infinitely superior to it.<a name=152:8></a> And we not only have Christ objectively as the Wisdom of God, but "we have the mind of Christ".<a name=152:9></a> We have a new and divine intelligent faculty by which we can apprehend the Wisdom of God.<a name=152:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thing mentioned as being seen by the Queen of Sheba was "the house that he had built".<a name=152:11></a> Christ is the Builder of everything that is for God's pleasure and glory on earth.<a name=152:12></a> The Father prepared the material and brought it to Him (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:37">John  6:37</a>, 45, etc.<a name=152:13></a>, etc.<a name=152:14></a>), and He put it together in resurrection power as His assembly (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>).<a name=152:15></a> There is divine material and a divine Builder, and the result is a divine structure.<a name=152:16></a>

		Approach to God in the sanctuary (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>) is the highest privilege of those who form the house of God.<a name=153:9></a> They are also introduced to a circle where divine satisfaction can be found, and where God's light and perfection is revealed (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>).<a name=153:10></a> This is a subject which attracts one's heart, but which I cannot enlarge upon now.<a name=153:11></a> It will come before us to some extent in the next section of our subject.<a name=153:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The third thing which the Queen saw with admiration was "the meat of his table".<a name=153:13></a> I have just mentioned that in the house of God we come to a circle where divine satisfaction can be found.<a name=153:14></a> There is food there.<a name=153:15></a> In the world, the greater your desires are and the more refined your tastes the less likely you are to get satisfaction.<a name=153:16></a> But in the house of God, the more your spiritual desires and capacities are enlarged the more perfect is

	<div class="paragraph">
		At every stage of our spiritual history the Spirit creates in our souls exercises and desires appropriate to our state, and by which we are prepared to appreciate that which may be known of God and of His beloved Son.<a name=154:3></a> Spiritual tastes and appetites are thus brought into being, which can only be satisfied by the knowledge of God.<a name=154:4></a> But in the food of God's house there is that which perfectly satisfies these spiritual tastes.<a name=154:5></a>

		Next, the Queen noticed "the deportment of his servants".<a name=154:11></a> The word translated in A.<a name=154:12></a>V.<a name=154:13></a> "sitting", and in J.<a name=154:14></a>N.<a name=154:15></a>D.<a name=154:16></a> "deportment" is generally translated "dwelling" or "habitation".<a name=154:17></a> I judge that the thought conveyed is not exactly how they conducted themselves, but rather the excellence of their position and privilege as being called to serve in Solomon's house.<a name=154:18></a> It was a most blessed position to occupy.<a name=154:19></a> "Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom".<a name=154:20></a>

		They had their dwelling in the circle of Solomon's greatness and glory, and they were privileged continually to hear his wisdom.<a name=155:1></a> We may see in this a figure of the character of Christian blessing.<a name=155:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our true blessing and joy does not consist in receiving certain things from Christ, but in being drawn to Him so as to find everything that is blessed and satisfying for our hearts in Him.<a name=155:3></a> Christ does not give blessings away to be enjoyed apart from Himself: He gives every blessing in Himself.<a name=155:4></a> The great longing of the Psalmist was expressed in the words, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty [graciousness] of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>).<a name=155:5></a> And again it is written, "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84:4">Psalm  84:4</a>).<a name=155:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find the same spirit in the two disciples who heard John speak and followed Jesus.<a name=155:7></a> When He said unto them, "What seek ye?<a name=155:8></a> They said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?<a name=155:9></a> He saith unto them, Come and see.<a name=155:10></a> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:38">John  1:38</a>, 39).<a name=155:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing which impressed the Queen was "the order of service of his attendants [or ministers], and their apparel".<a name=156:5></a> All the appointments of the house, with its different offices, and the orderly and harmonious working of the whole, revealed the wisdom and perfect administration of Solomon.<a name=156:6></a> In this we see a figure of the order that properly belongs to the house of God.<a name=156:7></a> Christendom in general has entirely departed from the divine order, having lost the sense of what that order is.<a name=156:8></a> The administration of the Lord Jesus, and the presence of the Spirit here, are quite unknown in any practical way in Christendom generally.<a name=156:9></a> Hence we find ecclesiastical systems set up, and religious officials appointed to maintain human order.<a name=156:10></a> On the other hand, not a few have left the organized religious bodies, and taken independent and professedly non-sectarian ground, that they might be at liberty to serve and minister in their own way.<a name=156:11></a> But clerical order and radical independency are alike unknown in the house of God.<a name=156:12></a> Everything there is under the administration of one Lord, and is in the power of the one Spirit.<a name=156:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The clerical system stands hopelessly condemned in the presence of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=156:14></a> However great and gifted a man may be, he is only one member of the body, and he cannot possibly discharge the functions of the other members.<a name=156:15></a> The attempt to do so can only be a human effort, unprofitable to men and displeasing to the Lord.<a name=156:16></a>

		The radical principle of everyone doing as he feels "led" is, if possible, a greater evil still, for it gives room for all the evils of "one-man-ministry" to be multiplied, and often subjects saints to the infliction of ministry (?<a name=157:1></a>) from men whose only qualifications are self-confidence, and a desire to hear their own voices.<a name=157:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		EDIFICATION is the great end of all ministry.<a name=157:3></a> The saints are to be built up in the knowledge of God, Christ is to be ministered to our hearts, and the things of the Spirit presented to us.<a name=157:4></a> And this, not merely in a general way -- the barren statement of things admitted to be true -- but so as to lead us on in a deepened knowledge of God.<a name=157:5></a> As our spiritual capacities are enlarged we should find in the house of God a ministry that would continually help and edify us.<a name=157:6></a> A ministry that does this approves itself to every spiritual mind as being of God.<a name=157:7></a> It carries the stamp of divine wisdom and grace, and it is necessarily in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=157:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The subduing knowledge of divine Persons, and a deep sense of the greatness of divine thoughts, characterizes every true "minister".<a name=157:9></a> We realize that he is not seeking to make himself prominent, or to display his ability in the way he presents things.<a name=157:10></a> He is conscious of the greatness and blessedness of that which he seeks to present, and it is his one desire that it should become great and blessed to our hearts.<a name=157:11></a> We see that he is absorbed by it, that it elevates him above self-consideration, and this gives moral weight to his ministry.<a name=157:12></a>

		One word as to "their apparel".<a name=158:1></a> Everything about Solomon's ministers was suitable and appropriate to their service.<a name=158:2></a> Their personal appearance was consistent with their high service.<a name=158:3></a> How important is this!<a name=158:4></a> People will pay little heed to the ministry of those whose personal appearance and ways are not in harmony therewith.<a name=158:5></a> I have heard of one who was continually speaking of being "dead with Christ", and going on with much worldliness at the same time.<a name=158:6></a> Such ministry only dishonours the Lord, and is a stumbling-block to souls.<a name=158:7></a> The apparel does not match the service!<a name=158:8></a>

		Now we come to "his cup-bearers and their apparel".<a name=158:9></a> These were servants who ministered in a special way to the pleasure of Solomon.<a name=158:10></a> There is a higher and sweeter service than that of ministry to the saints, however blessed that may be in its place.<a name=158:11></a> To be able to minister to the joy of Christ is a wondrous privilege, and divine love has placed even this within our reach.<a name=158:12></a> It is not, indeed, that we do so by bringing what is of ourselves to Him.<a name=158:13></a> But as we present ourselves before Him, and as our souls enter into His deep perfections and into that blessed revelation of the Father which He brings to our hearts, and as we taste and respond to His precious and perfect love, we minister joy to His heart.<a name=158:14></a> We bring back to Him that which is His own, but we bring it back to Him as that which has become the life and glory of our hearts.<a name=158:15></a> May God by His Spirit lead us more into this peculiar and blessed ministry when we are found together in assembly!<a name=158:16></a>

		Finally, the Queen of Sheba saw "his ascent by which he went up to the house of the Lord".<a name=159:7></a> I apprehend we have in this a figure of approach to God in the sanctuary.<a name=159:8></a> No doubt the approach in that day was worthy of the revelation of Jehovah's Name which had been made, and it was worthy of the one who approached.<a name=159:9></a> But when we come to Christianity all is so infinitely great and glorious that it transcends all types and figures.<a name=159:10></a> The Son has glorified the Father by placing the perfect revelation of the Father's Name before the hearts of His own.<a name=159:11></a> He has brought all the blessedness of God to light in the activity of His holy love.<a name=159:12></a> He has also, by receiving those whom the Father has drawn to Him, and by accomplishing redemption and giving the Spirit, secured a company of "many sons" to be in the light of that blessed revelation, and to respond to it.<a name=159:13></a> But, now that the revelation is made, and the company secured, He takes a new and wondrous place as "the firstborn among many brethren".<a name=159:14></a> He takes a
