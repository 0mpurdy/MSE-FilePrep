		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:1></a> You were here when we spoke of Hebrews following Luke: perhaps you would help us at the beginning of this epistle?<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:3></a>C.<a name=1:4></a> It was thought that Luke presented what was of priestly character, the Lord being carried to heaven in priestly attitude.<a name=1:5></a> This epistle follows suitably on that; it presents the Lord to us definitely as in heaven, and as exercising priesthood there, the thought being that the service of God is sustained according to divine pleasure.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:7></a> Is the thought that in the measure in which God's speaking becomes effective, in the same measure there is response Godward?<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:9></a>C.<a name=1:10></a> That is the key to this epistle; the service takes character from the speaking.<a name=1:11></a> It was so in the service of the tabernacle; this epistle is built up on the model of the tabernacle service.<a name=1:12></a> The first thing that God had in mind in setting up the tabernacle system was that there should be a place from which He could speak  --  the mercy-seat.<a name=1:13></a> The whole service was ordered from the divine speaking, and God would speak from a spot that set Him free.<a name=1:14></a> The speaking in Exodus was from the mercy-seat, and the service was regulated and took character from the divine speaking.<a name=1:15></a> It is so now, the speaking being of the highest character and connected with the thought of the Son, which is the highest thought.<a name=1:16></a> The service must have an elevation and character that corresponds with it.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:1></a> If the speaking is in Son, only those brought into sonship can understand it.<a name=2:2></a> If that is understood, is priestly service taken up in the enjoyment of sonship?<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:4></a>C.<a name=2:5></a> Yes.<a name=2:6></a> We find that priesthood, even in Christ, is dependent on His Sonship.<a name=2:7></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5">Hebrews  5</a>, "<i>Thou</i> art my Son", and then, "Thou art a priest", shewing that priesthood according to divine pleasure is only taken up in sonship, as the thought of God's delight enters into it.<a name=2:8></a> The thought of a Son in relation to God is very precious.<a name=2:9></a> The great thought that has come before the blessed God is an Object of delight and satisfaction.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:11></a> In the covenant we read, "I will be to them for God, and <i>they</i> shall be to me for people" (chapter 8: 10), but in this chapter we have, "I will be to him for father, and <i>he</i> shall be to me for son".<a name=2:12></a> Is that not much higher?<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:14></a>C.<a name=2:15></a> Yes, I think it is, though the two are intimately connected.<a name=2:16></a> When Israel was to be brought into the blessing of the new covenant it is said, "In the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, Sons of the living God", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#1:10">Hosea  1:10</a>.<a name=2:17></a> That shows that in connection with the covenant God has a great thought of sonship in His mind.<a name=2:18></a> In Deuteronomy Moses addresses the people as "sons of Jehovah your God", shewing that when God introduced the thought of the covenant to His people they were not to stop short of what was in His mind  --  sonship.<a name=2:19></a> So today the covenant comes in in connection with what is the cherished delight of God's heart; He has one Object before Him to fill His heart with satisfaction, and in which His love has found full delight; that is the thought in the Son.<a name=2:20></a> That becomes the standard, it is the measure of what is in the heart of God.<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:22></a> Is there any difference between sonship for Israel and for us?<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:24></a>C.<a name=2:25></a> They came into sonship as a people on earth; we

	<div class="paragraph">
		come into sonship in what takes character from Christ in heaven.<a name=3:1></a> The blessing in Hebrews takes on a heavenly character.<a name=3:2></a> The blessing known by the saints today goes far beyond the covenant that will be known to Israel.<a name=3:3></a> He is bringing many sons to glory now; that is, they are being brought to the consummation of all that is in the heart of God.<a name=3:4></a>

		Rem.<a name=3:5></a> The more we enter into it the more response there would be to it.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:7></a>C.<a name=3:8></a> Yes, I am sure of that.<a name=3:9></a> God is the Speaker; we should ever keep that before us.<a name=3:10></a> The end in view is that we should be brought to God, brought to the blessedness that is in God Himself.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:12></a> Would sonship be more for God Himself, although we get the joy of it?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:14></a>C.<a name=3:15></a> Yes.<a name=3:16></a> Sonship is for God, and the inheritance is for the sons.<a name=3:17></a> Hebrews helps much because it gives intelligence in the thoughts and ways of God.<a name=3:18></a> The idea of sonship is that we have intelligent capacity to enter into things of interest to God; that is the great thought in being brought into sonship.<a name=3:19></a> God is pleased, not in our telling Him we are sons, but in our being able to speak to Him in a way that shows we are sons.<a name=3:20></a> The spirit of sonship does not occupy us with itself; the spirit of sonship cries, "Abba, Father".<a name=3:21></a> That is, the blessedness of God known in love and in conscious relationship is before the soul.<a name=3:22></a> We are not just to be occupied with the dignity of it but with the blessedness of it.<a name=3:23></a> What was the prodigal occupied with inside the father's house?<a name=3:24></a> We are to enter into what the Father is and what is delightful to the Father.<a name=3:25></a> It is a great matter to any earthly father to have his son enter into his thoughts, purposes and delights; that is the thought of sonship.<a name=3:26></a> As sons we enter into those things which are pleasurable to God, and we rejoice in Him.<a name=3:27></a> "Abba, Father" is an adoring utterance --  we think of the blessedness

	<div class="paragraph">
		into which we are brought, and we enjoy it affectionately, so there is the rapturous expression of that in the cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=4:1></a> That is what the Father delights in.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is speaking in Son, so the speaking comes from the centre of God's delight and love.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:4></a> Can it be fully expressed in human language?<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:6></a>C.<a name=4:7></a> I do not suppose it can.<a name=4:8></a> As far as we are concerned sonship is only taken up in the Spirit.<a name=4:9></a> It is not what we have heard, or even what is in Scripture, but the ability to take up in the power of the Holy Spirit the relationship in which we are filled adoringly.<a name=4:10></a> There is a glorious Person introduced to us here, and that gives the spirit of worship.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is giving expression to Himself and His own thoughts in such a way that they are not limited by the vessel that conveys them.<a name=4:12></a> There would be a limitation in what God made known to Moses, but there is no limitation in God speaking in Son.<a name=4:13></a> Everything can come out that it is possible for the creature to know.<a name=4:14></a> A great deal has come into expression which is beyond the power of the creature to apprehend.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These opening verses of the epistle are to give us a very great thought of the Son, the immense glory that attaches to Him.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:17></a> In verse 4 it speaks of a more excellent name.<a name=4:18></a> Is that 'The Son'?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:20></a>C.<a name=4:21></a> Yes, that is an inherited name.<a name=4:22></a> As soon as He was born He inherited every title that belongs to the Messiah; and among those titles was the glorious name of Son.<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first few verses He is representative of God; the first thing said of Him is that God has established Him Heir of all things; He is competent to take up all things as God's representative, as succeeding to all the rights of God.<a name=4:24></a> Being Heir of all things suggests a great thought of wealth, and shews the immense value that He is going to

		C.A.<a name=5:18></a>C.<a name=5:19></a> It shews everything takes up the glory of God -- His effulgence in the Son.<a name=5:20></a> He is the effulgence of His glory and the expression of His substance.<a name=5:21></a> It does not follow we can take it all in.<a name=5:22></a> There is a great deal expressed mediatorially in the Son that is beyond creature power to apprehend.<a name=5:23></a> In the end of Revelation we find He has a

		Name and it is written, but no one knows it.<a name=6:1></a> There is the expression in the Son of all that belongs to the glory of God; it pleased God to set it forth mediatorially, but a good deal that is set forth mediatorially is beyond the compass of the creature.<a name=6:2></a> "The Son" is a mediatorial title, but we are told that no one knows the Son but the Father.<a name=6:3></a> By the Son God made the worlds.<a name=6:4></a> Creation was a mediatorial action, but it is inscrutable; we know nothing about creation; it belongs to God.<a name=6:5></a> We see the product but we cannot understand the power that made creation.<a name=6:6></a> Creation has a mediatorial character.<a name=6:7></a> In creation the Son was the Actor, one Person in the Deity was acting on behalf of the Others.<a name=6:8></a> The Word was with God, a distinct Personality.<a name=6:9></a> In creation the Son was the acting Representative on behalf of God.<a name=6:10></a> He could not have created if He had not been God.<a name=6:11></a> He was with God, He was God.<a name=6:12></a> All received being through Him; all belonged to His mediatorial glory.<a name=6:13></a> As this enters into our souls spiritually, worship is produced.<a name=6:14></a> Faith understands, though it is inscrutable.<a name=6:15></a> The Son is inscrutable; the sense of that is essential to worship.<a name=6:16></a> When we think of the Son there are no limitations; what comes into the mediatorial creation is without limit.<a name=6:17></a> The effulgence of His glory, the expression of His substance --  His substance and Being are expressed in the Son.<a name=6:18></a> As creatures we have limitations, but there are no limitations in the Son; the effulgence of divine glory is there, and there is not a ray of divine glory that is not there.<a name=6:19></a> What an elevation this gives to the worship of the assembly!<a name=6:20></a> All this is brought before us to prepare us for the worship of God in the assembly!<a name=6:21></a> We do not leave out of the service of the assembly the praise of God as Creator; that belongs to the assembly.<a name=6:22></a> The only assembly prayer recorded is one that belongs to creation (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>).<a name=6:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=9:6></a>C.<a name=9:7></a> Yes, the primary object of the epistle is to deliver Hebrew believers entirely from the old religious associations.<a name=9:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Crowned with glory and honour" is connected with Christ's exaltation: the whole position depends on the fact of His being at the right hand of God.<a name=9:9></a> The point of His being "crowned with glory and honour" is that it is a peculiar moment now between His establishing His moral title and having the inheritance.<a name=9:10></a> Faith enters into it now.<a name=9:11></a> Personally He is at the right hand of God; it is there that we view Him, but the point is not <i>where</i> we see Him, but <i>how</i> we see Him.<a name=9:12></a> We see Him in all the glory and holy splendour of the moral title which He has established through death.<a name=9:13></a> There is nothing more wonderful in the history of eternity than this parenthesis between the cross and the glory.<a name=9:14></a> His title to everything is established, though possession is not entered on, but we see Him crowned with glory and honour.<a name=9:15></a> God has crowned Him; God has done it to Him as Son of Man.<a name=9:16></a> Christ has come in as Son of Man to inherit all that is in the thought of God for man.<a name=9:17></a> All has come to light as to the Person to whom the world to come is to be in subjection.<a name=9:18></a> The peculiarity of this moment is that things are not subjected, but everything has come to light in regard to the Person.<a name=9:19></a> It is interwoven with the whole

		Now something appears that did not appear in creation.<a name=10:12></a> The grace of God did not appear in creation, but it does appear in the death of Christ.<a name=10:13></a> If something came in displeasing to God, it must be removed either in grace or in judgment; if in grace, what God is in His nature comes to light.<a name=10:14></a> The death of Christ is infinitely great because it has provided an outlet for all that there was in the blessed God to come out in His universe that had been stained by sin.<a name=10:15></a> It is an immense thing to be in the light of a Person who could do all that.<a name=10:16></a> We are in the light of the glory of the Son of Man.<a name=10:17></a> The power to do it was always in His Person, but now it has come to light.<a name=10:18></a>

		I thought it might be helpful to see what has come in in connection with Jesus as crowned with glory and honour.<a name=161:1></a> It is very interesting to keep in mind the psalm which is quoted.<a name=161:2></a> The Alpha and the Omega of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is that God's name is to be excellent in all the earth.<a name=161:3></a> The psalm begins with that and ends with it, but before that is brought in publicly there are babes and sucklings in whose mouths God establishes His praise, and that is God's present triumph over all His enemies.<a name=161:4></a> There is a circle where the blessedness of the world to come is anticipated.<a name=161:5></a> It will be anticipated in the blessing and testimony of the remnant before it is made manifest in the world to come, but at the present moment all blessing and testimony are found in the assembly; it is there that God's name is excellent.<a name=161:6></a>

		God is bringing many sons to glory, but He is bringing them there along the road of sufferings.<a name=164:7></a> Sufferings and glory are very often linked together in Scripture.<a name=164:8></a> I do not think the Lord ever proposed to bring people to glory by any other road, and you must not expect anything else.<a name=164:9></a> If you take the path of God's will --  the only path that leads to glory  --  you will find that it is paved with sufferings, but there is not a step in that road which has not been trodden by the feet of Jesus.<a name=164:10></a> The Leader of our salvation has been made perfect through sufferings, and if the Leader has been perfected by sufferings it indicates the character of the path in which He leads.<a name=164:11></a> When there were those who came to the Lord and asked for glory He said, 'Are you prepared for the path that leads there?<a name=164:12></a>'

		Sufferings are looked at in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>as the portion of children but the end is that the company which has suffered here is revealed in glory as the sons of God.<a name=165:6></a> They come out to display, it seems to me, the moral result of the way by which they have been led to glory.<a name=165:7></a> It is in this way that "all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose"; everything works along the line of effecting conformity to the image of His Son.<a name=165:8></a> God is forming sons for glory, and He is doing it very largely by sufferings (see <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:16">2 Corinthians  4:16</a> - 18).<a name=165:9></a>

		In Israel obedience and piety and love had place at home and all the year round, but when they took up their relations with God according to the full privilege of their calling it was in the place where He set His name.<a name=168:6></a> We are always to be marked by obedience, piety and love but to take up the full privilege of our calling we must be together.<a name=168:7></a> Hence the Lord left His Supper that we might be constrained in affection to come together.<a name=168:8></a> The affections must be touched.<a name=168:9></a>

		This scripture helps us as to the relation in which Christ stands to the assembly as Head, and as to the gain which the assembly derives from having such a Head.<a name=170:1></a> It will be remembered that in instituting the Supper the Lord took a place on our side.<a name=170:2></a> That is, He gave thanks; He appropriated for His saints in thanksgiving all that was involved in His body being for us.<a name=170:3></a> I understand that to be what He does as the Sanctifier.<a name=170:4></a> Chapter 10 of this epistle tells us that we are "sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once"; the "offering" suggests the blessedness and perfection of what was presented to God in His body.<a name=170:5></a> It is not only the removal of all that was contrary to God --  we know that He effected that --  but the bringing in of what is far greater than what He took away.<a name=170:6></a> When He says, "This is my body, which is for you", it involves the accomplishment of all the will of God, so that we might be set apart from the world and from all that we derived from Adam, and identified with all the perfection that has come in for God's pleasure in Himself.<a name=170:7></a>

		The more distinctly we have the heavenly calling in view, the more simple will be our confidence in God as to the circumstances and needs which arise here.<a name=209:2></a> The Lord Jesus would succour us by giving us the knowledge of the Father's purpose and the Father's care.<a name=209:3></a> "Fear not, little flock, for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:32">Luke  12:32</a>.<a name=209:4></a> Will He then lose sight of our need in the wilderness?<a name=209:5></a> No, "your Father knows that ye have need of these things".<a name=209:6></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:22">Luke  12:22</a> - 32 is priestly comfort and succour, assuring our hearts of God's care in the wilderness, and nourishing our souls with the thought of His purpose concerning us.<a name=209:7></a> Thus succoured and encouraged it is our privilege to be at rest in the goodness and love of God, so as not to be diverted from the joy of our heavenly calling by anxious care about circumstances here.<a name=209:8></a>

		The second temptation was a <i>worldly</i> one.<a name=209:9></a> The devil offered the Lord all the kingdoms of the world and their glory if He would do homage to him.<a name=209:10></a> But the great world system with its glory had no attraction for Christ, because He viewed it in relation to God.<a name=209:11></a> God has no place in the world; all its glory is based upon the exclusion of God.<a name=209:12></a> There is not a thing that has greatness and glory in the world that would not be displaced if the rights of God were established.<a name=209:13></a> Therefore a man cannot have the world or its things without "turning away from the living God".<a name=209:14></a> To go in for things of the world is the outcome of "a wicked heart of unbelief".<a name=209:15></a>

		The third temptation was more subtle than the two preceding ones.<a name=210:6></a> One might regard it as a religious temptation.<a name=210:7></a> The devil would have Christ to assume publicly the distinctions and privileges that belonged to Him as Messiah.<a name=210:8></a> But the time had not come for that.<a name=210:9></a> It was no part of the Lord's intentions to assume distinction in the present order of things.<a name=210:10></a> To do so would be to tempt God, and with the quotation of the scripture which forbade this the Lord made His final reply to the tempter.<a name=210:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see an illustration of this on the resurrection day.<a name=213:3></a> The "good things"  --  "the sure mercies of David"  --  had come, and were all established in the risen Christ.<a name=213:4></a> But the dawn of that "morning without clouds" did not break in the hearts of His own; they did not know the good things that had come in Himself as risen from the dead, apart from His service in priestly grace.<a name=213:5></a> To Mary with her sorrowing heart, to Simon with his soiled conscience, to the two disciples whose straying feet were on the road to Emmaus He became the Priest of those "good things".<a name=213:6></a> Each heart was tenderly and faithfully touched according to its state and need, but the gracious service of that wondrous day ceased not until the disciples were together, knowing the risen One, and discerning in Him the fulfilment of all the Scriptures.<a name=213:7></a> He blessed them by introducing their hearts to the knowledge of Himself and of all that was established in Him.<a name=213:8></a> And as thus blessed by Him they did Him homage; they had "great joy", and were continually "praising and blessing God", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:53">Luke  24:53</a>.<a name=213:9></a> It is as being in the good of this priestly salvation and blessing that we are fitted for approach to God.<a name=213:10></a>

		Consequent on redemption being accomplished, and Christ being set at the right hand of God, the whole course of God's dealings towards men is changed.<a name=214:1></a> "The commandment going before" is set aside because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.<a name=214:2></a> The law came in as a test for man in the flesh, but it made nothing perfect; it gave no satisfaction either to God's heart or to man's conscience.<a name=214:3></a> God found fault with the first covenant because it was incapable of bringing about what would yield pleasure and satisfaction to Him (See <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:7">Hebrews  8:7</a> - 9).<a name=214:4></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:1">Hebrews  10:1</a>, 2 we see that the law could never make perfect as to the conscience those who approached.<a name=214:5></a> Thus the law failed to meet the case on both sides; it did not secure satisfaction for the heart of God, and it did not bring perfection to the conscience of the one who approached.<a name=214:6></a> "There is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness, (for the law perfected nothing)".<a name=214:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In contrast to this, Christ makes everything perfect.<a name=214:8></a> Christianity is really a system characterised by divine perfection.<a name=214:9></a> That makes all the difference between the old system and the new.<a name=214:10></a> One makes nothing perfect, but the other makes everything perfect.<a name=214:11></a> It is very important to see this.<a name=214:12></a> When the Holy Spirit says, "Let us go on to what belongs to full growth" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:1">Hebrews  6:1</a>), He does not mean some extraordinary spiritual state, but simply that we are to go on to the apprehension of the true nature of christianity.<a name=214:13></a> Many have not apprehended it, but the great system of blessing which God has established now in connection with Christ in glory is a system of perfection,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=215>[Page 215]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and God would have our hearts instructed in that system.<a name=215:1></a> The result would be that we should find the greatest pleasure in drawing nigh unto God.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that redemption is accomplished and Christ is sitting as Priest at the right hand of God, there is "the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God".<a name=215:3></a> A whole system of blessing is brought into view where everything is perfect and of God.<a name=215:4></a> But what gives a peculiar character to the present moment is that, though blessing of the most wonderful nature is opened up to us, and known in our hearts as a divine reality, there is no present evidence of it to sight or sense.<a name=215:5></a> We cannot prove these great realities by any natural process of reasoning.<a name=215:6></a> If we speak of the two great facts which form the foundation and corner-stone of christianity --  (1) the accomplishment of redemption by the Lord Jesus going into death for the glory of God, and (2) that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, where it is written, "Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool .<a name=215:7></a>.<a name=215:8></a>.<a name=215:9></a> Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek"  --  we only know these great and blessed facts by the testimony of the Holy Spirit.<a name=215:10></a> We have no other evidence whatever.<a name=215:11></a> And faith does not want any other evidence.<a name=215:12></a> "Faith is the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:1">Hebrews  11:1</a>.<a name=215:13></a> We have divine proofs of the great realities which have been brought to pass by God, but we have no natural or visible evidence of these things.<a name=215:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that what is brought in in christianity is a present reality to the hearts of believers though it is not yet manifest in any public way.<a name=215:15></a> It therefore, to a very large extent, takes the character of <i>hope</i> in our souls.<a name=215:16></a> Hence hope has a very prominent place in this epistle; we read of "the boldness and the boast of hope" (chapter 3: 6), "the full assurance of hope" (chapter 6: 11), "the hope set before

		us" (chapter 6: 18), "the confession of the hope" (chapter 10: 23).<a name=216:1></a> The blessings which are established in Christ at the right hand of God have not yet come into public display; they are all hidden, if one may so say, in Christ, and this gives christian blessings the character of "hope" in the souls of believers.<a name=216:2></a> We know them as realities, but we await the display and manifestation of them.<a name=216:3></a> There is "the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God".<a name=216:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may point out three things connected with this hope which are better than anything which was proposed in connection with the law.<a name=216:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>.<a name=216:6></a> This brings us at once to the full height of the heavenly calling, and unfolds in all its blessedness the purpose of God's love.<a name=216:7></a> Mark the words, "for whom are all things"!<a name=216:8></a> Everything has been created and exists for the pleasure of God (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:11">Revelation  4:11</a>), but sin having come in and corrupted God's creation, things can only become pleasurable to God on the ground of reconciliation.<a name=216:9></a> To bring this to pass the Fulness of the Godhead has been pleased to dwell in the Son of the Father's love, by Him to reconcile all things to Itself.<a name=216:10></a> All things are by God as well as for Him.<a name=216:11></a> His mighty power and grace have wrought through redemption so that all things might eventually become the source of good pleasure to Himself.<a name=216:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is the supreme thought of God's heart?<a name=216:13></a> What family will have the central place in God's universe of bliss?<a name=216:14></a> Has He any company in a special way for the satisfaction of His own love?<a name=216:15></a> Yes!<a name=216:16></a> He is "bringing many sons to glory".<a name=216:17></a> Both the relationship and the state to which God is bringing the "holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling" are set forth in Christ in glory.<a name=216:18></a> He has taken His

		place there as the Firstborn among many brethren who will ere long be conformed to His image in glory.<a name=217:1></a> The calling  --  in the full height of its blessedness  --  is set forth and maintained in Him.<a name=217:2></a> God will have many sons brought to glory  --  to be with and like His beloved Son  --  for the satisfaction of His own love.<a name=217:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Does not this transcend every hope that stood in connection with the law?<a name=217:4></a> The brightest hope that could be set before an earthly people, or that shines on the pages of the Old Testament, is infinitely surpassed.<a name=217:5></a> It is, indeed, the introduction of "a better hope".<a name=217:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. Then in connection with the better hope we must take in the thought of the rest of God.<a name=217:7></a> "There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.<a name=217:8></a> For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.<a name=217:9></a> Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:9">Hebrews  4:9</a> - 11.<a name=217:10></a> God has established rest for Himself in Christ, and there is a day coming when God will head up all things in the Christ that He may have His own perfect rest in a universe of bliss.<a name=217:11></a> He will "head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him .<a name=217:12></a>.<a name=217:13></a>.<a name=217:14></a>", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:10">Ephesians  1:10</a>.<a name=217:15></a> The rest of God will be brought about in this way; He will have complacency in all the work of His hands.<a name=217:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is a present reality to the faith and hope of the saint.<a name=217:17></a> Is it not "a better hope"?<a name=217:18></a> Do you find anything like it in connection with the law?<a name=217:19></a> There was, indeed, a "shadow" of it in the tabernacle, but if we want the "image itself" of the universe of bliss we must come to Christ.<a name=217:20></a> There is the perfect setting forth in Christ in glory of everything that is pleasurable to God, and ere long God will head up everything in Him, and will bring His saints

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. Then there are "good things to come": "But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:11">Hebrews  9:11</a>.<a name=218:2></a> "The law, having a shadow of the coming good things", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:1">Hebrews  10:1</a>.<a name=218:3></a> I understand this to refer to the time when Christ will come out and bring all the goodness of God into this world.<a name=218:4></a> The priest coming out of the tabernacle and blessing the people was a figure of this.<a name=218:5></a> At present Christ is hidden from the eyes of men; He is within the veil.<a name=218:6></a> But when He comes forth it will be a wonderful time.<a name=218:7></a> Many Old Testament scriptures give us an idea of it.<a name=218:8></a> I will read one passage: "They shall come and sing aloud upon the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for corn, and for new wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd; and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall not languish any more at all.<a name=218:9></a> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into gladness, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice after their sorrow.<a name=218:10></a> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:12">Jeremiah  31:12</a> - 14.<a name=218:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This scripture  --  and there are many others of similar import --  suggests in a wonderful way the thought of "good things to come".<a name=218:12></a> The great point, as you see, is the introduction of God's goodness.<a name=218:13></a> Men will "flow together to the goodness of Jehovah" and "my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah".<a name=218:14></a> All the goodness of God will be brought into this world where evil has predominated so long, and will become the satisfaction of men's hearts.<a name=218:15></a> And Christ is Priest of these "good things to come".<a name=218:16></a> They are not yet brought out, but in the meantime our hope enters into that within the veil, and apprehends

		them in Christ.<a name=219:1></a> "Whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:20">2 Corinthians  1:20</a>.<a name=219:2></a> All God's promises speak of good things for man, and though they are as yet hidden from the eyes of men, they are all established and confirmed in Christ.<a name=219:3></a> And God has introduced to our hearts the knowledge of all this as "a better hope", we have the knowledge of it as a present reality in Christ though it is not yet brought into public view.<a name=219:4></a> The christian in the energy of this hope is thus satiated with fatness, and satisfied with God's goodness.<a name=219:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in the apprehension of all this that we draw nigh unto God.<a name=219:6></a> We are brought in view of the purpose of His love, according to which He is bringing many sons to glory.<a name=219:7></a> We are also in view of that blessed Person in whom God has found rest, and we anticipate the time when everything will be headed up in Him so as to afford complacency and rest to God.<a name=219:8></a> And we are in view, too, of all the goodness of God  --  that inexhaustible reservoir of beneficence out of which He will furnish an answer to every form of evil that has ever been in this world.<a name=219:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the apprehension of these blessed things we draw nigh to God.<a name=219:10></a> If we apprehend the purpose of His love, and the wonderful place Christ has in relation to His rest, and all the infinite goodness that finds its yea and amen in Christ, the effect must be that the presence of God becomes the most attractive spot in the universe to our hearts.<a name=219:11></a> I do not think any one truly draws nigh to God except in the apprehension of the "better hope".<a name=219:12></a> There must be attraction to bring us nigh to God.<a name=219:13></a> The principle of it is seen in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#43:3">Psalm  43:3</a>, 4: "Send out thy light and thy truth: <i>they</i> shall lead me, <i>they</i> shall bring me to thy holy mount, and unto thy habitations.<a name=219:14></a> Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto the God of the gladness of my joy".<a name=219:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot conceive anything of greater importance than that we should apprehend the better hope in connection

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=220>[Page 220]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		with Christ at the right hand of God --  that is, in connection with Christ as Priest.<a name=220:1></a> It is in Him that we apprehend our heavenly calling and the purpose of God's love, for He is the Firstborn among those who are being brought as many sons to glory.<a name=220:2></a> It is in Him that we apprehend the character of the rest of God.<a name=220:3></a> And it is He who is Priest of "good things to come".<a name=220:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be said, 'These are wonderful heights of blessing; they are out of our reach', I am sure that if we do not know the nature of the covenant of which Christ is Mediator, the things we have been looking at will be out of our reach.<a name=220:5></a> He has become Surety and Mediator of a better covenant which is established on the footing of better promises (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:22">Hebrews  7:22</a>; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:6">Hebrews  8:6</a>).<a name=220:6></a> Christ is Mediator of the new covenant on the ground that He has offered Himself spotless to God.<a name=220:7></a> Death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant.<a name=220:8></a> God's disposition towards man is made known in the death of Christ.<a name=220:9></a> The Testator has died that we might know the mind of God towards us.<a name=220:10></a> "God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:8">Romans  5:8</a>.<a name=220:11></a> In the death of Christ two things are plainly set forth  --  that God has brought in remission of sins for man, and that He has made Himself known as acting in perfect love and grace towards man.<a name=220:12></a> When we see this it sets us free, in conscience and heart, to apprehend all the blessedness connected with the introduction of the better hope.<a name=220:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another thing is that Christ is an absolutely unfailing Priest, and is able to save completely those who approach by Him to God.<a name=220:14></a> I need hardly say this is not the sinner coming to God, but the saint  --  it is priestly approach.<a name=220:15></a> There is power and present grace in Christ to save completely those who approach God by Him.<a name=220:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is necessary to be saved completely in order to

		<a name=221>[Page 221]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		approach God.<a name=221:1></a> All the influences of the world, and all the motives and principles which work in our flesh, tend to hinder our approach to God.<a name=221:2></a> If we had not a Priest able to save us from these hindering elements we should not be free to approach God.<a name=221:3></a> I connect the thought of this salvation very much with <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>where the Lord washed His disciples' feet in view of their having part with Him.<a name=221:4></a> This set forth in figure that all the contamination of the world has to be removed from us in order that we may have part with Him.<a name=221:5></a> The priests had to wash at the laver before they entered the sanctuary.<a name=221:6></a> The contamination of the world must be removed from our spirits before we can approach God.<a name=221:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt we all know what it is to be unfitted for approach to God, though there might be no sin on our conscience.<a name=221:8></a> We have often, it may be, had to mourn that in private, as well as when together in meetings, we were not really free in spirit to approach God.<a name=221:9></a> It is quite clear that at such times some contaminating influence connected with the world or the flesh was acting on our spirits.<a name=221:10></a> Or, it may be, the pressure of some care or trial was a burden on our hearts.<a name=221:11></a> It is these things that make the service of the Priest so necessary to us.<a name=221:12></a> We need a Priest able to save us completely.<a name=221:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me there are two things which have an important place in connection with this priestly salvation.<a name=221:14></a> The first is the ministry of the word.<a name=221:15></a> You may remember that when Aaron went into the sanctuary there were golden bells upon the hem of his garment, so that his sound might be heard, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28:33">Exodus  28:33</a> - 35.<a name=221:16></a> It is through the gifts which have been given from Christ in glory that His sound is heard today.<a name=221:17></a> "<i>He</i> has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=222>[Page 222]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>, 12.<a name=222:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though Christ Himself is hidden His sound is heard.<a name=222:2></a> He ministers grace and truth to our hearts through chosen vessels; His living grace and interest thus finds expression towards us; and this is no small part of His priestly service.<a name=222:3></a> The ministry of the word is intended to perfect and edify us, and thus to deliver us from the false and defective ideas to which we are naturally so prone, and which all tend to link us with the course of things which obtains in "this present evil world".<a name=222:4></a> It is with a view to our salvation from all that is evil here.<a name=222:5></a> No ministry is worth a straw that does not tend to cleanse the saints from the contamination of the world.<a name=222:6></a> Timothy was exhorted to "Give heed to thyself and to the teaching; continue in them; for, doing this, thou shalt save both thyself and those that hear thee", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4">1 Timothy  4</a>.<a name=222:7></a> 16.<a name=222:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing which must not be lost sight of in connection with this subject is the fellowship and unity of saints.<a name=222:9></a> This is clearly associated in Scripture with the anointing of the Priest.<a name=222:10></a> "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=222:11></a> Like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:1">Psalm  133:1</a>, 2.<a name=222:12></a> The grace of the Priest comes down to us that we may be knit together in love, and that we may find in the company of our brethren a circle where there is salvation from the evil influences of the world.<a name=222:13></a> There is a circle here where holy love can be found; there are "holy brethren" here, and as we love them and cleave to them we find security and preservation from the contaminating influences which rule in the world.<a name=222:14></a> Let me urge upon you all  --  and especially upon those who are young in the faith  --  the importance of cleaving to your brethren.<a name=222:15></a> I have often seen the evil of friendships being
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=223>[Page 223]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		formed with people with whom there could be no fellowship in the truth, or in the things of the Lord.<a name=223:1></a> The formation of such a friendship is a solemn indication of decline and departure; and has often led souls quite back into the world.<a name=223:2></a> The respectability or amiability of persons  --  or even their profession of christianity  --  should not be allowed to ensnare us.<a name=223:3></a> Our first thought should be, Do they know and love the Lord, and are they evidently seeking to walk in the truth?<a name=223:4></a> Our great object should be to cultivate spiritual relations with people, not social relations.<a name=223:5></a> If we love the "holy brethren" because they are "holy brethren", we shall find, in cleaving to them, present salvation from "the corruption that is in the world through lust".<a name=223:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot but notice how prominently these two things, the word of God and the company of the saints, are presented in this epistle.<a name=223:7></a> The saints are exhorted to remember those who had spoken to them the word of God, and to "consider one another for provoking to love and good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom is with some; but encouraging one another, and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:24">Hebrews  10:24</a>, 25.<a name=223:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by the ministry of the word, and by knitting our hearts together in love, that Christ would deliver us from the contaminating influences of the world.<a name=223:9></a> There is a constant living activity on His part towards us.<a name=223:10></a> He intercedes for us with a view to our being saved completely from the influences of the world, so that we may be free in spirit to approach God.<a name=223:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us pass on to where we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>.<a name=223:12></a> Christ is the "minister of the holy places".<a name=223:13></a> Everything connected with the knowledge of God and that is for His pleasure is under the charge of Christ.<a name=223:14></a> He is the Minister or Administrator of the holy places; they are all committed

		C.A.<a name=237:13></a>C.<a name=237:14></a> I have always thought it was striking that the account in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17">Acts  17</a>was only of Paul's labours in the synagogue, but when he writes this epistle he seems entirely occupied with those who were converted among the gentiles, who "turned to God from idols".<a name=237:15></a> In preaching to the Jews he reasoned from the Scriptures and shewed that Jesus whom he announced was the Christ;

		C.A.<a name=243:1></a>C.<a name=243:2></a> If God is before the soul there is nothing to hinder boldness; so the soul goes on courageously in the path of His will.<a name=243:3></a> Moses was told to exhort Joshua to be very courageous, to have no fear of the enemy.<a name=243:4></a> How bold troops would be if they, were assured that defeat was impossible!<a name=243:5></a> The way they make troops bold is by persuading them that they are invincible.<a name=243:6></a> Well, in the work of the Lord defeat is impossible; His is the winning side.<a name=243:7></a> Paul desires prayer that he might open his mouth boldly; it is the boldness that is the fruit of dependence because it comes from a sense of absolute weakness, having no sufficiency but in God.<a name=243:8></a> The apostle had a good deal of opposition in Thessalonica; in every bit of service there are difficulties to surmount, and if we are not bold in God we think there is a lion in the way.<a name=243:9></a> There are sure to be obstacles in the way of every little service.<a name=243:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we see that faithfulness to God marked the apostle; in all his service he was not thinking of how he might be approved of men, but it was God who had approved him to have the glad tidings entrusted to him.<a name=243:11></a> It was "God, who proves our hearts".<a name=243:12></a> That was so like the Lord who was the faithful Witness, and who considered only for God.<a name=243:13></a> It is an immense thing to be entrusted with anything that is of God, and then the great thought is --  How can we carry it out so as to please God?<a name=243:14></a> It is God that proves the heart; we are always under His scrutiny.<a name=243:15></a> It is not what we do or say but the spirit we are of; Paul said, "Whom I serve in my spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:9">Romans  1:9</a>); that is, his spirit was in perfect accord with his service.<a name=243:16></a> It is possible to teach and to speak to people, and yet one's spirit is not in accord with it.<a name=243:17></a> You might speak to a person because you feel it is the proper thing to do.<a name=243:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is so beautiful to see the true servant; they were a model assembly and he was a model servant.<a name=244:3></a> We see his boldness; then he has God only before him as the One to be pleased, and he was absolutely unselfish; there is no seeking glory from men, no flattering discourse, and even what he might have done rightly and properly he would not do.<a name=244:4></a> It would have been right if he had made himself a charge, and yet he was absolutely unselfish; his was unselfish labour for the good of others.<a name=244:5></a> It is just a continuation of Christ, and nothing else will do for God.<a name=244:6></a> This is really life; it necessitates a practical emptying of self.<a name=244:7></a> We all begin full of self, but here is a man in whom self has no place.<a name=244:8></a> Are we set to be here in the Spirit of Christ?<a name=244:9></a> Christianity is a very simple thing, just the Spirit of Christ active in the saints; we see it here in Paul.<a name=244:10></a> One can see more and more the importance of Paul's pressing on saints to love one another.<a name=244:11></a> John brings it out too, not doctrine but life, and that is the activity of love.<a name=244:12></a> We "have been gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse would cherish her own children" -- Paul had been amongst them in all the tenderness of a mother; he had begotten them first, and then he nursed them (verse 7).<a name=244:13></a> There had been a nursing time, but now they had got out of babyhood, and he exhorted them as a father; they had grown rapidly; they were big enough to be exhorted by a father, as well as being nursed by a mother.<a name=244:14></a> It is the same grace as was seen in the Lord when He would have gathered His people under the warmth and protection of His wing; that was like this word "cherish"; the apostle in his love cherished these young converts.<a name=244:15></a> There is such beautiful freshness about this first epistle of Paul's; it throbs and palpitates with life, and with all the activity

		of divine love; we see the activity of early love here.<a name=245:1></a> The condition brought about in the converts was morally connected with what they had seen in the apostle.<a name=245:2></a> We cannot expect the same results if we have not the same causes.<a name=245:3></a> There was a wonderful presentation of divine love in the preaching and in the preacher.<a name=245:4></a> He says, "Thus, yearning over you, we had found our delight in having imparted to you .<a name=245:5></a>.<a name=245:6></a>.<a name=245:7></a> our own lives also".<a name=245:8></a> Paul was ready to die for them; it was just what the Lord had done.<a name=245:9></a> How blessedly we should get on together if we were all animated by that spirit!<a name=245:10></a> Nothing can stop this love if it is there, no outside influence; so nothing can stop one from desiring the good of another, however bad they are or however they may have treated one.<a name=245:11></a>

		Then there was not only this yearning of love, but such a beautiful life of blameless purity had been exhibited among them.<a name=245:12></a> The Lord brings it before us so that we might see the vitality of christianity worked out in a man.<a name=245:13></a> The Thessalonians had begun to follow Paul and all this is to encourage them to go on; it is the most powerful way of appealing to any sensitive heart.<a name=245:14></a> Everything was worthy of God in the apostle.<a name=245:15></a> How wonderful to be able to say of a man that his walk and ways and speech are worthy of God!<a name=245:16></a> This could be said of Paul; he exhorts these Thessalonians and through them exhorts us to walk worthy of God.<a name=245:17></a> It is because he is so entirely free of himself that he can speak of himself like this; otherwise it would be self-importance.<a name=245:18></a> The epistle to the Philippians is full of "I" and "me".<a name=245:19></a> They occur about ninety times; no one could write like that unless he were entirely free of himself.<a name=245:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>there are the "I" and "me" of self-occupation, but in Philippians it is the "I" and "me" of a man in Christ.<a name=245:21></a> It is because Paul is a man in Christ and is conscious of it that he can say "I" and "me" freely without thinking of himself at all.<a name=245:22></a> How blessed to identify ourselves with the man

		AN ADDRESS AT BATH 20 NOVEMBER 1902<BR>THINGS WHICH PROMOTE SPIRITUAL GROWTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:1">1 Thessalonians  1:1</a> - 10
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there is something very interesting in the two epistles to the Thessalonians in the fact of their being addressed to young believers.<a name=275:1></a> Indeed, as far as we can judge, they had only been converted some few weeks when the apostle wrote this to them, and having just come out of heathendom, they needed to be addressed in the simplest form, and thus we need not feel that these epistles are over our heads.<a name=275:2></a> Though only "babes in Christ", yet it is evident what great joy these believers gave to the heart of the apostle (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:19">1 Thessalonians  2:19</a>, 20), even though there might be much lacking in their faith (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:10">1 Thessalonians  3:10</a>).<a name=275:3></a> And how was this?<a name=275:4></a> Well, look at verse 7, "So that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia".<a name=275:5></a> That is, they were models, setting forth in themselves the effect of the grace of God in their hearts and lives.<a name=275:6></a> They might be very small in the eyes of men but they were very pleasing to the apostle and to the Lord.<a name=275:7></a> I desire to press this most earnestly, that these dear saints though small and feeble yet were true to what they had.<a name=275:8></a> It is no manner of use for us to be trying to acquire more light unless we are walking in that which we have.<a name=275:9></a> These dear saints were so walking in the power of the truth they had received that they are the only church addressed as "In God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=275:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The very style of the address should show us how far they had got on.<a name=275:11></a> It means that their souls were established in the knowledge of God the Father in the grace known in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His beloved Son.<a name=276:1></a> It is the gospel which, if received in power, brings this knowledge of God in supreme grace.<a name=276:2></a> Beloved friends, have we got so far?<a name=276:3></a> Do we know God as the God of all grace, the One who is not demanding from us, but ready to supply us through His beloved Son so that we might stand firm in grace?<a name=276:4></a> What a bulwark this would be to our souls and so attractive, too, to our hearts!<a name=276:5></a> If it were so to these poor heathen, what should it not be to us?<a name=276:6></a> It turned them to God from idols.<a name=276:7></a> It is an immense thing to see God in this way.<a name=276:8></a> If I look at myself, I am only a poor sinner, blind, at enmity, dead, but God says, 'I will take away all that hinders and bring in all that is in my heart, so that you may know Me as the God of all grace'.<a name=276:9></a> It is a wonderful thing that the Holy Spirit can address them as "in God the Father" so that, like the prodigal, they knew the heart of God and could bear witness, as they did, to His grace.<a name=276:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing --  "and in the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=276:11></a> Paul was accused at Thessalonica of turning the world upside down and preaching another King.<a name=276:12></a> Jesus might be derided by men, but Paul knew Him as the King of glory.<a name=276:13></a> It is a wonderful thing to know what is behind the scenes.<a name=276:14></a> Men are altogether taken up with and greatly agitated about things here, but before God kingdoms and nations and all things down here are absolutely as nothing.<a name=276:15></a> God is behind the scenes and all for Him is contained in that blessed Man at His right hand.<a name=276:16></a> If you have received any blessing at all you have received it through that Man.<a name=276:17></a> God has set Him as administrator of all the grace and blessing He has for men, and that Man is announced as the One in whom not only are we blessed, but who is to give effect to all God's pleasure with regard to this world.<a name=276:18></a> Then indeed He will turn the world upside down.<a name=276:19></a> The effect on the Thessalonians of seeing behind the scenes was that they were able to turn their backs on the world, its politics and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=277>[Page 277]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		its religion and to wait for God's Son from heaven.<a name=277:1></a> They were able to stand in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=277:2></a> Christianity is the knowledge of God in grace and of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Man through whom all God's purposes will come in and be made good.<a name=277:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing, the moment you come to this there are certain effects produced --  you have spiritual faculties.<a name=277:4></a> A child is born with all its faculties but they need developing by exercise, and so it is with the child of God.<a name=277:5></a> It was so with the Thessalonians; they had all their faculties developed by exercise and this epistle was written to put them in the right way to exercise their spiritual faculties.<a name=277:6></a> And now what are these spiritual faculties?<a name=277:7></a> Verse 3 tells us, "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father".<a name=277:8></a> Faith, love and hope are our spiritual faculties and the Thessalonians did not seek to exercise their natural senses in these things.<a name=277:9></a> It would be no good, for we receive spiritual faculties for spiritual things.<a name=277:10></a> The whole of the epistle shows how these faculties are to be exercised, so that they may grow and develop; if not we shall become spiritually dwarfed and not be for the pleasure of God.<a name=277:11></a> No matter how fond the parents of a new-born babe may be of their child, they expect it to grow and develop mentally and physically, and thus it is with the one who is born of God; God looks for the spiritual faculties to come into play and thus we grow and develop and are to His pleasure.<a name=277:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to speak a little on each of these points and trust all will be interested because, if believers, we all have them in some degree.<a name=277:13></a> First, as to the work of faith, we find this
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=278>[Page 278]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		brought before us very distinctly in chapter 2, verses 11 and 12: "As ye know how, as a father his own children, we used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify, that ye should walk worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory".<a name=278:1></a> Faith is the light of the knowledge of God in my soul.<a name=278:2></a> The effect is that everything takes a new character, it becomes the desire of the saint to walk worthy of God.<a name=278:3></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>gives us a wonderful account of the work of faith, "For in the power of this the elders have obtained testimony" (verse 2).<a name=278:4></a> Beloved friends, would you not like that?<a name=278:5></a> Well, these men did, each according to his measure, and with us today it should be our great exercise of faith to be in correspondence with that which we have received.<a name=278:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How does this work?<a name=278:7></a> Let us look at <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17">Genesis  17</a>, verse 1 -- "Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him, I am the Almighty God: walk before my face, and be perfect".<a name=278:8></a> This is the perfection of the pilgrim walk.<a name=278:9></a> If we have tasted grace we are in a position to walk before God and we see this come out in Abraham in chapter 24, verse 40, where he could say, "Jehovah, before whom I have walked".<a name=278:10></a> That is the work of faith.<a name=278:11></a> What a contrast we find in Jacob as he neared his end, after his life of plotting and scheming, seeking in unbelief to bring about God's promises by his own efforts!<a name=278:12></a> He could not speak thus of himself, though he could say, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God that shepherded me all my life long to this day", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48:15">Genesis  48:15</a>.<a name=278:13></a> Think of this for it is quite possible for us to miss this blessed path as he did.<a name=278:14></a> He was obliged to say, "Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#47:9">Genesis  47:9</a>.<a name=278:15></a> Why was this?<a name=278:16></a> It need not have been for at the outset God had revealed Himself to him in such a way that he might have walked before Him as did his fathers.<a name=278:17></a> The work of faith is that which keeps us in the presence of God and lets God come into
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=279>[Page 279]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		everything connected with our path down here.<a name=279:1></a> Instead of this, how often we find that we walk before men or even before our brethren and that we prefer anything rather than to walk before God.<a name=279:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to another side of the work of faith (see <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:22">Genesis  5:22</a> - 24).<a name=279:3></a> "Enoch walked with God", and again, "Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him".<a name=279:4></a> This is not the pilgrim life as Abraham's, but rather the life of privilege.<a name=279:5></a> The work of faith is to cultivate a life of divine privilege.<a name=279:6></a> Nothing could be more remarkable than that Enoch walked with God under the circumstances in which he lived.<a name=279:7></a> If we look at the line of Cain, the man of the world, we find the seventh from him was Lemech, in whose time the world began to be very attractive.<a name=279:8></a> The arts, amusements, manufactures and so on occupied man's mind, but God says, as it were, 'I will have a man superior to all that system of things, in whom I can find the work of faith'.<a name=279:9></a> So we find that (though death had come in by sin) only one man had as yet died, not an adequate witness to man's condition.<a name=279:10></a> But Enoch lived in a sphere that death could not touch.<a name=279:11></a> It is a most wonderful thing to find a man who so walked with God that he had faith to be translated (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>).<a name=279:12></a> He was the first man who tasted eternal life down here, and was superior to the world system around and to death as the judgment of God.<a name=279:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God does the same with us; He renders us superior to the world by putting us in the light, and we are so brought into the secret things of God that we enter into and enjoy things which death cannot touch.<a name=279:14></a> But for this I must first be right as to the pilgrim life; then comes the life of privilege.<a name=279:15></a> I am brought out of the scene of death into the scene of eternal life in His Son.<a name=279:16></a> How wonderful to find Enoch so in the enjoyment of these things that his translation was morally appropriate.<a name=279:17></a> He leaves the world and goes on walking with God.<a name=279:18></a> The apostle in writing to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=280>[Page 280]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thessalonians beseeches them to walk so as to please God and to be superior to the world, so as to be in moral preparedness for being "caught up" like Enoch, as we get it in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>.<a name=280:1></a> Let us remember that the pilgrim life is before God, so that we may walk with God in the life of privilege until the Lord descends and we are translated and set down for ever in the presence of divine love.<a name=280:2></a> May we be exercised that we should be working out these things in faith.<a name=280:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly we come to the "labour of love".<a name=280:4></a> The work of faith puts us right in relation to God and the labour of love puts us right in regard of our brethren, for it leads in the direction of holiness and thus tends to unity.<a name=280:5></a> There is a moral order in christianity which we should be very careful to observe.<a name=280:6></a> As we have seen, the work of faith comes before the labour of love.<a name=280:7></a> The latter, as we see in chapter 3, verse 13, is "in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father", and mark, holiness is essential to unity.<a name=280:8></a> If I do not see this, I have not understood the great place that the unity of the saints has in the mind of God the Father and the Son.<a name=280:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>we hear the voice of divine love and the burden of the chapter is that the saints may be kept from evil and sanctified through the truth in view of unity, "that they may be all one".<a name=280:10></a> The labour of love is to be on this line; we should be labouring in order to promote holiness with a view to unity.<a name=280:11></a> The want of holiness is the reason why there is so little unity.<a name=280:12></a> We cannot be too sensitive as to this --  just as a bit of grit in the eye hinders the normal action of the whole organ until it is removed, so we should be so walking in holiness and self-judgment that all should be set aside in us that hinders the flow of divine love.<a name=280:13></a> Why are not all christians walking in unity here in Bath?<a name=280:14></a> For want of holiness.<a name=280:15></a> We should be so in the energy of divine love that everything should go that is not of Christ or of God.<a name=280:16></a> If
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=281>[Page 281]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all were willing as to this there would very soon be the christian company walking in unity.<a name=281:1></a> It must be so, for nothing else would be left but a perfectly lovely company, the body of Christ.<a name=281:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, God puts us on that line and we should be labouring for it, as they were doing to all in Macedonia (chapter 4: 10), but was that enough?<a name=281:3></a> No!<a name=281:4></a>  --  they were "to abound still more".<a name=281:5></a> Paul was insatiable as to this.<a name=281:6></a> May God enable us to set aside all that hinders.<a name=281:7></a> Paul, in writing to the Ephesians says, "I .<a name=281:8></a>.<a name=281:9></a>.<a name=281:10></a> exhort you" (chapter 4: 1).<a name=281:11></a> This chapter sets forth the labour of love, and it is not an altogether easy thing; you must give your mind to it "with all" (not some) "lowliness and meekness".<a name=281:12></a> There must be no self-assertion, and thus far it is a question of yourself.<a name=281:13></a> Then comes the outward thing, "bearing with one another in love; using diligence" (that is labouring) "to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:2">Ephesians  4:2</a>, 3) and that with every saint in this world, no less a circle.<a name=281:14></a> If others do not, you must.<a name=281:15></a> We find the blessed Lord is labouring to this end (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>), first in the love that gave Himself for the church, then working for the sanctification of it, and then comes the result, unity, one united company, no discord.<a name=281:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved friends, are we working in this direction to promote the love of Christ in the company?<a name=281:17></a> If so, you will not tolerate anything that hinders in yourself and you will not tolerate it in others; you will seek to wash their feet.<a name=281:18></a> How?<a name=281:19></a> By a ministry of Christ, by being an expression of Christ.<a name=281:20></a> I would rather exhibit a little bit of Christ than say a lot about Him.<a name=281:21></a> If our labour of love is to be effective we must be more and more in the company of Christ so as to come out in His spirit and character and thus help the whole church.<a name=281:22></a> What!<a name=281:23></a> you say, can I do this?<a name=281:24></a> Yes; through the ministry and expression of Christ, and this is the labour of love.<a name=281:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=282>[Page 282]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the third point, namely, the "constancy of hope".<a name=282:1></a> If we are right with God through the work of faith and with our brethren through the labour of love we are morally prepared and free to look up in the "constancy of hope", because we know what God has treasured up in Christ, the joy and blessing He has up there, ready to burst forth and illuminate the entire universe.<a name=282:2></a> We find often a great difference between many of the saints nowadays and these Thessalonian saints.<a name=282:3></a> The christian is now more often occupied with the thought 'I am going there' than with the thought of the glory that is coming from there.<a name=282:4></a> The constancy of hope would correct all this and keep one looking up in expectancy of all that is coming out and thus separate from the world, the whole system of things down here, which is all about to be done away.<a name=282:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All here is night and darkness; people may talk of the progress of science and the march of civilisation, but in the sight of God what is it all worth, and what is the effect of it morally on people down here?<a name=282:6></a> Are children more obedient to their parents?<a name=282:7></a> Is the love of God entering the heart?<a name=282:8></a> No!<a name=282:9></a> Look at what christendom is doing?<a name=282:10></a> With all the outward profession of christianity, men are unceasingly occupied in creating huge armies and navies, such as the world has never seen before, with the object of robbing, destroying and ruining one another.<a name=282:11></a> And is this done in the dark?<a name=282:12></a> By no means.<a name=282:13></a> People tell you that these are necessary things, that the world could not go on without them.<a name=282:14></a> Does this not show that it is the night according to God?<a name=282:15></a> But oh!<a name=282:16></a> the day is going to dawn.<a name=282:17></a> The Prince of peace is about to reign and bring the glory of God into this world.<a name=282:18></a> Are we rejoicing in the hope of it?<a name=282:19></a> We do not want to have anything whatever to do with the world, either its politics, pleasures or religion.<a name=282:20></a> Oh, what a wonderful place we are put in if by the work of faith we are walking before God and with God,

		C.A.<a name=346:24></a>C.<a name=346:25></a> Philemon would be pleased to be called a partner of Paul.<a name=346:26></a> Well, Paul says, "Receive him as me", that is, now you take him as a partner.<a name=346:27></a> That was one of the features he was to share, it is the word for fellowship; he comes in as a partner of the firm.<a name=346:28></a> I have sometimes asked those desiring fellowship how much capital they proposed to bring into the firm.<a name=346:29></a> It is one of the first questions asked in the case of proposed partnership.<a name=346:30></a> Now everyone who asks for fellowship should think of that, and not only what they will gain.<a name=346:31></a> If we go into partnership we contribute something and we draw a dividend accordingly.<a name=346:32></a> Onesimus still remains on the social side a slave, though on the spiritual side he was put on a common platform with his master, though I do not suppose he ever presumed on it.<a name=346:33></a>

		Scripture does not record it, I believe he was liberated (tradition says so), which shows we can pray for things that are very unlikely.<a name=348:1></a> This would encourage us to pray for a cessation of present distressing happenings.<a name=348:2></a> The Father is in control of things in the world and He only allows the power of evil and destruction to go so far; He does not allow it to go beyond a certain point.<a name=348:3></a> And He never forgets the saints are here, and so they are wonderfully preserved, and there is such tender thought with it; the Lord says to the saints, "Pray that your flight may not be in winter time", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:20">Matthew  24:20</a>.<a name=348:4></a> He enters into such things.<a name=348:5></a> The prophetic period of one thousand two hundred and sixty days will never run its full course.<a name=348:6></a> If God can cut short His own prophetic periods, He can cut short anything!<a name=348:7></a>
