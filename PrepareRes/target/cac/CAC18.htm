		THE HOUSE OF GOD AS MADE KNOWN TO JACOB

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is on my mind to bring before you, so far as I am able, some of the important and blessed things connected with the House of God.<a name=5:1></a> No one can read Scripture without seeing that the House of God is prominent both in the Old Testament and the New.<a name=5:2></a> It is most important to see that God has a place on earth.<a name=5:3></a> We all understand that heaven is God's throne and dwelling place, but what I should like to make clear is that God has a place on earth where He dwells in grace and blessing and, I may add, in holiness.<a name=5:4></a> He has a place on earth where He is known, and where His testimony is maintained.<a name=5:5></a> The House of God is "the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passages we have read contain the first intimation that Scripture affords of the House of God.<a name=5:7></a> It has often been said that in connection with the first mention of anything in Scripture we get a key to the whole subject, and I have no doubt it is so in this case.<a name=5:8></a> But before looking at these scriptures it may be well to travel rapidly over the previous chapters of Genesis.<a name=5:9></a> They are deeply important and instructive.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the fall to the flood we do not get any thought of God having a place here.<a name=5:11></a> Man had been driven out from the garden of Eden, and the cherubim with flaming sword barred his access to the tree of life.<a name=5:12></a> The earth was under the curse in consequence of man's sin, and man was a fugitive and a vagabond in it.<a name=5:13></a> What marked the men of faith in that day

	<div class="paragraph">
		was that they "walked with God".<a name=6:1></a> This is said of both Enoch and Noah.<a name=6:2></a> They recognised that God had no place here, and they walked with Him apart from the whole course of things in the world of the ungodly.<a name=6:3></a> Noah preached righteousness and in building the ark was a practical witness of coming judgment.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The flood came and swept away the world that then was.<a name=6:5></a> There was an end before God of the whole state of the world, and of all flesh.<a name=6:6></a> Noah and his family were saved in the ark -- a figure of the death of Christ -- and the first thing that he did when he stepped out of the ark was to build an altar and offer burnt offerings upon it (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:18">Genesis  8:18</a> - 22).<a name=6:7></a> This is the first altar of which we read in Scripture, and I understand Noah's act to mean that he claimed the earth for God, and put it on the ground of the burnt offering.<a name=6:8></a> The flood had come upon the earth as under the curse; there was, so to speak, an end of that order of things; and the earth was presented before God in connection with the sweet savour of the burnt offering.<a name=6:9></a> (I need hardly say that the burnt offering is a type of the death of Christ.<a name=6:10></a>) God smelled an odour of rest and said in His heart that He would not "curse the ground any more for man's sake".<a name=6:11></a> He answers the faith in which Noah had claimed the earth for Him, and takes up relations with it.<a name=6:12></a> He promises that "While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease".<a name=6:13></a> He covenants blessing for the earth, and every living creature upon it.<a name=6:14></a> God is the "Lord of all the earth" -- a title which occurs again and again in Scripture (see <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3:11">Joshua  3:11</a>; <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#4:14">Zechariah  4:14</a>; <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:5">Zechariah  6:5</a>, etc.<a name=6:15></a>, and compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8:1">Psalm  8:1</a>, 9, and <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:5">Exodus  19:5</a>).<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt the full answer to Noah's faith will be in the world to come.<a name=6:17></a> There is a day coming when all the effects of the curse will be removed, everything on earth will be put into covenant relationship with God, and His Name will be excellent in all the earth.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time for this had not come in Noah's day, nor has it come yet.<a name=7:1></a> From <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8">Genesis  8</a>onward, faith has ever claimed the earth for God, but the time has not come yet for Him to take possession.<a name=7:2></a> In His dispensational and governmental ways, and in view of all His purposes of love and grace, He has not yet taken possession.<a name=7:3></a> The present world is accurately pictured in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:11">Genesis  9:11</a>.<a name=7:4></a> Three things are prominent.<a name=7:5></a> Nimrod "began to be a mighty one in the earth", and founded a kingdom.<a name=7:6></a> Then men built the tower of Babel, saying, "Let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth".<a name=7:7></a> Men took possession of the earth, and sought to make themselves a name.<a name=7:8></a> And, what was worst of all, God's servant, who in faith had claimed the earth for Him, failed to hold it for Him, but used it for self-gratification.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Alas!<a name=7:10></a> this is very much the history of the present world.<a name=7:11></a> It is the time of Nimrod and Babel still.<a name=7:12></a> Men are in possession of the earth, and hence it is a scene of confusion.<a name=7:13></a> And as for God's witness, Noah's failure is perpetuated in the church.<a name=7:14></a> The things of the earth are used for self-gratification instead of being held for God.<a name=7:15></a> I speak, of course, of the general Christian profession.<a name=7:16></a> God's Name is not yet excellent in all the earth, but it will be in the world to come.<a name=7:17></a> It has been a characteristic of faith in all ages to look on to the world to come.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then God maintains His title to the earth and His right to dispose of it as He will, in the call and blessing of Abram.<a name=7:19></a> "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:1">Genesis  12:1</a>).<a name=7:20></a> And when Abram reached Canaan the Lord appeared to him, and said, "Unto thy seed will I give this land" (verse 7).<a name=7:21></a> Depend upon it that in due time God will dispose of the earth as He will, in spite of men and of all the power of evil.<a name=7:22></a> And when He does so there will be blessing for all the families of the earth (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:3">Genesis  12:3</a>).<a name=7:23></a> When man in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		self-will takes possession of the earth he dispossesses God of all His rights; but when God asserts Himself and takes possession of the earth He will give it to man, and fill it with blessing, so that His Name may be excellent in all the earth.<a name=8:1></a> See the promises to Abraham and Isaac in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:1">Genesis  12:1</a> - 7; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#13:14">Genesis  13:14</a> - 17; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:7">Genesis  15:7</a>, 8, 18 - 21; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:8">Genesis  17:8</a>; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:18">Genesis  18:18</a>; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:17">Genesis  22:17</a>, 18; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26:2">Genesis  26:2</a> - 4.<a name=8:2></a> In making Abraham "heir of the world" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:13">Romans  4:13</a>), God asserted His right to dispose of the earth as He would.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in connection with Isaac we get wonderful instruction as to the way in which the promises will be fulfilled.<a name=8:4></a> Isaac was to be the heir -- the child of promise -- type of Christ.<a name=8:5></a> And it was on the ground of death and resurrection that He would take the inheritance.<a name=8:6></a> In figure Isaac died and rose again.<a name=8:7></a> God can only take possession of the earth so as to fill it with blessing on the ground of death and resurrection.<a name=8:8></a> Sin had to be put away, which could only be by death, and the power of death had to be broken, which could only be by resurrection.<a name=8:9></a> But on the ground of death and in the power of resurrection Christ will take up the earth -- so long filled with man's assumption and sin's confusion -- and will fill it with blessing and with the knowledge of God.<a name=8:10></a> When Christ takes up the inheritance all the families of the earth will be blessed and God's Name will be excellent in all the earth.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham was called to be the heir of the world in faith, but to be actually possessed of no part of the promised inheritance.<a name=8:12></a> He owned God as being "the God of the earth" as well as "the God of heaven", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:3">Genesis  24:3</a>; he had the blessing of "the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14:19">Genesis  14:19</a>, 22.<a name=8:13></a> Though he had actually nothing, he was blessed in the favour that would give him everything.<a name=8:14></a> In the sense of this favour he was content, though he knew well that there could be no possession of the promised inheritance until the world to come.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to chapter 28 we see God making known to Jacob His purpose about the land and about the blessing of all the families of the earth.<a name=9:1></a> Jacob finds himself in the presence of God's grace and faithfulness -- in presence of God's thoughts and purposes in all their blessed reality.<a name=9:2></a> He was, in a sense, outside the world, and for the time, apart from all the workings of his own mind.<a name=9:3></a> Everything that passed before him was of God.<a name=9:4></a> Hence he said, "This is none other but the house of God".<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one way Jacob went beyond Abraham and Isaac.<a name=9:6></a> No doubt they held in faith the divine communications which had been made to them, and those communications formed the ground of their intercourse with God.<a name=9:7></a> They built altars, but Jacob went further -- he set up a pillar.<a name=9:8></a> God, revealed in grace and faithfulness, was to have a place here -- a testimony here -- and this in figure, in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=9:9></a> "He set up a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.<a name=9:10></a> And he called the name of that place Bethel [the House of God]".<a name=9:11></a> A pillar means witness or testimony (see <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#31:52">Genesis  31:52</a>).<a name=9:12></a> There was to be a place here for God -- a witness to the blessed reality of His grace and faithfulness.<a name=9:13></a> He was God of heaven and earth, and He would carry out His own purposes of grace and blessing in spite of all the evil and weakness that was in the world and in man.<a name=9:14></a> The anointed pillar was the witness of this on earth.<a name=9:15></a> It was the testimony of God here -- the witness of His purposes, His grace, and His faithfulness.<a name=9:16></a> And thus it presents to us the great fundamental idea of the House of God, God has a place here where He dwells in blessing and testimony; His house is here.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see three things in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>in connection with Bethel which give us a very good idea of the House of God.<a name=9:18></a> In the first place a link was established between heaven and earth.<a name=9:19></a> The House of God has a direct link with heaven; it is the "gate of heaven".<a name=9:20></a> God in this way makes the gate of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heaven accessible to men; that gate is not a long way off; it is here on earth.<a name=10:1></a> In Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple, over and over again he said, "When they shall pray toward this place .<a name=10:2></a>.<a name=10:3></a>.<a name=10:4></a> hear thou in heaven" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8:30">1 Kings  8:30</a>, 32, 34, 36, 39, 43, 45, 49).<a name=10:5></a> In that day the House of God was the gate of heaven -- the link between heaven and earth.<a name=10:6></a> It will be so again in the millennium.<a name=10:7></a> All the families of the earth will go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and the House of God will be to them the gate of heaven.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not want to occupy you merely with the past and the future.<a name=10:9></a> I should like you to realise that the House of God is on earth at the present moment, and that it is the gate of heaven.<a name=10:10></a> Read <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:1">Acts  2:1</a> - 4.<a name=10:11></a> The House of God in its present aspect dates from the day of Pentecost.<a name=10:12></a> The one hundred and twenty disciples, indwelt by the Spirit, were constituted the House or dwelling place of God.<a name=10:13></a> The Holy Ghost came upon them from heaven -- from a risen and glorified Christ at the right hand of God -- and linked them with heaven.<a name=10:14></a> There was a company upon earth linked with heaven in the most wonderful way.<a name=10:15></a> But that company is still here; the Holy Ghost has never returned to heaven; the saints have never ceased to be the House of God.<a name=10:16></a> When one receives the Holy Ghost -- consequent on remission of sins through faith in the Lord Jesus -- he belongs to a company which is divinely linked with heaven.<a name=10:17></a> He may have everything yet to learn, but he is of the House of God, and the sooner he realises this the better.<a name=10:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a blessed reality that heaven and earth are linked together by the fact that the House of God is upon the earth.<a name=10:19></a> In Stephen we see that a man full of the Holy Ghost could look up stedfastly into heaven; there was no cloud between him and heaven.<a name=10:20></a> By the Spirit we can look up into heaven and see there a glorified Man -- the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself for us.<a name=10:21></a> The Holy Ghost links us with
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heaven and with the One who is there.<a name=11:1></a> Is it not wonderful to see that there is that upon earth which is directly linked with heaven?<a name=11:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope no one will suppose that in speaking of the House of God I have any thought of applying this term to a material building, or even to any particular company of saints.<a name=11:3></a> The House of God is composed of "living stones", and every saint on earth indwelt by the Spirit is of that house.<a name=11:4></a> Would to God that we all understood this, -- and were more exercised as to our behaviour in "the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth!<a name=11:5></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing in connection with Bethel (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>) is that God's grace and faithfulness were known there.<a name=11:7></a> "I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed .<a name=11:8></a>.<a name=11:9></a>.<a name=11:10></a> and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed".<a name=11:11></a> I quite admit that what is said here does not go beyond the earth, but it is wonderful grace.<a name=11:12></a> For us everything takes a higher character, for we have to do with "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>).<a name=11:13></a> It is not "the land whereon thou liest" now, but God directs our eyes to heaven and to His treasured store of spiritual blessings in Christ.<a name=11:14></a> Who can measure the expanse of those blessings?<a name=11:15></a> "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:20">2 Corinthians  1:20</a>).<a name=11:16></a> What transcendent grace to man, who was once persuaded by the devil to believe that God was withholding something good from him!<a name=11:17></a> God answers that lie of Eden by bringing in all the blessing of a universe of bliss in Christ and bestowing it as a free gift upon man.<a name=11:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then God's faithfulness was known at Bethel as well as His grace.<a name=11:19></a> "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of" (verse 15).<a name=12:1></a> Along with the unconditional promise of grace there was the assurance of God's immutable faithfulness.<a name=12:2></a> All that Jacob would do and be was well known to God, but in presence of all that God's faithfulness was made known as the security of his blessing.<a name=12:3></a> It is a great characteristic of the House of God that His grace and faithfulness are known there.<a name=12:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you turn to <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8">1 Kings  8</a>you will see these two things in connection with the house that Solomon built.<a name=12:5></a> Read verse 41 - 43.<a name=12:6></a> This is a remarkable scripture for Old Testament times, for it contemplates the report of God's Name going out from the house to all people of the earth, so that "the stranger" should come out of a "far country" attracted by that blessed Name.<a name=12:7></a> It shows how God would have the testimony of His Name as great in grace to sound forth from His house.<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the thought of God's faithfulness is also very prominent in Solomon's prayer.<a name=12:9></a> Read verse 15, 20, 23, 24, 56.<a name=12:10></a> Everything of which God had spoken had come to pass.<a name=12:11></a> The house was the standing witness to the faithfulness of God.<a name=12:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn to the House of God in its present aspect.<a name=12:13></a> Read <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:4">1 Corinthians  1:4</a> - 9.<a name=12:14></a> The apostle is writing to "the church of God which is at Corinth", and we know from another scripture that the church of the living God is the House of God.<a name=12:15></a> He first thanks God for His grace given to the saints in Christ Jesus, that in everything they had been enriched in Him, and that the testimony of Christ was confirmed in them.<a name=12:16></a> They were in the blessed knowledge of the grace of God, and the testimony of that grace was confirmed in them.<a name=12:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he also speaks of the faithfulness of God.<a name=12:18></a> They were proving themselves very unfaithful to the grace and light which had reached them, but the apostle fell back upon divine faithfulness as the security of their blessing.<a name=12:19></a> He speaks of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		their being confirmed to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=13:1></a> If we believe not, God abides faithful; He does not give up His thoughts with regard to His saints.<a name=13:2></a> If we are self-willed and wayward we shall come under the faithful discipline of God.<a name=13:3></a> Jacob went on in his own course for a long time, but he had to suffer for it under God's discipline until eventually he was prepared to return to Bethel.<a name=13:4></a> God is faithful; He will bring His saints -- it may be through much discipline -- to His own end.<a name=13:5></a> He will divest them of all that is unsuitable to Himself so that they may be blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=13:6></a> If our every blessing springs -- as it surely does -- from grace, our security and preservation in those blessings is altogether of the faithfulness of God.<a name=13:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third thing in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>to which I desire to call your attention is that, in figure, what God had made known of Himself was set up here in testimony.<a name=13:8></a> Jacob set up a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it, and called the name of that place Bethel -- i.<a name=13:9></a>e.<a name=13:10></a>, the House of God.<a name=13:11></a> This was surely figurative of the testimony of God's grace and faithfulness being set up on earth in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=13:12></a> We have seen that Solomon's temple was intended to be the testimony of God's grace and faithfulness for all the nations of the earth.<a name=13:13></a> And if we turn to Christianity we find how very characteristic this is of the House of God today.<a name=13:14></a> Read <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:1">1 Timothy  2:1</a> - 7; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>; <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:12">2 Timothy  1:12</a>; <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:13">2 Timothy  2:13</a>, 19.<a name=13:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in these scriptures how the testimony of God's grace and faithfulness is in His house today.<a name=13:16></a> The testimony of God as a Saviour God is in His house, and it sounds forth from that house that He will have all men to be saved.<a name=13:17></a> God is dwelling here in infinite grace to men, so that in His house prayers are made for all men.<a name=13:18></a> Spite of man's wickedness and sin's confusion God has a pillar here -- the testimony which is maintained in the power of His Spirit, and which not all the power of evil can overturn.<a name=13:19></a> Is it not an unspeakable
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=14>[Page 14]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		privilege to be part of that testimony, through His infinite grace?<a name=14:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the second epistle the last days are contemplated -- times of declension, departure, and even apostasy.<a name=14:2></a> In presence of all this, divine faithfulness becomes the bulwark and security of the believer, and of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=14:3></a> The testimony of God's grace and faithfulness is here, and it will be here so long as there are saints on earth indwelt by God's Spirit.<a name=14:4></a> No power of evil can overturn God's pillar.<a name=14:5></a> The House of God "is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth".<a name=14:6></a> May each one of us get a deeper sense of the blessedness of being identified with this holy testimony!<a name=14:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now just a few words in conclusion, about Jacob!<a name=14:8></a> He got the light of God's house, but for a long time he was not very much affected practically by it.<a name=14:9></a> He went down to Padan-Aram, and served there for his wives and his cattle.<a name=14:10></a> He was preserved and became fruitful there.<a name=14:11></a> God did not leave him, but fed him all his life long, as he said at the end (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48:15">Genesis  48:15</a>).<a name=14:12></a> But, though prospered and cared for by God, he was a long way from the pillar which he had anointed.<a name=14:13></a> He was building up his own house, and not thinking much of God's house.<a name=14:14></a> It is one thing to be fed and cared for by God, and another to be near the pillar -- to be identified wholly in heart and ways with God's testimony, that is, with God's house.<a name=14:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is food.<a name=22:7></a> And it seems to me that two thoughts are suggested to us here -- contemplation and appropriation.<a name=22:8></a> They had to take a lamb on the tenth day and keep it up till the fourteenth day.<a name=22:9></a> The lamb without blemish was first the object of their contemplation, and then as roast with fire it became their food.<a name=22:10></a> It is a wonderful thing to contemplate the Lord Jesus as the Holy One of God, the Lamb without blemish and without spot, the One foreordained before the foundation of the world.<a name=22:11></a> Then we appropriate Him as having come under judgment on our behalf.<a name=22:12></a> "Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire".<a name=22:13></a> We feed upon Christ as the One who came in deep divine love under holy judgment for us.<a name=22:14></a> He alone could sustain that judgment, and because He has done so the very judgment to which we are exposed has become the evidence to us of the love of Christ, for He has endured and exhausted it.<a name=22:15></a> We can never disconnect the thought of the judgment from the divine Person who bore it in the greatness of His love.<a name=22:16></a> The judgment of God upon sin is infinite, but Christ has borne it in love that He might become the food of our hearts.<a name=22:17></a> God would have us to be nourished upon the love of Christ.<a name=22:18></a> Whenever God means to put people in motion He always feeds them first (see <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#19:5">1 Kings  19:5</a> - 8; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a> - 13).<a name=22:19></a> We need to be nourished -- to have our spiritual affections sustained and invigorated by the knowledge of Christ in the blessed love in which He came under

	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to the thought of divine instruction.<a name=23:9></a> "The blood shall be to you for a token".<a name=23:10></a> Not only does the blood shelter me but it speaks to me.<a name=23:11></a> The blood of Jesus speaks volumes.<a name=23:12></a> The words, "When I see the blood I will pass over you", are often commented upon, but there is another side -- "The blood shall be to you for a token".<a name=23:13></a> The blood is a token of certain things to us.<a name=23:14></a> God would have the death of Jesus to speak to us volumes of divine instruction.<a name=23:15></a> I cannot dwell upon it -- it is a great subject in itself -- but I may say that there are three things of which the blood is a token to me.<a name=23:16></a> First, that I am under death; second, that the grace of God has reached me there; and, third, that divine righteousness is in my favour.<a name=23:17></a> Our souls need to be instructed in the blessed reality of these things.<a name=23:18></a>

		All this is most important in connection with the subject of the House of God.<a name=26:5></a> Salvation is in view of the House of God, for immediately after they had said, "The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation", they went on to say, "I will prepare him a habitation".<a name=26:6></a> It is so also in other parts of scripture.<a name=26:7></a> For example, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27">Psalm  27</a>David says, "The Lord is my light and my salvation", and then he goes on to say, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in s temple".<a name=26:8></a> Again in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>God says, "I will also clothe her priests with salvation".<a name=26:9></a> And in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61:10">Isaiah  61:10</a>, where we read, "He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation", the same verse speaks of being decked as a priest [margin].<a name=26:10></a> This shows how intimately salvation is connection with priesthood; that is with the privileges and service of the House of God.<a name=26:11></a> Salvation is the garment that fits one for priestly service, and I think it would be right to say that salvation is enjoyed in the House of God.<a name=26:12></a> We come into the House of God in the beauty of God's salvation and enjoy the blessedness of a circle which is morally far removed from sin, the world, and Satan's power.<a name=26:13></a> Salvation is the moral beauty of saints in which they are suited to the habitation of God's holiness.<a name=26:14></a> It is written that "The Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#149:4">Psalm  149:4</a>).<a name=26:15></a>

		It is very interesting to see that in God's mind all the people were to be "a kingdom of priests".<a name=30:5></a> The thought of a special priestly family came in subsequently after the failure of the people, but God's mind was to have "a kingdom of priests".<a name=30:6></a> And it seems to me that it was from that point of view that God regarded the people when He said, "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:8">Exodus  25:8</a>).<a name=30:7></a> It was His mind to dwell among a kingdom of priests.<a name=30:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that strikes one in connection with the tabernacle is that all the material was given by the people, and all was directly connected with their affections.<a name=30:9></a> "Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:2">Exodus  25:2</a>).<a name=30:10></a> All the precious things which they were to bring represented, I suppose, the preciousness of Christ as known in the hearts of the saints by God's blessed work in them.<a name=30:11></a> This becomes the material for the house, if we may so speak.<a name=30:12></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:7">1 Peter  2:7</a>, "To you therefore who believe is the preciousness".<a name=30:13></a> God puts the preciousness of Christ and the knowledge of Himself in the hearts of His saints, and it is thus really that they become living stones for His spiritual house.<a name=30:14></a> As Christ is built up in the souls of God's children there is divine material for the House of God.<a name=30:15></a> (Compare as to this <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:10">1 Corinthians  3:10</a> - 17).<a name=30:16></a>

		Looking at it in this way how appropriate to our lips are the words of David when he and the people presented their offerings for the temple!<a name=31:6></a> "Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.<a name=31:7></a> But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?<a name=31:8></a> for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:13">1 Chronicles  29:13</a>, 14).<a name=31:9></a> If God had not manifested Himself to us in grace, and made Christ to live in our affections by His Spirit, we could bring nothing to His house; it is of His own that we give Him.<a name=31:10></a> And every true saint is qualified, in measure, to contribute to the House of God.<a name=31:11></a> The youngest and the feeblest believer ought to entertain the thought of this.<a name=31:12></a> We must not think of the House of God in a material way but as a spiritual structure.<a name=31:13></a>

		Now I pass on to say a few words about the tabernacle, and in venturing to do so I may say that I have no thought of going into the types in detail, nor of speaking dogmatically on any point, for I feel that I have almost everything to learn on this subject.<a name=31:14></a> But I should like to suggest one or two thoughts which seem to have a place in connection with these interesting types.<a name=31:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things which I should like to remark upon.<a name=31:16></a> (1) The house itself; and (2) what it contained.<a name=31:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the house itself, it was composed of boards covered with gold and standing upon sockets of silver.<a name=31:18></a> (See <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#26:15">Exodus  26:15</a> - 30).<a name=31:19></a> This seems to intimate clearly that God's house stands on the basis of redemption, and that it is composed of those who are in Christ.<a name=31:20></a> No one can really understand

		his place in the House of God until he knows what it is to be set up on the ground of redemption and to be in Christ.<a name=32:1></a> The very basis of everything for our souls is that God has been glorified in the death of Christ about sin and sins; all that we were as in the flesh has been removed from before Him in holy judgment.<a name=32:2></a> Then, on the other hand, we are in Christ; our souls have come into the apprehension of Christ as our righteousness and our life; we can be near to God in the blessed consciousness of what Christ is made to us.<a name=32:3></a> The saint in all his relations with God realises that he is on a new footing altogether; he is on the footing of redemption and he is consciously in Christ.<a name=32:4></a> He is conscious that his righteousness, satisfaction, sanctification, and strength are not in himself but in another Man -- even in Christ.<a name=32:5></a> And "if any man be in Christ there is a new creation".<a name=32:6></a> God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a> - 21).<a name=32:7></a> This gives us in New Testament language the thought of the silver sockets and the covering of gold.<a name=32:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thus that the saints are qualified to be builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:22">Ephesians  2:22</a>).<a name=32:9></a> Note the words, "builded together!<a name=32:10></a>" The saints were never intended to be separate units, nor was it ever in the mind of God that they should be divided into great or small church systems.<a name=32:11></a> No natural dividing influence could be stronger than the difference between Jew and Gentile.<a name=32:12></a> But the great point in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>is that the Jew and the Gentile were "builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=32:13></a> Sectarianism is built up on the recognition of man in the flesh -- not on the silver sockets which speak of a holy work in which that man has been entirely set aside by God.<a name=32:14></a>

		the Spirit's testimony in the House of God.<a name=38:1></a> "He shall glorify me", was the Lord's word with reference to the coming of the Comforter.<a name=38:2></a> The candlestick was one thing, the seven lamps another, and, I may add, the light given was a third.<a name=38:3></a> For this latter was dependent on the service of the priests; it was their responsibility to maintain the light.<a name=38:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of Christ is in the House of God by the Spirit, and this is what I connect with the candlestick.<a name=38:5></a> It is a wonderful thing to remember that the testimony of Christ is here in spite of all Satan's efforts to dislodge it.<a name=38:6></a> The Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthians says, "I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; that in everything ye are enriched in him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you; so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 4 - 7).<a name=38:7></a> No one could say that the testimony of Christ was very bright at Corinth, but the saints there were God's assembly -- God's house -- and the testimony of Christ had been confirmed in them so that they came behind in no gift.<a name=38:8></a> The candlestick was there, so to speak, with all its vessels, but the lamps very much needed trimming.<a name=38:9></a> Fitness for priestly service was wanting and the lamps were burning very dimly.<a name=38:10></a> Paul had to use the golden snuffers in writing his first Epistle to Corinth!<a name=38:11></a> When he came to write the second it was more like pouring oil into the lamps!<a name=38:12></a> He was pouring into their hearts by the Spirit the blessed ministry of Christ well fitted to brighten all their souls in the testimony of Christ.<a name=38:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There had been a want of priestly care and priestly sensitiveness at Corinth, and the result was that, though the candlestick was there, the light was much obscured.<a name=38:14></a> The testimony of Christ remains still in the House of God, and saints get the light and gain of it in proportion as they walk in self-judgment and separation from evil.<a name=38:15></a> In Christendom

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The House of God is the place where the Holy Ghost glorifies Christ.<a name=39:3></a> The youngest believer ought to have the consciousness that he belongs to a circle where the Holy Ghost makes everything of Christ.<a name=39:4></a> We have to see to it that we do not grieve or quench the Spirit.<a name=39:5></a> Priestly sensitiveness and priestly exercise are needed.<a name=39:6></a>

		What is the testimony of the Christ?<a name=39:7></a> Well, it is the blessed witness in the power of the Spirit that everything for the pleasure of God and the blessing of men is established in Christ.<a name=39:8></a> Saints are in Christ Jesus, who is made wisdom to them from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.<a name=39:9></a> God has firmly attached His saints to Christ -- the One in whom all His promises are yea and Amen.<a name=39:10></a> He is bringing those taught of Himself to recognise that man after the flesh has no place with Him, but that Christ is everything, and in all.<a name=39:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To be in the light of all this involves a great deal.<a name=39:12></a> If Christ is to be everything the cross must come in on all that I am as in the flesh -- it must draw the line between me and the world.<a name=39:13></a> If I am not prepared to judge myself and to break with the world the light will burn very dimly so far as I am concerned.<a name=39:14></a> There must be the practical acceptance of the cross.<a name=39:15></a> The Apostle Paul after speaking to the Colossians about being complete in Christ goes on to speak of circumcision and burial.<a name=39:16></a> The Christian to be in the good of the testimony of Christ must put off the body of the flesh and have done with the world.<a name=39:17></a> Of course in saying this I am not referring to the Christian's actual departure from this life but to a great moral reality which he comes to in mind and spirit.<a name=39:18></a> If I am complete in Christ I must part company in spirit with what is not Christ.<a name=39:19></a> It is not that one gives up the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have looked at the tabernacle itself and what it contained on a previous occasion.<a name=41:1></a> I now desire to bring before you a few thoughts in connection with the altar and the consecration of the priests.<a name=41:2></a> One feels a difficulty in taking up subjects so great and suggestive, and can only trust that the Lord may graciously give what will help to feed our souls.<a name=41:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The altar occupied a most important place.<a name=41:4></a> It was not part of the furniture of the house, and yet it was not outside the precincts of the house.<a name=41:5></a> It formed the connecting link between the house and the congregation.<a name=41:6></a> It was where God spoke to the people generally.<a name=41:7></a> "I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.<a name=41:8></a> And there I will meet with the children of Israel" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:42">Exodus  29:42</a>, 43).<a name=41:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The altar seems to me to represent Christ as the One who has glorified God about sin and sins in such a way that He is now free to approach men in all the blessedness of His grace as a Saviour God.<a name=41:10></a> The altar was at the door of the tabernacle; it was connected with God's dwelling-place on the one hand, and it was in view of the people on the other.<a name=41:11></a> In that way it corresponds with what is said of the Lord Jesus in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>, "There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time" (verse 5, 6).<a name=41:12></a> It is by Christ that God approaches men and speaks to them in grace.<a name=41:13></a> If God speaks to men in grace it must be in connection with the One who has given Himself a ransom for all.<a name=41:14></a> The furniture of the house speaks of things which are

		known within the house, but the altar speaks of what is proclaimed, if one may so say, at the door of the house.<a name=42:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony that sounds out from God's house is that God will have all men to be saved, and that the man Christ Jesus gave Himself a ransom for all.<a name=42:2></a> Christ is made known in the proclamation of grace as One who has had to do with the sins and liabilities of men.<a name=42:3></a> There is but one Person in the universe who could sustain the fire of God's holy judgment upon sin, and that Person has come under it in grace to men.<a name=42:4></a> His resurrection has proved that He was greater than all the death and judgment that He came into.<a name=42:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by way of the death of Christ that God comes out to men in the testimony of His grace.<a name=42:6></a> On the basis of ransom He can speak of repentance, and forgiveness, and peace to every sinner under heaven.<a name=42:7></a> God views the whole world at the present time from the standpoint of Christ and His death; hence every testimony of God to men is full of grace and blessing.<a name=42:8></a> Everything that God has to say to men in grace is based upon atonement; it is from the altar that God speaks in grace to men.<a name=42:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 29 we come to the consecration of the priests.<a name=42:10></a> I do not go into the anointing of Aaron separately.<a name=42:11></a> No doubt in this he is a figure of Christ personally.<a name=42:12></a> I pass on to what relates to the priestly household.<a name=42:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place they were brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and washed with water (verse 4).<a name=42:14></a> This seems to be a figure of purification from our defiled state as sinners -- what is often spoken of as moral cleansing.<a name=42:15></a> It is not cleansing from guilt.<a name=42:16></a> With reference to guilt we are justified by His blood, but we need to be morally cleansed from our defiled state as in the flesh.<a name=42:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need hardly say that there is no such thing as being cleansed actually from the presence of sin in the flesh so long as we are here in mortal bodies.<a name=42:18></a> But we can be cleansed morally; that is, separated in heart and spirit from the sin

	<div class="paragraph">
		that dwells in us, and brought to judge our whole state as in the flesh.<a name=43:1></a> We can come into the apprehension of the death of Christ as that in which our sinful state has been condemned and removed from before God in holy judgment.<a name=43:2></a> So that it is possible for us to be in moral separation from flesh of sin, and to be in mind and spirit with God on an entirely new ground and in an entirely new state.<a name=43:3></a> We cannot bring sinful flesh to God; it has been condemned in the death of His Son.<a name=43:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God effects this moral cleansing by bringing what is of Himself into the souls of His people.<a name=43:5></a> We are perhaps in danger of thinking of moral cleansing too much in a negative way, but I am sure that evil is only judged as good is brought in.<a name=43:6></a> Job said, "Now mine eye seeth thee.<a name=43:7></a> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:5">Job  42:5</a>, 6).<a name=43:8></a> It was as God was before him that he truly judged himself.<a name=43:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same thought is suggested in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:5">John  3:5</a>, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God".<a name=43:10></a> What is of God is brought into the soul, and this leads to the judgment of what we are according to the flesh and moral separation from it -- it brings about moral cleansing.<a name=43:11></a> There can be no true cleansing in this way except as that which is of God is brought in.<a name=43:12></a> Hence in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:3">John  15:3</a> the Lord says, "Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you".<a name=43:13></a> The word which He had spoken unto them was the blessed revelation of Himself and of the Father, and by bringing that in He cleansed them morally from all that was evil here -- bringing in the good and thus giving power to judge and separate from the evil.<a name=43:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in putting on the priestly garments (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:8">Exodus  29:8</a>, 9) we seem to get a figure of being set before God in a new state.<a name=43:15></a> This is a great spiritual reality in Christianity.<a name=43:16></a> God brings us to judge ourselves as in the flesh, but that is not His end.<a name=43:17></a> His end is that we may be brought into a new state before Him.<a name=43:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>after speaking of Christ as having died to sin and living to God, the apostle goes on to say, "Likewise

		<a name=44>[Page 44]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=44:1></a> God would have us to be conscious that we are in relation to Him apart from sin.<a name=44:2></a> We judge the world and the principle that rules in it -- sin -- and we take account of ourselves as being alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=44:3></a> The saint is thus alive to God on a new footing and in a new state.<a name=44:4></a> We could not live to God as identified with sin, but as being dead to sin and alive in Christ Jesus we are before God for His pleasure.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to the Colossians Paul develops this further, and speaks of the saints being risen with Christ.<a name=44:6></a> If we look at Christ on the cross it is a scene of death; we see there the condemnation and end of all that we are as in the flesh.<a name=44:7></a> He has died as having come in grace under all our liabilities, and as having been made sacrificially what we were actually.<a name=44:8></a> If we see this how can we want to strut about and hold our heads up as men in this world?<a name=44:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to consider the death of Christ in this way, but we must not stop there.<a name=44:10></a> God has operated in that scene of death and has raised up Christ from the dead, so that now a resurrection scene is opened up to us.<a name=44:11></a> There is but One Man in that resurrection scene, and by faith of the working of God who raised Him from among the dead we are risen with Him.<a name=44:12></a> We get the consciousness that we live along with Christ before God.<a name=44:13></a> It is clear that this puts us in an entirely new state and on a new footing, according to which we have priestly fitness to approach God.<a name=44:14></a> We appear before Him as in association with Christ, and thus invested with suitability to His holy presence.<a name=44:15></a> We are made meet to take a priestly place.<a name=44:16></a> The thought of this seems to be suggested by the holy garments.<a name=44:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then certain offerings had to be presented -- a bullock for a sin offering, a ram for a burnt offering, and another ram which was properly the ram of consecration -- and in each case Aaron and his sons bad to put their hands on the head of the

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		victim.<a name=45:1></a> This speaks of our appropriation of, and our identification with, Christ in the various characters which are set forth typically in these different offerings: Aaron and his sons were washed and arrayed in the priestly garments by Moses, but neither the washing nor the clothing was presented to them as an object.<a name=45:2></a> Neither the one nor the other was the ground of their confidence nor the object of their contemplation.<a name=45:3></a> It is not by these things that sin is removed from before God, or that sweet savour comes before Him in connection with the maintenance of His glory.<a name=45:4></a> The death of Christ was needed for this; or rather I would say, CHRIST in the place of sin and death for the glory of God, and in absolute devotedness and love.<a name=45:5></a> This is what was presented, in figure, for the contemplation and apprehension of the priests.<a name=45:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The blood was put on the lintel in Egypt for shelter, but the sinner putting himself under shelter of the blood and the priest putting his hand on the head of the sin offering are two very different things.<a name=45:7></a> One is more like the view of the death of Christ which is presented to us in Romans, and the other that which is spoken of in Hebrews.<a name=45:8></a> In Romans we are cleared in view of the righteous judgment of God, but in Hebrews we are cleared according to the holiness of the sanctuary.<a name=45:9></a> One has to do with relief and the other with approach.<a name=45:10></a> Christ has made purification of sins according to the holiness of the sanctuary, so that with purged consciences and hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience we might be free to draw near to God.<a name=45:11></a> The priest putting his hand on the head of the sin offering is a figure of the saint appropriating -- and identifying himself with -- Christ as the One who has glorified God about sin and sins according to the holiness of His sanctuary.<a name=45:12></a> The death of Christ has cleared us from righteous judgment, but it is also the ground on which we can approach God in all the glory in which He is known in His sanctuary.<a name=45:13></a> Our sin brings no stain to that holy

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the ram was slain and burnt upon the altar as a burnt offering.<a name=46:2></a> The priestly company was identified with that which was a figure of Christ in all the fragrance and sweet savour of His offering of Himself.<a name=46:3></a> Not only has sin been removed, but all the perfection and devotedness of Christ has been placed on the altar fire that the sweet savour of it might come out and ascend with infinite acceptance to God and the Father.<a name=46:4></a> "Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:2">Ephesians  5:2</a>).<a name=46:5></a> To apprehend this and to identify ourselves with it is an important part of our preparation for the exercise of priesthood.<a name=46:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the second ram was properly the ram of consecration.<a name=46:7></a> Aaron and his sons had to lay their hands on the head of this ram also, and then its blood was put on their right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot.<a name=46:8></a> In this we see the precious blood in another of its many and various aspects.<a name=46:9></a> Saints must not think that the blood is only for shelter; its meaning and preciousness continue to open out in new and varied forms all through the soul's history.<a name=46:10></a> The believer who walks with God has a continually growing sense of the preciousness of the blood of Christ; his thoughts of the blood are continually expanding; year by year it speaks with fresh power to his heart; it becomes more wonderful and blessed in the vision of his soul.<a name=46:11></a> The person who thinks less of that precious blood year by year is certainly travelling on a dangerous road.<a name=46:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that the blood of the ram of consecration speaks of the blood of Christ as the witness of His absolute personal devotedness to God.<a name=46:13></a> And the putting it on the ear, the thumb, and the toe of the priests seems to suggest that the mind and heart of the saint -- to which the ear is the avenue -- and his service and walk are all to come under the

		Finally, Aaron and his sons had to eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that was in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation (verse 31 - 35).<a name=49:5></a> They had to "eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them".<a name=49:6></a> In Egypt they ate of the lamb roast with fire; this corresponds with the saint feeding upon Christ that he may be spiritually nourished and strengthened to come out of Egypt.<a name=49:7></a> But the feeding upon the ram of consecration answers to saints being nourished upon the love of Christ in order to be strengthened for approach.<a name=49:8></a> That is, in the one case they ate in view of going out, and in the other in view of going in.<a name=49:9></a> I do not think people will move out of Egypt unless they feed upon Christ as the lamb roast with fire, and, on the other hand, I do not think saints will have spiritual energy to approach God unless they feed upon Christ as the ram of consecration.<a name=49:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tabernacle was movable and provisional.<a name=51:3></a> It was intended to be carried about, and was only for the time.<a name=51:4></a> It did not represent an established or permanent order of things.<a name=51:5></a> The house, properly speaking, could not be built until the kingdom was established.<a name=51:6></a> When the kingdom was established and mount Zion secured under David the house came distinctly in view.<a name=51:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:68">Psalm  78:68</a> - 70 we may see the connection between God's choice of David and of mount Zion and the building of His sanctuary.<a name=51:8></a> Jehovah dwelt in Zion as the rest of the kingdom (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:13">Psalm  132:13</a>, 14), and this prepared the way for His sanctuary to be built by Solomon.<a name=51:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of the kingdom being established in the hands of David was that the people were delivered from every enemy.<a name=51:10></a> "Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree".<a name=51:11></a> Jehovah put all the enemies under the soles of David's feet, so that when Solomon came to the throne he could say, "Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent".<a name=51:12></a>

		Then, again, the effect of the kingdom being established was that the people were commanded and ordered according to the pleasure of God.<a name=52:3></a> You remember how it is said in the book of Judges, "In those days there was no king in Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes".<a name=52:4></a> God raised up saviours for the people in their distresses, but there was no king to order them according to God's pleasure.<a name=52:5></a> The king was placed over the people to rule them for God.<a name=52:6></a> We read of Solomon that he was set on Jehovah's throne to be king for Jehovah his God (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#9:8">2 Chronicles  9:8</a>).<a name=52:7></a> Christ has that place for us now.<a name=52:8></a> Not that we know Him exactly as King -- He is Lord to us -- but I speak of the principle.<a name=52:9></a> The day of His glory here -- of which Solomon's reign was figurative -- is yet future, but we sing oftentimes: --

		In connection with this read <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#5:3">2 Samuel  5:3</a> - 7; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:12">2 Samuel  6:12</a>.<a name=53:5></a> David's first act after being anointed king over Israel was to take "the stronghold of Zion: the same is the city of David", and one of his next acts was to bring up the ark of God "into the city of David with gladness".<a name=53:6></a> The LORD had chosen Zion; He had desired it for His habitation.<a name=53:7></a> He had said, "This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:13">Psalm  132:13</a>, 14).<a name=53:8></a> David acted in victorious power to secure the place that God had chosen, and then he brought the ark to rest there.<a name=53:9></a> Zion spoke of the victorious power and supremacy of David, and it represents all the grace and blessings that have been secured in a risen and ascended Christ on the ground of redemption.<a name=53:10></a> God's purposes of grace had to be established in Christ risen and glorified on the basis of redemption before His house could be built.<a name=53:11></a>

		It may seem in the actual history of things here as though the enemy held the field, and that nothing of God's will was established.<a name=53:12></a> But as a matter of fact the enemy's power is completely broken, and God's purpose and grace are established in the most glorious way in Christ as the risen and exalted One.<a name=53:13></a> This is known by faith and in the Holy Ghost, so that it can be said to believers now, "Ye are come unto mount Zion" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a>).<a name=53:14></a> The House of God is built upon the impregnable basis of a victory which has broken the enemy's power, and a Person who has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light, One in whom God's

		It is well to note that when the ark was brought to the city of David there was "gladness", and the people had a good time (see <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:18">2 Samuel  6:18</a>, 19).<a name=54:6></a> They were caring that God should have His place, and the result was that they were blessed and enriched.<a name=54:7></a> If we want to have a good time we must be like David, who said, "I have set my affection to the house of my God" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:3">1 Chronicles  29:3</a>).<a name=54:8></a> If we do so we are sure to have prosperity of soul.<a name=54:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:7">1 Chronicles  22:7</a> - 10 we see that it was in David's mind to build the house, but he was not suffered to do so because he had "shed much blood upon the earth".<a name=54:10></a> This is an interesting scripture, because it points to a distinction between two characters which are united in Christ.<a name=54:11></a> Christ is the Man of war and the Man of rest and peace -- He is the true David and the true Solomon.<a name=54:12></a> David came in victorious power to meet and destroy every enemy, and Christ has taken up this character -- He has maintained all the rights of God with regard to sin, and in view of the blessing of man Then Solomon [peaceable] was a man of rest, and in his day God gave peace and quietness.<a name=54:13></a> Christ is now in the blessed peace of resurrection, having vanquished every foe.<a name=54:14></a> As the risen One He said to His disciples, "Peace be unto you".<a name=54:15></a> No disturbing element can ever reach the shore of resurrection.<a name=54:16></a> There is rest on every side, and neither adversary nor evil occurrent.<a name=54:17></a>

		One might say that typically David was the king of righteousness, and Solomon the king of peace.<a name=55:1></a> Both are united in Melchisedec -- figure of Christ as the One who "shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne" (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:13">Zechariah  6:13</a>).<a name=55:2></a> In a coming day Christ will be the King of righteousness and the King of peace, and in connection with Him the millennial temple will be built, the glory will be brought in, and everything on earth will be ordered for the pleasure of God.<a name=55:3></a> But in a certain way, as I have suggested, we know Him in these characters now -- as the true David who in the victorious power of grace has put every foe beneath His feet so that there might be full blessing for all who believe on His Name, and as the true Solomon in the blessed rest and peace of resurrection.<a name=55:4></a> These things are hinted at in picture in the Old Testament; we enter by faith and in the Spirit into the reality of them now; and in a quickly coming day they will be publicly displayed in power and glory.<a name=55:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was reserved to Solomon to build the house, but David was the one who secured the place for it, and who provided the material.<a name=55:6></a> He could say, "Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared".<a name=55:7></a> David secured the kingdom when he took Zion, and then all through his reign he was providing for the house -- treasuring the spoils of forty victorious years to that blessed end.<a name=55:8></a> It suggests to me that all the fruit and spoil of Christ's victory, and all that has accrued to Him as the exalted One, goes to enrich and beautify the House of God.<a name=55:9></a> In that way the kingdom contributes to the house.<a name=55:10></a>

		I desire now to point out one or two things in connection with the temple which had no place in connection with the tabernacle.<a name=56:9></a> The temple adds considerably to our conception of the House of God, for in connection with the temple we get the thought of God's house as a dwelling place for men.<a name=56:10></a> In the tabernacle there was no provision for men to dwell in God's house -- there was not even a seat there for the priests.<a name=56:11></a> But in the temple there were "chambers" (see <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#6:5">1 Kings  6:5</a>, 10), which suggest the thought of men dwelling in the House of God.<a name=56:12></a> That house was not only to be a place of approach to God, but a dwelling place for men.<a name=56:13></a> I need not remind you how often this thought is taken up in the Psalms.<a name=56:14></a> "I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23:6">Psalm  23:6</a>); "One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of

		In turning to New Testament Scriptures with reference to the House of God, we notice a great contrast between what we find here and what is found in the Old Testament.<a name=62:1></a> In the Old Testament things are presented in shadow and in dead types.<a name=62:2></a> There was no life in either the tabernacle or the temple; they were material structures of wood, stone, gold, etc.<a name=62:3></a>, and were only types and shadows, though deeply instructive for us in many ways.<a name=62:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the New Testament everything is living.<a name=62:5></a> That is the great distinction between the Old Testament and the New.<a name=62:6></a> The Old Testament had regard to man in the flesh, and we are told here that "all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.<a name=62:7></a> The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away".<a name=62:8></a> There could not be anything very precious in connection with that.<a name=62:9></a> But in the New Testament CHRIST is introduced, and that brings vitality into everything.<a name=62:10></a> In the Old Testament there are shadows, types, and promises, like so many fingerposts pointing on; but nothing came into divine reality and vitality till Christ came.<a name=62:11></a> When He came into this world everything that was of God and for man's blessing was presented livingly in Him.<a name=62:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Last week we looked at the first chapter as bringing before us different things which give character to the saints as living stones.<a name=71:1></a> I now pass on to show how the living stones are brought together so as to be built up a spiritual house.<a name=71:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that the first chapter might be summed up as putting off the old man and putting on the new, in the way in which Peter presents this great truth of Christianity.<a name=71:3></a> In the Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians it is taken for granted that saints have put off the old man and have put on the new.<a name=71:4></a> Of course we have to begin with forgiveness of sins, but we do not stop there.<a name=71:5></a> The great turning point in a soul's history is when he puts off the old man and puts on the new.<a name=71:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was a time when we regarded ourselves as in the flesh; we cultivated and gratified ourselves in that character; that was the time past of our lives.<a name=71:7></a> Now having been born again by the incorruptible seed of the word of God we view ourselves in a different light altogether.<a name=71:8></a> If I look at myself as in the flesh I cannot see a point upon which my eye can rest with any kind of satisfaction.<a name=71:9></a> I see every form of corruption developing itself; the old man corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts.<a name=71:10></a> It would be dreadful for us to think we were identified with that man before God.<a name=71:11></a> I know of no anguish more terrible than of one finding out what he is according to the flesh and thinking he is identified before God with that old state.<a name=71:12></a> It is enough to sink one into the depths of despair in the experience of his soul.<a name=71:13></a> But what a relief to awake to the blessed fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ; that man with all his corruption and

	<div class="paragraph">
		depravity has gone from before God.<a name=72:1></a> Thank God for it!<a name=72:2></a> Seeing this, we put off the old man.<a name=72:3></a> How do I look at myself now?<a name=72:4></a> Well I regard myself as a subject of the gracious work of the blessed God.<a name=72:5></a> I have been born again, I have been brought into the blessing of the gospel, I have received the Spirit, I am now being formed in holiness and love as one of God's chosen and redeemed people, I have put on a new character.<a name=72:6></a> It is a great moment when the soul comes to that point.<a name=72:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And all this is very practical.<a name=72:8></a> People may say these things are not practical.<a name=72:9></a> I grant they are not exactly practice, but they are very practical.<a name=72:10></a> We must be practical before we can practise.<a name=72:11></a> We put off the old man, we take the ground of not belonging to that man any more; we are born of incorruptible seed; we are God's redeemed people, and we are being formed in holiness and love as our true character according to God.<a name=72:12></a> It is a great thing to start thus, and the effect is we are empowered to lay aside what is connected with the old man.<a name=72:13></a> So the second chapter begins by saying, "Wherefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings".<a name=72:14></a> These five things have to be laid aside; they do not belong to the new man.<a name=72:15></a> If I have put off the old man how can I go on with his deeds?<a name=72:16></a> A great many Christians try to correct the old man without putting him off.<a name=72:17></a> You first put him off and then you lay aside his deeds.<a name=72:18></a> If Christians do not lay these things aside, they will not make any headway.<a name=72:19></a> All these habits and dispositions of the old man must be laid aside, and the effect is that as new-born babes we desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby up to salvation.<a name=72:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very serious that there is not a greater desire amongst the children of God for the sincere milk of the word.<a name=72:21></a> It shows that many who take the place of believers have not put off the old man with his deeds, nor have they come into separation from the world.<a name=72:22></a> We shall not desire the sincere

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we desire the sincere milk of the word I am sure we shall get it, and our souls will be nourished in the love of God, and God will bring us intelligently into that world of which Christ is the Centre.<a name=73:6></a> If we love Him we shall surely desire to apprehend all that blessed system of things of which He is the Head and Centre.<a name=73:7></a> But if people are not prepared to leave the old world they will never reach the new.<a name=73:8></a> If Columbus had not left the old world he would never have discovered the new.<a name=73:9></a> Anybody can see that.<a name=73:10></a> But who is going to leave this world till he gets some idea of a better one?<a name=73:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way God gives an appetite for the sincere milk of the word is by causing us to taste that the Lord is gracious.<a name=73:12></a> That is what it begins with.<a name=73:13></a> "If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious".<a name=73:14></a> What does that mean?<a name=73:15></a> Well, it seems to me that the graciousness of the Lord -- His goodness comes out in a special way in the Gospel of Luke.<a name=73:16></a> Just look at a section of it for a few moments.<a name=73:17></a> Read <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:11">Luke  7:11</a> - 16.<a name=73:18></a> It has been said that the woman represents humanity.<a name=73:19></a> Here the Lord was looking upon humanity in presence of the terrible reality and desolation of death, and His heart was touched with compassion.<a name=73:20></a> He was good.<a name=73:21></a> The presence and pressure of death is a great reality, but the Lord came down from heaven to meet it all and He has abolished it in His own goodness by going into it for us.<a name=73:22></a> We have found out His goodness in compassion.<a name=73:23></a> He has placed Himself in contact with death and has annulled its power.<a name=73:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now read <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:36">Luke  7:36</a> - 50.<a name=73:25></a> Here we find the question of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 8: 26 - 37 we get Satan's power in the man possessed by demons.<a name=74:4></a> Some may say that people are not possessed by demons now!<a name=74:5></a> There is no demon I am more afraid of than my own will.<a name=74:6></a> Satan gives energy to the will of man.<a name=74:7></a> Man in himself is a very impotent creature, but he becomes the agent or instrument of mighty forces of evil.<a name=74:8></a> The Lord delivered that poor captive of the power of evil, so that he was found sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed and in his right mind.<a name=74:9></a> The Lord was good.<a name=74:10></a> And we have tasted of that goodness.<a name=74:11></a> We have proved how He can deliver from all the power of darkness here.<a name=74:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:43">Luke  8:43</a> - 48 we get the woman with the issue of blood.<a name=74:13></a> That seems to be figurative of the weakness of the flesh.<a name=74:14></a> Virtue went out of Him for the healing of the woman.<a name=74:15></a> There is power in the Lord to make us superior to the will of the flesh and to its weakness.<a name=74:16></a> How good He is!<a name=74:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 9 we see in picture that the world is a desert; it does not afford satisfaction to the heart.<a name=74:18></a> But the Lord made these five thousand sit down, and He gave satisfaction in the desert.<a name=74:19></a> We may have had to say many times, "We are here in a desert place", but have we not proved the Lord is good?<a name=74:20></a> Have we not tasted that He is good?<a name=74:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the goodness of the Lord is brought out beautifully in the good Samaritan in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:30">Luke  10:30</a> - 35, where He puts Himself in contrast with man.<a name=74:22></a> The priest and the Levite passed by on the other side; they were not good; they would give nothing to a penniless and perishing man.<a name=74:23></a> But the Lord was good; He would give everything, and charge Himself with the care of such a one.<a name=74:24></a> How blessed to know Him in

	<div class="paragraph">
		His supreme goodness!<a name=75:1></a> We shall certainly not know what it is to come to Christ as the Living Stone, if we have not tasted and proved His goodness.<a name=75:2></a> And the effect of this is to make us independent of anything in this world, and conscious that we have a resource in Him for everything.<a name=75:3></a> Would not that give us a desire to pass into God's world?<a name=75:4></a> He comes to us in goodness and in relation to our need, and then we are called to leave what is of the world and go to Him in His own circle of things.<a name=75:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what we get in verse 4, "To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God, and precious".<a name=75:6></a> I do not think any one will enter into the blessedness of this until his heart is free to be attracted to Christ as Mary's was in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:39">Luke  10:39</a>.<a name=75:7></a> No doubt she had first tasted that the Lord was gracious, and the result was she was attracted to Himself.<a name=75:8></a> Then we get another side.<a name=75:9></a> Tasting that the Lord is good comes out very fully, as I have said, in the Gospel of Luke, but coming to Christ as the Living Stone answers more to what we get in the Gospel of John.<a name=75:10></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:10">John  1:10</a>, 11.<a name=75:11></a> I read these verses to show that this gospel views Christ as being rejected by man from the very beginning; He has no place here.<a name=75:12></a> The world does not know Him, and His own people according to the flesh will not receive Him, but He becomes the subject of divine testimony as in verses 29 - 34.<a name=75:13></a> Here we see the Lord presented in quite a new character.<a name=75:14></a> He is the One who takes away the sin of the world and who baptizes with the Holy Ghost; He is the Son of God.<a name=75:15></a> That is, He is not looked at here in relation to man's need but in relation to God's thoughts.<a name=75:16></a> He comes into the world to take sin out of it, and then He gives the Holy Ghost, and as the Son of God He becomes the subject of testimony.<a name=75:17></a> When John said"Behold the Lamb of God", it was the sincere milk of the word.<a name=75:18></a> All the word of God bears testimony to that Person.<a name=75:19></a> The two disciples spoken of in verses 35 - 39 had their hearts nourished

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in John's gospel very plainly that Christ did not get a company from the world.<a name=76:6></a> The world did not know Him and His own would not have Him, but He got a company from the Father.<a name=76:7></a> It is very important to see that.<a name=76:8></a> So we get in chapter 6: 37, "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out".<a name=76:9></a> And in verses 44, 45, "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him", etc.<a name=76:10></a> The Father gives, and the Father draws, and the Father teaches.<a name=76:11></a> That is how Christ gets a company; He gets them really from the Father.<a name=76:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look to ourselves as living stones we have to trace our origin to a divine source; we had our origin in the Father's purpose.<a name=76:13></a> We are told that the Lord knew what was in man: He never trusted anything but what was of the Father; and that is the only thing that can be trusted.<a name=76:14></a> Everything that is of man breaks down.<a name=76:15></a> The great point is that the Father introduced a Person into this world who had no link with the world.<a name=76:16></a> He was altogether distinct from the world.<a name=76:17></a> His disciples never suggested that He should take a place in this world.<a name=76:18></a> They were ignorant in many points, but they were conscious that He had nothing to do with the course of this world.<a name=76:19></a> I believe if any person got a sense of who Christ is it would be impossible for him to connect Christ with anything in this world.<a name=76:20></a> In Christendom

		Read in connection with this <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40:3">Isaiah  40:3</a> - 9.<a name=80:7></a> That is a very remarkable scripture, because it indicates the way in which God would provide for the comfort of His people on the one hand and the display of His own glory on the other.<a name=80:8></a> The chapter begins, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people", etc.<a name=80:9></a> Many of God's children have not divine comfort, because they are still entangled with the flesh.<a name=80:10></a> They are conscious of a thousand imperfections in themselves, and are made to realise every day of their lives what poor failing creatures they are, and how unsatisfactory their ways are to God, and having all this before them they do not know much of divine comfort.<a name=80:11></a> But God would comfort His people by showing them how He has set that imperfect and corrupt flesh entirely aside, so that everything might be placed upon a new footing.<a name=80:12></a> In a certain way that was so when His Son came into this world.<a name=80:13></a> The presence of the Lord Jesus here -- the Son of God, the Holy One of God -- was morally the setting aside of every other man.<a name=80:14></a> There was no man after the order of Adam to the pleasure of God.<a name=80:15></a> That came out in the Old Testament; there was "none that doeth good, no, not one".<a name=80:16></a> But God brought His own beloved Son into this world, and the moment He came into view at His baptism the heavens were opened, and the Spirit descended and rested upon Him, and the Father's voice said, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased".<a name=80:17></a> The glory of God was there, and, for the first time, the Godhead was revealed;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John the Baptist had come, according to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40">Isaiah  40</a>, to cry that all flesh was as grass, and to call people to repentance.<a name=81:2></a> And then this blessed One, God's beloved Son, appeared, and in Him the glory of God in grace.<a name=81:3></a> So, as we read in the Gospel of John, the apostles could say, "We beheld his glory", and in the second chapter He "manifested his glory", and in the eleventh chapter He said to Martha, "Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=81:4></a>" The glory of God shone out in that blessed Person.<a name=81:5></a> In Him we see God's glory in the midst of a scene of evil, and of Satan's power, a scene of distress and ruin and death.<a name=81:6></a> The glory of God shone out in grace in all its blessed supremacy in the Person of Jesus.<a name=81:7></a> It is a great thing to see that, because the effect is we do not think much of any other man, and we think a very great deal of Christ.<a name=81:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thing.<a name=81:9></a> The bringing into this world of the glory of God in the Person of His beloved Son did not settle the question of sin and sinful flesh.<a name=81:10></a> The cross was needed for that, and that blessed One by His own death glorified God in regard to sin, and made an end of that sinful flesh which is such a discomfort to every saint.<a name=81:11></a> It may work out in a different way in each one of us, but the great source of discomfort with us all is the flesh.<a name=81:12></a> The Holy One of God was made sin so that sinful flesh might be condemned and cleared away.<a name=81:13></a> And not only that, but in the very place where sinful flesh was cleared away the glory of God in holiness and love shone forth in all its brightness.<a name=81:14></a> We see the glory of God at the cross, coming out in all its holy splendour in the very place where sin was being judged.<a name=81:15></a> The glory of the blessed God came out in that wondrous death.<a name=81:16></a> Flesh was removed in judgment; God was revealed in holiness and love!<a name=81:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, further, we find in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40">Isaiah  40</a>that the Spirit of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=82>[Page 82]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the LORD was to blow on the flesh.<a name=82:1></a> That carries us a step farther.<a name=82:2></a> That is what the Spirit of God does in your soul and mine.<a name=82:3></a> He brings us to God's mind about the flesh.<a name=82:4></a> What is God's mind with regard to my flesh?<a name=82:5></a> It is that it must needs come under condemnation and death; and it has done so in the Person of Christ upon the cross.<a name=82:6></a> And now, as a believer on the Lord Jesus, having received forgiveness through His Name, God has given me His Spirit to blow upon the flesh in my heart and mind, so that I may see the worthlessness of it and the impossibility of improving it.<a name=82:7></a> We are thus brought into concert with the mind of God, and then there is no hindrance to our souls being in the light of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=82:8></a> If I want to go on with the flesh, to gratify it or to display it, I am hindered from being in the light of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=82:9></a> But God works by bringing in Christ, and by condemning the flesh in the death of Christ, and by giving us the Spirit to blow upon the flesh in order to bring us into harmony with Himself that we may be in the light of the "glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God".<a name=82:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it necessarily follows that those glad tidings become the standard of everything.<a name=82:11></a> It is very different from having the ten commandments or merely rules and regulations of any kind.<a name=82:12></a> Our souls are put in the presence of the holiness and love of the blessed God, and we are now called, as Paul says to the Thessalonians, to "walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory".<a name=82:13></a> That is the only standard in the House of God.<a name=82:14></a> Many of us are content to walk like decent men and women in this world, and satisfied if we carry out certain precepts and do not step across a certain line which we draw for ourselves.<a name=82:15></a> But true Christianity is very different to that kind of thing; it is that we are brought into the light of God's holy love, and that becomes the standard of everything.<a name=82:16></a> Hence the apostle says, "If there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=83>[Page 83]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God".<a name=83:1></a> Everything contrary to that standard is condemned in God's house.<a name=83:2></a> I cannot enlarge upon it, but the importance of being in the light of God is incalculable.<a name=83:3></a> We are not in the House of God in legality but in perfect liberty, and joy, and blessing, because of the way God has made Himself known in Christ and by the cross and by giving us His Spirit, and then our knowledge of God becomes the standard of everything.<a name=83:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 2 we get a second thing that is in the House of God.<a name=83:5></a> <i>The testimony of God is there</i>.<a name=83:6></a> We read, "God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<a name=83:7></a> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time".<a name=83:8></a> That is God's testimony.<a name=83:9></a> The first thing is that God should be known in the hearts of His people, that we should be in the light of the glory of the blessed God.<a name=83:10></a> And that is preparation for testimony.<a name=83:11></a> The testimony, so far as I understand it, consists in giving a true account of God in this world.<a name=83:12></a> That is really the testimony of saints as forming the House of God -- we have to give a true account of God.<a name=83:13></a> Remember the terrible state this world is in.<a name=83:14></a> It is ignorant of God, and has refused Him in every possible way.<a name=83:15></a> God has been turned out of this world, so far as men could do it, but there is a divine Person here who cannot be turned out of the world, and He forms the saints into God's dwelling-place, and the only knowledge of God in grace and righteousness and love the world gets comes through God's house, which is the place where His testimony dwells, and from whence it goes forth.<a name=83:16></a> God is a Saviour God who desires that all men should be saved, and the Man Christ Jesus is the Mediator through and in whom all His grace has been expressed.<a name=83:17></a> The Mediator gave Himself a ransom for all, and this is the manner of God's approach to men in grace.<a name=83:18></a> The full glory of the blessed God has come out in the way of grace to men; and the testimony

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=84>[Page 84]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of it is maintained in the House of God.<a name=84:1></a> Nothing could be more wonderful.<a name=84:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Through the failure of man and the ruin of the church the light has been greatly dimmed, but I am inclined to think that God has maintained His own testimony all through from Pentecost until now.<a name=84:3></a> Not that you are likely to find the record of it in church history, for if the testimony of God was maintained in the dark ages it was probably in those who were not much in view of the world or of ecclesiastical historians.<a name=84:4></a> People are very much mistaken if they suppose that church history can be relied on as giving a true estimate of what there has been for God during the nineteen centuries of Christianity.<a name=84:5></a> We may look at the history of the dark ages and think there was nothing for God.<a name=84:6></a> But we are not justified in coming to such a conclusion.<a name=84:7></a> I admit there was very little public proclamation of the gospel, but God's house was here, and His testimony was here in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=84:8></a> Perhaps only a few obscure individuals, entirely unknown to fame, were in it, but God's testimony was in this world.<a name=84:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dwell upon this because I want to ask every one here, Do you covet to be in the line of this blessed testimony?<a name=84:10></a> The great thing is that we should be in the testimony of God -- that it should be the earnest desire of our souls to be expressing somewhat the true character of God in this world.<a name=84:11></a> That is the great dignity that saints have as forming God's house.<a name=84:12></a> We are here to present God in His proper character and true light as a Saviour God -- One who will have all men to be saved, One who is approaching men by a Mediator and on the ground of ransom.<a name=84:13></a> We are here to render testimony to what God is in blessed grace to men.<a name=84:14></a> He dwells here in His saints in grace and blessing towards men, and it is impossible to be spiritual or pious without being evangelistic.<a name=84:15></a> It is the true testimony of the church of God.<a name=84:16></a> The truth of the church and the truth of the gospel have sometimes been
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		regarded as though they were two different lines.<a name=85:1></a> But the true note of the church in this world is its testimony to the blessed God -- that it is here sounding out the grace of the blessed God amongst men.<a name=85:2></a> Man may dislike the testimony and turn from it with contempt, but to be identified with that testimony is the great dignity that the saints have as forming the House of God.<a name=85:3></a> When I speak of the House of God I do not mean any particular company of saints.<a name=85:4></a> It requires every believer in the world who has the Spirit to make up the House of God; it would be incomplete if you left out one believer indwelt by God's Spirit.<a name=85:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another thing.<a name=85:6></a> The third point that I want to touch upon is that in the House of God <i>man gets his right place</i>.<a name=85:7></a> I do not think that man is in his proper place and dignity anywhere but in the House of God.<a name=85:8></a> What we see in the second chapter of this epistle is man restored to his proper dignity.<a name=85:9></a> Man has fallen and become alienated from God, but is seen here in his true dignity.<a name=85:10></a> What is the dignity of man?<a name=85:11></a> So far as I understand it, the true dignity of man is to be in intercourse with God.<a name=85:12></a> People think very much of being presented at court.<a name=85:13></a> A person admitted to intercourse with the king is looked upon in the world as a person of dignity.<a name=85:14></a> But the greatest dignity is to be admitted to intercourse with God.<a name=85:15></a> I think we sometimes look at prayer too exclusively on the side of our need and dependence; that side is perfectly true, but think of the great dignity and blessedness of being admitted to have personal intercourse with God!<a name=85:16></a> "I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.<a name=85:17></a> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour".<a name=85:18></a> "I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting".<a name=85:19></a> The saints are to occupy this wonderful place of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		intercession, and I think the best time of one's life is the time spent in intercourse with God.<a name=86:1></a> That is the time of real honour and dignity.<a name=86:2></a> If you see a man who is accustomed to have intercourse with God you see one who is in the greatest dignity that is possible for a creature.<a name=86:3></a> We are called to be so in the liberty of intercourse with God that everything that comes under our eye becomes an occasion of intercourse with Him.<a name=86:4></a> You look around in the world and everything becomes an occasion of intercourse with God -- whether it be men, or kings, or the mercies of the way, or its trials.<a name=86:5></a> You sit down to your meals; they become occasions of intercourse with God.<a name=86:6></a> I am referring now to chapter 4: 3 - 5, "Meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.<a name=86:7></a> For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer".<a name=86:8></a> One might think that partaking of food was a very common-place affair, but the wonderful thing is that God puts His people in such nearness to Himself that there is not a single thing that comes under their notice that does not become an occasion of intercourse with Himself.<a name=86:9></a> I think in that way man is recovered to his proper dignity and maintained here for the good pleasure of God.<a name=86:10></a> This is characteristic of the House of God; these things cannot be sectarianised; they cannot be limited to anything less than the whole company of saints.<a name=86:11></a> I put it to myself and to you, Are we really exercised to maintain individually what is proper to God's house; or are we content to live on a lower platform than that to which grace has called us?<a name=86:12></a> There is nothing legal or burdensome about it; God has thrown round our hearts the golden chain of His blessed grace and love that we might be drawn to Him and bound to Him, and that it might become the joy of our hearts to be in intercourse with Him and intercession before Him as to everything here.<a name=86:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the end of the third chapter.<a name=87:1></a> The apostle's object in writing was that Timothy might know how to behave himself in the House of God.<a name=87:2></a> We are not Timothys, but we all have a place in the House of God, and it is as important for us as for Timothy that we should know how to behave ourselves there.<a name=87:3></a> Saints often forget that they have a place in the House of God, and it is well to have our minds stirred up by way of remembrance.<a name=87:4></a> We belong to the House of God not only when we come together but at all times, and we have to behave ourselves as those who belong to that house.<a name=87:5></a> After speaking of the House of God as the pillar and ground of the truth Paul passes on to speak of the "mystery of godliness [or piety]: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory".<a name=87:6></a> It has been said that <i>the mystery of godliness is enshrined in the House of God</i>.<a name=87:7></a> I cannot go into this wonderful verse in detail; it is too big; but it is deeply interesting and profitable to see what is the mystery of piety.<a name=87:8></a> A mystery means something that is hidden -- something that does not appear on the surface.<a name=87:9></a> Piety has its own secret and divine spring.<a name=87:10></a> If we look at the clock we see the right time indicated by the hands, and that shows that the spring and mechanism within are working properly.<a name=87:11></a> The motive power is hidden, but can be recognised by its effects.<a name=87:12></a> Piety is that everything in our lives down here is regulated according to God, and this will only be as our hearts are under the power of the mystery of piety.<a name=87:13></a> Now that is what we get in this verse.<a name=87:14></a> In one word it is CHRIST -- He is the spring and energy of all true piety.<a name=87:15></a> The great thing is to have CHRIST dwelling in the heart by faith.<a name=87:16></a> The form of piety can be very well imitated, and in the second epistle the Holy Ghost tells us of some who have the form of piety but deny the power thereof.<a name=87:17></a> They have not got the true spring of it.<a name=87:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important for us to see how to get our piety invigorated.<a name=87:19></a>
	</div>

		<a name=88>[Page 88]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there is room for more piety in every one of us; but how is it to be brought about?<a name=88:1></a> If the clock is out of order will any amount of tinkering with the face and hands put it right?<a name=88:2></a> No, you must get to the spring and the works -- to the hidden part -- and put that right.<a name=88:3></a> It is no good trying to put right this detail and that in a legal kind of way.<a name=88:4></a> The great thing for us is to know and have more of Christ -- to have Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith.<a name=88:5></a> If we get more of Christ in our hearts there will be more of Christ expressed in our lives.<a name=88:6></a> Christ expressed in the life is true piety.<a name=88:7></a> There was in that blessed One the expression in this world of a life that had all its springs in God.<a name=88:8></a> And now He has been received up into glory, so that in the power of the Spirit He might become the divine spring of everything for God's pleasure in the hearts of His saints down here.<a name=88:9></a> You will find practically, beloved friends, that when Christ holds and occupies your heart it is very easy to live piously.<a name=88:10></a> You do not find it a great effort to keep clear of the snares of the world or the lusts of the flesh.<a name=88:11></a> But when Christ declines in the heart it becomes difficult to keep on the right side of the border line, and not to drift with the desires and lusts of the flesh and of the mind.<a name=88:12></a> We need more of the mystery of piety -- Christ Himself in the heart as the regulative power of everything.<a name=88:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a few words on the fifth thing.<a name=88:14></a> <i>In the House of God the Spirit speaks</i>.<a name=88:15></a> Chapter 4 begins, "The Spirit speaketh expressly".<a name=88:16></a> This is characteristic of the House of God; there we get the voice of the Spirit.<a name=88:17></a> No doubt the epistles are the voice of the Spirit in a certain way, but it is important to remember that only the Spirit of God can give application to things at the moment when they are needed.<a name=88:18></a> A man of ability might commit to memory the whole of the New Testament so far as the letter is concerned, but this would not give him any idea of its divine application.<a name=88:19></a> The Spirit of God is the only One who can give present application of the needed

		truth at any particular moment.<a name=89:1></a> The Spirit spoke in the early days in the assembly and He has not ceased to have a voice in God's house.<a name=89:2></a> The Holy Ghost is here and has a voice on behalf of Christ in the assemblies.<a name=89:3></a> Of course I am not supposing for a moment that He makes new revelations now; there is no such thing as that.<a name=89:4></a> The whole truth has been set forth in the holy Scriptures, and we can thank God that the form of sound words is with us in Scripture.<a name=89:5></a> But then we need particular truths at particular moments; we need things to be divinely applied to our souls, and the Spirit gives a voice in the House of God to that which the saints need -- that which is consistent with their present condition, and with the ways of God in leading them on in their souls.<a name=89:6></a> We shall have that to the end.<a name=89:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of immense importance that we should hear what the Spirit says to the churches, as in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches".<a name=89:8></a> When God speaks of having an ear He certainly means a moral condition -- a state of soul that can discern what is of the Spirit.<a name=89:9></a> Nothing could be more sad and solemn than the deafness of God's people.<a name=89:10></a> There is nothing more solemn than to find believers -- those you cannot doubt are children of God -- deaf to the voice of the Spirit.<a name=89:11></a> We need exercise about this.<a name=89:12></a> In the epistles to the seven churches, it has often been pointed out that in the last four churches the word, "He that hath an ear" comes after the promise to the overcomer.<a name=89:13></a> That implies that only <i>the overcomer</i> will have an ear for what the Spirit says to the churches.<a name=89:14></a> What is it to be an overcomer?<a name=89:15></a> It is very simple: an overcomer is one who responds to Christ.<a name=89:16></a> There are no two saints exactly alike in their circumstances, or condition, but there is not a saint in the world to whom the blessed Lord does not present Himself, and those who respond to Him become overcomers.<a name=89:17></a> If Christ presents Himself to a soul and there is response to Him it necessitates that the soul should break away from

		what is not Christ.<a name=90:1></a> If He presents Himself and there is no response, how sad it is!<a name=90:2></a> Christ does not fail at some time or other to present Himself to every one of His own in the world, and if there is response to Him it brings the believer into some degree of separation.<a name=90:3></a> Then there will be a further presentation of Christ to the soul, and if there is response to that a further manifestation still, and thus the Lord would lead on and draw His own to Himself.<a name=90:4></a> If there is response to Christ in our hearts I am sure we shall be overcomers, and the effect will be that we shall have an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.<a name=90:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us remember that the living voice of God by the Spirit is in His house today.<a name=90:6></a> There is such a thing as divine ministry in the House of God, and the voice of the Spirit is heard there.<a name=90:7></a> What we need is an ear to discern that voice.<a name=90:8></a> We are not to receive everything as truth; we ought to be discriminating, and full of discernment.<a name=90:9></a> Would to God that the saints were more critical in a spiritual way!<a name=90:10></a> Every kind of error is presented now, and Christians do not seem able to discern it.<a name=90:11></a> We do not want the carping criticism of the natural mind that makes a man an offender for a word, but that spirit of discernment that knows how to separate what is human from what is divine.<a name=90:12></a> God says, "If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15:19">Jeremiah  15:19</a>).<a name=90:13></a> We need to be particular and critical in that sense.<a name=90:14></a> We have to exercise our senses upon things, and not go on as if everything we heard was sure to be right.<a name=90:15></a> On the other hand, it is a very poor thing to be merely acute in the discernment of what is wrong.<a name=90:16></a> We need to gain increasingly an appreciation of what is of God; we need an ear for the voice of the Spirit, and exercise so that we turn away from that which is not according to the Spirit.<a name=90:17></a> In that way we should distinguish between good and evil, choosing the good and refusing the evil.<a name=90:18></a>

		Another distinct action of discipline is that it is <i>corrective</i>.<a name=112:17></a> There is an element of correction -- that is, of setting right -- in all discipline.<a name=112:18></a> There is always, to some degree, the thought of rectification in it.<a name=112:19></a> We see this in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:67">Psalm  119:67</a>.<a name=112:20></a> "Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word".<a name=112:21></a> The Psalmist was corrected by the discipline of God;

		There are many trials that are not confined to saints.<a name=114:2></a> Trying circumstances, suffering and weakness in body, and the sorrow of bereavement are common to men generally.<a name=114:3></a> The unconverted have these trials as well as believers.<a name=114:4></a> But the blessed thing is that God takes up all these things, which are connected with the wreck and ruin of things in this world of sin and death, and makes them work divine profit and benefit to His beloved children.<a name=114:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not suppose there is one here without some kind of sorrow or trial.<a name=114:6></a> God's discipline is a matter in which we are all personally interested; it has a practical bearing upon every one of us.<a name=114:7></a> How blessed to know that these sorrows and exercises are instruments in our Father's hand to bring about the profit of our souls!<a name=114:8></a> Men of the world in presence of sorrow often harden themselves to bear it in a stoical way, but if we get hard and callous we miss the good of God's discipline.<a name=114:9></a> God would not have us to accustom ourselves to trials and get hard under them.<a name=114:10></a> There is nothing stoical in Christianity; every proper natural feeling and sensibility has its place, but these feelings become the occasion for the development of tender and precious spiritual affections -- the sensibilities and feelings of Christ.<a name=114:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may see an example of beautiful divine tenderness and care in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:25">Philippians  2:25</a> - 28.<a name=114:12></a> "Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.<a name=114:13></a> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.<a name=114:14></a> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.<a name=114:15></a> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again,

		ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful".<a name=115:1></a> All this exercise and care, called forth in Paul and in the Philippians by the sickness of Epaphroditus, and the grief of Epaphroditus himself, not because he was sick, but because the Philippians had heard of his sickness, is perfectly beautiful.<a name=115:2></a> Spiritual affections came into exercise all round.<a name=115:3></a> This is a very blessed result of God's discipline, of which we do well to take account.<a name=115:4></a> Times of sorrow and suffering give opportunity for the love and care of the saints to come into activity.<a name=115:5></a> It is a common thing to hear one say, in reference to some season of great pressure or sorrow, "I never knew before how much love there was in the saints".<a name=115:6></a> We find the compassion and care and love of God in His children, and in this way we are spiritually enlarged in the very moment of pressure.<a name=115:7></a> We get this in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#4:1">Psalm  4:1</a>, "Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress".<a name=115:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God cares for us in every detail.<a name=115:9></a> He cared that an old man should have his overcoat before winter (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:13">2 Timothy  4:13</a>).<a name=115:10></a> He keeps His eye on us in all the discipline that we suffer under His hand.<a name=115:11></a> There is always the care of His love behind it all.<a name=115:12></a> May the comfort of this be ever in our hearts!<a name=115:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, again, it is in trial and sorrow that we learn in an experimental way the sympathy and succour of Christ -- His love as Priest.<a name=115:14></a> He enters into every feeling of weakness and suffering.<a name=115:15></a> When He was here, healing thousands of people of various diseases, He felt and bore in His spirit all that He removed by His power.<a name=115:16></a> And even if it were death itself, we see Him in that matchless scene at Bethany -- how can one speak of it?<a name=115:17></a> -- in company with a bereaved heart; the blessed Son of God entering into it all and weeping with those who wept!<a name=115:18></a> And now He has gone up to the right hand of God to intercede for His tried and disciplined saints down here.<a name=115:19></a> The intercession of Christ ever goes along with the discipline of God, to the end that it may effect a divine result in our souls.<a name=115:20></a> It is all in deep, divine love.<a name=115:21></a>

		The pressure of sorrow turns one away from the world and rebukes the natural self-importance of the flesh, and this leaves room for the blessed Lord to come to the heart in all the tenderness of divine sympathy and love to establish a personal link between Himself and the Borrower that could not be formed in any other way.<a name=116:1></a> The Psalmist could say, "Thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#31:7">Psalm  31:7</a>).<a name=116:2></a> A friend who comes near to you in time of pressure or trial makes himself very dear to you.<a name=116:3></a> A poor mortal like yourself cannot do much for you, but you feel the preciousness and comfort of a friend who in some way feels for you in your sorrow.<a name=116:4></a> But think of the blessed Lord, with perfect knowledge of your sorrow, and of all the detail, of which you would be ashamed to speak to a human being, because it would so expose your weakness that you could hardly expect to be understood, coming near to you in perfect divine love and sympathy <i>to endear Himself to you</i> in your need and pressure!<a name=116:5></a> Of what deep and precious value is that holy discipline which thus becomes the occasion for our hearts to make personal acquaintance with Christ!<a name=116:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It might, no doubt, be said that in the enjoyment of proper Christian privilege we should be found in a divine and heavenly sphere of blessing far above all pressure and trial and sorrow!<a name=116:7></a> Blessed be God, there is a sphere where no trial or sorrow can come, but how do we reach it?<a name=116:8></a> There is but one way, and that is <i>in company with Christ</i>.<a name=116:9></a> But how and where do we first learn His company?<a name=116:10></a> Let us take the two going to Emmaus as an illustration.<a name=116:11></a> They were filled with grief, and were going back to their own things, far away in heart from the resurrection sphere in which Christ was.<a name=116:12></a> His love was set upon leading them to Himself in that new place upon which He had entered as the risen One.<a name=116:13></a> But His way of doing this was first to come near to them in their sadness, that He might establish a link between Himself and their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get the thought of this in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:20">Revelation  3:20</a>, "I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me".<a name=117:5></a> Divine love in Christ touches me where I am in all the reality of my weakness and need, compassed with infirmity, and feeling every sorrow and trial.<a name=117:6></a> I need Him to sup with me -- to succour me by His grace, and thus to make Himself precious and indispensable to me.<a name=117:7></a> There is this wonderful thing about God's discipline, that it furnishes opportunity for the love of Christ as Priest to touch us where we are, and to so knit us to Himself in affection that we may travel in company with Him to a spot where sorrow and sin can never come.<a name=117:8></a> It is good to contemplate this.<a name=117:9></a> We sometimes look at the discipline of God too much in a judicial way, as if one did wrong and got a thrashing for it, as he deserved.<a name=117:10></a> We need to consider the blessed results which God intends to bring to pass by His discipline.<a name=117:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this connection I may say that we are dependent upon Christ as Priest to give us divine understanding of the discipline of God.<a name=117:12></a> "There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD.<a name=117:13></a> And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#21:1">2 Samuel  21:1</a>).<a name=117:14></a> I suppose that, according to the due order, David inquired of the Lord by means of the priest (see <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:21">Numbers  27:21</a>; <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#23:9">1 Samuel  23:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#30:7">1 Samuel  30:7</a>, etc.<a name=117:15></a>).<a name=117:16></a> It is only as we are in nearness to Christ that we have divine intelligence as to God's discipline.<a name=117:17></a> He can give us understanding in all things, and enable us to

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have referred to things which are common to men -- trial in circumstances, sickness, and bereavement -- but in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>it is another order of discipline that is more especially in view.<a name=118:2></a> The Spirit of God has before Him a kind of discipline which is peculiar to saints.<a name=118:3></a> We may see a sample of it in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:32">Hebrews  10:32</a> - 34.<a name=118:4></a> "But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.<a name=118:5></a> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance".<a name=118:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These beloved saints had to pay a great price for being Christians.<a name=118:7></a> The fact that they took their stand as confessors of the Lord Jesus cost them a good deal in their circumstances here.<a name=118:8></a> It must be remembered that they had been accustomed to look for the manifestation of God's favour in their circumstances here.<a name=118:9></a> It must have been a peculiar trial to them to find that, after becoming Christians, they had so many hardships to suffer.<a name=118:10></a> But the things that befell them were on account of being in the path of faith.<a name=118:11></a> Many sorrows and difficulties are escaped by those who do not tread that path.<a name=118:12></a> Paul would not have had such a long catalogue of hardships to recount (see <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:23">2 Corinthians  11:23</a> - 27) if he had not been in the path of faith.<a name=118:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another kind of discipline is when we suffer the governmental consequences of our own sin and folly.<a name=119:7></a> There are also moral consequences which we suffer in the experience of our souls, as when joy and peace are lost in consequence of getting away from the Lord.<a name=119:8></a> "God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<a name=119:9></a> For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:7">Galatians  6:7</a>, 8; see also <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:6">Romans  8:6</a>, 13).<a name=119:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we give place to that which is of the flesh we have to suffer for it.<a name=119:11></a> We may often learn the moral nature of things by their effect upon us.<a name=119:12></a> If we discover that certain things take us away from our joy in the Lord it is a solemn warning to us.<a name=119:13></a> To suffer in that way is a very serious discipline -- more to be deprecated than any other kind of affliction.<a name=119:14></a> We ought to be wise, and observant of the moral effect of things, so as to take warning as soon as we find that they bring a shade upon our spiritual joy and communion.<a name=119:15></a> If we find that something brings what is, morally, death and corruption into our souls we ought to turn from it at once -- we have learned its character by its experimental results.<a name=119:16></a> If we continue to trifle with it we play the part of fools.<a name=119:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If God deals with us governmentally on account of our wrong-doing it is our wisdom to humble ourselves under His mighty hand.<a name=120:5></a> The same remark applies to discipline exercised in the assembly, whether it be admonition, rebuke, or withdrawing from a wicked person.<a name=120:6></a> If I am admonished or rebuked by my brethren I ought not to resent it, but to be thankful for the occasion it gives me to be exercised about my ways.<a name=120:7></a> When under all discipline, of whatever kind it may be, it is important to keep in mind that God has said, "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#66:2">Isaiah  66:2</a>).<a name=120:8></a>
