		THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to bring before you at this time a very important subject, the Forgiveness of Sins.<a name=1:1></a> Some may think it an elementary subject to bring before a company of believers, but I am quite sure it is a subject which many believers have not apprehended in its greatness and blessedness.<a name=1:2></a> We too often think of it from the side of man's need only, and by so doing we are apt to lose sight of the greatness and grace of it according to God.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, then, let us consider
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<center>THE PROCLAMATION OF FORGIVENESS.<a name=1:4></a> </center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus "said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:46">Luke  24:46</a>, 47).<a name=1:5></a> Paul at Antioch says, "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:38">Acts  13:38</a>,39).<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that demands attention as to this blessed proclamation is the fact that it is altogether on God's part.<a name=1:7></a> It does not suppose or require the fulfilment of any conditions on the part of man.<a name=1:8></a> It rather, indeed, assumes and takes for granted at the outset that nothing attaches to man but SINS.<a name=1:9></a> It is the unconditional declaration on God's part of His disposition towards men.<a name=1:10></a> On their part they may be ungodly

		and impenitent, too hardened by familiarity with sin to feel their need, too proud to own it even if they feel it, or too much in love with their sins to wish to part company with them: but all this, sad as it is, does not in any way affect the proclamation of forgiveness, either to change its character or to limit its scope.<a name=2:1></a> God would have men to know what He is, and to know that His grace is greater than their sins, and to this end He sends forth this gracious proclamation.<a name=2:2></a> It is entirely of and FROM GOD.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is preached in the name of the Lord Jesus, and through Him.<a name=2:4></a> A name sets forth the character, reputation, renown, dignity, and glory of the one to whom it belongs.<a name=2:5></a> Now it is in the NAME of the Lord Jesus that forgiveness of sins is proclaimed.<a name=2:6></a> What lustre and honour is thus put upon the proclamation!<a name=2:7></a> With what exceeding grace and attractiveness is it presented to men!<a name=2:8></a> We are not called upon, as it were, to look at the guilty sinner in his fearful need and danger; our eyes are at once directed to a Saviour in whom every perfection is found.<a name=2:9></a> Not the leper in his sores, but the mighty and gracious Healer, is before us.<a name=2:10></a> In short, we do not find ourselves in the presence of man's need and ruin, but in the presence of God's infinite grace.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of this blessed One, in whose name forgiveness of sins is proclaimed; seek to get before your heart something of His greatness and preciousness.<a name=2:12></a> He is One who, from eternity, was daily God's delight, and who came into this world to bring the full revelation of God into it, and at the same time to present absolute perfection in manhood to the eye of God in the very scene and circumstances where Adam and his children had so thoroughly broken down; He was One able to make atonement, to overcome death, to vanquish Satan, to spoil principalities and powers, and to glorify God as to the whole question of sin; He was One who filled up and presented in His own person every prophetic blessing, whether connected with the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,

		the Son of man, or the Son of God; He is One who has finished the work God gave Him to do, who has glorified God by bringing every divine attribute into full and eternal display, and who has set the nature of God free to have its own way in blessing, even in a scene where everything had been ruined by sin; He is One now raised by the glory of the Father, and seated in heavenly exaltation at the right hand of the majesty on high.<a name=3:1></a> And

		<center>IN HIS NAME</center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		forgiveness of sins is preached among all nations, and to every creature under heaven.<a name=3:2></a> With what power and preciousness does the proclamation go forth!<a name=3:3></a> It goes forth according to all the worthiness, excellence, perfection, grace, and glory of CHRIST, and invested with all the authority and attractiveness of His name.<a name=3:4></a> Important addresses to honoured individuals are often inscribed upon costly vellum, and ornamented with every device that art can suggest; but was ever address or proclamation inscribed upon such a scroll as that on which God has inscribed His proclamation of grace to a world of lost and guilty sinners?<a name=3:5></a> God has invested that proclamation with all the beauty and glory of Christ, and with the power and preciousness of His sacred NAME.<a name=3:6></a> One might say that God has made forgiveness of sins as attractive as possible by setting it forth in the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"<i>Through this man</i> is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins".<a name=3:8></a> God puts Christ before sinners -- the Son of His love, the blessed Victim of Calvary, now the risen and glorified One and through HIM proclaims forgiveness.<a name=3:9></a> On the platform of divine grace -- on which God approaches man with this wondrous proclamation -- there is but one figure to be seen, and that is CHRIST.<a name=3:10></a> It is on the ground of what HE is, and in connection with the worthiness and glory of His Person, that forgiveness of sins is proclaimed.<a name=3:11></a> The gospel of God is "concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=3:12></a> Our

		goodness, repentance, desire to amend, prayers, religious service, or works of any kind, have absolutely nothing to do with it; and, on the other hand, our sins -- impiety, self-will, pride, indifference, self-satisfaction, blasphemy, hypocrisy, or whatever other form of wickedness we may have been guilty of in thought, word, or deed -- do not in any way detract from the fulness or the freeness of this divine proclamation.<a name=4:1></a> The very fact that such a proclamation is addressed to us assumes that we are guilty; it is as such, and in no other way, that it regards us.<a name=4:2></a> But it addresses us, not according to our deserts, but according to all the greatness, perfection, and worthiness of the One in whose name it is promulgated.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached CHRIST unto them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:5">Acts  8:5</a>).<a name=4:4></a> CHRIST is the great and blessed theme of the evangelist, and as He is preached faith IN Him "cometh by hearing".<a name=4:5></a> Faith in Christ is not a blind acceptance of certain arbitrary dogmas or the assent of the mind to an orthodox creed.<a name=4:6></a> It is the whole-hearted confidence of one who has come to the knowledge of the blessed perfection of Christ as a Saviour.<a name=4:7></a> He is everything that He needs to be to fill that place -- to be the Mediator between God and men.<a name=4:8></a> Nothing can be added to Him.<a name=4:9></a> He is everything to God's satisfaction, and He is everything that the heart and conscience of an exercised sinner would like Him to be.<a name=4:10></a> He is a suitable, an acceptable, and an attractive Saviour.<a name=4:11></a> And He is the only One; He has no rival; it is Christ or nothing.<a name=4:12></a> "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:38">Acts  13:38</a>).<a name=4:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This proclamation is universal in its scope; it is to go forth "among all nations".<a name=4:14></a> It is also unlimited in its application to the individual.<a name=4:15></a> God does not offer a partial discharge.<a name=4:16></a> He does not say "sins that are repented of", nor "sins that are confessed", nor "sins up to the time of believing", but simply "forgiveness of sins".<a name=4:17></a> The whole question of sins is looked at as one thing, and when you get the forgiveness of

	<div class="paragraph">
		sins you get it for ever.<a name=5:1></a> If it were otherwise there could never be any certainty about the matter.<a name=5:2></a> How could the believer ever be sure that he had not overlooked some of his sins?<a name=5:3></a> Or if every fresh sin committed raised again the whole question of the believer's forgiveness and justification, it would be quite impossible for any to have the quiet confidence of peace with God or the certainty of forgiveness, which is the very groundwork in the soul of all happy relationship with God.<a name=5:4></a> I purpose later on to say a little about sins committed after conversion, both as to how they affect the believer's heart and conscience, and as to how they are dealt with.<a name=5:5></a> But for the present I desire to press the importance of seeing that the forgiveness of sins, which clears the believer of all imputation in the sight of a holy God, is something which is unchanging and eternal.<a name=5:6></a> There is no thought in Scripture of a believer having it today and not having it tomorrow.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before saying more as to this I should like to bring under your notice several scriptures with reference to
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<center>THE ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS</center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:43">Acts  10:43</a>; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:12">1 John  2:12</a>; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:14">Colossians  1:14</a>.<a name=5:8></a> Doubts and misgivings on the subject of forgiveness arise from the fact that anxious souls are slow to believe that the proclamation is one of absolute grace, that it is presented to them in the name of the Lord Jesus, and that it is entirely "for his name's sake".<a name=5:9></a> They look upon it as a sort of conditional offer on God's part to obtain the benefit of which there must be the fulfilment of certain conditions on their part; and as they cannot be quite sure that they have fulfilled the conditions, they are in a state of uncertainty on the whole matter.<a name=5:10></a> They do not know whether they have repented enough, or whether they have faith enough, or whether they have the right kind of faith.<a name=5:11></a> These difficulties, and many others which trouble anxious souls, only show how little they have apprehended the grace of God.<a name=5:12></a> We are so slow to take in the blessed

	<div class="paragraph">
		thought that God is acting <i>from Himself</i> and according to the worthiness Of CHRIST, and that there is no question of any conditions to be fulfilled on our side.<a name=6:1></a> The whole thing is complete on God's side, and is not in any way conditional on our repentance or faith; it is God approaching man in all the fulness of His grace, and declaring Himself to be a Saviour-God.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find nothing in myself that I can trust in the smallest degree, but I can trust the grace in which God has set Himself forth in Christ.<a name=6:3></a> It is GOD who has spoken to me of forgiveness of sins, and who has set this great blessing before me in the name of the Lord Jesus and through Him.<a name=6:4></a> I gladly receive this wondrous grace, for it brings me what I need, and at the same time bows my heart in adoration before the unexpected and unmerited favour of God.<a name=6:5></a> I believe on God as the Source of the whole blessing, and as the One who has provided it altogether from His own side; and I believe on the Lord Jesus as the Mediator of that grace, as the One who has opened up a righteous channel for it, and in whose name it is proclaimed.<a name=6:6></a> And the Word of God declares that "through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:43">Acts  10:43</a>).<a name=6:7></a> There is no question or peradventure about it.<a name=6:8></a> The blessing is certain to"whosoever believeth in him".<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the question will arise in some hearts, 'Is it not possible to believe in a way that leaves a man a mere professor?<a name=6:10></a>' We read that "Simon himself believed also" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:13">Acts  8:13</a>), and he turned out to be one that had "neither part nor lot in this matter".<a name=6:11></a> It is written that "the devils also believe, and tremble" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#2:19">James  2:19</a>).<a name=6:12></a> How, then, can one be sure that his faith is such as will secure the blessing of God?<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must again point out that the thought which lies behind this question is that faith is a condition which has to be fulfilled on our part before the grace of God is available for us.<a name=6:14></a> That is, the soul has the idea that the grace of God is conditional upon faith, but conditional grace is not really

		grace at all.<a name=7:1></a> The gospel of the grace of God is the proclamation of the blessed fact that God is coming out in absolute grace on the ground of the death of Christ, and according to all the perfections of Christ, and is proclaiming forgiveness of sins to a world of sinners.<a name=7:2></a> When this gospel is believed it brings the knowledge of God in all the blessedness of His unconditional grace into the heart of the sinner.<a name=7:3></a> But the sinner's faith adds nothing to the gospel any more than the windows of our houses add to the light of the sun.<a name=7:4></a> The sun shines for everybody; my window lets the light into my room so that I enjoy it and am warmed by it.<a name=7:5></a> In like manner the sun of divine grace is shining for everybody; faith is the window which lets the light and warmth of it into the soul of a sinner.<a name=7:6></a> If you appreciate that grace and rejoice in it as the only thing that could possibly meet the need of your soul, you need have no question as to the nature of your faith.<a name=7:7></a> You may be sure that Simon Magus had no appreciation of the grace of God.<a name=7:8></a> He was intellectually convinced, it may be, by the miracles done by Philip; the new religion had credentials that could not be disputed, and, moreover, it was for the moment the popular thing.<a name=7:9></a> By the sheer force of evidences and circumstances, he accepted and professed it, but there is nothing to show that he had the smallest real appreciation of the grace which Philip preached as he proclaimed Christ in the city.<a name=7:10></a> The devils may believe that there is one God, and tremble as they believe, but you may be sure they have no appreciation whatever of divine grace.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A man may "say" he has faith; he may "say" that he believes in the grace of God; but if his heart is not cheered and gladdened by it, it is evident that it is nothing to him.<a name=7:12></a> The knowledge of grace subdues a man to God; it breaks the power of sin, and it brings heavenly gladness into the heart.<a name=7:13></a> In short, it brings the knowledge of God into the heart of man.<a name=7:14></a> The sinner who believes has the light of what God is in his heart.<a name=7:15></a> He only thinks of himself as a corrupt and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hell-deserving sinner, but he knows what God is in absolute and unconditional grace for sinners; he knows something of the preciousness and worthiness of Christ.<a name=8:1></a> It is not that he believes in his own faith -- anyone who did so would be on very dangerous ground -- he believes God's proclamation of grace, and rejoices in that grace because it not only meets his need, but makes God known to him so that he can "joy in God".<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who have misgivings about their faith are not generally those who despise the grace of God.<a name=8:3></a> It is more often those who realize something of the value of that grace, and feel they must perish without it, that are concerned lest they should not have it for themselves.<a name=8:4></a> Let me say to such that that grace has already, to some extent at any rate, established itself in your heart.<a name=8:5></a> The window may be small, and the rays of light are only few that have yet entered, but the light has begun to shine even in your soul.<a name=8:6></a> What you need is to turn away from yourself -- your feelings and your faith -- to the blessed God of all grace.<a name=8:7></a> He is what He is, whether you believe it or not; believing it brings the knowledge and gladness of it into your heart.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is "for his name's sake" that the believer's sins are forgiven.<a name=8:9></a> It is because of what Christ is, and according to the value of His atoning death, that God can say to every believer on His blessed name, "Your sins are forgiven".<a name=8:10></a> And believers can say without question or doubt, "In whom <i>we have</i> redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:14">Colossians  1:14</a>).<a name=8:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<center>THE RIGHTEOUS GROUND OF FORGIVENESS</center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as we have it clearly and fully presented in the Word of God.<a name=8:12></a> I desire to direct your attention in particular to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, where we learn that forgiveness is founded upon a sacrifice in which God has been glorified in righteousness.<a name=8:13></a> Let us

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		then briefly consider what is presented to us in the first eighteen verses of this chapter.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A careful reader cannot fail to notice that two things are prominent in these verses: first, the accomplishment of the will of God; and second, the securing a purged and perfected conscience for those who approach God.<a name=9:2></a> The second is really included in the first, for the will or pleasure of God may be briefly summed up in this, that He would make Himself known, and that He would have a people free in conscience and happy in heart to approach Him according to the revelation of Himself.<a name=9:3></a> The first covenant, and all that was connected with it, entirely failed to accomplish either of these two things.<a name=9:4></a> God found fault with the first covenant, as we are told in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>, because it failed to make Him known in the hearts of His people; and the law, with the whole system of sacrifices connected with it, is taken away in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, because it was so entirely powerless to give a purged conscience to those who approached God.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now in connection with Christ we get all the grace of the new covenant, God revealed in supreme and blessed grace on the one hand, and on the other His people purged and perfected in their consciences, so that they may be able to "draw near with a true heart".<a name=9:6></a> Consequent upon the death of Christ two things are made good: believers are (1) "sanctified" and (2) "perfected for ever" (verses 10, 14).<a name=9:7></a> "Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God .<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a>.<a name=9:10></a> .<a name=9:11></a> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once".<a name=9:12></a> Believers are sanctified, or set apart, according to the pleasure of God.<a name=9:13></a> It is His pleasure to have a people whom He can regard according to His own estimate of the value of the death of Christ; it is His pleasure to have a people entirely divested of every trace of unsuitability to Himself; and this not by a progressive work carried on in them, but by the infinite efficacy of the "offering of the body of Jesus Christ".<a name=9:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to what the believer is in himself, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>supposes that he is nothing but a heap of sins.<a name=10:1></a> Morally my whole history is covered by that one word SINS.<a name=10:2></a> As a child of fallen Adam, nothing could come out of me but sins, the sad evidence of my corruption and irretrievable ruin.<a name=10:3></a> But in the "offering of the body of Jesus Christ" God has been glorified in the execution of a righteous sentence upon me and my sins.<a name=10:4></a> Christ has gone into death vicariously, and in His death there has been such a judgment of sin and sins that in the eyes of God not a stain of guilt, not a spot of contamination, remains upon His people.<a name=10:5></a> They are set apart in the will of God, and according to His pleasure, from everything that they were naturally and from everything that attached to them as Adam's children in this world.<a name=10:6></a> Such is the efficacy and such is the result of the death of Christ looked at from God's side.<a name=10:7></a> It has secured for Him a sanctified people suited to Himself.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, on the other hand, this has to be made known and to be made good in the consciences of believers, or they would have no liberty to approach God.<a name=10:9></a> Hence we read, "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".<a name=10:10></a> If we compare this statement with chapter 9: 9, we shall see that the perfection here referred to is perfection "pertaining to the conscience".<a name=10:11></a> It is not by any means that the believer is brought into a state of perfection as to his actual condition in this world; we shall only attain perfection in <i>condition</i> when we are conformed to the image of God's Son in glory, but perfection in <i>conscience</i> we not only may know now, but if we have it not we must be more or less in legal darkness and in ignorance of the true grace of God.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer is in his conscience with God, not as identified with his sins and all the imperfection that attached to him as a man in this world, but as identified with the value of the "one offering" of Christ.<a name=10:13></a> He knows the efficacy of that offering and rejoices in it as that by which his sins have been completely and eternally purged.<a name=10:14></a> It is not that he thinks
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		lightly of his sins, but he has come to know and appreciate the value of the death of Christ.<a name=11:1></a> That death has cleared everything away in the estimation of God, so that He can have His people before Him in the beauty of divine sanctification, and it has cleared everything away in the estimation of the believer's conscience, enlightened by grace, so that every question of sins is settled; he is as to this matter "perfected".<a name=11:2></a> And inasmuch as the ground of this perfection is the unalterable value of the death of Christ, he is "perfected for ever".<a name=11:3></a> The believer's place with God according to divine grace is not changeable; he is not sometimes on the ground of Christ's death and sometimes on the ground of his own good behaviour.<a name=11:4></a> The value of the "one offering" does not fluctuate with his changing moods and feelings, nor with the ebbings and flowings of his joy.<a name=11:5></a> It abides as the only and the unchanging ground on which God can have a people for Himself.<a name=11:6></a> The believer who apprehends this is on solid ground; he is acquainted with the grace of God, and he knows the secure basis on which all the activities of that grace are based; he is perfected in perpetuity.<a name=11:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing in the chapter before us which connects itself with all this in a very blessed way.<a name=11:8></a> I refer to verse 16: "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more".<a name=11:9></a> Here we see the effect of grace being known in the hearts of men.<a name=11:10></a> It becomes a pleasure to them to be controlled by the will of God, for the things which are on a man's heart and mind are things which give him pleasure: and along with this they have the blessed consciousness that the question of their sins has been entirely and eternally disposed of.<a name=11:11></a> The great thought of God is to have His people near Himself, with not a single outstanding question between Himself and them, and this in order that they may find their undistracted delight in Him and in being controlled by His pleasure.<a name=11:12></a> God would have His people

		conscious that there is nothing between Himself and them; He would have them conscious that they are a forgiven people, that thus they may realize the "blessedness" which David describes in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32">Psalm  32</a>"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.<a name=12:1></a> Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile".<a name=12:2></a> This is

	<div class="paragraph">
		This leaves the believer free in his spirit to approach God.<a name=14:9></a> God has brought us out of everything that attached to us in our responsibility as children of Adam, that we might be free to approach Him on another ground altogether; He has forgiven us all trespasses, that we might be free to apprehend His pleasure concerning us, that we might know what it is to be quickened together with Christ (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:13">Colossians  2:13</a>).<a name=14:10></a> There is an entire settlement of every question connected with our responsible history, so that we may approach God as those whose hearts and consciences are free to enter into a circle where there is nothing but the perfection of Christ.<a name=14:11></a> If we have learned that God has approached us in His wondrous grace according to the preciousness and perfection of Christ -- if God has dealt with us, not according to what we are, but according to what CHRIST is -- the suited response to that

	<div class="paragraph">
		The clear and simple statements of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>leave no uncertainty as to this.<a name=22:13></a> But, in the first place, we are warned against five roads which <i>do not lead to justification</i>.<a name=22:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. This great blessing comes not by <i>natural descent</i>.<a name=22:15></a> It was not enough for the Jew to be descended from Abraham.<a name=22:16></a> He must needs walk in the steps of <i>Abraham's faith</i>.<a name=22:17></a> Otherwise he would find himself among those "children of the kingdom" who "shall be cast out into outer darkness" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:12">Matthew  8:12</a>).<a name=22:18></a> See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:11">Romans  4:11</a> - 18.<a name=22:19></a> It is a great privilege to be a child of believing parents, but this <i>will not justify</i>.<a name=22:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. Nor can we be justified <i>by the law</i>.<a name=22:21></a> For, if so, <i>faith</i> would be "made void, and the promise made of none effect" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:14">Romans  4:14</a>).<a name=22:22></a> The law has the opposite effect to justifying

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		-- it "worketh wrath" (4: 15) -- and in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:20">Romans  3:20</a> we are plainly told that "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is <i>the knowledge of sin</i>".<a name=23:1></a> In another part of Scripture we read that "as many as are of the works of the law are <i>under the curse</i>", and "that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<a name=23:2></a> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:10">Galatians  3:10</a> - 12).<a name=23:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. It is equally impossible to be justified by <i>works of any kind</i>.<a name=23:4></a> Thus boasting is excluded, and all the pretensions of man set aside.<a name=23:5></a> (See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:27">Romans  3:27</a>; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:2">Romans  4:2</a> - 4.<a name=23:6></a>) It is the faith of "him that <i>worketh not</i>" that is counted to him for righteousness.<a name=23:7></a> God imputes to the believer "righteousness <i>without works</i>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:5">Romans  4:5</a>, 6).<a name=23:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. Nor have <i>ordinances</i> any part in this matter of justification.<a name=23:9></a> It was "not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision", that "faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:9">Romans  4:9</a> - 11).<a name=23:10></a> Neither baptism nor the Lord's supper confers any saving grace or benefit.<a name=23:11></a> To suppose that they do is an awful perversion of those sacred institutions, and a soul-destroying delusion.<a name=23:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5. Finally, it might be urged that, at any rate, a man must be godly and pious before God would justify him.<a name=23:13></a> But the Scripture before us will not allow that this is the case.<a name=23:14></a> It is expressly said that God "justifieth the UNGODLY" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:5">Romans  4:5</a>).<a name=23:15></a> So that it is neither by natural descent, nor of the law, nor by works, nor through ordinances, nor because of our piety, that we are justified.<a name=23:16></a> "Therefore we conclude that a man is"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. "Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness" (verse 3).<a name=24:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness" (verse 5).<a name=24:2></a>

		3. "Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed" (or counted) "to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed" (or counted), "if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification" (verses 23 - 25).<a name=24:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well that we should ponder the deeply instructive illustration of faith which is here presented so prominently.<a name=24:4></a> Abraham was childless, and, according to nature, beyond the possibility of having seed, when God "brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:5">Genesis  15:5</a>).<a name=24:5></a> If Abraham had thought of himself, he would have said, "This is impossible".<a name=24:6></a> But his eye was altogether turned from himself To GOD.<a name=24:7></a> There are no difficulties or impossibilities with GOD, and "Abraham believed GOD".<a name=24:8></a> The thing promised was wholly outside the range of sight, reason, and experience.<a name=24:9></a> In fact, it was outside the course of nature altogether, and could only be brought about in the power of <i>resurrection</i>.<a name=24:10></a> The God in whom he believed was the "God who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=24:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the justification of an ungodly man is as great an impossibility, if you leave God out, as the birth of Isaac or the resurrection of a dead man.<a name=24:12></a> If we ask in the sphere of reason and nature, "Can a dead man be raised?<a name=24:13></a>" the answer would be "Impossible!<a name=24:14></a>" In the same sphere it is just as impossible for an ungodly man to be justified.<a name=24:15></a> But with God nothing is impossible, and He <i>has</i> raised One from the dead, and He <i>does</i> justify the ungodly sinner who believes

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark this well, that righteousness shall be imputed to us "if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=25:6></a> This brings us to the consideration of

		<center>THE MEASURE AND CHARACTER OF JUSTIFICATION, </center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as set forth in Christ risen.<a name=25:7></a> The righteousness which God imputes to the believer is set forth in Jesus our Lord.<a name=25:8></a> He is for ever beyond the range of sin, law, judgment, and death, in absolute and eternal suitability to God, and to that new world which He has entered as raised from the dead.<a name=25:9></a> And HE IS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF EVERY BELIEVER.<a name=25:10></a> Our justification is set forth in CHRIST.<a name=25:11></a> Hence we are "justified <i>by faith</i>".<a name=25:12></a> If we were justified in ourselves there would be no need for faith; it is because we are justified in Another that faith comes in.<a name=25:13></a> "<i>In him</i> all that believe are justified from all things" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:39">Acts  13:39</a>).<a name=25:14></a> If we look at ourselves, we see much that will not do for God; but if we look at our risen Saviour, we see nothing but perfect and eternal suitability to God.<a name=25:15></a> And all that is set forth in HIM is put to the account of the believer.<a name=25:16></a> We have been divested by His death of every spot and stain of sin, and now we see in HIM the perfection of the righteousness with which we are invested in the eyes of God.<a name=25:17></a> HE is our righteousness, and as we apprehend and appropriate Him thus we are "justified by faith".<a name=25:18></a>

		and Christ went into death to remove all that by bearing its judgment, that thus He might bring to an end before God an order of things in which nothing but iniquity, transgression, and sin were found.<a name=26:1></a> But in His resurrection we see MAN introduced to an entirely new position, placed, as we have said, beyond death and judgment, and outside the range of sin and the law, in perfect and eternal suitability to the pleasure of God.<a name=26:2></a> That this is absolutely true of Christ no believer would think for a moment of doubting.<a name=26:3></a> But it is an immense thing to see that He has been raised again with a view to God's thoughts concerning us -- He has been raised "for our justification".<a name=26:4></a> And if we would learn the character of the righteousness which is imputed to us by God, we must look at that risen One.<a name=26:5></a> We are identified before God -- that is, in the mind of God -- with all the perfection of Christ.<a name=26:6></a> Christ is made unto us righteousness.<a name=26:7></a>

		Now what is the effect of the soul's apprehension of this by faith?<a name=26:8></a> Cloudless and everlasting peace.<a name=26:9></a> Every question is settled.<a name=26:10></a> Satan cannot touch our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=26:11></a> He can never bring a spot or a cloud on the acceptance of that blessed One.<a name=26:12></a> And HE is our righteousness.<a name=26:13></a> We have come into the knowledge of what God Himself has effected that He might carry out His own thoughts of blessing to usward.<a name=26:14></a> He has taken everything into account, and has cleared away in holy judgment all that we were in our sins that He might impute righteousness to us.<a name=26:15></a> And the measure and character of that righteousness is set forth in Christ risen.<a name=26:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ has accomplished righteousness, and His "one righteousness" is "towards all men for justification of life".<a name=27:9></a> The death of Christ, regarded from this point of view, has a very wide scope; it is "towards all men".<a name=27:10></a> It is on God's part the great setting forth to men of righteousness, of the true desert of sin, and of the holy judgment of God, and this withal in absolute grace.<a name=27:11></a> God would have men to learn righteousness in the death of Christ -- that is, in the way of unmingled grace -- that they may derive a new moral constitution from Christ, and have "justification of life".<a name=27:12></a> By a new moral constitution I mean that the believer gets a true apprehension in his soul of righteousness according to God.<a name=27:13></a> The death of Christ sets forth that judgment must come upon all that we are as in the flesh, and the believer accepts this; yea, he rejoices in the fact that judgment has come upon him in the way of grace in the death of Christ.<a name=27:14></a> This is certainly a feature which could by no means be found in a natural

		man.<a name=28:1></a> All the lust, pride, and self-importance of man rebels against such a thought, but the believer, through grace, rejoices in it.<a name=28:2></a> He has an entirely new estimate of things -- a divine estimate of sin and of righteousness.<a name=28:3></a> He recognizes that nothing attached to him as a man in the flesh but sin, and he rejoices to know that it has all been judged in the death of Christ.<a name=28:4></a> And, on the other hand, he loves to trace the moral beauty, the excellence, the perfection, of CHRIST as that alone which could be acceptable to God or appreciated by Him.<a name=28:5></a> He accepts the judgment which he once refused, and that which was once worthless in his eyes is now of inestimable value.<a name=28:6></a> He is thus "constituted righteous" as deriving morally from Christ.<a name=28:7></a> In short, he has acquired a new moral constitution by learning righteousness and love in the death of Christ, and by coming into the presence of all that grace and moral perfection which is set forth in the Lord Jesus Christ, all of which he enters into in the power of the Holy Ghost given to him to this end.<a name=28:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the believer is not only <i>accounted</i> righteous, as we have seen before, but he is <i>constituted</i> righteous -- he comes into "justification of life".<a name=28:9></a> And the practical outcome of this is that he walks in self-judgment, and is taught by the grace of God to live "soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:12">Titus  2:12</a>).<a name=28:10></a> He fulfils the righteous requirement of the law, and brings forth the fruit of the Spirit -- "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance".<a name=28:11></a> It is well said that "against such there is now law" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:22">Galatians  5:22</a>, 23).<a name=28:12></a> Such a one has "justification of life".<a name=28:13></a>

		<a href="../bible/James.htm#2:17">James  2:17</a> - 26.<a name=28:14></a> If a man's faith has no moral effect upon him, it is, as James says a "dead" faith.<a name=28:15></a> It has not really

		brought the light and blessing of God's grace into his soul, and of what value is a faith which does not do this?<a name=29:1></a> But, on the other hand, it is important to see that the "works" by which a man is justified are not necessarily what men would call "good works" at all.<a name=29:2></a> The two examples given prove this very distinctly, for the first is that of Abraham offering up his son, and the second is that of Rahab betraying her country, neither of them very creditable things from man's point of view.<a name=29:3></a> The works which justify are those works which FAITH produces, and which evidence that it is an operative principle in the soul of the believer, and not a mere assent to creeds and doctrines.<a name=29:4></a> Faith brings the knowledge of God into a man's soul, and this makes him willing to give up what is naturally dear to him -- his self-importance, his religious position and reputation in this world, and all the things in which he was most gratified as a natural man.<a name=29:5></a> It also breaks the power of those ties and associations which exist among men, and brings a man out of them to take his place with the people of God.<a name=29:6></a> Such are the works of faith, by which a man is justified.<a name=29:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many who assent to the doctrines of Christianity, or to the creeds of Christendom, and they call themselves "believers".<a name=29:8></a> They would stoutly maintain, it may be, among other things, the doctrine of "justification by faith".<a name=29:9></a> But their faith, such as it is, has no moral effect on them.<a name=29:10></a> It does not separate them from the world, or lead them to surrender what is gratifying to them as men in the flesh.<a name=29:11></a> They go on with their pleasures, their money-making, their hobbies and ambitions, and with all the social and political engagements of the world.<a name=29:12></a> Theirs is a faith without vitality -- a faith which is worthless and "dead".<a name=29:13></a> It is a very important truth, especially in days when the Christian faith is professed in some form by so many, that a man must be "justified by works".<a name=29:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		ACCEPTANCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the privilege of every believer to be consciously in the favour of God -- to be in the unclouded light and joy of Acceptance.<a name=30:1></a> But, alas!<a name=30:2></a> many who are truly converted are not in the enjoyment of this privilege.<a name=30:3></a> It may be helpful to consider briefly <i>why</i> not.<a name=30:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The things which hinder converted persons from having the light and joy of Acceptance may be classed under the four following heads:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<ol><li>SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS</li><li>SELF-IMPROVEMENT</li><li>SELF-GRATIFICATION</li><li>SELF-OCCUPATION</li></ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I speak of <i>self-righteousness</i> in this connection I do not mean the proud self-righteousness of the unconverted man.<a name=30:5></a> I refer to the very different form of self-righteousness which leads many to doubt their acceptance with God <i>because of the imperfections which they find in themselves</i>.<a name=30:6></a> You may say, "But <i>ought</i> I not to have misgivings when I find my spirit and the state of my mind so contrary to that which befits a Christian?<a name=30:7></a> and when I am conscious of inconsistencies and backslidings?<a name=30:8></a>" That you ought to judge yourself, and be humbled before God about these things, is most true; but it is in no wise true that your righteousness and acceptance with God depend upon yourself, or are measured by your condition or conduct.<a name=30:9></a> To have such a thought in the mind is really to suppose that you could be in the favour of God by being worthy of that favour in yourself.<a name=30:10></a> It is simply <i>self-righteousness</i>.<a name=30:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then souls reason in this way: "Surely if I were converted I should be very different.<a name=31:1></a> There must be a great change in one who is born again.<a name=31:2></a> And if I had the Spirit of God He would help me to gain the victory over evil habits -- over the lusts and tempers of the flesh -- and to become pleasing to God.<a name=31:3></a> But instead of this more temptations seem to come in my way than ever before, and the evil tendencies of my heart seem to have acquired greater strength.<a name=31:4></a> I never felt more utterly unworthy of God's favour and acceptance".<a name=31:5></a> It is not always easy to see that <i>self-righteousness</i> is hidden under all this, yet such is the case.<a name=31:6></a> There is the thought that, either by our own efforts, or by God's grace and the help of His Spirit, we should become <i>in ourselves</i> suitable to God's favour; and we are disappointed and distressed to find that we make so little progress in this direction.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to know that the effect of the new birth, and of the grace of God, is not to bring about some change in us on which we could rest, but to convince us of the <i>impossibility</i> of finding righteousness, or suitability to the favour of God, in ourselves.<a name=31:8></a> An unconverted man may think himself worthy of God's favour, but every converted person is made conscious of utter unfitness in himself for that favour.<a name=31:9></a> The awakened soul gives account of itself in such language, as, "I have sinned"; "I am undone"; "I am vile"; "I abhor myself".<a name=31:10></a> Indeed, it is a common thing for such to suppose that since they turned to God the evil tendencies of their hearts had increased rather than otherwise.<a name=31:11></a> The fact is that before conversion we went with the stream, and not a ripple impeded our progress; when, by grace, we made some stand <i>against</i> the current, we began to feel its force, and to be distressed by it, as never before.<a name=31:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I should like to bring two circles before the consideration of your hearts -- a circle of darkness and a circle of light -- each having for its centre the Lord Jesus.<a name=31:13></a> The thought of the first is presented to us in a solemn way by the words,

		Now, a new scene opens, as we read, "And was raised again for our justification".<a name=32:16></a> An Old Testament saint might stand on a mountain-top, and seeing the landscape blotted out as a dense cloud from the sea rolled over it, might think of the words, "I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#44:22">Isaiah  44:22</a>).<a name=32:17></a> As he looked into the distances of space he would be reminded that "as far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103:12">Psalm  103:12</a>).<a name=32:18></a> He could hardly catch a glimpse of the gleaming snows of Lebanon without thinking of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#1:18">Isaiah  1:18</a> or <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51:7">Psalm  51:7</a>.<a name=32:19></a> But for the believer now all these material figures give place to a living Person -- a Person in spotless suitability to that new

		I should like to read two scriptures which have very pointed reference to this matter.<a name=38:7></a> "And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:24">Galatians  5:24</a>).<a name=38:8></a> "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:1">1 Peter  4:1</a>, 2).<a name=38:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<center>SELF-OCCUPATION.<a name=40:6></a> </center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure that this underlies the hindrances which we have already looked at, but there are forms of self-occupation which perhaps hardly fall under the three previous heads, and yet are a withering blight upon the joy of Acceptance.<a name=40:7></a> There are four kinds of self-occupation.<a name=40:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. <i>Self-occupation as to soul experience</i>.<a name=40:9></a> A beloved servant, now with the Lord, used to say that he never knew souls much occupied with experience -- whether that of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5">Galatians  5</a>, or holiness by faith -- that it did not end in making <i>self</i> a great object of consideration.<a name=40:10></a> Some minds are always attracted by what is experimental.<a name=40:11></a> They do not know deliverance, and experimental truths seem to offer that which they are seeking.<a name=40:12></a> They are not seeking an increased knowledge of <i>the Grace of God</i>, or deepened acquaintance with <i>Christ</i> ; their object of desire is to have a more satisfactory experience.<a name=40:13></a> That is, <i>self</i> is still their centre.<a name=40:14></a> And such souls are constantly occupied either in bemoaning how little they have got or attained, or in complacently assuming that they have reached a certain stage of experience.<a name=40:15></a> It has often been remarked that in the writings of those who advocate "holiness by faith" the beauty and perfection of what Christ is in Himself as an all-blessing Object for the heart is very little presented.<a name=40:16></a> Christ is set forth as <i>One who can bring about a new experience</i> in the believer, and it is easy to see that the new experience has often a more prominent place in the mind than Christ.<a name=40:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remedy for all this is to have <i>the purpose of God</i> distinctly in view, and His purpose is to have us before Him "as sons with Him who is above".<a name=41:1></a> It is God's pleasure that we should "receive the adoption of sons" -- that is, receive the place of sonship as a gift.<a name=41:2></a> This is no question of effort, experience, or attainment.<a name=41:3></a> It is the glorious purpose of divine love, and infinitely transcends every conception of blessing that could be formed in our minds.<a name=41:4></a> No standard of experience, however exalted, and no goal of attainment, however advanced, which we could propose to ourselves could possibly come up to <i>sonship</i>.<a name=41:5></a> Whatever your ideal may be, the purpose of God eclipses it.<a name=41:6></a> Your standard of perfection dims and fades before the glorious light of the divine purpose.<a name=41:7></a> Indeed, there is but one Person in whom you can learn the exceeding greatness and blessedness of your place according to the love and purpose of God, and that is the Son of God.<a name=41:8></a> God has predestinated us to be "conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>).<a name=41:9></a> We are "sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus", and because we are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a>; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>).<a name=41:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find that when souls are occupied with experience -- whether it be in connection with holiness, power for service, or spiritual attainment -- they always have something before them less than the purpose of God.<a name=41:11></a> They are either pursuing, or are satisfied with, something less than that which divine love proposes, and thus they are losers to an incalculable extent.<a name=41:12></a> It is when the purpose of God in its greatness is before our hearts, and we are mightily attracted by it, that our experience becomes like that of the beloved servant who could say, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.<a name=41:13></a> Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. <i>Self-occupation in service</i>.<a name=42:3></a> It is a sad thing when <i>service</i> interferes with <i>soul-prosperity</i>.<a name=42:4></a> Service may take possession of the heart until it becomes the theme of conversation, the subject-matter of correspondence, and the centre round which the thoughts continually revolve.<a name=42:5></a> It is possible to be so engrossed with service that one's meditations are coloured by it, one's prayers are full of it, and the Word of God becomes simply a quarry out of which material for sermons and addresses can be dug.<a name=42:6></a> This is a serious loss to the soul, and many are thereby hindered from making spiritual progress.<a name=42:7></a> Very often young believers who have not even peace with God are encouraged to take up service, and they become so occupied with what they are doing that they are not at leisure to learn or to take their place in the favour of God.<a name=42:8></a> Hence, so long as the service prospers, and they get on pretty well with it, they are happy.<a name=42:9></a> The service is their life.<a name=42:10></a> But when there is no success, and the whole thing seems to be a failure, their joy collapses; and they have to discover how little they have really got, and in many cases to find that they are perfect strangers to the liberty and joy of Acceptance.<a name=42:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel sure that it is a much greater thing with God that we should be in the enjoyment of peace with Him, in the light of His favour, and in the acceptance of sonship, than that we should be preaching, teaching, or giving away tracts.<a name=42:12></a> I do not undervalue service, and I thank God for every true servant, but I am sure that <i>the first thing in the mind of God</i> is to bring us to Himself -- into the enjoyment of His favour, which is better than life -- into the real liberty and satisfaction of heart in divine love which is connected with Acceptance.<a name=42:13></a>

		Anything which occupies us so that we are diverted from this is <i>a positive hindrance</i>, even if it be a thing apparently so excellent as service.<a name=43:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. <i>Self-occupation induced by physical weakness</i>.<a name=43:2></a> Believers with weakly bodies are in special danger of becoming very self-centred.<a name=43:3></a> Their condition and circumstances tend to make them very much objects of consideration to themselves.<a name=43:4></a> There may be need for great care, for special diet and treatment, and this very often turns to self-occupation, and the soul's spiritual joy declines.<a name=43:5></a> I dare say some of my hearers have no difficulty in recognizing the symptoms of this baneful malady.<a name=43:6></a> You would like to know if there is a cure for it.<a name=43:7></a> Well, I believe there is.<a name=43:8></a> The remedy for this kind of self-occupation is to know the love and support of Christ as Priest.<a name=43:9></a> I believe the Priesthood of Christ comes into exercise to sustain us above the self-occupation into which we should otherwise sink.<a name=43:10></a> In His love He makes His sympathy a reality to our hearts, and the fact that He considers our trouble and has known our soul in adversity as One touched with the feeling of our infirmities, having been in all points tempted like as we are apart from sin, draws our hearts to Him in a very blessed way.<a name=43:11></a> In nearness to Himself we enjoy His love, and are assured of His support, and the moment our hearts come consciously into the circle of His love self is no longer the centre.<a name=43:12></a> It is in thus drawing our hearts to Himself that Christ succours us.<a name=43:13></a> To find that we are objects of consideration to Him is an infinite solace, and it brings Him before our hearts in such a way that we are sustained above the consideration of ourselves.<a name=43:14></a> There is the positive support of His love; and thus our weakness becomes the occasion of proving the personal love and support of Christ, so that we are sustained in the joy of God's favour.<a name=43:15></a> We are sensible that we need support -- that the love of Christ in this blessed way is an indispensable necessity -- but we may have the support that we need.<a name=43:16></a> The love of Christ makes it available for us; His

		It is thus, as having access by faith into the favour of God, as being alive unto God in Christ Jesus, as being armed with the mind to suffer in the flesh, and as delivered from self-occupation of every kind, that we may know what it is, not only to be clear as to the doctrine, but to be in <i>the light and joy</i> of Acceptance.<a name=44:11></a> God would have us to enjoy His favour, which is better than life, and to know the answer in our souls to the wondrous desire, "that the love wherewith thou halt loved me may be in them, and I in them".<a name=44:12></a> Thus may we "find in Abba's favour our spirit's present home".<a name=44:13></a>

		I should like to refer to another thing in Mephibosheth's case, because it illustrates an important point in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=52:7></a> I mean the full and practical acceptance of judgment upon what we may speak of as his "old man".<a name=52:8></a> What Ziba said of him so slanderously was just what we might have expected him to say according to nature.<a name=52:9></a> "Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#16:3">2 Samuel  16:3</a>).<a name=52:10></a> But Mephibosheth's account of himself and of his father's house is in perfect and beautiful contrast to this.<a name=52:11></a> He says, "For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#19:28">2 Samuel  19:28</a>).<a name=52:12></a> It is lovely to see him acknowledging that death was upon him as of his father's house.<a name=52:13></a> Nor does he wish it otherwise, for all the associations and interests of his life had been transferred to another centre.<a name=52:14></a> All that was <i>life</i> in his estimation was bound up with David.<a name=52:15></a> He lived not as of the household of Saul, but by David's grace; his life was in those things which were ministered to him by David.<a name=52:16></a> There was not the smallest disposition on his part to

		This chapter, which states so plainly that He has died to sin, brings with equal distinctness before us the circle in which He lives.<a name=56:5></a> "Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father" (verse 4).<a name=56:6></a> The sphere of man's glory has refused and rejected Him, but the glory of the Father has raised and received Him.<a name=56:7></a> These are the two great moral circles brought before us in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=56:8></a> These circles subsist today, and <i>death rolls between them</i>.<a name=56:9></a> Now, I ask, in which circle is your life?<a name=56:10></a> Are you drawn in affection to Christ in that new world of light and love where He lives unto God?<a name=56:11></a> Can you say that you know what it is to be bound up with Him?<a name=56:12></a> Then I am sure the power of the world is broken for your heart.<a name=56:13></a> For you could not be drawn to Him without finding His death between you and the whole sphere of sin.<a name=56:14></a> You could not be drawn to Him without having in your soul something of what Paul expressed when he said, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:14">Galatians  6:14</a>).<a name=56:15></a> And the one of whom this is true is dead to sin.<a name=56:16></a> He would take as little interest in what is going on in the sphere of man's will as Mephibosheth took in what was going on in Jerusalem in the absence of David.<a name=56:17></a> It is in the power of affection for Christ that we can reckon ourselves "to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=56:18></a>

		It would hardly be of much interest to an unconverted man, or to a worldly believer, to unfold how we are delivered from the law.<a name=58:2></a> The soul must, in some measure at least, be in the good of what is presented in chapter 6 before it would be prepared to appreciate the aspect of Deliverance which is brought before us in chapter 7.<a name=58:3></a> There would be found in anyone who was really "in the seventh of Romans" an intense separation from the world, a holy abhorrence of sin, and a vehement desire to do the will of God.<a name=58:4></a> The will of God has become the glory and delight of his heart; sin is no longer any glory or pleasure to him.<a name=58:5></a> Now his distress and complaint is that he finds himself perfectly incapable of carrying out that on which his heart is set.<a name=58:6></a> He finds himself altogether incompetent for the will of God, though it commands both his conscience and his heart.<a name=58:7></a> But this helplessness arises from the fact that he is under the law, and therefore in his conscience, on the ground of a man living in the flesh; for "the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth".<a name=58:8></a> It is the supposed case of one who is set for the will of God; but who is, as to his consciousness, <i>dissociated from Christ</i>.<a name=58:9></a> From the seventh verse to the twenty-fourth there is no mention of Christ, and, so far as the soul's consciousness is concerned, there might be no such Person in existence.<a name=58:10></a> Hence there is absolute weakness, no fruit for God, and the soul can only cry, "O wretched man that I am!<a name=58:11></a>" Here we see the realization of those words of Christ, "Without me ye can do nothing" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:5">John  15:5</a>).<a name=58:12></a> I will now seek to show the way of deliverance from this legal bondage.<a name=58:13></a>

		It is important to observe that the apostle, in writing as he does in this chapter, has Jewish believers specially in view that is, those who had been under the law, for he says "I speak to them that know the law" (verse 1).<a name=58:14></a> It was most essential <i>for such</i> to know the divine way of deliverance from

		and a divinely created obligation could only be set aside in a divine way.<a name=59:1></a> The apostle recognizes that the bond between the law and those who were under it was as inviolable as the marriage bond, which he takes up as an illustration.<a name=59:2></a> That is, <i>death alone could annul it</i>.<a name=59:3></a> If God has put a man under the law, the law will have dominion over him "as long as he liveth".<a name=59:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But death <i>has</i> come in.<a name=59:5></a> Christ was "made under the law", and fulfilled it perfectly in His holy life, and on the cross He bore its curse for those who were under it.<a name=59:6></a> But when His dead body hung upon the cross He had passed out of the condition of life to which law applied.<a name=59:7></a> We saw in the previous chapter that He died to <i>sin</i>, and it is just as true that He has died to <i>the law</i>.<a name=59:8></a> And we have "become dead to the law by the body of Christ" (verse 4).<a name=59:9></a> The principle of being in the same relation to things as Christ is, applied to sin in chapter 6, is here seen to be the believer's privilege in respect of the law.<a name=59:10></a> But in this case it is not only a privilege that may be entered upon, but it is the place in which the believer is set by an act of God.<a name=59:11></a> "Ye also are become dead [or, have been made dead] to the law by the body of Christ".<a name=59:12></a> The law and those who were under it had been joined together by God, but death has come in and the bond is severed.<a name=59:13></a> So that "now we are delivered from the law, having died in that in which we were held" (verse 6).<a name=59:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If this was so in the case of those who had been put under the law by God, it must be perfectly evident that Gentile believers are not under the law.<a name=59:15></a> If God takes pains to show us that the bond is dissolved where it did exist, we may be quite sure that no such bond has been formed in the case of Gentile believers who had never been under the law.<a name=59:16></a> We are not come to Mount Sinai, but to Mount Zion.<a name=59:17></a> "Ye are not under the law, but under grace".<a name=59:18></a>

		I will take for granted that we rejoice in the fact that we are under obligation to the will of God, and that we also recognize that we have "become dead to the law by the body of Christ".<a name=60:5></a> Now it becomes a matter of the greatest interest to us to know <i>how the will of God comes to us</i>.<a name=60:6></a> The answer is very simple and blessed.<a name=60:7></a> It comes to us in CHRIST.<a name=60:8></a> We do not acquire our knowledge of what is pleasing to God through the law, but by being brought under the sway of Christ -- by being "married to Another, even to Him who is raised from the dead".<a name=60:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the third part of our subject; that is, deliverance from the flesh.<a name=64:13></a> It is possible to make a distinction between "sin" and "the flesh", because innocent Adam was in flesh without sin.<a name=64:14></a> The Lord Jesus, too, was in flesh without sin.<a name=64:15></a> But by the fall that terrible principle of evil, which had already manifested itself in the devil and other spiritual beings, came into connection with flesh, and flesh became "sinful" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>).<a name=64:16></a> <i>Sin</i> has become characteristic of the state and condition in which we are found as Adam's children in this world.<a name=64:17></a> Hence the expression "the flesh" is frequently used in Scripture to convey in one brief and striking term the thought of all that is morally connected with us as children of fallen Adam.<a name=64:18></a> Now the question is,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=65>[Page 65]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How can we be completely superior to it?<a name=65:1></a> We shall find from the chapter before us that the power of deliverance from the flesh lies in the Spirit of God.<a name=65:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first verse of the chapter (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>) is of the deepest importance, as indicating how alone the believer can be clear of condemnation.<a name=65:3></a> "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus".<a name=65:4></a> It is not exactly here the condemnation of God that is in question, but condemnation in one's own soul.<a name=65:5></a> The believer takes the ground with God of one who is in spirit completely apart from all the imperfection that attached to him as in the flesh.<a name=65:6></a> He recognizes that not one whit of the flesh will do for God, and that he can only be with God according to the state and acceptance of another Man, even Christ Jesus, in which state and acceptance there is no flaw, but the most complete suitability to the thoughts and love of God.<a name=65:7></a> So long as the believer is in his conscience "in the flesh" he is under the law, and therefore under a sense of condemnation.<a name=65:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then from verse 3 we learn that the law was incapable of giving effect to the pleasure of God.<a name=65:9></a> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=65:10></a> The law could neither put the flesh right, nor remove it for the glory of God.<a name=65:11></a> The first was impossible, but the second has been accomplished in the death of Christ, and it is on this ground that the Spirit is given to believers.<a name=65:12></a> God has condemned sin in the flesh.<a name=65:13></a> The flesh is a condemned thing, and, as far as God is concerned, it has <i>gone</i> from His eye in judgment.<a name=65:14></a> Now the Spirit is given to set us on another line altogether, and to form us in an entirely new state.<a name=65:15></a> And as we are formed in that new state, we are necessarily delivered from what was characteristic of our old state.<a name=65:16></a> I can only now ask you briefly to consider three points in the chapter.<a name=65:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,

	<div class="paragraph">
		who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<a name=66:1></a> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit" (verses 4, 5).<a name=66:2></a> It must be apparent to all that tastes and motives which are formed by the Spirit are necessarily quite diverse from the tastes and motives of the flesh.<a name=66:3></a> Now I could not conceive such a thing as a Christian having the Spirit without having a wholly new set of tastes and motives.<a name=66:4></a> You see the proof of this in every good convert.<a name=66:5></a> He has acquired new tastes; he loves the Word of God, and prayer, and the company of the saints; and he abhors the things that formerly were his greatest gratification.<a name=66:6></a> The truth is, though he may know nothing of the doctrine of it, he is now walking according to the Spirit, and is maintained in superiority to the flesh.<a name=66:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian, as such, is "according to the Spirit".<a name=66:8></a> His desires, motives, and tastes are entirely new.<a name=66:9></a> He no longer "minds" the things of the flesh; they are no longer objects of desire or pursuit with him; but as he formerly minded those things so he now minds the things of the Spirit.<a name=66:10></a> If a man has a taste for horses, pictures, or music, he minds those things.<a name=66:11></a> He makes them his object; he seeks them; he goes where they are to be seen or heard; he is characterized by the things for which he has a taste.<a name=66:12></a> And, as a rule, a man of the world will make everything bend to the gratification of his tastes.<a name=66:13></a> Now those who are according to the Spirit mind "the things of the Spirit".<a name=66:14></a> I suppose many here know what it is to come into an entirely new world of interests and affections, and in minding these new things to find the power and control of the old tastes completely broken.<a name=66:15></a> This is the way of deliverance from the flesh.<a name=66:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it may be said that there are many who profess to be converted in whom these new tastes are very feeble, and for whose hearts the "things of the Spirit" do not seem to have much attraction.<a name=66:17></a> Well, this is very sad, but it is easy to account for it.<a name=66:18></a> It will be found that in the majority of such cases

		peace with God is not known, and what such souls need is the ministry of the Gospel of the Grace of God in power to their hearts.<a name=67:1></a> The truth is their hearts are not really won for God, and they are not in the enjoyment of His grace.<a name=67:2></a> Then, no doubt, there are many cases where the Spirit is so grieved and hindered that souls have hardly any of the good of His presence.<a name=67:3></a> If you are going on with the world, or there is a want of uprightness about you, your spiritual development will be greatly impeded.<a name=67:4></a> In such a case the Christian is not true to his colours; he is not true to his proper character; practically he is more "after the flesh" than "after the Spirit", and this is not Christianity at all.<a name=67:5></a> He is one to whom it might well be said, "Now it is high time to awake out of sleep".<a name=67:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of great importance to "mind" the things of the Spirit.<a name=67:7></a> If your spiritual tastes are feeble, it is probably because you cultivate them so little.<a name=67:8></a> I have heard believers complain that they had not much desire for the Word of God and prayer, and I have often found in such cases that story books and religious novels were being read with avidity.<a name=67:9></a> You will never make any headway until you break with this kind of thing.<a name=67:10></a> Minding the "things of the Spirit" will bring you into touch with your brethren, and you will find that there are many whose hearts are, through grace, after those things.<a name=67:11></a> And in this way we come into a new circle, outside everything that is of the flesh, where divine affections are found.<a name=67:12></a> We love the brethren; the saints become to us the excellent of the earth; and thus, in the exercise of those affections which are of the divine nature, we find deliverance from the flesh.<a name=67:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you" (verse 9).<a name=67:14></a> Here we see how entirely new is Christian state.<a name=67:15></a> The Christian is "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit".<a name=67:16></a> The fact that the Spirit of God dwells in him is the proof that, for God, the flesh is completely set aside.<a name=67:17></a> God could not recognize the flesh in any way, and the

		<a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		fact that His Spirit dwells in the believer is the sure evidence that according to God the believer is no longer "in the flesh".<a name=68:1></a> This is the new state of the Christian; he is in the Spirit.<a name=68:2></a> According to his divine state the Spirit of God characterizes him and not the flesh.<a name=68:3></a> <i>Practically</i> he is formed in this new state as he walks according to the Spirit.<a name=68:4></a> As he cultivates and ministers to those tastes which are of the Spirit, they become increasingly characteristic of him.<a name=68:5></a> A taste may be feeble to begin with, but if it is cultivated it becomes characteristic.<a name=68:6></a> I am sure that the youngest believer in whom the Spirit dwells <i>has divine tastes</i>.<a name=68:7></a> There is affection for Christ and for His own in his heart, and at least some degree of desire after His things.<a name=68:8></a> It may be that, like the faculties of a child, these things are not much developed as yet; they need to be fed and cultivated; but these things constitute the elements, of your new state, and it is in the minding of these things that you will find practical deliverance from the flesh.<a name=68:9></a>

		"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.<a name=68:10></a> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (verses 12, 13).<a name=68:11></a> We are under no kind of obligation to the flesh; we recognize it as a condemned thing; and as we walk according to the Spirit in the exercise of spiritual tastes, and in the activity of divine affections, we are able by the Spirit to put to death the "deeds of the body".<a name=68:12></a> Thus walking in love and holiness, we are maintained in superiority to all the evil that naturally attaches to us as children of Adam.<a name=68:13></a> "Through the Spirit" we are enabled to refuse the flesh, because our life and interests are in another order of things.<a name=68:14></a> In short, we have touched a circle of things where <i>life</i> is found, and we do not wish to return to that which is morally <i>death</i>.<a name=68:15></a> It is thus, as giving no quarter to the flesh, that we are found in the liberty of life.<a name=68:16></a> "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<a name=68:17></a> For

		ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father" (verses 14, 15).<a name=69:1></a> Instead of having his life in the circle of pride and self-gratification, where alone the flesh can move, the Christian <i>lives</i> in a circle of divine affections, and in the power and enjoyment of that which is truly life he is able to put to death the deeds of the body.<a name=69:2></a> And in this way he is practically delivered from the flesh.<a name=69:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, it must be remembered that this three-fold cord of deliverance has to be woven together in the soul.<a name=69:4></a> Deliverance from sin, the law, and the flesh, are presented to us separately in these scriptures for our spiritual apprehension, but they are not so much three distinct things as three parts of one whole.<a name=69:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it must also be remembered that deliverance is a thing which has to be maintained.<a name=69:6></a> The very nature of the thing in itself should make this evident, and yet some have spoken of deliverance as if it was something they got years ago, and had never needed to think about since.<a name=69:7></a> If I am worldly, or legal, or carnal today, of what good is it to say that I have deliverance?<a name=69:8></a> To do so is to turn a great spiritual reality into an empty word.<a name=69:9></a> It is only as we are maintained by the Spirit in dependence and divine affections that deliverance will be a present reality to us.<a name=69:10></a>

		I have no doubt that these Psalms give us very distinctly the experience and joy of the remnant of Israel in a day that is yet to come -- their experience as disinherited and driven out of the place of privilege, and the subsequent joy of heart with which they will turn to their once-rejected Messiah and find supreme satisfaction in Him and in the anticipation of His reign.<a name=70:1></a> But I should like to say a few words at this time on these Psalms in connection with the fact that they bring before us two very distinct states of soul-experience.<a name=70:2></a> Nothing could be more striking than the difference between them.<a name=70:3></a> In the one we find a soul "thirsting", in the other a heart "overflowing".<a name=70:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42">Psalm  42</a>answers to "If any man thirst"; while <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>answers to "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>, 38).<a name=70:5></a>

		It is a home question for every one of us, Am I "thirsting" or "overflowing"?<a name=70:6></a> Which of the two Psalms is more truly descriptive of the experience of my soul?<a name=70:7></a> It is our true blessedness to have CHRIST so before us that our hearts are really <i>satisfied</i>.<a name=70:8></a> There is satisfaction of which the Lord spoke to the woman at Sychar's well when He said, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>).<a name=70:9></a> It should be a cheer to the most tried and disappointed heart in this company to know that there is a satisfaction to be had of such a wonderful nature.<a name=70:10></a> So that instead of the murmurs of the wilderness being in the heart and on the tongue, the glories, perfections, and love of Christ so fill the heart that when the mouth opens streams of refreshing and gladness flow forth as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=70:11></a>

		It may be well at this point to consider two questions which naturally suggest themselves in connection with this subject.<a name=74:6></a> (1) Is it absolutely necessary for one to go through an experience of this kind after he finds peace?<a name=74:7></a> (2) Why is such an experience necessary?<a name=74:8></a> With regard to the first of these questions, it may be remarked that some souls go through a much deeper process of self-knowledge <i>before</i> they enter into peace than do others; and in cases where this exercise had been very deep, and the soul had been under legal preaching, peace and deliverance might be entered into almost simultaneously.<a name=74:9></a> But when the gospel has been fully and clearly presented souls are often brought into peace thereby, and then <i>afterwards</i> have to learn experimentally what they are as in the flesh.<a name=74:10></a> In answer to our second question, it may be said that our hearts have a continual tendency to make <i>self</i> the centre.<a name=74:11></a> Even when, by God's converting grace, we no longer make self the object of carnal gratification or of religious exaltation, we may, and do, make self the centre of the blessings which God's grace has conferred.<a name=74:12></a> We can all remember that it was so with us in the beginning.<a name=74:13></a> We thought and spoke much of <i>our</i> blessings, of what <i>we</i> had got, of what God had done for us.<a name=74:14></a> I am not at all objecting to this; it is, if I may so say, natural to the infancy of the soul.<a name=74:15></a> It gladdens

	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) In the latter part of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>we find the experience of one who, through grace, delights in the law of God after the inward man, and is earnestly seeking to carry out God's holy will, but he finds a law in his members -- a law of sin -- to which he is in helpless captivity.<a name=76:6></a> He becomes painfully conscious that sin dwells in him, and eventually reaches the conclusion that in him, that is, in his flesh, there is nothing but sin -- good he cannot find.<a name=76:7></a> It is by the law that he discovers this -- by the effort to carry out God's will -- so that which was ordained to life he finds to be unto death.<a name=76:8></a> <i>He is brought down to death</i>.<a name=76:9></a> Death is that state out of which nothing comes for God, and if I am truly conscious that good does not dwell in me I am brought down to death -- the "land of Jordan".<a name=76:10></a> Paul reached this point in a very short time because he was in dead earnest.<a name=76:11></a> He learned in three days a lesson which it often takes a lifetime to learn.<a name=76:12></a> We are long on the road because we are so little in earnest about it.<a name=76:13></a> But all this is inward experience and exercise.<a name=76:14></a> Outwardly Paul's life was most exemplary; it is not at all outward failure that others might see; it is the inward exercise in which the true character of sin in the flesh is discovered.<a name=76:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) The object of all the trial and testing of the wilderness was, as <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:2">Deuteronomy  8:2</a> tells us, "to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no".<a name=76:16></a> God leads us by a trying and rugged path (Hermon means "rugged" ) that the naughtiness and pride of our hearts may be discovered.<a name=76:17></a> God loves us too well to allow us to be deceived as to our true character as in the flesh.<a name=76:18></a> He puts us in the very circumstances that bring it out.<a name=76:19></a> Not one of us can escape this testing and sifting.<a name=76:20></a> And as our true character is thus brought to light,

		(3) The "hill Mizar" (the little hill) may represent any special discipline of God by which we are made consciously weak and small.<a name=77:16></a> When Paul came down from the third heaven there was given him a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him; and this, he tells us, was "lest I should be exalted above measure".<a name=77:17></a> It was his "hill Mizar".<a name=77:18></a> God allowed Satan so to act on Paul's flesh, by some form of bodily suffering, that he was conscious of nothing in himself but weakness.<a name=77:19></a> You may say, "That must be a miserable experience".<a name=77:20></a> Well, Paul was not miserable; he was supremely happy.<a name=77:21></a> He says, "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weakness, that the power of Christ may tabernacle

		As to these three forms of self-reduction, the first two are <i>instructive</i>, while the third is rather <i>protective</i>.<a name=78:9></a> The inward exercise of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>and the testing of the wilderness serve the purpose of teaching us what sin in the flesh is, and what is in our hearts; while such special discipline of God as Paul's thorn is rather to protect us from the unaltered tendencies of the flesh.<a name=78:10></a> The latter is <i>always</i> needed, and goes on in one form or other to the end of our course here.<a name=78:11></a>

		It is well for us to get to the end and the bottom of ourselves, for when we really get to the bottom with God we reach deliverance.<a name=78:12></a> Paul no sooner reaches "O wretched man that I am!<a name=78:13></a> who shall deliver me out of this body of death?<a name=78:14></a>" than he exclaims, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=78:15></a> The children of Israel, bitten by the serpent and brought down to death, found the way of life opened up by beholding the serpent of brass.<a name=78:16></a> When we truly abhor ourselves, we are prepared to rejoice in the blessed fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ -- that sin in the flesh was condemned when Christ died, that our whole history as in the flesh closed before God in His death -- and that this is our title to be free.<a name=78:17></a> I have now a righteous title to have done with myself because Christ has died.<a name=78:18></a> To prepare me for this I have to learn the necessity for death in my own experience, but <i>the death of Christ</i> is my title to be free.<a name=78:19></a> It is by the appropriation of His death that I reach liberty and life; that death has severed me from all that I was as in Adam.<a name=78:20></a> "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=78:21></a> I am free from myself, and free to have Christ before me, and to learn how I am associated with Him in new creation.<a name=78:22></a> In a word, I pass from the experience of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42">Psalm  42</a>into that of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=78:23></a>

		For an illustration of this, and of its effect, I should like you to consider the history of David.<a name=118:10></a> You have, no doubt, noticed that the Spirit of God has brought together, in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#22">2 Samuel  22</a>, 23, two of David's songs.<a name=118:11></a> One belongs to his early days, for he "spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul".<a name=118:12></a> The other contains "the last words of David".<a name=118:13></a> What a contrast there is between the two!<a name=118:14></a> In the first it is all triumph, he is exulting in what God has done for him; but in the last, as he thinks of the character of the one who is to rule over men in the fear of God, he has to say sorrowfully, "Although my house be not so with God".<a name=118:15></a> Forty years of discipline come between these two songs.<a name=118:16></a> How suggestive is this contrast!<a name=118:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We not only learn thus by our falls and back-slidings, but oftentimes these become the occasion of direct chastening on God's part, and we may have to suffer under God's government for years, or for a lifetime, the consequences of our sin and folly.<a name=119:5></a> David fell into a sin, the consequences of which he had to suffer all his life.<a name=119:6></a> He repented, and his sin was put away, but he had to suffer its governmental consequences all his life.<a name=119:7></a> "The sword shall never depart from thine house".<a name=119:8></a> But all this chastening -- solemn as it was in itself, and sad as was the conduct which necessitated it -- turned to David's profit, and in the lowly and chastened spirit of his "last words" we can see him a partaker of God's holiness.<a name=119:9></a> For if he has to say, "my house be not so with God", he has another Person in view, of whom he can say, "He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain".<a name=119:10></a> He had learned to distrust everything connected with his own house; but he had also learned the preciousness and beauty of CHRIST, and the stability of God's purpose in Him.<a name=119:11></a> "Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire".<a name=119:12></a> God's purposes secured in Christ were now not only all his salvation, but all his desire.<a name=119:13></a> Thus he became a partaker of God's holiness.<a name=119:14></a>
