		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle views the twelve tribes as in a very different position from that in which they are presented in the book of Joshua.<a name=3:1></a> We see there how the tribes dispossessed their enemies under the leadership of Joshua, and were set in the inheritance.<a name=3:2></a> That would answer to the early days of the assembly when there was spiritual leading on the part of the apostles, bringing the saints into the full blessing that was in the heart of God to bestow.<a name=3:3></a> But James addresses the twelve tribes as "in the dispersion".<a name=3:4></a> He takes account of the people of God in their entirety -- "our whole twelve tribes" as Paul says -- but he views them as being "in the dispersion", which answers very much to the position in which we find ourselves publicly today.<a name=3:5></a> The people of God are seen here as scattered from the inheritance in the government of God.<a name=3:6></a> It is an epistle specially suited to an abnormal state of things.<a name=3:7></a> It gives what would stabilize us, and lead to our being "perfect and complete" even amidst a scattered condition of things.<a name=3:8></a> In this way it has a peculiar application to ourselves.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to accept the conditions in which we find ourselves; they are conditions which involve a good deal of testing, and we are not to deprecate the testing, but to look on it as advantageous.<a name=3:10></a> James plunges at once into this subject: "Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various temptations, knowing that the proving of your faith works endurance".<a name=3:11></a> We find ourselves in a testing time, and we have to accept it; it is not an

	<div class="paragraph">
		easy time for the people of God.<a name=4:1></a> But if we accept the conditions, and go through them with God, a real increase of spiritual power will be found.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James writes as a bondman of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is only those who realise that they are bondmen, and thus under definite and abiding obligation to be faithful, who will stand in a day of testing.<a name=4:3></a> One has often felt that we are too much on volunteer principles; but we are not volunteers, left at liberty to do as much as we like, and go as far as we like; we are bondmen.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every test is a gain; it is well for us to take account of things in that way, because we are always being tested, and we do not always bear in mind that these tests are permitted of God, and that our increase in spiritual power largely depends on our facing them with God.<a name=4:5></a> God wants reliable material in His assembly.<a name=4:6></a> I was once in an engineering works, and the proprietor took me to a room and said, "This is the testing room.<a name=4:7></a> Every bit of material that comes into our works is brought here first".<a name=4:8></a> There were various machines for testing the strength and enduring quality of iron bars and other things that were there; nothing would be passed on but tested material.<a name=4:9></a> James opens his epistle by putting us into the testing room.<a name=4:10></a> Every testing is apportioned in the faithfulness of God to each individual that is subjected to it.<a name=4:11></a> None of us really gets a test that is out of proportion to our ability to bear it.<a name=4:12></a> The tests raise the question whether we are able to move on with what is of God in the face of every kind of difficulty.<a name=4:13></a> Each saint who accepts a testing, and goes through it with God, is prepared for the next, and finally, under the faithful hand of God, there is no element left lacking that God would form in that soul.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is encouraging to see that God has taken us up in view of developing certain features in us, and those features are developed on the line of endurance.<a name=4:15></a> There is nothing accidental or haphazard in any testing that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		comes; we have exactly the test which is needed to bring out the nature of our knowledge of God, and the amount of faith we have, and to furnish that faith with power of endurance, so that there <i>is</i> real increase.<a name=5:1></a> If I shirk a test, I lose the gain of it.<a name=5:2></a> The gain of a test lies in facing it and going through it with God.<a name=5:3></a> Our whole life is a series of tests, but all together they are planned so as to work out in result the accomplishment of what is in the mind of God in regard to each saint.<a name=5:4></a> It is beautiful to think of it working out to completeness, so that there is not an element wanting.<a name=5:5></a> We can count it joy in view of the issue.<a name=5:6></a> If I am tested as to whether I will compromise a divine principle, and I evade the test, I lose the gain that would have accrued from facing it.<a name=5:7></a> But if faith comes into exercise there will not be a single test that will not be productive of good to us.<a name=5:8></a> We have to submit to the government of God, as suffering under it the consequences of our own failures, and the general failure of His people.<a name=5:9></a> But there is a deepening under the government of God of all moral exercises.<a name=5:10></a> Most of us are shallow and superficial at the beginning, but testings bring about a deepening, a truer self-knowledge; we discover what weakness and want of wisdom are in ourselves.<a name=5:11></a> Such exercises turn us to God for wisdom.<a name=5:12></a> The great gain of faith is that we reach God about things, and what is merely natural is displaced.<a name=5:13></a> "That ye may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing" contemplates that God has a certain end to reach with every one of us, and He means to add every element that is needed to make up the complete thought that He has in His mind for us.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Endurance is a quality which is of primary importance.<a name=5:15></a> Moses persevered as seeing Him who is invisible.<a name=5:16></a> There is a danger of going on to a certain point in one's exercises, and then stopping short.<a name=5:17></a> If endurance has its perfect work we shall be "perfect and complete".<a name=5:18></a> Every needed element will be added in the faithfulness of God.<a name=5:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus was never deflected; He went straight on; He was marked by endurance; He "endured the cross".<a name=6:1></a> It was a great and precious feature in Him that He endured.<a name=6:2></a> He went through everything, even to the endurance of the cross.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This scripture would teach us that we are under the hand of God in every testing, and if we go faithfully through the test with Him we shall reach the perfection and completeness of what He has in His mind for us in it.<a name=6:4></a> Endurance and wisdom are two primary necessities for us in a day like the present.<a name=6:5></a> It is a difficult time, and for such a time both endurance and wisdom are needed, and they are the two things to which James calls our attention first.<a name=6:6></a> However unforeseen by us a difficulty may be, it cannot baffle divine wisdom.<a name=6:7></a> Wisdom is a most comprehensive thing.<a name=6:8></a> There are, I believe, ten different words in Hebrew for wisdom, which suggests its varied and comprehensive character; it takes different forms according to the need of the moment.<a name=6:9></a> Scripture speaks of the "all-various wisdom of God" as being made known through the assembly (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:10">Ephesians  3:10</a>).<a name=6:10></a> Wisdom is infinitely varied, and it will meet everything.<a name=6:11></a> There is not always chapter and verse for every detail; if there were it would leave little room for wisdom.<a name=6:12></a> Wisdom is essential, and it can be got by asking of God.<a name=6:13></a> He is not unwilling to bestow it; He gives to all freely, nor does He reproach us for the lack of it.<a name=6:14></a> "And it shall be given to him".<a name=6:15></a> There is no uncertainty as to the result to those who "ask in faith nothing doubting".<a name=6:16></a> A doubter is double-minded and unstable; he does not really know God; he is carried by the influences of the moment, and there is no wisdom in this.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that James, in his references to wisdom here and in chapter 3, has in mind the "wise" of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#11:33">Daniel  11:33</a>, 35; 12: 3 -- the Maschilim -- who have benefited by the instruction of the thirteen Maschil psalms, so as to have understanding in the mind of God in the last days.<a name=6:18></a>

		How necessary to ask of God for this in a day of dispersion, when the whole condition of things is abnormal!<a name=7:1></a> I remember a remark of Mr.<a name=7:2></a> Darby's which impressed me: "If the apostle Paul were living today I do not know what he would do.<a name=7:3></a> Nay!<a name=7:4></a> I go further, and say Paul himself would not know what to do".<a name=7:5></a> His thought was that even an apostle would have to ask and receive wisdom from God to know how to act in the peculiar circumstances of the present day.<a name=7:6></a> Nothing but wisdom from above will ever carry us through.<a name=7:7></a> But it is impossible that the "wise" should be baffled, however great the difficulties may be.<a name=7:8></a> Wisdom comes out in knowing how to act in presence of difficulties.<a name=7:9></a> The deacons in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>were men full of the Spirit and wisdom, and it was said of Stephen that "They were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke".<a name=7:10></a> His address in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>is a wonderful example of a man speaking in wisdom; no answer to it was possible.<a name=7:11></a> Wisdom is needed that we may use knowledge aright.<a name=7:12></a> If knowledge is not used in wisdom and love we may stumble the very persons we want to help.<a name=7:13></a>

		The brother of low degree is elevated in coming amongst the brethren, but the rich finds humiliation.<a name=7:14></a> Both are to glory.<a name=7:15></a> If we are really low grace acts to elevate, but if we have anything that gives us importance in the flesh, that has to be brought down.<a name=7:16></a> It belongs to an order of things which passes away as the grass's flower when exposed to the "burning heat" of the sun.<a name=7:17></a> The reference here is not to the light of the sun, but to its "burning heat".<a name=7:18></a> The sun having risen is a figure of God having come forth in revelation, but this viewed in its effect upon all that gives apparent glory or comeliness to man, The shining of God withers everything that man, as such, would trust in; yea, it withers the man himself.<a name=7:19></a> But this is that God alone may be looked to as the source of good.<a name=7:20></a> As one of "low degree" I can look up to Him

		as the source of "every good gift and every perfect gift", and this is great elevation.<a name=8:1></a> Nothing withers what comes down from above.<a name=8:2></a> If there is "burning heat" to wither what is of the flesh, there is the beneficent light of God revealed in love, giving every good and perfect gift.<a name=8:3></a> In this light, and as loving God thus revealed, there is power to endure testing.<a name=8:4></a> To endure temptation proves that there is something there which is not of withering nature -- something which God can bless and distinguish.<a name=8:5></a> "Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for, having been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which He has promised to them that love Him".<a name=8:6></a> God loves to see evidences of life, and to give the crown of life to those whom He has proved.<a name=8:7></a> Such acquire peculiar distinction with God.<a name=8:8></a> It is a great advantage to be a brother of "low degree", for such are elevated in the knowledge and joy of what comes down from above, through the outshining of God in His goodness.<a name=8:9></a> But if I have had anything that made me rich, such as Paul could refer to in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, true glory consists in being humbled as to it all, and in this way the rich becomes in his mind and spirit a "brother of low degree".<a name=8:10></a> One might come into the assembly as having some status through wealth, or through natural abilities or qualities, and if so one would be sure to find humiliation, and such humiliation is really a ground for spiritual glorying.<a name=8:11></a> It is to make room for what is from above, and thus to help us on the line of life.<a name=8:12></a> The testings to which we are subjected bring out the fact that the saints love God, and it is such who receive the crown of life.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Temptation is looked at in the first twelve verses of this chapter as the testing of what is of God in the souls of His people, so that it is to be counted joy because there is ability to endure the test.<a name=8:14></a> When that is the case testing only develops the power of endurance which is there by grace.<a name=8:15></a> But in verses 13 - 15 James turns to speak

		of temptation in another way -- as the enticement of one's own lust.<a name=9:1></a> This raises the question whether we are looking for pleasure on the line of gratifying the desires of our flesh, or on the line of receiving every good and every perfect gift from God?<a name=9:2></a> For our own lust is contrasted here with divine giving.<a name=9:3></a> James had already spoken of God as giving liberally; and he goes on to say that "every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights".<a name=9:4></a> Now we are tested as to whether we are continually looking up expectantly for what God will give -- for things that come down -- or are we yielding to the solicitations and enticements of our own lusts and fleshly desires?<a name=9:5></a> Practically we are ever on one line or the other.<a name=9:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most important that we should have the upward look of appreciation for those things which are the fruit of the revelation of God in love.<a name=9:7></a> Nothing comes down but what is good and perfect.<a name=9:8></a> Now do we want what is good and perfect, or the gratification of our own fleshly desires?<a name=9:9></a> The answer will show where we are in our souls with God.<a name=9:10></a> Salvation in a practical sense is that one is removed from the region of one's own desires into the region where there is divine giving, and in that region there is unalloyed happiness instead of lust giving birth to sin, and sin, fully completed, bringing forth death, That is something very different from the crown of life spoken of in verse 12.<a name=9:11></a> The line that leads to life is connected with the giving of God; our own desires lead to sin, and sin to death.<a name=9:12></a> To be outside the activities and giving of divine love is death morally.<a name=9:13></a>

		The substance of John's ministry is in verses 17, 18.<a name=10:4></a> If God had not exercised His own will in sovereign love none of us would have had a bit of appreciation of Christ, or desire to move after Him.<a name=10:5></a> But He has begotten us by the word of truth that we might appreciate the shining of the revelation of God, and find it to be an unchanging source of happiness.<a name=10:6></a> Every good and perfect gift is the fruit of the revelation of God; it comes down from the Father of lights; He is the source of every choice gift.<a name=10:7></a> The most wonderful thing possible is the revelation of God; we should ponder it as the greatest thing that our hearts can know.<a name=10:8></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>are chapters we should cherish, for they speak of the effulgence of God shining out in His Son; all the splendour of God shines out there.<a name=10:9></a> The most magnificent thing in nature is the sun; it has incomparable glory, and therefore the sun is the great figure in nature of the outshining of God.<a name=10:10></a> We are told of the Lord that His face shone as the sun (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:2">Matthew  17:2</a>).<a name=10:11></a> What happiness for those "in the dispersion" to be brought consciously into the presence of every good and every perfect gift as the fruit of the outshining of God in His unchangeable glory!<a name=10:12></a> Nothing that can happen in the Christian profession, or in any individual, can dim the shining of God.<a name=10:13></a> Clouds may come in below and hide the sun from us, but they do not dim its shining.<a name=10:14></a> The moon has phases but the sun has none; there is no variation nor shadow of turning there.<a name=10:15></a> The "Father of lights" really brings in John's ministry, which does not vary nor have a shadow of turning.<a name=10:16></a>

		The Lord, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, called the attention of the woman to the giving of God.<a name=11:1></a> God is revealed as a Giver.<a name=11:2></a> Not one of us in nature had that thought of God; we thought of Him as a Demander, and naturally -- strange to say -- man would rather think of God as a Demander than as a Giver.<a name=11:3></a> But the Son in manhood has revealed the giving God; He delights to give; He has given His Son, His Spirit, everything that is good and perfect, and there is no variableness nor shadow of turning in Him as the Father of lights.<a name=11:4></a> In the solar system the sun is the father of lights; there is no light that is not begotten by the sun; the light of the moon and of the planets is begotten by the sun.<a name=11:5></a> The sun is the father of every light in the solar system, and God is the Father of lights.<a name=11:6></a> Wherever there is light it is of God.<a name=11:7></a> As brought forth by God His children partake of the character of light; they are spoken of by both John and Paul as "sons of light"; they are begotten by the revelation.<a name=11:8></a> James brings in really a great deal more than most people think.<a name=11:9></a>

		If we were more conscious of being "in the dispersion" we should more appreciate the unvarying and unchangeable character of God as known in the light of revelation.<a name=11:10></a> We dwell a good deal sometimes on things that have changed, and will change, but we need to abide more in the light that does not change -- the shining out of God in His Son, and the giving of every good and perfect gift.<a name=11:11></a> We can have everything that is of true value as gift, and God delights to be known in the character in which His beloved Son has revealed Him here.<a name=11:12></a> The greatest thing in the universe is the shining of God.<a name=11:13></a> That, in itself, is the supreme giving, and every perfect gift is the result of it.<a name=11:14></a> It is a peculiar encouragement to see that, though those to whom James writes are "in the dispersion", the best of everything remains.<a name=11:15></a> The revelation of God remains, and all that is bound up in it.<a name=11:16></a> Do we appreciate that?<a name=11:17></a> So that we are thankful to live in

	<div class="paragraph">
		James brings divine Persons before us as the spring of everything.<a name=16:1></a> He insists upon works, but they are not legal works; they are such works as flow from the knowledge of God in the soul.<a name=16:2></a> In the first chapter God is presented as the Father of lights, the source of every good gift and of every perfect gift.<a name=16:3></a> Then chapter 2 speaks of having the faith of "our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory".<a name=16:4></a> No doubt the perfect law was seen in the Lord Jesus as a Man on earth, wholly commanded by the will of God, and responding to it in perfect freedom; it is there for us to fix our view on.<a name=16:5></a> But then he speaks of our having the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory; that brings in Christ as the glorified Man.<a name=16:6></a> Later on in the epistle he speaks of the Spirit as having taken up His abode in us.<a name=16:7></a> It is well for us to see how James presents divine Persons.<a name=16:8></a>

		"The scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God".<a name=20:18></a> This had been said of him many years before, but when he offered up Isaac it was fulfilled; that is, it was filled out in its completeness; by works his faith was perfected, and he was called friend of God.<a name=20:19></a> God Himself could speak of him as His friend (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#41:8">Isaiah  41:8</a>), and Jehoshaphat spoke to God of "Abraham thy friend" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#20:7">2 Chronicles  20:7</a>); the word really is "lover".<a name=20:20></a> James has in his mind a company of lovers of God, and who are therefore not on good terms with the world.<a name=20:21></a> Rahab was not on good terms with the people of Jericho; in one

		All the prophets laboured in view of the coming of the Lord, and people in a general way admit that it was blessed that they should have had grace to do so.<a name=36:3></a> "Behold, we call them blessed who have endured" (verse 11).<a name=36:4></a> We are prepared to admit that it is blessed for people to suffer patiently in view of coming glory, but what about ourselves?<a name=36:5></a> Suffering comes in as a result of being identified with what is of God; the prophets speaking in the Name of the Lord suffered, and Job suffered, because he was the most eminent servant of the Lord on the earth at that time.<a name=36:6></a> For there is not only suffering from men, but there is necessary discipline from the hand of God.<a name=36:7></a> The more eminent a servant of God is the more necessary is it that he should be refined, and therefore the more exacting is the discipline to which he is subjected.<a name=36:8></a> This epistle shows, as we have remarked before, that saints are in the crucible.<a name=36:9></a> Job was in the crucible because of his value in the sight of God; there was silver and gold there, but there was also an element of dross that needed to be eliminated.<a name=36:10></a> James has given us a headline to write over the book of Job, "Ye have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful" (verse 11).<a name=36:11></a> Think of the tender feelings of the blessed God all the time that Job was in the crucible!<a name=36:12></a> He did not let them out to Job, and Job thought His dealings hard, but God let out to James what His feelings were all the time; they were tender and pitiful.<a name=36:13></a> He felt for Job all the time that He was passing him through so much to refine him; He was full of compassion all the

		We should never forget that our brethren are a suffering and afflicted people.<a name=37:4></a> We may think that some people escape lightly, but if we knew all the sorrows of the saints we should be much more tender and pitiful than we are.<a name=37:5></a> The brethren are a suffering people, and the more we get to know of their private and relative history the more we find that it is so, and it is all intended to have an effect in loosing us from things as they are in the present world, and leading us to look out for the coming of the Lord.<a name=37:6></a> All evil is soon going to be banished, and everything put into accord with the pleasure of God.<a name=37:7></a> We suffer at the present time because things are not in accord with the pleasure of God, and also because, as to ourselves, there is a need for refining.<a name=37:8></a> We can sometimes see at the end of the course of a saint who has walked before God for many long years something that is as near to refined gold as anything we are likely to see on earth.<a name=37:9></a> The holy exercises of perhaps fifty or sixty years have done their refining work, the dross has been purged, and spiritual features remain in purity to God's praise.<a name=37:10></a>

		Complaining of the brethren (verse 9) is certainly dross; the Lord will not suffer it; it brings us under judgment.<a name=37:11></a> You may say, There are many things that are not what they should be.<a name=37:12></a> Well, do you know that "the judge stands before the door?<a name=37:13></a>" He will come in directly, and see to everything.<a name=37:14></a> Our complaining one against another does not remedy anything.<a name=37:15></a> I may be very confident that the One who is taking such pains to discipline and correct me is doing the same with every one of the brethren.<a name=37:16></a> If there is any measure of holiness

		The Lord's supper has in view the return of the Lord to the earth.<a name=38:3></a> We come together as knowing that the will of God and the new covenant are soon going to be brought in publicly, but we know the precious reality of these things while they are yet hidden from the eyes of men.<a name=38:4></a> Those who look for the coming of the Lord must be intelligent as to what it means.<a name=38:5></a> Wonderful things are coming out of heaven to influence the earth, and we know what they are because they have affected us already.<a name=38:6></a> And in the meantime there is an outlet for every exercise in any kind of circumstances.<a name=38:7></a> If one is suffering evil, he can pray; if he is happy, he can sing; and if he is sick, there is an outlet in regard to that!<a name=38:8></a>

		Verse 12 comes in as connected with what James had said before about the tongue.<a name=38:9></a> He would insist, as the Lord had, that there should be no need of an oath to pledge the truth of what we say.<a name=38:10></a> Every word that a brother or a sister says should be known as absolutely reliable; there should be no prevarication or throwing us off the scent on their part, The Lord said prophetically that His thought did not go beyond His word (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#17:3">Psalm  17:3</a>); with Him the thought and the word absolutely corresponded.<a name=38:11></a>

		As to calling the elders of the assembly (verse 14), though there are no official elders now, for there is no one to appoint them, oversight in the assembly has not ceased, and it ought to be a concern to us all that it should be preserved in exercise.<a name=38:12></a> We do not want individuals to be marked as elders officially, but we ought to be concerned that there should be those to whom souls in exercise could turn.<a name=38:13></a> One would look for moral qualifications now rather than official status.<a name=38:14></a> We

		I do not doubt that the anointing with oil was literal, but I think it might suggest in a figurative way that spiritual ability is conferred on the sick person to understand what the Lord is doing with him.<a name=39:5></a> Many sick persons would be thankful to apprehend that in a spiritual way, and I think we might confidently look for it.<a name=39:6></a> It would be a great spiritual gain in every case, and perhaps more to be desired than restoration to health.<a name=39:7></a>

		The prayer of faith heals the sick; there is nothing about the gift of healing here; it is the prayer of faith.<a name=39:8></a> We hear of large crowds assembling for faith-healing; but I wonder how many are prepared to make a clean breast of their sins!<a name=39:9></a> It is all put on moral grounds in these verses.<a name=39:10></a>

		James would give us a great sense of the power of prayer.<a name=39:11></a> "The fervent supplication of the righteous man has much power".<a name=39:12></a> He tells us what the Old Testament does not mention, that Elijah prayed that it should not rain.<a name=39:13></a> It shows the power of prayer when a man is thinking of the glory of God and the true good of His people.<a name=39:14></a> This was not his intercession against Israel referred to in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, but it was intercession on their behalf by one who was in the mind of God, and who realised that nothing but a severe chastisement would correct their state.<a name=39:15></a> He was in the current of God's thoughts, and was really on the line of restoration.<a name=39:16></a> And that is the line on which James would put us.<a name=39:17></a> "My brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and one bring him

		The thought of the Lord's coming would produce a desire for that in the brethren; we should want every one to be put right.<a name=40:2></a> I have no doubt that the intercession of Christ is often answered by the discipline of God for the restoration of those who have erred.<a name=40:3></a> The Lord would encourage us all to cultivate the desire for restoration -- to do our utmost to save souls from death and to cover sins.<a name=40:4></a> How could we bear to think of any sins of God's people being unconfessed, and unrepented of, when the Lord comes?<a name=40:5></a> The restoration of every erring one is to be sought in view of the coming of the Lord.<a name=40:6></a> Turning aside from the truth, and from what is suitable to God, is the way to death; it is not the way of life.<a name=40:7></a>

		Nothing promotes brotherly confidence more than the confession of faults.<a name=40:8></a> If one confesses his offences it does not make us think less of him, but more, because we know he has judged himself about those things in which he has been at fault.<a name=40:9></a> He is now upright and we are greatly encouraged to pray for him.<a name=40:10></a> But it is to be noted that confession is mutual.<a name=40:11></a> "Confess therefore your offences to one another" (verse 16).<a name=40:12></a> It is not a priest listening to the confessions of other people, but not confessing his sins to them.<a name=40:13></a> We are all put on the same platform of mutual transparency and confidence.<a name=40:14></a> James reminds us that "we ALL often offend".<a name=40:15></a> I believe it will be generally found if one brother has to make acknowledgement to another of a fault that something is also due on the other side.<a name=40:16></a> I knew two brothers who were not happy together, and they met one day, and one of them said, "I am very sorry that this feeling has come in between us, and I feel that it has all been my fault".<a name=40:17></a> The other replied, "No, indeed, it has all been MY fault".<a name=40:18></a> That is the way to get breaches healed.<a name=40:19></a><br>C.<a name=40:20></a> A.<a name=40:21></a> C.<a name=40:22></a>
