	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Paul's closing words in Timothy he called attention to the fact that Luke was with him, which is a spiritual intimation that Luke's service was closely associated with Paul's.<a name=1:1></a> Luke's writings I present things which are essential to the understanding of Paul.<a name=1:2></a> He alone of the evangelists relates particularly the circumstances connected with the Lord being carried up into heaven.<a name=1:3></a> Paul was converted by seeing Jesus in heaven as the glorified One, but the Person whom he came to know as in heaven had been seen on earth by eye-witnesses, and we need the gospels, and particularly Luke, to give us the knowledge of the Person who is now in heaven.<a name=1:4></a> We need to learn Him as He was here that we may know Him where He is in heaven.<a name=1:5></a> The One who is now in heaven has trodden this earth as the lowly Man; He has been seen and heard and attended by a company of persons who became acquainted with Him.<a name=1:6></a> This gospel is written that we might have the supreme favour from God of seeing and hearing in a spiritual way what those saw and heard who were eye-witnesses and attendants on the Word.<a name=1:7></a> We have the privilege of sharing with them what they saw and heard in that blessed One.<a name=1:8></a> No greater favour could be shown us, and if we do not know what it is to study Him in His course through this world we shall not know Him as He is now in heaven.<a name=1:9></a> Our knowledge of Him in heaven is dependent On what was disclosed in Him down here.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke and Paul were both in the same position as ourselves in regard to the Lord as seen down here; neither of them had known Him thus personally, but Luke became accurately acquainted from the origin with all things concerning Him, and God had taken Luke up to communicate accurate knowledge and certainty as to these things.<a name=1:11></a> There are certain "matters fully believed among us".<a name=1:12></a> The believing company is still on earth, and certain matters are fully believed in that company.<a name=1:13></a> Thank God it is so!<a name=1:14></a> But that does not deprive us of the privilege of knowing the certainty of those things.<a name=1:15></a> The gospel of Luke is largely the unfolding of the glory of the Lord as the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To Luke as to John the Lord was "the Word".<a name=2:2></a> I have often wondered why we do not speak more of Christ as the Word.<a name=2:3></a> It was evidently a common and well-known designation of Him, for both Luke and John use it as a well-known title.<a name=2:4></a> It conveys that God is now in full expression as to His mind and nature in a Man.<a name=2:5></a> We have to do now with matters that are far greater than creation.<a name=2:6></a> God could speak in power and creation came into being.<a name=2:7></a> John tells us that "without him not one thing received being that has received being", but there was not in that any communication of the mind of God, or any disclosure of what He was in His nature and character.<a name=2:8></a> Now there is the full telling out of what God is in His nature, in His thoughts, in His heart, and this in One who trod this earth as Man, who was seen and heard and attended by men like ourselves.<a name=2:9></a> A man might make a watch if he was skilful enough; God could make one by a word; but there would not be any expression of God's thoughts or of His heart in making a watch, a world, or a universe.<a name=2:10></a> That would not bring out God's mind or His heart, but "the Word" does.<a name=2:11></a> Revelation is greater than creation.<a name=2:12></a> Men and women like ourselves were privileged to be eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word.<a name=2:13></a> They were privileged to be in His retinue, and the Spirit of God would give us, through the gospels, the privilege of personal nearness to the Word.<a name=2:14></a> One would judge that the greatness of divine revelation was very much before the minds of the apostles and early saints.<a name=2:15></a> They thought and spoke much of "the Word".<a name=2:16></a> We think of Christ as Lord, as Saviour, as Head, and as Priest, and these are wonderful titles and characters, but how great and glorious He is as "the Word"!<a name=2:17></a> John and Luke had an immense sense of it.<a name=2:18></a> In the Word God expressed what was in His mind and His heart, what He is in His very nature.<a name=2:19></a> It bows one's soul to think of it.<a name=2:20></a> It was a necessity to God's love that He should speak out of His nature, His thoughts and His heart, and that He should have beings capable of appreciating it.<a name=2:21></a> It was not like a royal visit when some great personage comes, and there is reserve; everybody must be respectful; there are soldiers to keep the people back; all is in formal and stately splendour.<a name=2:22></a> There is nothing like that here.<a name=2:23></a> Peter says, "the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us".<a name=2:24></a> It was a lowly Man coming in and going out

		in all the ordinary circumstances of human life, but in those circumstances expressing the nature and character of God and the activities of God in boundless favour and grace towards men.<a name=3:1></a> He was "The Word".<a name=3:2></a> It says in Hebrews I that God spoke in the Person of the Son.<a name=3:3></a> We do not wonder that many took in hand to record it.<a name=3:4></a> How could they help it?<a name=3:5></a> "Many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us".<a name=3:6></a> What men saw and heard -- what held them in attendance upon Him -- was the wonder of the expression He was giving of God.<a name=3:7></a> Sinful men, for the first time, saw and heard "the Word".<a name=3:8></a> It would have been strange if many had not undertaken to draw up a relation concerning such matters.<a name=3:9></a> They are matters of such profound interest and importance to all men that to know of them kindles a desire to make them known.<a name=3:10></a> We can say with deep thankfulness that these matters are "fully believed among us".<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been particularly favourable to us in employing a Gentile to write this gospel.<a name=3:12></a> Luke was probably a Gentile and he was writing to a Gentile, whose name means "Lover of God".<a name=3:13></a> That this wonderful gospel should be written to one individual shows the delight that God has in making Himself known to one man.<a name=3:14></a> Each individual reader can take it all to himself.<a name=3:15></a> God has been very favourable to us in enabling Luke to put these matters on record in a divine way.<a name=3:16></a> Other people had done their best, but that was not good enough for us; God took up Luke and made him the medium of these communications by the Holy Spirit, so that all these matters concerning the Word should be made known to us accurately and with method.<a name=3:17></a> It is the consideration of divine grace for us; we might well admire and adore the grace that has given us such a gospel.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke is writing to a lover of God, and it is only such who can appreciate his gospel in a spiritual way.<a name=3:19></a> He also calls attention to the fact that he writes "with method", he puts everything in order; so we have to notice in Luke not only what he writes but where and how he puts things.<a name=3:20></a> It is like a beautiful picture gallery, but the pictures are not hung anyhow; every picture is in its right place; everything is "with method".<a name=3:21></a> So we may not only admire Luke's pictures by looking at them in an isolated way, but we may see that every picture has its place in the series.<a name=3:22></a> Luke takes up incidents,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and puts them just where they are "with method"; he has an object in it.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first feature of method which we notice is that Luke introduces us to what may be called a priestly atmosphere.<a name=4:2></a> It is as much as to say that the things he is about to write can only be entered upon in spiritual conditions.<a name=4:3></a> So he brings before us first priestly conditions and an atmosphere of prayer.<a name=4:4></a> He sheds the perfume of incense over the opening of his gospel, indicating conditions which are suitable to what God was about to introduce, and also that this gospel must be approached in a priestly spirit if we wish to apprehend the substance of it in spiritual reality.<a name=4:5></a> No doubt we are all familiar with the text; believers generally are as familiar with Luke as with any part of Scripture, but there must be suitable conditions if we are to enter into it with spiritual appreciation.<a name=4:6></a> So we find a man and his wife here, both of the priestly family, and both walking consistently with the light that God had given them up to that time.<a name=4:7></a> If we are not walking in consistency with the light that has been given to us we are not in a condition to get more.<a name=4:8></a> These two, Zacharias and Elizabeth, were in accord with the light that God had given to them, fearing Jehovah and walking blamelessly before Him, and Zacharias was engaged in the priestly service of offering incense.<a name=4:9></a> Incense in Scripture is typical of prayer (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#141:2">Psalm  141:2</a>), but of a special character.<a name=4:10></a> I have no doubt that this gospel has in view the setting up of priestly conditions.<a name=4:11></a> It ends by showing us a company of persons in the temple praising and blessing God.<a name=4:12></a> There is a praying company in the temple at the beginning of the gospel, but all their prayers are answered at the end, so they are praising and blessing God.<a name=4:13></a> If our prayers have incense character they will surely eventuate in our praising and blessing God.<a name=4:14></a> The psalmist said, "Let my prayer come before thee as incense" -- it should be an exercise with us whether our prayers have this character.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Incense according to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#30">Exodus  30</a>is very precious; it was composed of fragrant drugs and pure frankincense, but compounded according to the art of the perfumer; it was pure and salted and holy.<a name=4:16></a> That indicates a character of prayer that is delightful to God.<a name=4:17></a> Incense is prayer that is in accord with the mind of God.<a name=4:18></a> The most wonderful example of prayer that was truly incense is recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>; every grain of that precious prayer was indeed fragrant.<a name=4:19></a> If we read Paul's prayers

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for the Colossians and Ephesians we see in them prayers that had the character of incense; every grain of those prayers was fragrant to God as the expression of His own thoughts for His people.<a name=5:1></a> In the Lord's prayer we do not find the slightest allusion to any failure on the part of His saints.<a name=5:2></a> And in Paul's prayers there is no allusion to any failure on their part; he is entirely occupied with the thoughts of God about His people.<a name=5:3></a> That is incense.<a name=5:4></a> I have no doubt that Zacharias had prayed on that line.<a name=5:5></a> The angel said, "Thy supplication has been heard".<a name=5:6></a> It was many years before that he had prayed for a son, and the answer given showed the kind of spirit in which he had prayed.<a name=5:7></a> He had evidently wanted a son who should be in some way an expression of God's favour to Israel, and the angel said, Your prayers shall be answered; you shall have a son and his name shall be called John (meaning The favour of God), and many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.<a name=5:8></a> Zacharias had longed that the sons of Israel should be turned to the Lord their God.<a name=5:9></a> That is the kind of prayer that is truly incense.<a name=5:10></a> Then in this chapter the fragrance of incense was going up inside the temple and the people were in accord with it; they were praying outside.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we are to profit from Luke's gospel we shall have to pray in our chambers, in our households, and in our meetings.<a name=5:12></a> It is no good to think of reading the gospel of Luke without prayer.<a name=5:13></a> The Lord is specifically presented as the Man of prayer in this gospel; there are at least seven instances of His praying.<a name=5:14></a> We have the privilege of caring for the interests of God in our rooms and households.<a name=5:15></a> If we pray in our own rooms we shall find it so sweet that we would not like to deny ourselves the privilege of praying in our households, and we shall find that so sweet that it would lead to our taking up the privilege of praying in the assembly.<a name=5:16></a> God would not have dumb priests; such a one is not equal to his own desires.<a name=5:17></a> We often have holy and spiritual desires, but we are not equal to them, and so we come under some expression of God's displeasure.<a name=5:18></a> God was displeased with the unbelief of Zacharias, and He is displeased with us if we are not equal to our prayers.<a name=5:19></a> We have perhaps often had to confess that when we have got off our knees we have been characterised by something quite contrary to what we have been praying about.<a name=5:20></a>

		This chapter brings out the fact that God will move on in His grace in spite of the unbelief that will not trust Him to do

		it.<a name=6:1></a> The angel says, "the which shall be fulfilled in their time"; that is, faith or no faith, God says, 'I am going on with My thoughts of grace'.<a name=6:2></a> What we see in this gospel is an irresistible and unquenchable grace, so that, even when a man prays and is not equal to his own prayers, God says, 'I am equal to them, and I am going to answer them, I am going to carry out not only what was in your heart, but all that is in My heart!<a name=6:3></a>' God is going to do it in His persistent grace, He reaches the fulfilment of His own thoughts in spite of unbelief.<a name=6:4></a> I suppose everyone who has read these early chapters of Luke has been impressed by the nearness of heaven which is disclosed in them.<a name=6:5></a> In Matthew the communications from heaven are in measure veiled; an angel appears to Joseph but it is in a dream; there are no dreams in Luke.<a name=6:6></a> There is a, certain suggestion of distance about a dream, but what strikes one here is the personal and intimate character of the communications from heaven.<a name=6:7></a>

		Zacharias was a priest morally as well as officially; he had known what it was to draw near to God in private.<a name=6:8></a> And, as we have noticed; he had desired some mark of God's favour to Israel.<a name=6:9></a> We have referred to his unbelief, but it is well to bear in mind that his exercises before God had been very genuine, and had been regarded by God, and they were answered by glad tidings from heaven.<a name=6:10></a> The very mind of God as known in heaven was revealed in glad tidings to a man on earth.<a name=6:11></a> A heavenly personage appeared to Zacharias.<a name=6:12></a> It is interesting to see that angels have names which are expressive of what God is: Michael means, "Who is like God?<a name=6:13></a>" and Gabriel means, "God is mighty".<a name=6:14></a> Gabriel's accustomed place was to stand before God; he was sent to Zacharias as one conversant with the mind of God as it was known in heaven.<a name=6:15></a>

		The angel appeared "on the right side of the altar of incense".<a name=6:16></a> It was not at the brazen altar, though no doubt the morning or evening lamb had been offered there, nor would we forget that the blood of the sin offering had been put on the horns of the altar of incense.<a name=6:17></a> But Luke does not introduce the sacrificial side; the altar of incense is the point at which the communications from heaven come in.<a name=6:18></a> It does not speak of dealing sacrificially with sin in the way of atonement -- deeply essential as that is -- but the burning of holy fragrance before God in which He could find delight.<a name=6:19></a> It suggests that the favourableness of God to men is according to Christ; His thoughts of

	<div class="paragraph">
		favour manward have found expression in Christ, and they are a delight to God as expressed in Him.<a name=7:1></a> God was about to have One on earth in whom He could delight as the full setting forth of His favour to men.<a name=7:2></a> There was sweet fragrance in this for the heart of God.<a name=7:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The right" is the favourable side; the Lord sets the sheep on His right hand, and when Bathsheba came to Solomon he caused a throne to be set for her on his right hand; it is the place of favour, and here in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>it is expressive of the favour of God to men.<a name=7:4></a> The birth of John was announced there, John means "The favour of God".<a name=7:5></a> The great thought in Luke is the favour of God to men; heaven draws near at the right of the altar of incense.<a name=7:6></a> Luke does not dwell on the sacrificial side, but the side of divine favour to men.<a name=7:7></a> So the death of Jesus in Luke is not presented from the sacrificial side, but rather as in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, "that by the grace of God he should taste death for everything".<a name=7:8></a> It is the extreme favour of God to men set forth in the death of Jesus.<a name=7:9></a> All the grace been brought near to men in this world; the announcement of it came by a great and heavenly personage, to Zacharias or to Mary; it was by one whose name set forth the might of God, but whose service revealed that the might of God was acting in favourableness to men.<a name=7:10></a> The greatness of God in His grace to men is what is magnified in Luke.<a name=7:11></a> We might well say with David, "Great is Jehovah, and exceedingly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#145:3">Psalm  145:3</a>.<a name=7:12></a> Later in this gospel we read that "all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God", chapter 9: 43.<a name=7:13></a> It is not a question in this gospel merely of meeting man's need but of the revelation of God's greatness in grace.<a name=7:14></a> The end in view is that God may have good pleasure in men.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John was named from heaven, and his name means "The favour of God".<a name=7:16></a> No doubt Zacharias had prayed that he might have a son who would be the expression of the favour of God to the sons of Israel, and his subsequent unbelief did not invalidate the genuineness of his exercises before God, nor prevent God from answering those exercises by bringing in His own favour.<a name=7:17></a> There never had been such an expression of divine favour in this world before, because John was not to be like an Old Testament prophet who could speak of divine intervention as a more or less distant prospect.<a name=7:18></a> John was to be the immediate forerunner of Jesus; that is why he was

		great before Jehovah as expressing divine favour to men as no prophet had ever expressed it.<a name=8:1></a> Gabriel announced the birth of John as glad tidings from heaven; he would be joy and rejoicing to Zacharias, and many should rejoice at his birth, for he would be great before Jehovah.<a name=8:2></a> He would not be marked by natural energy or excitement -- wine or strong drink -- but by being filled sovereignly with the Holy Spirit.<a name=8:3></a> He would be the expression of the sovereign favour of God in regard of Israel's departure from Him.<a name=8:4></a> He would be a vessel of divine power and grace to turn many of the sons of Israel to their God.<a name=8:5></a> It was when the sons of Israel had departed from God, that divine favour came in to turn them to Jehovah their God.<a name=8:6></a> It was all to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.<a name=8:7></a> There must be a people prepared to appreciate the grace that was coming out of heaven -- the divine favour to men that was about to be expressed in Jesus.<a name=8:8></a> We all have to be prepared to appreciate it as much as the sons of Israel had to be prepared.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Mary we see divine favour magnified more than in any other instance.<a name=8:10></a> No human being was ever the subject of such favour as Mary; Gabriel's salutation to her was, "Hail, favoured one!<a name=8:11></a>" His coming to her is not presented as being in answer to her exercises, but as the unsought and blessed outflow of the favour of heaven.<a name=8:12></a> That is the character of Luke's gospel -- heaven breaking forth into this world so as to bring divine joy to the children of men.<a name=8:13></a> It is not divine favour known providentially or in changed circumstances for men, but God Himself coming in in a grace that surpasses everything, in grace that was as high above the thoughts of men as heaven is above the earth.<a name=8:14></a> Mary is in one way a contrast to Zacharias; in Zacharias there was self-consideration which led to unbelief, but in Mary there was complete absence of self-consideration.<a name=8:15></a> She yielded herself to God to be the vessel for the working out of His supreme thoughts of grace.<a name=8:16></a> She said, "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word".<a name=8:17></a> There was no self-consideration.<a name=8:18></a> Elizabeth might well say, "Blessed is she that has believed".<a name=8:19></a> Mary is an outstanding example in Scripture of a believer.<a name=8:20></a> Heaven was about to break forth in the way of boundless favour to men, and there was one heart at least divinely prepared to appreciate it.<a name=8:21></a> The thought of it raises exercise as to whether we are prepared to appreciate through divine grace the great things of God which are unfolded in this gospel.<a name=8:22></a> Mary only

		I think we should he justified in regarding Mary as the representative of that humanity with which the Lord was about to identify Himself.<a name=9:12></a> Mary was saluted from heaven as a favoured one -- "Hail, favoured one", and "Thou hast found favour with God".<a name=9:13></a> It was not a question of meeting need but of divine favour being expressed from the height of heaven.<a name=9:14></a> The birth of the Holy Child Jesus as conceived and born of a woman was the supreme expression of that favour.<a name=9:15></a> There could be no closer identification with humanity than to be born of a woman.<a name=9:16></a> "Come of woman", Paul says.<a name=9:17></a> How favourable God is to men!<a name=9:18></a> He would send forth His Son, come of a woman, as a Child born.<a name=9:19></a> The prophetic word had said, "Unto us a child is born".<a name=9:20></a> Mary was actually His mother, but He was born unto us who are of the race of men; He came forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse.<a name=9:21></a> May the greatness of it arrest, and hold our hearts!<a name=9:22></a> The Scripture we have read is covered by the two statements -- "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given".<a name=9:23></a> The Child born secures everything in divine favour for men, the Son given secures supreme delight for God in Man.<a name=9:24></a> In the apprehension of this, God would enable us to give Him a Name, He would enable us to call Him Jesus.<a name=9:25></a> God would have all that is covered or expressed in that Name -- the infinitude of divine favour manward -- to be

		The angel said to the shepherds, "Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people: for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord".<a name=10:8></a> The coming in of this Child has a bearing in divine favour towards all men.<a name=10:9></a> In the gospel of Luke it is not only that man needs God, but that God needs man in order that He may express in man and towards man the favour of His own heart.<a name=10:10></a> Jesus coming in manhood is all for men.<a name=10:11></a> It is sovereign in the sense that God took His own way unsolicited; He moved according to His own pleasure in causing the Dayspring from on high to visit us -- the shining forth from heaven of what was in His own heart.<a name=10:12></a>

		I do not wonder that Satan makes every effort by his servants to cast doubt on the virgin birth of Jesus.<a name=10:13></a> If he can succeed in that he has gained his, whole object; he has robbed us of all that the birth of Jesus means: he has robbed us of the favour of God, and of God's salvation.<a name=10:14></a> If Nazareth and Bethlehem go, Calvary goes also, and there is no Jesus of Nazareth glorified at the right hand of God.<a name=10:15></a> The whole fabric of Christianity is gone.<a name=10:16></a>

		Mercy is spoken of here in connection with the coming in of Jesus; God remembered mercy.<a name=20:3></a> At the end of <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2">Exodus  2</a>we are told that God remembered His covenant.<a name=20:4></a> The people were poor slaves and idolaters; Ezekiel tells us that they worshipped idols when God took them up in Egypt, but He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and He acknowledged them as subjects of mercy.<a name=20:5></a> That is how God has acknowledged us.<a name=20:6></a> The state of Israel in Luke I was a very sad one, but Mary took account of them as subjects of mercy.<a name=20:7></a> John came in altogether on the line of mercy; Jehovah "magnified his mercy" with Elizabeth, and when her neighbours and kinsfolk heard it they appreciated it and rejoiced with her.<a name=20:8></a> The subject of conversation in all the hill country was the acting of God in mercy.<a name=20:9></a> Thank God there are still people living in "the hill country" who are not engrossed with business, or pleasure, or politics, or religion, but who converse together on the ways of God in mercy!<a name=20:10></a> God made His covenant in mercy, and He remembers it, and nothing can invalidate it.<a name=20:11></a> He brought in Jesus purely on the line of mercy.<a name=20:12></a> God is said to be rich in mercy; He has such an abundance of it that He has a large quantity to dispense.<a name=20:13></a>

		We see here that there were persons who appreciated mercy, but they had to learn to discard natural thoughts.<a name=20:14></a> It was very natural to call the child after his father, but John had been named from heaven.<a name=20:15></a> He was the expression of the favour of heaven, and Zacharias and Elizabeth were in the confidence of heaven.<a name=20:16></a> They were free from natural thoughts, and they both appreciated that his name was John.<a name=20:17></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is the great expression of God's mercy, and Elizabeth was occupied with Mary's Child rather than her own, and Zacharias was full of thoughts of Christ rather than of John.<a name=20:18></a> He spoke of God fulfilling "mercy with our fathers" and remembering "his holy covenant".<a name=20:19></a> He speaks of "the bowels of mercy of our God".<a name=20:20></a> That is the source from which all blessing comes; Jesus comes to be the full expression of it.<a name=20:21></a>

		This utterance of Zacharias shows that God is moving in the presence of conditions of need that call for mercy.<a name=21:11></a> The thought of influences adverse to God and adverse to His people is clearly referred to, for He speaks of "deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us".<a name=21:12></a> There are hostile conditions in view but the Horn of deliverance is equal to them all.<a name=21:13></a> It is a happy thought that if we are hindered by any hostile power there is not the slightest reason for it on God's part, for He has raised up a Horn of deliverance that is equal to anything.<a name=21:14></a> We all have enemies.<a name=21:15></a> A great deal rises up in ourselves and many influences act upon us through others, but God's Horn of deliverance is more than equal to liberate us from all.<a name=21:16></a> There is no need now for us to be hindered by any influence adverse to God.<a name=21:17></a> Peter speaks about fleshly lusts that war against the soul; if I have a fleshly lust it is an opportunity for me to prove the power of God's Horn of deliverance.<a name=21:18></a> Then there are reasonings.<a name=21:19></a> Did you never have a battle with your own reasonings?<a name=21:20></a> God's Horn of deliverance would set us free from all "reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God".<a name=21:21></a>

		The public position is taken account of in the opening verses of this chapter; everything that publicly attached to Israel had broken down.<a name=47:18></a> The times of the Gentiles were running their course; the Roman power ruled.<a name=47:19></a> That in itself was the evidence that the kingdom had passed away from Israel.<a name=47:20></a> Descendants of Esau were subordinate rulers in that which had been David's kingdom.<a name=47:21></a> As to the priesthood we are told that it was the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas,

		The word of God came upon John.<a name=48:14></a> God spoke then in view of the coming of Christ, and He is speaking now in the last days of the church in view of Christ's coming again.<a name=48:15></a> The state of things in the church is every bit as bad as, or worse than, the state of things in Israel, but God is speaking in a distinct and marked way.<a name=48:16></a> God has been bringing in light ever since the Reformation; every century He has brought in more light; the word of God has been given and it is that which emancipates the people of God.<a name=48:17></a> They have been able to escape from what is really the word of man by receiving the word of God; the word brings forth a generation that is according to God.<a name=48:18></a> It is incorruptible seed and it brings forth a generation like itself.<a name=48:19></a> What marks Philadelphia is, "thou hast kept my word"; such persons receive and value the word of God.<a name=48:20></a> God is speaking in grace, and that will always be the character of divine speaking while the assembly is here.<a name=48:21></a> The word of God is the word of grace; Paul says, "I commend you to God and the word of his grace".<a name=48:22></a>

		If God moves in grace, it is to remove every obstacle or difficulty that stands in His way; that comes out in this quotation from Isaiah: "every gorge shall be filled up".<a name=49:9></a> The gorges represent what does not come up to the proper level; there is deficiency, the valleys have to be filled up.<a name=49:10></a> This is illustrated in the crowds, who were lacking in gracious consideration for others and who said, "What should we do?<a name=49:11></a>" John says, "He that has two body coats, let him give to him that has none, and he that has food, let him do likewise".<a name=49:12></a> If God comes in to operate in grace and salvation, He will fill up every deficiency.<a name=49:13></a> But on the other hand there are mountains and hills which have to be brought low; they represent such as the Pharisees boasting that they had Abraham for their father; all that sort of thing has to come down; if God moves in grace He will bring it down.<a name=49:14></a> Then the "crooked places" have their counterpart in such as the tax-gatherers who made people pay too much; the soldiers, oppressing and falsely accusing, would answer to the "rough places".<a name=49:15></a> If God operates in grace He adjusts everything so that all flesh shall see His salvation; in result all can see how God can adjust man morally at every point.<a name=49:16></a> He deals with every condition, and He adjusts everything that is wrong, whether it is deficient, or high and haughty, or crooked, or rough -- God takes His own way to bring about moral conditions that are suitable to Himself.<a name=49:17></a>

		John teaches the necessity for new birth in a very striking way, though he does not exactly put it in those word>.<a name=50:6></a> He says to them, "God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham".<a name=50:7></a> I have no doubt that is an allusion to the necessity for the new birth.<a name=50:8></a> If God makes a stone into a child it is a very sovereign movement, and that God should so act is the only hope for man.<a name=50:9></a> As far as man is concerned there is not a bit of anything in him for God, but if God makes a stone into a child it is a miracle of mercy.<a name=50:10></a> Man after the flesh is morally the offspring of Satan, the "offspring of vipers", and therefore that man never has brought forth good fruit, and never can.<a name=50:11></a> John says that the time has come to deal with the tree right down to the root.<a name=50:12></a> It is not a question merely of the fruit but of the tree; he says, "Every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire"; the axe is applied to the root of the trees.<a name=50:13></a> The root is what mar, is according to the flesh.<a name=50:14></a> Man according to the flesh never did bring forth good fruit, and the time had come for all expectations from man after the flesh to cease, not only for the tree to be cut down, but to be cast into the fire.<a name=50:15></a> It is quite certain that if you cut a tree down you do not expect fruit from it afterwards, and still less would you expect any fruit if it had been cast into the fire: that is the complete and final rejection of it so that henceforth nothing is to be expected from it; you cannot revive it.<a name=50:16></a> Such a statement as this looks on to the cross, where there was the cutting down and casting into the fire of all that man is according to the flesh, in order that the ground might be cleared for a new generation raised up by God Himself out of what was lifeless -- "these stones".<a name=50:17></a>

		The third temptation was more subtle than the first two, because it was based upon a divine promise; it was a suggestion that the Lord should avail Himself of a promise which would show publicly that He was the subject of divine care.<a name=66:11></a> The devil would suggest a putting of God to the test as to whether He would be true to His word.<a name=66:12></a> To do so would be a proof of want of confidence in God; it would be to tempt God, as the people did when they said, "Is Jehovah among us or not?<a name=66:13></a>" The Lord answered this by the scripture which forbad doing so.<a name=66:14></a> We learn here that Satan is conversant with Scripture; he knew that Jesus was the Son of God and the Messiah, and he knew the scriptures referring to the Messiah, and quoted one of them.<a name=66:15></a> I suppose the devil knows the Bible better than any one of us and he often quotes it for his own ends.<a name=66:16></a> But he was careful to quote just as much as would answer his purpose; there was another verse immediately following: "Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot".<a name=66:17></a> He did not quote that

		In the next incident we see Jesus as the glory of His people Israel, for the widow of Nain represents the nation as bereaved of all hope, but finding in her desolation that there was One who could bring back her son from the gates of death.<a name=98:3></a> In this incident we see the compassion of God expressed in Jesus in circumstances where all was utterly hopeless on the human side.<a name=98:4></a> A widow bereft of her only son!<a name=98:5></a> What could be more pathetic?<a name=98:6></a> Such an occasion would move human sympathy almost everywhere, so we find here that "a very considerable crowd of the city was with her".<a name=98:7></a> But how helpless they all were!<a name=98:8></a> He was dead, and they could only carry him out.<a name=98:9></a> Every citizen of Nain up to that time had had to succumb to the power of death.<a name=98:10></a> But One greater than death drew near that day to the city gate, and met the burial procession.<a name=98:11></a> No one called upon Him to intervene; He had not as yet, so far as we know, exercised His power in the domain of death.<a name=98:12></a> It might well have been that no one in the crowds had the slightest hope that He could do anything when death had actually taken place.<a name=98:13></a> It was a case in which the initiative could only be with Himself.<a name=98:14></a> But He was here as God's representative, and, as Peter told a Gentile congregation later, "God was with him".<a name=98:15></a> How would God act in the presence of a heart desolated by the ravages of death?<a name=98:16></a> "And the Lord, seeing her, was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Weep not; and coming up he touched the bier, and the bearers stopped.<a name=98:17></a> And he said, Youth, I say to thee, Wake up.<a name=98:18></a> And the dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother", Sin has let loose a flood of sorrow upon human hearts, and this is no small part of what is under the eye of God in the world.<a name=98:19></a> Indeed, I have no doubt that the sorrows which sin has entailed upon mankind are much greater in volume than "all the pleasures of sin".<a name=98:20></a> We are apt to think that the ambitions of men, and their lust for gain and self-gratification, and their pride and vanity, are more prominent than their sorrows.<a name=98:21></a> They are, perhaps, in a public way, but, if the true secret history of every human heart were written, I believe it would be found that disappointment and sorrow are in greater bulk, and have been more really felt than anything else.<a name=98:22></a> And the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord going through the country city by city, and village by village, is an intimation that He would have the power of the kingdom of God to be known in a large number of different localities.<a name=104:9></a> The reign of grace was to come into expression in many places, a foreshadowing of what would come about by the setting up of local assemblies in connection with Paul's ministry.<a name=104:10></a> Not only did the Lord preach and announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, but the power of the kingdom was seen in the persons who accompanied Him.<a name=104:11></a> "The twelve" represented His authority in administration, but the women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, and who now ministered to Him of their substance, were a personal evidence of the power of the kingdom.<a name=104:12></a> The Lord would have that kind of administration, and that kind of personal testimony, in every city and village that He visits throughout the world.<a name=104:13></a> The authority of those whom He has chosen to be apostles must be everywhere owned, for they are the representatives of His authority, but there must also be the subjective state set forth in the women, who were healed persons, set free from the power of evil, and now ministering to Him in love.<a name=104:14></a> The woman seen at the end of the previous

		The testimony of God in this world largely hangs on the appreciation of Jesus as the Friend of sinners.<a name=105:4></a> Where Jesus is loved and ministered to, and where His heart is gratified by what He receives from those who love Him, there is the kingdom of God in power.<a name=105:5></a> Perhaps many of us would be more vitally in the kingdom of God if we were more in the ardent affection of those to whom much has been forgiven.<a name=105:6></a> Perhaps some of us still need healing of infirmities which hinder us from expressing what God is in grace.<a name=105:7></a> Mark tells us that the Lord cast seven demons out of Mary Magdalene, but here in Luke we read that they had "gone out".<a name=105:8></a> It suggests that they could not remain where Jesus was loved.<a name=105:9></a> But if the demons go out it is that the Lord's appointments may be recognised as set forth in "the twelve".<a name=105:10></a> For us this would mean that the Lord's commandments through His apostles have their full place in directing us as to how we walk together (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>).<a name=105:11></a> One important way in which love to the Lord Jesus comes into expression is by regard for that assembly order which He has instituted.<a name=105:12></a>

		The first three verses of chapter 8 really connect with the end of chapter 7; verse 4 begins a new subject.<a name=105:13></a> There is now "a great crowd coming together", and this brings before the Lord's mind that the kingdom of God was going to take a certain form in which it would be necessary to discriminate between different classes of persons who would come into relation to it.<a name=105:14></a> The word of God would be widely sown, and many would hear it, but it would only be fruitful in "good ground", where there would be, as presented in Luke, a full result -- a hundredfold.<a name=105:15></a> What we see here is the normal yield from seed so valuable and fertile as "the word of God".<a name=105:16></a> The word of divine grace falling into good ground produces a full result for God.<a name=105:17></a> The Lord gives His disciples a clear understanding why the word in many cases does not result in a normal yield.<a name=105:18></a> These are "mysteries" known only to those

		We must not lose sight of the distinctive place of the twelve, but at the same time, in principle, every soul converted has in view the extension of the representation of God in this world.<a name=115:12></a> There is a further extension later on, in the mission of the seventy.<a name=115:13></a> We see the representation of God in one Man, then in twelve, and then in seventy; the thing is extended, and in a certain sense has been extending ever since.<a name=115:14></a> We should cherish the thought of representation; it has come very much before me of late.<a name=115:15></a> The twelve represented the Lord wherever they went; they did what He did and they said what He said.<a name=115:16></a> They preached the kingdom of God.<a name=115:17></a> It was the distinctive position of the twelve, but it is the position morally of all saints.<a name=115:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This thought of representation is a very important thing in the mind of God.<a name=116:4></a> I believe it is the great primary thought of God, and it puts great dignity on the twelve, and on all who are represented in the twelve.<a name=116:5></a> For this representation nothing is requisite outside likeness to Jesus and what is in Him; no accessories are needed; no staff, no scrip, no bread, no money, and not two coats.<a name=116:6></a> The Lord could invest the disciples with ability to do as He did Himself, and to say the same things that He would say Himself; and to do things without any extraneous addition of any kind, no matter how necessary it might appear to be from a human point of view -- they were adequately furnished without any addition.<a name=116:7></a> It is not only that things are done correctly, but that they are done in such a way and by such persons that there is a representation of Christ and of the blessed God in the way they are done.<a name=116:8></a> We want to see what the divine mind is, and to see that there is that in Christ that can make it good according to our measure in every one of us.<a name=116:9></a>

		We have seen the Lord in the previous chapter as the Revealer; that would clearly be on the divine side, but we see Him here as the Teacher, and that would have reference to our side.<a name=131:9></a> Prayer would represent spiritual exercises on our side that are brought into activity as the product of the revelation: that would be the true character of prayer.<a name=131:10></a> No one has ever before spoken to the Father in such a way as the Son spoke to Him.<a name=131:11></a> I suppose the disciples must have felt the wonderful character of His speaking to the Father, and they were so moved by it that there was a desire with them to be taught to pray.<a name=131:12></a> I think we have all to feel that we need to be taught to pray; that is, prayer in a spiritual sense is not merely the expression of need, but the expression of exercises brought into being in the light of the revelation of God.<a name=131:13></a>

		The revelation has the effect of producing confidence, so there is no sense of difficulty in getting things from the Father.<a name=136:20></a> The Lord uses figures to illustrate His meaning, but we find that the figures are taken up in some sense by way of contrast, not only of comparison.<a name=136:21></a> For instance, a man has a friend, but if he goes at an unusual hour like midnight to prefer his request, he may find the friend unwilling, though he may by importunity overcome his unwillingness.<a name=136:22></a> Now the Lord indicates that you will never have to do like that with the Father, though we are to ask, seek and knock.<a name=136:23></a> Again, the Lord speaks

		There is a difference in this chapter between what we have need of and what the Father gives us.<a name=157:3></a> The things He gives us are far superior to the things we have need of; but as long as we are here we have need of food and clothing, and the Father knows that.<a name=157:4></a> It is the Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom, and that is far greater than feeding and clothing us.<a name=157:5></a> If He will give you the kingdom, a whole realm of blessed things perfectly in accord with His own mind, He will assuredly give you bread to eat, and clothes to wear, so that you may be perfectly free for that kingdom.<a name=157:6></a> On the Father's side it is His good pleasure to give us the kingdom; and on our side it should be our pleasure to seek it, and to be relieved in the sense of divine care so that the provision for temporal need is not the ruling principle of life.<a name=157:7></a> The principle of covetousness does not rule, but we are perfectly free in the sense of the Father's care to seek the kingdom.<a name=157:8></a> The Father's kingdom is a wonderful thing; that is what is to be sought, and we can all seek it.<a name=157:9></a> There is nothing that has any kind of prior claim.<a name=157:10></a> People say that they have not time for spiritual things, but there is nothing that has a prior claim to the Father's kingdom.<a name=157:11></a> The little flock are a select company, suited to receive such a gift as the kingdom; they are apart from hypocrisy and covetousness, and free from all fear; they are friends of Christ, identified with the testimony.<a name=157:12></a>

		The Father's kingdom is a realm ordered according to the Father.<a name=157:13></a> It is the place where God is known in supreme grace as Father; and the saints are in the place of dependence, praying in the light of that revelation, and having the gift of the Spirit out of heaven.<a name=157:14></a> These things constitute the principal features of the Father's kingdom.<a name=157:15></a> The Father's kingdom is an order of things morally according to His mind.<a name=157:16></a> God is known there in the relationship of Father: "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" and "Your Father knows you have need of these things".<a name=157:17></a> All is now being worked out in conditions of outward smallness -- in a "little flock".<a name=157:18></a>

		The disciples had been under the influence of Jesus, and He had been bringing before their hearts the blessedness of God as known in grace, and the blessedness of the heavenly system.<a name=215:1></a> Now He forewarns them that it was inevitable that offences would come; the enemy would make persistent efforts to ensnare the disciples and take them away from the spirit of little ones.<a name=215:2></a> Offences are inevitable.<a name=215:3></a> The word is often used as being caused by the Lord: Christ Himself is a rock of <i>offence</i>; "unto the Jews a <i>stumbling block</i>"; "the <i>offence</i> of the cross".<a name=215:4></a> Christ and the truth become an offence to the natural man.<a name=215:5></a> But here the word is used of things that are contrary to spiritual prosperity.<a name=215:6></a>

		Many of our difficulties when traced to their root are found to arise from self-importance.<a name=215:9></a> A sense of the greatness of God in grace is a marvellous reducer, but the enemy would ever seek to bring in offences, something to take the little ones away from the place of littleness.<a name=215:10></a> That is the way the enemy works all the time.<a name=215:11></a> The Lord prizes very highly that state of heart which thinks not of itself, but of the blessedness of God as known in grace, and of the heavenly system.<a name=215:12></a> He thinks very seriously of everything that would divert from it; the Lord takes a very serious account of any influence that would tend to take us out of the place of being little ones.<a name=215:13></a>

		The Lord is telling us here what we may have to meet with; offences are inevitable, and we may be tested by a brother.<a name=216:6></a> He may be a naughty brother, but he is a valuable asset if we know how to take account of him, because he is an opportunity for active grace in the saints; if he sins there is a call for restorative action.<a name=216:7></a> The Lord knew all the conditions we may have to meet, and that a brother may be naughty enough to sin against us seven times in one day.<a name=216:8></a> Such a thing has never happened to me, but the Lord says it might happen and we are to take heed that even such a thing as that does not take us out of the spirit of grace that should mark a little one.<a name=216:9></a> The little one is not thinking of himself at all, but of the joy of grace; it is like the spirit of chapter 15 passed on to our brotherly relations.<a name=216:10></a>

		The Psalms speak much of the sufferings of Christ, they should have a great place among us when we are in assembly, but I doubt if we are much up to it.<a name=308:12></a> We are to think of the exceeding sweetness of the love that would suffer so much.<a name=308:13></a> The Lord is cherished in His suffering love, but that means that we are perfectly free from all thought of ourselves.<a name=308:14></a> We are not thinking so much of what the Lord did <i>for us</i>, but we are thinking of the path of unmeasured sorrow and suffering which He traversed in order to bring to us the grace and love of God.<a name=308:15></a> The Psalms rightly give prominence to that, and it is always so in spiritual affections.<a name=308:16></a> There is no subject in Scripture so profoundly spiritual as the sufferings of Christ.<a name=308:17></a> Everyone ought to read J.<a name=308:18></a> N.<a name=308:19></a> Darby's wonderful book on the sufferings of Christ; it would do the saints good to read it once a year.<a name=308:20></a> The Lord was the holy Sufferer all the way through; the whole Scripture testifies to His sufferings.<a name=308:21></a> The whole testimony of Scripture was that He would suffer and enter His glory.<a name=308:22></a>

		The Lord had in mind that there should be a company of living witnesses: "Ye are witnesses of these things", verse 48.<a name=311:12></a> The Lord shows that, consequent on His suffering and rising again, repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=311:13></a> It is the full width and scope of the testimony of grace.<a name=311:14></a> Repentance is preached as a wonderful bestowal of grace on God's part; the preaching is part of the grace of the gospel.<a name=311:15></a>
