		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This part of the Holy Scriptures has a peculiar and touching claim on the attention of every Christian.<a name=1:1></a> No other part of Scripture comes to us in quite the same way.<a name=1:2></a> It is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him".<a name=1:3></a> God gave this revelation to the glorious anointed Man at His own right hand; it is His revelation.<a name=1:4></a> It treats of matters which are thus manifestly of interest to God and to Jesus Christ, and which therefore cannot fail to be of profound interest to His servants.<a name=1:5></a> For it is in the character of servants, or bondmen, that we are here shewn "what must shortly take place".<a name=1:6></a> This book is for saints viewed as in responsible service, caring for the interests of their Lord.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This may well raise the question with each one as to how far we are truly in this character.<a name=1:8></a> The indisposition of many to consider this book is probably traceable to the fact that we are so little in the true attitude and spirit of bondmen.<a name=1:9></a> There is a tendency with us all to seek our own things, not the things of Jesus Christ, and when this is so we are hardly true bondmen.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John refers to himself here, not as an apostle, but as a bondman and a brother.<a name=1:11></a> He was one of a suffering

	<div class="paragraph">
		company: "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=2:1></a> It was to a man suffering for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus that this revelation was communicated, and he made it known to those who were partakers -- at any rate, in measure -- of the same kind of suffering.<a name=2:2></a> If there were more fidelity there would be more suffering, and this book would be more appreciated.<a name=2:3></a> It has been observed that in periods of the church's history when there have been special pressures or persecutions, as in times of martyrdom, the saints have turned with peculiar interest to this book, and have derived distinct comfort and support from it.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where there is a desire to connect Christianity with this world, and to think that things here are improving, one can understand there would be a lack of interest in this Revelation.<a name=2:5></a> Persons having such desires would not care to face the fact that the world system is coming under judgment.<a name=2:6></a> The whole course of things here is wrong, and must be set aside to make room for something else.<a name=2:7></a> The churches (assemblies) have failed, and departed from the character in which they would have been true light-bearers, in suffering witness to a rejected Christ; and the world in every phase is a scene of moral disorder.<a name=2:8></a> This is the true character of things here, and it is clearly set forth, with all its consequences, in this book.<a name=2:9></a> To look at such things in the fear of God involves serious exercises, which many are reluctant to face, and this may be one reason why this book has been so neglected.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, in truth, it is a most encouraging book for all who fear God and who love our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=2:11></a> For it shews the ultimate triumph of God over every
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		form of the power of evil.<a name=3:1></a> It shews the character of that power, and all that it will issue in, but it shews it broken and set aside to make room for "the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12:10">Revelation  12:10</a>).<a name=3:2></a> Its scope is very wide, for it shews how all things in the moral universe are to be dealt with so as to establish eternally the glory of God, and the full blessing of man, recovered through redemption -- whether it be the church or other families of the redeemed.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this book we are taken into the divine confidence at a peculiar moment.<a name=3:4></a> Christ has been manifested in flesh; He has been to the cross to accomplish redemption; and now as a risen Man He has gone back to heaven.<a name=3:5></a> The church -- left here to be His witness in the time of His rejection -- has failed.<a name=3:6></a> Now what will happen?<a name=3:7></a> We are told here "what must shortly take place", and if we aspire to be confidential servants we shall take the deepest interest in the communications.<a name=3:8></a> Hearts touched by the love of Jesus Christ, and by the way that love expressed itself in death, and by the consciousness of the wonderful position in which that love has set us as priests to His God and Father, must take a deep and intelligent interest in all that He has to communicate.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The time is near".<a name=3:10></a> We are apt to put these things off in our minds to a somewhat distant future, but the Lord would have them near, and in reading this book the Spirit brings them near to us.<a name=3:11></a> Then the reading and hearing the words of this prophecy are in view of the things written in it being <i>kept</i>.<a name=3:12></a> The things written are of great value and are to be treasured; they are not matters for idle curiosity.<a name=3:13></a> Special blessing is attached to reading, hearing, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		keeping them.<a name=4:1></a> And for those who find themselves, as we do, in the conditions of the last days it is essential that we should have the serious exercise which such a book produces, and also the comfort and establishment which it affords.<a name=4:2></a> These are days when nothing but a good and divine foundation will preserve us from being shaken.<a name=4:3></a> Amidst the insecurity of things here, this book would connect our faith with the stability of the throne in heaven and of Him who sits upon it, the One "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty".<a name=4:4></a> This gives security from perturbation of mind in the midst of all the tremblings and shakings here.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One important object of this book is to preserve saints from becoming earth-dwellers by connecting all their hopes and expectations with heaven, and by leading them there in spirit even now.<a name=4:6></a> There is much here for the heart as well as the conscience.<a name=4:7></a> What could be more encouraging than to see the possibility of being an overcomer even in the midst of assembly failure and departure?<a name=4:8></a> And then, as we pass on through the book, to see different families of saints coming into view, called by divine grace and sustained in divine witness amidst terrible and appalling conditions, is most stimulating to faith and love.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John is very interesting as a representative man.<a name=4:10></a> The Lord said of him, "If I will that he tarry till I come", and he represents what remains to the end.<a name=4:11></a> The first phase of the church's history stood connected with Jerusalem and Peter's ministry; the second phase was connected with the results of Paul's labours and ministry; and the third with John's.<a name=4:12></a> In the early chapters of the Acts Jerusalem was the centre, but the seventh chapter brings into view what has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		been called "the new metropolis".<a name=5:1></a> Jesus was at the right hand of God, and from thence He called another apostle and gave him a distinctive mission, and the result of Paul's ministry was that local assemblies were formed far and wide in the Gentile world.<a name=5:2></a> What this phase of things resulted in historically we may see in the second epistle to Timothy, and in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>, 3, we also see the failure of the assemblies as set here in local responsibility.<a name=5:3></a> But after all the failure John looks up with undimmed freshness of affection at the end, and says, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus".<a name=5:4></a> He shews how the Spirit and the bride say, "Come", and how the heavenly city will descend having the glory of God.<a name=5:5></a> He represents those holy and living affections which can be sustained all through in spite of church failure, and which can be found at the end in full response to the love of Christ -- the Coming One.<a name=5:6></a> I trust we cherish the thought of being found here in such affections.<a name=5:7></a> They will not secure us a great place in this world; instead of expanding here we shall probably get more and more circumscribed.<a name=5:8></a> We may have to be content with a Patmos, but we shall be happy there if, like John, we have clear vision of all that is shortly to be brought in by our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book is addressed to "the seven assemblies which are in Asia", and those assemblies are seen as seven golden lamps in the midst of which "one like the Son of man" walks.<a name=5:10></a> These assemblies are viewed as representing all the assemblies, seven being a number suggestive of completeness.<a name=5:11></a> But it is the assemblies viewed in their responsibility as light-bearers, and as subject to the scrutiny of the One who is seen and heard as taking account of their moral

		state, commending all that of which He can approve, and expressing His judgment of that which is displeasing to Him.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first chapter we have conditions which, if maintained, would have preserved the assemblies from failure.<a name=6:2></a> Keeping the things written would have marked true bondmen.<a name=6:3></a> Every needed divine support and consolation would have been found in the rich supply of grace and peace from the eternally existing One upon the throne, and from the seven Spirits, and from Jesus Christ.<a name=6:4></a> The dependent affections of the saints would have been connected with divine fulness of resource, and engaged with a supremely worthy and blessed Object.<a name=6:5></a> One, too, who awakens by the sense of what He has done for us in love the responsive affections and praises of every heart that knows Him.<a name=6:6></a> "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=6:7></a> Amen".<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be noted that the Spirit is not seen here as the one Spirit in relation to the one body, but as "seven Spirits"; that is, He is presented in the diversity and completeness of His actings for the effectuation of God's sovereign will.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The vision of the One in the midst of the lamps was such that it caused John to fall at His feet as dead.<a name=6:10></a> In the service of such an One there could be no power or ability of any kind save what came from the strengthening touch of His right hand.<a name=6:11></a> All else had to find itself in the place of death.<a name=6:12></a> There would then be material suited for divine witness.<a name=6:13></a> The seven lamps are "golden", which suggests what is divine in character -- the fruit of divine grace and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		working; no other kind of material would be suited to sustain divine light in witness here.<a name=7:1></a> Then to realize the nearness of the Lord as walking in the midst of the seven lamps, with His eye constantly upon them, would preserve the holy sense of responsibility to Him who, though unseen, is near to take account at every moment of how that responsibility is being carried out.<a name=7:2></a> Had these things been maintained in power in the souls of the saints they would have been preserved from the elements of defection.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Himself is seen as "the faithful witness" in verse 5.<a name=7:4></a> There could be no true thought of witness save as seeing it first in Him, and we see it there without flaw or failure.<a name=7:5></a> How perfectly did He witness to all that God was in grace to man, and to all that Man was as entirely according to the mind and pleasure of God!<a name=7:6></a> Now He is "the first-born from the dead" -- the Risen One, outside everything here.<a name=7:7></a> And He will soon be manifested as "the prince of the kings of the earth".<a name=7:8></a> We confess Him as "King and Sovereign even now"; we confess His title while He is still the rejected One.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment this great and glorious Person is mentioned it calls forth an outburst of praise from every heart that knows Him.<a name=7:10></a> "To him who loves us", etc.<a name=7:11></a> There is an overflow of praise <i>to</i> Him, and then a solemn testimony <i>about</i> Him.<a name=7:12></a> "Behold, he comes with the clouds", etc.<a name=7:13></a> The world has not done with Him; they may think they have got rid of Him, and act as if they had, but they have not.<a name=7:14></a> "God .<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a>.<a name=7:17></a> now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent, because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, giving the proof of it

		to all in having raised him from among the dead" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:30">Acts  17:30</a>, 31).<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position in which John was found is very suggestive of the place in which true testimony is found at the present time -- that is, during the church period.<a name=8:2></a> He was a prisoner in a bleak and sterile island "for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus".<a name=8:3></a> The testimony of Jesus is found in suffering and reproach, and in an outwardly restricted place.<a name=8:4></a> We may see the same thing in the case of Paul; his most mature years were spent in prison, and it was when there that the testimony came out most distinctively, and the ministry was richest.<a name=8:5></a> Both Paul and John were very much restricted outwardly.<a name=8:6></a> If things are popular it is a pretty sure sign that there is a large proportion of the human element in them.<a name=8:7></a> It is wholesome for us to consider this.<a name=8:8></a> And opposition to the testimony, and reproach in connection with it, are now found within; that is, from those who bear the name of Christians.<a name=8:9></a> Those who do not value, and move with, light which God may give, become adversaries to it, and there is a good deal of opposition of a subtle character.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the restricted place John got compensation in the way of divine communications, and we should be exercised not to miss these.<a name=8:11></a> It is through conflict and difficulty that the truth is brought out; every spiritual gain has to be fought for and suffered for.<a name=8:12></a> Everything that has been recovered in the church has been won through conflict and suffering.<a name=8:13></a> Take the Reformation: we have the fruit of it now, but it was a great battle.<a name=8:14></a> And the truth of Christ and the assembly, which was restored during the last century, came out in the face of tremendous

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		opposition.<a name=9:1></a> The truth has always to be bought; and when bought there is the danger that it may be sold for something much less valuable.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom is marked at the present time by tribulation and the exercise of patience.<a name=9:3></a> Those who will live godly in Christ Jesus suffer persecution.<a name=9:4></a> By-and-by we shall serve God in a scene of glory, but now we are called to serve Him in tribulation and patience.<a name=9:5></a> We cannot expect to avoid suffering if we realize that the whole tide of things here is opposed to the character and rule of the kingdom in which we are partakers.<a name=9:6></a> When saints are bright they get tribulation in some way, and it tends to make them brighter still.<a name=9:7></a> The more you rub good metal the brighter it shines, and opposition and difficulty bring out the reality of divine witness in saints.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John "became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=9:9></a> He was entirely abstracted from what was merely natural, or of the mind and thought of man, and absorbed in a special way with spiritual things.<a name=9:10></a> It is interesting to see that, though he was alone so far as we know, the Lord's day was marked by this abstraction, which would imply some peculiar enjoyment of spiritual privilege.<a name=9:11></a> The Lord's day here spoken of is the first day of the week -- a very special day in Christianity.<a name=9:12></a> The week is a divinely marked period of time; it goes back to creation, and has its place in all dispensations; it is part of the original divine ordering of things.<a name=9:13></a> The sabbath was the last day of the week; God blessed it and hallowed it, because that on it He rested from all the work of creation, and He would have it hallowed by His people; one great controversy which He had with them was that they did not keep it.<a name=9:14></a> But the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hallowed day now is the first day of the week; that day has been marked off from all the other days as the one on which the Lord rose from the dead, and He claims it for Himself.<a name=10:1></a> Hence we find that on two succeeding first days of the week the disciples came together, and the Lord came into their midst (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>), and at a later period the saints came together to break bread on that day (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a>).<a name=10:2></a> It is a day peculiarly characteristic of Christianity, and marked by special spiritual privilege, and its being the <i>first</i> day suggests that it is intended to give character to the six days that follow.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though John was probably isolated from his brethren he was "in the Spirit on the Lord's day", and engaged with spiritual realities outside the whole course of things here.<a name=10:4></a> But while in this state of abstraction he heard behind him "a great voice as of a trumpet".<a name=10:5></a> He was called back, as it were, for a time from the peculiar spiritual privileges which lie in the Spirit, and which would normally be in his thoughts as connected with "the first day of the week".<a name=10:6></a> He was called back from these things to view the assemblies as set here in responsibility to give light for God.<a name=10:7></a> And to see in their midst One who was taking account of their state, and expressing His judgment as to it.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The light would shine as God was really known in grace, and as the saints were in the shining of Christ.<a name=10:9></a> Their relations with one another as walking together in truth and love and holiness and unity, in complete separation from the world, would be such as to support the testimony of divine grace, and to preserve true witness to a rejected Christ.<a name=10:10></a> And the Lord is in the midst of the lamps to see how this character

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is maintained or in what it is departed from.<a name=11:1></a> How solemn is the thought!<a name=11:2></a> He is seen in judgment -- judgment in the sense of discernment -- discerning everything according to God.<a name=11:3></a> He is "girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle"; His affections are under restraint; they cannot flow freely in nourishing and cherishing, for much that is under His eye calls for rebuke and discipline.<a name=11:4></a> He is considering what is due to Himself and to God.<a name=11:5></a> "His head and hair white like white wool, as snow", suggests maturity in judgment.<a name=11:6></a> "His eyes as a flame of fire", speak of penetrating discernment; nothing in the inmost depths of our being can escape the scrutiny of those eyes.<a name=11:7></a> "His feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace"; wherever He treads, as He walks in the midst of the golden lamps, everything is tested according to what "our God" is as "a consuming fire".<a name=11:8></a> How searching the heat of that holy fire!<a name=11:9></a> Who can abide such a test?<a name=11:10></a> "His voice as the voice of many waters"; a voice, indeed, "full of majesty".<a name=11:11></a> "And having in his right hand seven stars"; He asserts His title and ability to hold every responsible element in the assemblies in His right hand; only as being there can it be rightly directed or sustained.<a name=11:12></a> "Out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth"; every convicting word in prophetic ministry which brings home to us our true condition is the action of that sword.<a name=11:13></a> "His countenance as the sun shines in its power"; the full revelation of God, effulgent in Him, is the light in which the church is blessed, as viewed on the line of privilege.<a name=11:14></a> But it is also the light by which the assemblies are judged on the line of their responsibility.<a name=11:15></a> The effulgence of God has shone forth in the Son, and the church's privilege

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be well for every Christian to see the Lord in this character.<a name=12:3></a> John had known Him in other ways; in the attractiveness of His walk as the Lamb of God; in all the varied blessedness of the ministry in word and deed which flowed out of that fulness of grace and truth which resided in Him; in the service of His love when He had stooped to wash His disciples' feet; and in those intimacies of holy affection which made him so conscious that he was "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=12:4></a> He had known what it was to lean on the breast of Jesus.<a name=12:5></a> But when he saw Him in the midst of the golden lamps he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=12:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think this is an experience which, if all had gone through it, would have preserved the assemblies from defection; it is what each individual needs to pass through in order to be an overcomer.<a name=12:7></a> It is the learning in His presence that all that is of the flesh, and according to man after the flesh, is brought to the nothingness of death there.<a name=12:8></a> We then realize that everything that is of ourselves has to be rebuked and refused, and that we can only be for the Lord as under the strengthening of His right hand.<a name=12:9></a> We have to learn that "without me ye can do nothing".<a name=12:10></a> We may learn this in nearness to the Lord, in the searching light of His presence, or we may learn it through practical failure or inward declension.<a name=12:11></a> It is happier, and the lesson is more deeply learned, if we learn it

		"He laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=13:3></a> It is as much as to say to the one who is at His feet as dead, "All that I am is for you; I became dead because that was your place, and I took it in grace for you; but now I am alive to be your strength and the Source of everything for you".<a name=13:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to learn death on all that is of ourselves that He may be all to us.<a name=13:5></a> Have we learned that there is not a bit of anything that has divine value save as we derive from Christ?<a name=13:6></a> That is how proper material for the candlestick comes in.<a name=13:7></a> Paul had the consciousness of utter weakness in himself, but he boasted in it that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.<a name=13:8></a> The right hand of Christ speaks of His power, which becomes available to us through the Spirit given.<a name=13:9></a> It is only as we are under the touch of His right hand that we can be overcomers.<a name=13:10></a> We see the effect of being there in John and in the other apostles.<a name=13:11></a> None of them departed from first love; they were sustained in freshness and spiritual energy to the very end of their responsible course.<a name=13:12></a> The letters of John and Peter and Paul, near the end of the course of each, shew them with undiminished affection and energy, strengthened and sustained by the right hand of Christ's power.<a name=13:13></a> The same power was available for others, and if it had been utilized there would have been no breakdown in responsibility.<a name=13:14></a> Thank God it is still available for all who call on the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of verse 19 has often been dwelt upon as giving a clear division into three parts of what John was to write.<a name=14:2></a> "What thou hast seen", is recorded in chapter 1: "the things that are" are the assemblies on earth -- the church period -- as addressed in chapters 2 and 3: "the things that are about to be <i>after these</i>" are things to take place when the assemblies are no longer found here; these things follow from chapter 4 onward.<a name=14:3></a>
	</div>

		In Ephesus, though there was as yet no public defection, under the Lord's eye first love had been left; then in Pergamos there was public departure -- the assembly dwelling in the world and having corrupters within; now in Thyatira we find Jezebel permitted and those in the assembly who were her children.<a name=34:3></a> The different stages of departure, and the increasing inroads of evil, which succeeded each other in the history of the assemblies, are thus clearly seen as discerned by the Lord.<a name=34:4></a>

		But even in an assembly where gross corruption was permitted there was that which the Lord could commend.<a name=34:5></a> "Love, and faith, and service, and thine endurance, and thy last works to be more than the first".<a name=34:6></a> One delights to think of the personal devotedness found in many saints during what are called "the dark ages".<a name=34:7></a> Many whose writings, or portions of them, have been preserved to us evidently loved the Lord and laboured for Him; and probably the vast majority of devoted ones left nothing to perpetuate their names, and never got a place in church history.<a name=34:8></a> The Lord could recognize even in such an assembly as Thyatira a remnant who were not Jezebel's children, nor personally corrupted by her teaching, and His consideration for them is very touching.<a name=34:9></a> "But to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine .<a name=34:10></a>.<a name=34:11></a>.<a name=34:12></a> I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast till I shall come".<a name=34:13></a> He takes account of them as having that which was of divine value, and which was to be held fast till He should come.<a name=34:14></a>

		CHAPTER 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must keep in mind that this book is divided into three parts.<a name=73:4></a> It was said to John, "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:19">Revelation  1:19</a>).<a name=73:5></a> The things which John had seen are in chapter 1; "the things that are" refer to the assemblies -- the church period.<a name=73:6></a> This was present when John wrote, and it still continues.<a name=73:7></a> Then there are "the things that are about to be after these"; chapter 4: 1 connects itself with this by the twice-repeated, "After these things".<a name=73:8></a> We do not find the assembly on earth after chapter 3, but we see divine grace and testimony in other companies of saints who will be found here after the assembly has been translated.<a name=73:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 4 and 5 come in as introductory to the properly prophetical part of the book.<a name=73:10></a> The first verse of chapter 4 is most important.<a name=73:11></a> John saw "a door opened <i>in heaven</i>", and heard a Voice which said, "<i>Come up here</i>, and I will shew thee the things which must take place after these things".<a name=73:12></a> John was to look at things from heaven, and it is from that standpoint that saints of the assembly view prophecy.<a name=73:13></a> It is this which makes the difference between Revelation

		and Daniel, though there are, of course, certain points of contact between them.<a name=74:1></a> Daniel -- the representative of an earthly people -- had visions by the rivers Ulai and Hiddekel, but John is the representative of a heavenly company, and he is called to "Come up here".<a name=74:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church will be actually in heaven after chapter 3, and to look aright at chapters 4 - 19 we must be spiritually there.<a name=74:3></a> The Lord would call us up there in spirit now, so that we may look down upon the earth as the scene of prophecy from a point outside it.<a name=74:4></a> He would not have us to be occupied with prophecy from an earthly standpoint.<a name=74:5></a> Many interpreters of this book have not gone up there, and they have been largely occupied in trying to fit past and current events into prophecy.<a name=74:6></a> Every one knows how they have succeeded!<a name=74:7></a> If you read this book to discover what will happen to England, how certain wars will terminate, and so forth, you are not likely to get much light.<a name=74:8></a> But if at the outset you respond to the invitation, "Come up here", you will get great illumination.<a name=74:9></a> Heaven is our true place; the assembly is found here in witness for the moment, but she belongs to heaven.<a name=74:10></a> It is as she takes her true place as belonging to heaven that she gets understanding in regard to other families.<a name=74:11></a>

		Then there is another thing essential to clear vision of "the things which must take place"; John says, "Immediately I became in the Spirit".<a name=74:12></a> The heavenly position must be accompanied by a state in keeping with it.<a name=74:13></a> To become in Spirit is to be abstracted from all activity of the human mind, and to be in a region where every thought and feeling is of the Spirit.<a name=74:14></a> It is a privilege within our reach.<a name=74:15></a> A brother well known in the ministry of the word said, "As soon as I find my mind working when reading Scripture, I

		CHAPTER 13
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter shews us the two great forms which the power of evil will take during the last half-week of Daniel's seventy weeks.<a name=143:3></a> It is by these two beasts, that those who dwell upon the earth will be deceived, and the saints persecuted and slain.<a name=143:4></a> There will be a great political power, seconded and supported by a religious power.<a name=143:5></a> The beast of verse 1 is the revived Roman Empire or its head, and the beast of verse 11 is the antichrist.<a name=143:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first beast rises out of the sea -- an unsettled and unordered state of things; it will be such conditions that will give opportunity for the revival by Satanic power of the Roman Empire.<a name=143:7></a> At present the powers that be are ordained of God.<a name=143:8></a> Consequent upon the failure of Israel, God ordained that earthly government should be found in four successive Gentile empires -- the Babylonish, the Medo-Persian, the Greek, and the Roman -- as made known prophetically in Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the great image (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2">Daniel  2</a>).<a name=143:9></a> The unity of the Roman Empire has long been broken up, and men might doubt that it would ever be found in existence again.<a name=143:10></a> But it will come up out of the abyss, and have its power from the dragon, so that when it appears no allegiance or respect will be due to it from the saints.<a name=143:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The extraordinary way in which the Roman Empire will appear again will make the whole earth wonder.<a name=144:11></a> They will do homage to it, and to the dragon who gives it authority.<a name=144:12></a> The only ones who will not do homage to this blasphemous imperial power will be God's elect, those whose names have "been written from the founding of the world in the book of life of the slain Lamb".<a name=144:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The beast will open "its mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle".<a name=145:3></a> There is something blessed conveyed even in this, for it is the proof that God's Name will still be here in testimony, and His tabernacle will still overshadow His saints with its protection.<a name=145:4></a> If His Name and His tabernacle had disappeared from the earth there would be no object in blaspheming them.<a name=145:5></a> Then the beast blasphemes "those who have their tabernacle in the heaven".<a name=145:6></a> I think this indicates that there will be those in that day who will maintain faith's ancient confession of being "strangers and sojourners on the earth", and who will be prepared to lose their lives here in view of a dwelling in the heaven.<a name=145:7></a> A place in the kingdom on earth will be the portion of those who are carried right through the tribulation under the protection of God's tabernacle.<a name=145:8></a> But the saints against whom the beast makes war, and whom he overcomes, will have "a better, that is, a heavenly" portion.<a name=145:9></a> The beast may overcome them, in the sense of being able to kill them, but morally they gain the victory over him (chapter 15: 2; 20: 4).<a name=145:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus some saints will be carried through to be a testimony to the protection of God's tabernacle here; others will not get deliverance here, but will be conscious that their tabernacle is "in the heaven".<a name=145:11></a> Satan is ever intensely hostile to the thought of man having a present dwelling in heaven.<a name=145:12></a> He does not so much oppose the thought of men going to heaven when they die, because that does not make men

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 9 and 10 warn the saints of that day against the use of any human or fleshly power in their own defence.<a name=146:3></a> To suffer patiently, even as the slain Lamb did, was their calling.<a name=146:4></a> "Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints".<a name=146:5></a> It is a warning equally applicable to ourselves.<a name=146:6></a>

		"Another beast" rises out of the earth.<a name=146:7></a> He makes his appearance in ordered and settled conditions, and has a resemblance to Christ.<a name=146:8></a> "It had two horns like to a lamb"; "and it works great signs"; it appears to have convincing credentials; and all its influence is to bring men to worship the first beast and its image, and to carry a mark indicative of their allegiance to him.<a name=146:9></a> This is a religious head, establishing its influence by signs, so that men may become worshippers of the first beast, and carry his moral impress.<a name=146:10></a> He causes "even fire to come down from heaven to the earth before men", and he causes an image of the beast to be made, and gives breath to it, and sets it up to be worshipped, and causes "that as many as should not do homage to the image of the beast should be killed".<a name=146:11></a> This corresponds in measure with the image which Nebuchadnezzar made (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#3">Daniel  3</a>), but accompanied by supernatural signs which deceive those that dwell upon the earth.<a name=146:12></a> Indeed nothing could be more solemn than to see that the same words are used of the antichrist in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:9">2 Thessalonians  2:9</a> -- "power and signs and wonders" -- which are used in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:22">Acts  2:22</a> of the witness which God gave to the Lord Jesus.<a name=146:13></a>

		So that we see in this chapter a great political power of Satanic origin and character, and then a great religious power which acts in support of the political power, and which "spake as a dragon".<a name=147:2></a> Though it may pretend to be like Christ, its utterances are diabolical.<a name=147:3></a> These are powers which are soon to appear on the stage of the world's history.<a name=147:4></a> It is not impossible that both the beast and the antichrist may be alive on earth now, though not to be manifested until after the assembly has been translated.<a name=147:5></a>

		All this has a voice for us, because the principles which will be fully developed in these two beasts are working in the world today.<a name=147:6></a> Paul tells us that "the mystery of lawlessness already works" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:7">2 Thessalonians  2:7</a>); and John says, "According as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>).<a name=147:7></a> The principles which will be embodied in the first beast are abroad in the political world, and the spirit of antichrist is abroad in the religious world.<a name=147:8></a> We have to see that we do not fall under the contamination of these subtle influences of evil.<a name=147:9></a> One cannot but notice that the conditions of the industrial world, both on the side of employers and employed, tend to the formation and recognition of combinations which make it more and more difficult for those who remain

	<div class="paragraph">
		When these principles are fully developed no one will be "able to buy or sell save he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name".<a name=148:3></a> There will be no civil or religious liberty, no freedom of conscience; every one must carry on his "right hand" or upon his "forehead" the mark of the beast.<a name=148:4></a> He must be openly identified in his working ability or in his personal character with the beast.<a name=148:5></a> The dragon's purpose in this policy, which will be carried out by his two representatives on earth as far as possible, will be to blot out from the face of the earth every trace of testimony to God or to His Christ.<a name=148:6></a> He will not succeed, and he will only have "a short time".<a name=148:7></a>

		In chapter 21 "one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues" shews John "the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=179:1></a> In this chapter one of the same angels shews him "the sentence of the great harlot".<a name=179:2></a> The contrast between the two must arrest the attention of every reader.<a name=179:3></a> One is the true church -- holy, heavenly, luminous with divine glory.<a name=179:4></a> The other is "great" but unfaithful and corrupt.<a name=179:5></a> She "sits upon the many waters", and as these were explained by the angel their meaning is not uncertain.<a name=179:6></a> "And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues" (verse 15).<a name=179:7></a> This shews the wide extent of her influence.<a name=179:8></a> But she not only influences peoples but kings.<a name=179:9></a> "With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication".<a name=179:10></a> She has had baits to offer to kings and courts which have made it worth their while to court her favour that they might secure them.<a name=179:11></a> In this way she has enhanced her own wealth and glory by ministering what was attractive to others, much as Tyre -- which is also called a "harlot" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#23">Isaiah  23</a>) -- did with her commerce (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#27">Ezekiel  27</a>).<a name=179:12></a> But all such influence in the world must be at the cost of fidelity to Christ.<a name=179:13></a> It can only be achieved by being untrue to the church's place as the suffering witness to a rejected Christ.<a name=179:14></a> She is a "great harlot".<a name=179:15></a>
