		Between the British and Spanish territories at Gibraltar there is a quarter of a mile of land which belongs to neither, and is called 'neutral ground'.<a name=1:1></a> It is to be feared that many people think there is a wide piece of 'neutral ground' between those who are saved and those who are lost.<a name=1:2></a> They dare not say that they are saved, and they will not admit that they are lost.<a name=1:3></a> So the devil -- old arch-deceiver that he is -- cheats them alike out of the blessings of the believer and the opportunities of the sinner.<a name=1:4></a>

		You may be able to say that you are as good as, or better than, most of your neighbours; and it is perhaps your opinion that if <i>you</i> do not get to heaven many others will stand a poor chance.<a name=1:7></a> That may be true, but there is an awful possibility that you may find yourself shut out along with them.<a name=1:8></a> Suppose that a recruiting sergeant came to your town to enlist soldiers for the Life Guards.<a name=1:9></a> Twenty young men apply to be enlisted, and while they are waiting for the sergeant to bring his measuring standard, they begin to measure themselves by one another.<a name=1:10></a> One finds he is half-an-inch taller than another.<a name=1:11></a> 'I have a better chance than you', he says.<a name=1:12></a> He measures himself with another, and finds that he is an inch taller.<a name=1:13></a> 'Well', says he, 'if I don't pass, you will

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you refuse to accept this four-fold description as being true of yourself, you thereby shut yourself out from the saving value of Christ's death.<a name=4:4></a> It was for those who could by no means save, or help to save, themselves that Christ died; it was for ungodly sinners, yea, for those who were enemies to God in their mind, that He gave His life; and if you are not such a one you have neither part nor lot in the blessings which flow from His death.<a name=4:5></a> A lifeboat is for the drowning, a physician is for the sick, and a SAVIOUR IS FOR LOST SINNERS.<a name=4:6></a>

		I now address myself to those in whose hearts the above momentous inquiry has arisen.<a name=6:1></a> One part of your need, at least, you are already conscious of, namely, THE NEED OF PARDON FOR YOUR SINS.<a name=6:2></a> I should be glad to think that some who will read this book are as anxious to have the knowledge of forgiveness as an elderly lady to whom I once put the question, Are your sins forgiven?<a name=6:3></a> I shall never forget the wistful look that came into her eyes, and the earnest trembling tones of her voice, as she said, Sir, I would give all that I possess to know that.<a name=6:4></a> I found that she had long known her need of pardon, and that she prayed, and read her Bible, and went to church, and was hoping that it might be well at last.<a name=6:5></a> She knew not the grace of God nor the value of the precious blood of His Son.<a name=6:6></a> Many are in a similar state, and it is to such I now speak.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me assure you, at the outset, that pardon for sins cannot be bought with money, or earned by good works, or won by tears and prayers.<a name=6:8></a> If you spent all your life in reading the Bible and in prayers; if you wept out the contrition of your heart in an ocean of penitential tears; yea, if you gave all your goods to the poor, and your body to be burned; none of these things would secure the pardon of your sins.<a name=6:9></a> Nay, I will go further, and say that <i>if you could</i> by some means acquire to yourself the combined merits of all the saints of God who ever lived on earth, there is not value enough in all their holy living and dying to absolve one of your sins.<a name=6:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place let me recall the fact -- so clearly and fully presented in Scripture -- that there is but ONE efficacious sacrifice for sins.<a name=18:3></a> The Spirit of God draws a pointed contrast between the oft-repeated "sacrifices which can never take away sins", and the "one sacrifice for sins" offered by Christ; and He asserts plainly that by God's will "we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ ONCE", and that "by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:10">Hebrews  10:10</a> - 14.<a name=18:4></a> The Son of God has by Himself purged our sins, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>.<a name=18:5></a> The work was accomplished centuries before the sins were committed, and in due time, when we believed the gospel, its efficacy was made known to us that we might have purged consciences, and be assured that God will not impute sin to us.<a name=18:6></a> Any repetition of the sacrifice is impossible, nor is it ever suggested in Scripture that there can be a RE-application of its cleansing virtue to our souls.<a name=18:7></a> On the contrary the believer is 'sanctified' -- he is set apart for God in the unchanging value of the offering of Christ and is 'perfected for ever'.<a name=18:8></a> He is continually before God in the efficacy of an eternal redemption.<a name=18:9></a> ALL his sins, whether committed before conversion or after, were borne by Jesus.<a name=18:10></a> If so much as one of them had not been taken into account at Calvary he must perish, for there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.<a name=18:11></a>

		I do not wish to lessen in any Christian's mind the sense of the evil of sin.<a name=18:12></a> That which cost Christ such untold agonies to put away, cannot be lightly thought of.<a name=18:13></a> But it is deeply important for every believer to know that if he does sin his standing in Christ <i>remains</i>

		What, then, is the consequence of a sin committed by a believer?<a name=19:2></a> His heart condemns him; his communion as a child with God is interrupted; and, consequently, he loses his spiritual joy; but he is still a child, though a <i>naughty child</i>.<a name=19:3></a> What he needs is to have his communion and joy restored, and for this there is a provision made, as we read in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:1">1 John  2:1</a>, 2, "And if any man sin, WE HAVE AN ADVOCATE with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins".<a name=19:4></a> The One who has made full atonement for our sins on the cross is now our Advocate with the Father.<a name=19:5></a> The believer's sin requires, and calls into exercise, this gracious activity of divine love.<a name=19:6></a> Nor does our blessed Advocate delay His service until we repent and judge ourselves; His advocacy is rather the secret producing cause of every movement in our souls towards restoration.<a name=19:7></a> Consequent upon His advocacy <i>up there</i>, the Holy Spirit <i>down here</i> makes us feel the sorrow and shame of the sins we have committed, and we 'judge ourselves'.<a name=19:8></a> Then "if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:9">1 John  1:9</a>.<a name=19:9></a> It is not a question of putting sin away before God -- that was settled at the cross; but a Father forgiving a child, and communion being restored.<a name=19:10></a>
