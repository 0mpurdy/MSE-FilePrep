		The Readings took place during a period of great pressure, in keeping with the times during which the prophets themselves served, and it is felt that they contain much of lasting spiritual value to believers.<a name=1:3></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The name Hosea, meaning Deliverance, seems to suggest that, sad as the state of the people was to whom he prophesied, the leading object of his service was to show how Jehovah would bring deliverance from that state.<a name=1:4></a> In the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, and Hezekiah there was a certain outward form of piety, but the prophets exposed the inward state of the people generally, and it was marked by great unfaithfulness to the divinely established relationship between Jehovah and His people.<a name=1:5></a> "The land is entirely given up to whoredom, away from Jehovah", verse 2.<a name=1:6></a> This state was to be set forth in the prophet's own associations, and his children represented in a symbolical way the results of unfaithfulness.<a name=1:7></a> Jizreel means <i>Jehovah will sow</i>, and the chapter suggests that this sowing on Jehovah's part takes a two-fold character.<a name=1:8></a> In the first place it is retributive; unfaithfulness will inevitably result in a sowing and reaping of judgment, as we see in verses 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.<a name=1:9></a> But when this is felt and bowed to, God's sowing takes another character, and He brings in what is of Himself in mercy.<a name=1:10></a> This is seen in verses 7, 10, 11.<a name=1:11></a> The day of Jizreel in this aspect is clearly one of sovereign mercy.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 6 and 7 Jehovah says that He will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, but that He will have mercy on the house of Judah.<a name=1:13></a> This was manifested in His preserving a remnant of Judah through the captivity, and bringing them back to the land so that Christ might be presented to them.<a name=1:14></a> Indeed verse 7 was fulfilled in the principle of it when Christ was here, though on the part of the people they did not perceive or accept it.<a name=1:15></a> The rejection of Christ by the Jews has resulted in wrath coming upon them to the uttermost as a nation, but a remnant was secured of whom Peter could say that they were once not a people, but were now the people of God, who were not enjoying mercy, but now had found mercy, <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:10">1 Peter  2:10</a>.<a name=1:16></a> The two aspects of Jizreel have thus been seen, and they will be seen further in God's future dealings with Israel, for on the one hand they will receive double for all their sins, but on the other hand both Judah and Israel will be blessed according to verse 11 in the sovereignty of mercy.<a name=1:17></a>

		In Israel there was such unfaithfulness that Jehovah had to completely disown them.<a name=2:13></a> Such a state will soon be found in the Christian profession that it will be spued out of Christ's mouth as nauseous to Him.<a name=2:14></a> But there is still a remnant marked by faithfulness in the affections, those who keep Christ's word and do not deny His name.<a name=2:15></a> That there should be such a remnant is the fruit of sovereign love that has wrought from the divine side for the satisfaction of divine Persons.<a name=2:16></a> After all Israel's unfaithfulness, and their being disowned by Jehovah, He will yet bring about that "it shall be said unto them, Sons of the living God", verse 11.<a name=2:17></a> They will be secured in family relation, with a nature capable of response to God in holy affections.<a name=2:18></a> There will not then be any breakdown in the marriage relation.<a name=2:19></a> At the present time there are those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.<a name=2:20></a> The privilege is open to us of being found amongst them.<a name=2:21></a> We may be very conscious of weakness in ourselves, but weakness need not be unfaithfulness.<a name=2:22></a> Conscious weakness casts us all the more upon divine faithfulness, upon the love of Christ and of God.<a name=2:23></a> As kept in a sense of divine love we shall not be unfaithful in our affections.<a name=2:24></a> The way of deliverance is to know our own nothingness as being kept near to divine love.<a name=2:25></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah had said in chapter 1 that He would no more have mercy on the house of Israel, and He refused to acknowledge them as His people.<a name=3:1></a> But He looked on to a future day when they would be addressed as "Sons of the living God".<a name=3:2></a> In verse 1 of the chapter now before us we find that, notwithstanding Jehovah's rejection of the nation, there were those who could be owned as His people, and who had obtained mercy.<a name=3:3></a> This shows that even when the general state is so bad that God cannot own it, He is pleased to have a remnant which He can own.<a name=3:4></a> It is so today.<a name=3:5></a> Not that those of the remnant are better in themselves than others, but through God's mercy they have had experience of His restoring ways as they are outlined in this chapter.<a name=3:6></a> We have all had to learn to judge the unfaithfulness and idolatry to which we are naturally prone.<a name=3:7></a> I suppose that, at some time or other, we have all known what it was to have our way hedged up (verse 6) so that we were unable to pursue the course which we had proposed to ourselves.<a name=3:8></a> God did not allow us to succeed in our self-chosen path.<a name=3:9></a> This particularly applies to those who have turned away from what they once knew of God.<a name=3:10></a> If there is in any heart a remembrance of former happiness which has now been lost, it is a powerful appeal to return.<a name=3:11></a> "I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it better with me than now", verse 7.<a name=3:12></a> Paul says to the Galatians, "What then was your blessedness?<a name=3:13></a>" reminding them of a joy which they once had.<a name=3:14></a> It is sometimes well to ask, Have I ever been happier in my relations with God than I am now?<a name=3:15></a> If so, it is because I have gone away from Him; I had better return at once.<a name=3:16></a> All that constitutes true happiness for the intelligent creature is to be found in God Himself.<a name=3:17></a> But the result of sin having come in is that the natural heart prefers anything to God.<a name=3:18></a> Any foolish propensity, or momentary gratification, any form of self-confidence or self-righteousness, or self-pleasing in a religious way, may be a Baal to seduce us from faithfulness to the only true God and Jesus Christ His sent One.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God has alluring ways even with an unfaithful people.<a name=3:20></a> "Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart", verse 14.<a name=3:21></a> His governmental ways and correction are seen in verses 6 - 13.<a name=3:22></a> He has to make His people feel the seriousness of departure from Him -- the poverty and disappointment it entails.<a name=3:23></a> But He does not fail to allure,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and to speak to the heart.<a name=4:1></a> He is still a faithful Lover, bent upon making Himself attractive to the poor heart that has forgotten Him, but whose responsive affection He is set upon having.<a name=4:2></a> Being brought into the wilderness here is the result of being allured; it suggests that she is brought in a tender and appealing way.<a name=4:3></a> Her heart is so affected that she is prepared for a position where she will have nothing but Himself, and where she will hear no voice but His.<a name=4:4></a> It corresponds with <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:2">Jeremiah  2:2</a>, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown".<a name=4:5></a> The divine allurements are very wonderful; God proposes to be known, not merely as the merciful Benefactor of His people, but as coveting their affection in a most intimate and personal way, so that His love may be more attractive and satisfying than the whole realm of created things.<a name=4:6></a> The wilderness here is in contrast with the corn and new wine and oil which she had employed for Baal.<a name=4:7></a> Under the divine alluring she comes apart from all that to be satisfied with Jehovah alone, and the communications of His love.<a name=4:8></a> Every heart that takes up this position will find fulness of joy.<a name=4:9></a> "And I will give her her vineyards from thence".<a name=4:10></a> If, in response to the divine alluring, we are content to have our portion in the love of God, He will give us all that is in the purpose of that love.<a name=4:11></a> "Thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown".<a name=4:12></a> That was what He appreciated; there was nothing else to attract them, and He was sufficient.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the valley of Achor is given "for a door of hope"; verse 15.<a name=4:14></a> That was where the first movement of departure in the land was fully judged (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#7:24">Joshua  7:24</a>), and this is always necessary.<a name=4:15></a> True affectionate response to God will always be accompanied by thorough judgment of that in our own hearts which led us away from Him.<a name=4:16></a> This is a true <i>door of hope</i>; it opens up to us all that love is so ready to give; and the result is that "she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt".<a name=4:17></a> The singing here is an answer or response (see margin of New Translation) to the known love of God.<a name=4:18></a> Then Jehovah is claimed in an affectionate way as "My husband" (verse 16), the rival Baals have lost their power, and are remembered no more.<a name=4:19></a> He undertakes to defend His people from all their enemies, and He betroths them to Himself for ever; verses 18 - 20.<a name=4:20></a> It is now a blessed known reality that Jehovah has become Man, not only to save sinners, but that He might be known in an affectionate relation of which a husband

		is the scriptural type.<a name=5:1></a> He had betrothal in view from the outset with each of us; that is, that we should be altogether for Him on the ground that He had been altogether for us.<a name=5:2></a> He is entitled to us, for He died for us when we were in a state of death.<a name=5:3></a> The love of Christ is known as claiming us to live to Him, and this claim love recognises and yields to.<a name=5:4></a> It is, indeed, a matter of righteousness as well as love that we should live to Him and not to ourselves, for we are not our own; we have been bought with a price.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness, judgment, loving-kindness, mercies, faithfulness, in verses 19, 20, are precious qualities or characteristics of Jehovah, but in this connection they suggest that those betrothed to Him will have features which correspond with Him whom they now claim as Husband.<a name=5:6></a> They are moral features which stand in contrast with what is here, and betrothal could hardly be thought of apart from suitability.<a name=5:7></a> We are going to be like Christ eternally, but the effect of knowing this is that we purify ourselves even as He is pure.<a name=5:8></a> There is a remarkable link of communication between the top and the bottom in verses 21, 22.<a name=5:9></a> Jizreel is looked at as being down here on earth, but she is linked by a wonderful chain with Jehovah on high.<a name=5:10></a> There is no discord or want of harmony between the bottom and the top.<a name=5:11></a> It is wonderful to think of there being something down here which is in harmony with heaven, and with the divine Persons who are there.<a name=5:12></a> The saints are fitted, through infinite grace, to be with Christ up there, but they also become, by the work of God, morally suitable to Him down here.<a name=5:13></a> They would hardly have the true character of betrothed ones otherwise.<a name=5:14></a> Prophecy will not be needed in heaven, but it is necessary down here that conditions may be brought about in the saints morally and spiritually that correspond with what is above.<a name=5:15></a>

		It is thus that a testimony is secured down here.<a name=5:16></a> "And I will sow her unto me in the land", verse 23.<a name=5:17></a> In a future day Israel will appear on earth as the fruit of God's sowing, and will show forth His praise.<a name=5:18></a> But Peter, having this very scripture in mind, gives it present application to the sojourners of the dispersion when he says, "But <i>ye</i> are a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a people for possession, that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light; who once were not a people, but now God's people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:9">1 Peter  2:9</a>, 10.<a name=5:19></a> There is thus a present Jizreel, a

		present result of God's sowing, but it is found in those who have come into affectionate relation with Christ, "whom having not seen ye love, on whom though now not looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:8">1 Peter  1:8</a>.<a name=6:1></a> Such do really, in the spirit of it, call Him "my husband"; they are, indeed, betrothed to Him.<a name=6:2></a> Saints of the assembly ought not, surely, to be less active in their affections than Israel will be in a coming day.<a name=6:3></a>

		CHAPTER 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet was told to love "an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes".<a name=6:4></a> That God should love a people in spite of the greatest unfaithfulness on their part is truly marvellous, and the thought of it bows the heart in wonder and worship.<a name=6:5></a> It is very necessary that we should know this character of divine love; a love which has its source and fountain in the very heart of God because of what He is, and which cannot be quenched or stayed by any unworthiness on the part of the creature.<a name=6:6></a> Jehovah's controversy with the children of Israel in Hosea's day was that there was no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land, chapter 4: 1.<a name=6:7></a> They did not know that Jehovah loved them in spite of their unfaithfulness; if they had known this it would have broken their hearts in repentance and turned them to Him.<a name=6:8></a> All the service of the prophets whom Jehovah sent carried with it the testimony that He still loved them, and desired their love, and when He came as Immanuel into their midst it was that this might be known in the most unmistakable way.<a name=6:9></a> "How often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!<a name=6:10></a>" By the last of the Old Testament prophets Jehovah said, "I have loved you" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#1:2">Malachi  1:2</a>); and to the last phase of unfaithfulness in the assemblies the Lord says, "I rebuke and discipline as many as I love; be zealous therefore and repent".<a name=6:11></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:19">Revelation  3:19</a>.<a name=6:12></a> What touching appeals on the part of divine Persons!<a name=6:13></a> In spite of all departure and unfaithfulness, though the loved one is an adulteress, the love remains.<a name=6:14></a>

		Love has established its title to the unfaithful one by purchase (verse 2), and this title holds good even if the claim is not answered to.<a name=6:15></a> Jehovah has not given up His claim on Israel, or His title to

		possess her, though He has had to wait long for the claim to be acknowledged on her part.<a name=7:1></a> The last prophecy in Israel was that Jesus was going to die for the nation that it might not perish; <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:50">John  11:50</a> - 52.<a name=7:2></a> He has established His title in love, and "at the end of the days" (verse 5) "shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness".<a name=7:3></a> They will recognise the blessed goodness that has been expressed in Jesus.<a name=7:4></a> The two thousand years that have elapsed have not changed Him, and when they turn to Him "at the end of the days" they will find that the love in which He died for them remains undiminished.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All in the Christian profession have been "bought with a price"; we are not our own; but it is a price which love has paid.<a name=7:6></a> Christ "died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:15">2 Corinthians  5:15</a>.<a name=7:7></a> He is entitled to say to us, "Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be another man's, and I will also be for thee", verse 3.<a name=7:8></a> But as it was with Israel so has it been in Christianity; there have been "many days" during which the claim of divine love has been disregarded, with the result that God's people have been deprived of all that is suitable to their ordering before Him, and they have not had even the miserable comfort which deceived hearts might have found in pure idolatry.<a name=7:9></a> Without divine love being known and responded to there is really nothing.<a name=7:10></a> No "teraphim" can be a substitute for God, and all who turn away from the love of God will find that they have nothing which they can put in its place.<a name=7:11></a> I think this is the meaning of being without "teraphim", verse 4.<a name=7:12></a> All idols are really "nonentities" (see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#2:8">Isaiah  2:8</a>, margin), and will be proved to be so in the end.<a name=7:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But the husband love of Jehovah for Israel has in view their return to Him "at the end of the days", and I believe the love of Christ has cherished this thought in regard of the assembly.<a name=7:14></a> All believers have some idea that the assembly will be the bride, the Lamb's wife, in a future day, and that in the glorified conditions she will know His love, and respond to it in a way that will satisfy His heart.<a name=7:15></a> But all believers have not understood that God is giving a special ministry of Christ and the assembly now so that saints may turn in their affections to the precious reality of what Christ is for the assembly, and what the assembly is for Christ.<a name=7:16></a> No one can be in the current of the present working of

		When God has a controversy with His people, which He surely has at the present time, it will always be found to turn on the knowledge of Himself.<a name=8:2></a> His people were destroyed in Hosea's time "for lack of knowledge", or, more literally, "<i>the</i> knowledge"; that is, the specific knowledge referred to in verse 1.<a name=8:3></a> So how the knowledge of God is acquired becomes the most important matter for our consideration.<a name=8:4></a> It is evident that we cannot get it by pursuing idolatry; it was said, "their doings do not allow them to return unto their God", verse 4.<a name=8:5></a> We can understand this, but it is said also, "They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them", verse 6.<a name=8:6></a> He is not to be found on that line.<a name=8:7></a> People would often be prepared to make great sacrifices if they could thereby obtain the favour of God.<a name=8:8></a> But this prophet, and, indeed, the whole of Scripture, make plain that He can only be found through affliction, and through learning that there is no help anywhere else.<a name=8:9></a> The deepest affliction anyone can pass through is to be convicted of sin, and to learn that death is upon one.<a name=8:10></a> It is by the cutting off of all hope from any other quarter that men are brought to turn to God.<a name=8:11></a> But none of us accepts this very readily; we look in every other direction first.<a name=8:12></a> "When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore", verse 13.<a name=8:13></a> Assyria was at that time the dominant human power, and I believe he represents what is dominant at the present time.<a name=8:14></a> The great characteristic of the present day is confidence in the human mind.<a name=8:15></a> The religious element is still strong in Christendom, but the rationalistic or modernist element is stronger.<a name=8:16></a> The mass of people who think at all are modernists; they do not attach supreme authority to the Holy Scriptures, or look to them for the final settlement of every question.<a name=8:17></a> They prefer human thoughts.<a name=8:18></a> King Jareb, (meaning, <i>He will contend</i>), represents the contention of the human mind against the truth.<a name=8:19></a> The man of sin will be the great modernist; he will oppose and exalt himself against all called God or worshipped; man is to be supreme.<a name=8:20></a>

		All this had its part in, "I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of love", chapter 11: 4.<a name=12:2></a> God was pleased to have a man who was nearer to Him than any prophet (see <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:6">Numbers  12:6</a> - 8), that His people might be drawn into the thoughts of His love as known by and expressed in that man.<a name=12:3></a> Of course, it was Christ who was set forth, for it is by Him that God draws in love.<a name=12:4></a> The greatest wonder of all is that Jehovah has become Man that He might be near to men in His love, telling out what is in His own heart, not only by doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, but by taking upon His own spirit the full weight of everything that pressed upon man by reason of sin, finally becoming a sacrifice for sin, and bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, and tasting death for us so that the reality and depth of the love of God to men might be manifested and known.<a name=12:5></a> God in this way is drawing men "with bands of a man, with cords of love".<a name=12:6></a> It is His pleasure to be known by men as acting for them in this wondrous way of love.<a name=12:7></a> The One who died upon the cross is now the living Mediator of the love of God to men, and He is ever serving in love as interceding on high.<a name=12:8></a> In Him as the glorified One are perfectly set forth the place and acceptance in which the love of God would have men to be before His face.<a name=12:9></a> Man is in heaven in the most blessed acceptance with God, and the great proposal of the glad tidings is that through the love of God men may have Christ as their righteousness, and be accepted in Him the Beloved.<a name=12:10></a> By the bands of that blessed glorified Man God is drawing men into the knowledge of Himself as revealed in love.<a name=12:11></a> All the past and present unfaithfulness of the church has not altered the love of God.<a name=12:12></a> Men have turned away from it, but the drawing continues.<a name=12:13></a> "And I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:32">John  12:32</a>.<a name=12:14></a> Christ is not repelling but attracting, and the fact that He speaks of "bands" and "cords" shows that He intends to bind men firmly to Him as the One in whom the love of God is expressed.<a name=12:15></a> That love cannot be found anywhere else, but its fulness can be found there: "the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=12:16></a> It is there for an unfaithful people as well as for a perishing world.<a name=12:17></a> If we respond to the drawing, the love that draws undertakes everything for us.<a name=12:18></a> God knows everything that there is on our side, and on the side of an unfaithful church, but He says, 'I am drawing you by the Man in whom I have revealed My love so that you may find out

	<div class="paragraph">
		The references to Jacob in this chapter are remarkable, and brought in apparently without much connection with what the prophet is speaking of.<a name=14:6></a> He suddenly leaves all the present failure to dwell upon the energy which had characterised their great forefather.<a name=14:7></a> It had been said prophetically before the children were born that "the elder shall serve the younger" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#25:23">Genesis  25:23</a>), but it also came out that there was an energy in Jacob to make good what had been said of him.<a name=14:8></a> "He took his brother by the heel in the womb", verse 3.<a name=14:9></a> The very name Jacob means <i>heel-holder</i>, or <i>supplanter</i>.<a name=14:10></a> It intimates that, along with God's election, there is always found an inward energy to displace or dispossess that which according to nature came first.<a name=14:11></a> Esau represents what we are by nature as children of Adam, but Jacob represents what we are by God's grace and election.<a name=14:12></a> The work of God in souls is the consequence of His election, and He brings it in to dispossess that which actually preceded it in point of time, so that persons take a course which they never would have taken naturally.<a name=14:13></a> Israel in turning from Jehovah to idolatry had given up all thought of displacing the elder, the Esau man.<a name=14:14></a> This was the root of all the terrible departure and unfaithfulness; they had gone back to the man whom God hated.<a name=14:15></a> They no doubt boasted in having Jacob as their father, but they had not Jacob's energy to supplant the "elder".<a name=14:16></a> The distinction between the old man and the new could not really be known until the death of Christ had taken place, but we read the typical Scriptures in the light of what is now made known.<a name=14:17></a> There should have been energy in God's elect to supplant the man after the flesh, and with that man supplanted by the work of God there would have been no departure, no idolatry.<a name=14:18></a> It raises the question with each one of us

		Then we find that the energy by which Jacob took his brother by the heel developed into energy acting Godward.<a name=15:4></a> "In his strength he wrestled with God.<a name=15:5></a> Yea, he wrestled with the Angel, and prevailed", verses 3, 4.<a name=15:6></a> In the historical account (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32">Genesis  32</a>) we are told first that "a man wrestled with him", but Hosea does not dwell upon that; the point before the Spirit of God here was to bring out the energy that was in Jacob.<a name=15:7></a> It was true that he had first to be crippled as to his natural power before he could prevail with God, but he had spiritual strength to wrestle with God.<a name=15:8></a> We have read of Paul agonizing, for that is the word used in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:1">Colossians  2:1</a>, and he uses the same word of Epaphras, "who is one of you" in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:12">Colossians  4:12</a>.<a name=15:9></a> It conveys the thought of great energy Godward expended on behalf of His saints.<a name=15:10></a> A well-known servant of the Lord used to say sometimes to persons who came to him with questions, Have you ever spent a night in prayer about it?<a name=15:11></a> I think most of us have to deplore a lack of energy Godward, and yet this is how the knowledge of God comes in power into the soul.<a name=15:12></a> Tears, too, have their place in this.<a name=15:13></a> "He wept, and made supplication unto him"; verse 4.<a name=15:14></a> How humbling to idolatrous Israel to be reminded of the energy with which their great ancestor had sought the knowledge of Jehovah, and yet they had given Him up for every worthless idol that presented itself to them!<a name=15:15></a> Perhaps it is hardly less humbling to some of us.<a name=15:16></a> In all this God was saying to Israel, and is now saying to us, that His elect come to light by the energy and purpose of heart with which they seek Him.<a name=15:17></a>

		"He found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us, even Jehovah, the God of hosts, -- Jehovah is his memorial"; verses 4, 5.<a name=15:18></a> Early in his history Jacob had been favoured with an impression of the house of God so that he could give it a name, but it was many years before he came to it in suitability.<a name=15:19></a> There were strange gods in his household which had to be put away, and other matters which had to be faced, before God could find him in Bethel in a condition suited to the place.<a name=15:20></a> But eventually he was found there, and if Jacob could be found there why should not all Israel be found there?<a name=15:21></a> All this is like Jehovah saying to His poor idolatrous people, 'I want you to go over Jacob's history yourselves, and come to what he came to'.<a name=15:22></a> Why should

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was "Jehovah, the God of hosts" who spoke in His house, God known in relation to "hosts" blessed by Him.<a name=16:11></a> The speaking in the house today takes character from the fact that God has been declared, the Father's name made known, by His beloved Son.<a name=16:12></a> If He is made known as Father it implies that He would have men to know Him as acting in supreme favour, and to be set in relationship with Him in that character.<a name=16:13></a> The <i>hosts</i> now are children and sons; they are for God's delight as "in Christ Jesus".<a name=16:14></a> The place and relationship in which they are set corresponds with the Name which has been made known to them, and all is of infinite grace and love.<a name=16:15></a> At Peniel Jacob had said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:26">Genesis  32:26</a>.<a name=16:16></a> And we are told that God "blessed him there", and said that his name should be called Israel, meaning <i>wrestler</i>, or <i>prince of God</i>.<a name=16:17></a> But at Bethel it was definitely said, "And he called his name Israel", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35:10">Genesis  35:10</a>.<a name=16:18></a> That is, he was there as having a distinguished name, and for us this means that we are there as sons.<a name=16:19></a> We must first take up the Jacob exercise of supplanting the fleshly and the natural, and then we shall have energy Godward to secure His blessing, and we shall get a princely name in the house of God, and God will talk with us on that footing, and make His name known to us.<a name=16:20></a> All this is viewed here as reached through Jacob's inward exercise and energy in seeking the knowledge of God.<a name=16:21></a> It is to stir up our hearts to greater earnestness with regard to God's blessing, and our place in His house as sons.<a name=16:22></a> It is not the gospel side of the truth that we receive sonship as God's gift, but

		The second reference to Jacob in this chapter brings out another side of the truth.<a name=17:2></a> "Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep".<a name=17:3></a> I have no doubt that, in saying this, the Spirit had in mind that Jehovah had been serving for a prolonged period to secure Israel in wifely relationship to Himself.<a name=17:4></a> The wifely place to which Israel was called has a very prominent place in this book.<a name=17:5></a> It had been written that "Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they were in his eyes as single days, because he loved her", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#29:20">Genesis  29:20</a>.<a name=17:6></a> It was a touching expression, in a typical way, of how Jehovah had loved Israel; He had served from the time of Moses onward to win Israel for Himself.<a name=17:7></a> His service had been carried on mediately through those by whom He had acted, as we read in the next verse, "And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:13">Hosea  12:13</a>.<a name=17:8></a> "Preserved" here is the same word as "kept" in verse 12.<a name=17:9></a> The whole of God's prophetic service in Israel, from Moses to Malachi in the Old Testament, and by John the baptist and Christ Himself in the New Testament, was to keep the people for Jehovah that they might be in true wifely relation to Him.<a name=17:10></a> All the God-sent prophets laboured for this, and yet the service of love was unrequited.<a name=17:11></a> Israel had turned out unfaithful and idolatrous, as this very prophet bears witness in his strong expostulations and pleadings.<a name=17:12></a> And the Lord Himself had to say, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for naught and in vain", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:4">Isaiah  49:4</a>.<a name=17:13></a> "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her, how often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:37">Matthew  23:37</a>.<a name=17:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Prophets such as Jonah that have to do with the Gentile world are interesting, showing that though God has ever special regard to His own people, He does not overlook men in general.<a name=25:1></a> The thoughts of God's heart come out wonderfully in this book, and the workings of man's heart are exposed, too, even in a true saint and servant of God.<a name=25:2></a> We see with Jonah how the thought of his own importance obscured everything.<a name=25:3></a> His own reason for not going to Nineveh was not that he was afraid of that city, but that he knew God!<a name=25:4></a> He tells us so in the fourth chapter: "And it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.<a name=25:5></a> And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Ah, Jehovah, was not this my saying when I was yet in my country?<a name=25:6></a> .<a name=25:7></a>.<a name=25:8></a>.<a name=25:9></a> for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil".<a name=25:10></a> He knew that he was bidden to cry against Nineveh a message of judgment.<a name=25:11></a> Supposing that he cried for forty days and that it worked out that God had mercy on them, what a fool it would make of Jonah!<a name=25:12></a> He would rather that all Nineveh perished than that anything should reduce his self-importance -- that is man!<a name=25:13></a> Though he knew Jehovah in a remarkable way, he was not at all in accord with Jehovah; God's goodness was most distasteful to him; it made him quite angry, and he was angry without making any apology.<a name=25:14></a>

		It has often been said that Jonah sets forth the state of the Jews, who could not bear that grace should go out to the publicans and sinners.<a name=25:15></a> We see this exemplified in the gospel of Luke in the case of the elder son (chapter 15) and in other instances.<a name=25:16></a> It was this which necessitated the casting out of the Jews, and their casting out has made room for us to come in, so that we have profited.<a name=25:17></a> The Jew should have been the exponent to the Gentile world of the goodness and grace of God.<a name=25:18></a> Jonah became a testimony to God's character by God's judgment coming on himself -- he had to acknowledge that he was under the judgment of God himself.<a name=25:19></a> Paul speaks of the Jews as "forbidding us to speak to the nations that they may be saved", and that "wrath has come upon them to the uttermost".<a name=25:20></a> That is the casting out of the Jew, which comes out in the first chapter: "And they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea".<a name=25:21></a> The Jews should have been a testimony to God Himself, but instead are a testimony of the judgment of God.<a name=25:22></a> It is a warning to Gentile nations; all that the Jews are suffering today is a warning to us.<a name=25:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When Jehovah leads the remnant of Israel out of evil associations and assembles them in relation to Himself, as we have seen in chapter 2, His intention will be to establish His house as the place of divine teaching, and to set up His kingdom over His people so that, in result, He may give them the kingdom and dominion.<a name=36:11></a> These are the great subjects which chapter 4 brings before us.<a name=36:12></a>

		The <i>elevation</i> of Jehovah's house is very strikingly presented in the opening verses of the chapter.<a name=36:13></a> We read of "the mountain", "the top of the mountains", "lifted up above the hills".<a name=36:14></a> "And many nations shall go and say, Come, and let us go up".<a name=36:15></a> Men will become sensible "in the end of days" that God's house is very elevated, but that it is attractive, and that it is worth while to go up to it.<a name=36:16></a> Indeed, it is said that "the peoples shall flow unto it", which seems to indicate a readiness to move under a law of attraction which draws upward.<a name=36:17></a> The natural law of gravitation is reversed, and this is what always happens when grace becomes operative in the souls of men.<a name=36:18></a> The tendency of everything here is downward, for it is a fallen world, but when God moves in "the peoples" they will desire to <i>flow</i> up to what

		It is evident that if this is so the thought of doing anything to improve one's status with God drops out altogether; see verses 6 and 7.<a name=48:4></a> Nothing that we could bring or do could add one jot or tittle to the clearing away of our sin, or to our acceptance with God.<a name=48:5></a> All that God requires of us is reduced to three simple elements; "to do justly, and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God", verse 8.<a name=48:6></a> The whole life of piety is summed up in these three things.<a name=48:7></a> Nothing but the action of our own will can ever deprive us of the peace and happiness which are found by those who, under the influence of grace, move on this line.<a name=48:8></a> Verses 4 and 5 show what grace has done for us.<a name=48:9></a> It has freed us from every kind of bondage or uncertainty as to the terms on which God is with us, so that in simplicity and liberty we may do what is right, and love goodness (<i>or mercy</i>) and walk humbly with our God.<a name=48:10></a> The practical power of grace is seen in our being delivered from evil so that we have nothing to do but to go on with what is good.<a name=48:11></a>

		CHAPTER 7 - THE EXERCISES AND DELIVERANCE OF THE REMNANT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What Jehovah had done for His people at the beginning of their history came before us in chapter 6, but they had turned away from Him, and came under His rod of chastisement.<a name=49:1></a> If a remnant was to be secured for Him after all the failure it must be through conscience work which rightly felt the state of departure, accompanied by faith of heart which counted on Him to come in for those who looked to Him.<a name=49:2></a> They had to come back to all that was made known typically at the beginning of their history.<a name=49:3></a> The very departure provided occasion for Jehovah to come in and show His people marvellous things.<a name=49:4></a> But the way must be prepared for this by much exercise on their part, and this is brought out in chapter 7.<a name=49:5></a> So that this chapter is peculiarly instructive for us who are at the end of the assembly period; a period marked by as great departure as was ever seen in Israel.<a name=49:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet is seen here as representative of the godly remnant, feeling keenly the terrible state of those amongst whom he served.<a name=49:7></a> This exercise marked all the prophets, and it finds expression in many of the Psalms.<a name=49:8></a> The sorrows and distresses of those who feared Jehovah were largely occasioned by the presence and conduct of those who were in the place of privilege as Jehovah's people, but whose hearts were far from Him.<a name=49:9></a> This exercise is always present with us.<a name=49:10></a> It was a deep grief to Paul to have to say of those who were in the Christian profession, "all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ".<a name=49:11></a> And, again, "Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ .<a name=49:12></a>.<a name=49:13></a>.<a name=49:14></a> who mind earthly things".<a name=49:15></a> We have only to read 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, and Jude to see what Scripture has said about the present state of things.<a name=49:16></a> The language is as severe as anything the Old Testament prophets said about Israel.<a name=49:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of all this is to isolate anyone who really fears God from the state of things which surrounds Him, and to shut him up to God.<a name=49:18></a> He comes to realise that nobody can be trusted.<a name=49:19></a> "The best of them is a briar; the most upright worse than a thorn-fence", verse 4.<a name=49:20></a> If you cannot put confidence in a familiar friend, or in your dearest relation (verse 5), where can your resource be?<a name=49:21></a> You must turn wholly to God.<a name=49:22></a> "But as for me, I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is something even more deadly than bad conduct.<a name=50:4></a> There is an enemy (verse 8) ready to rejoice over the sorrows and failures of the one who has been isolated by his distress at the prevalent evil, ready to rejoice even in what such a one suffers under God's chastening hand.<a name=50:5></a> The word <i>enemy</i> is feminine, and she is spoken of in verse 10 as <i>her</i> and <i>she</i>.<a name=50:6></a> It is well known that in Scripture a woman often represents a system of things, as, for example, Hagar and Sarah, or the harlot of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#17">Revelation  17</a>, or the Lamb's wife of chapter 21.<a name=50:7></a> Perhaps the female enemy of <a href="../bible/Micah.htm#7:8">Micah  7:8</a> refers prophetically to the apostate Jews who in the last days will seek to ingratiate themselves with Antichrist.<a name=50:8></a> They will go to the king with ointments (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#57:9">Isaiah  57:9</a>), but they will taunt and persecute those who fear Jehovah and cherish His promises.<a name=50:9></a> They will say, "Where is Jehovah thy God" (verse 10), just as the chief priests said of Christ upon the cross, "He trusted upon God; let him save him now if he will have him", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:43">Matthew  27:43</a>.<a name=50:10></a> There may be circumstances in which God does not seem to come in on behalf of His suffering saints, and the <i>enemy</i> will taunt them with it.<a name=50:11></a> The tried saints in Smyrna had to bear "the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:9">Revelation  2:9</a>.<a name=50:12></a> And this synagogue of Satan appears also in connection with the assembly in Philadelphia (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:9">Revelation  3:9</a>); it evidently represents traditional and ceremonial religion, an imitation of Judaism, but really of Satan.<a name=50:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while the prophet recognises the presence and tauntings of the enemy he goes on with his own exercises.<a name=50:14></a> He cannot meet the taunts of the enemy by setting up to be anything but one who has fallen (verse 8); if he has arisen after falling it is surely by mercy alone!<a name=50:15></a> And he says further, "When I sit in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light unto me".<a name=50:16></a> He is like the one spoken of in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:10">Isaiah  50:10</a>, but he confides in the name of Jehovah, and stays himself upon his God.<a name=50:17></a> He is not out of the darkness yet, but he knows he will be.<a name=50:18></a> He has not yet seen the great light of Jehovah having become Man, and accomplishing redemption, but he is assured that Jehovah will be light for him.<a name=50:19></a> He is cast down, but hoping in God.<a name=50:20></a> This is far better than walking in the light of sparks of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glad tidings of the grace of God gives us to know that God has pleaded our cause, and executed judgment for us.<a name=51:9></a> He has brought us to the light that we might behold His righteousness.<a name=51:10></a> That righteousness was borne witness to by the law and the prophets; this very scripture bears witness to it.<a name=51:11></a> But it was something to be looked forward to then, and it will be something for the remnant of Israel to look forward to until Jehovah brings them forth to the light of Christ and the new covenant, but that righteousness is now revealed and manifested.<a name=51:12></a> Redemption has been accomplished, and the mercy-seat set forth in all the value of the blood of Christ.<a name=51:13></a> We are brought to the full light of God's righteousness as being upon us, and this by infinite grace.<a name=51:14></a> This really qualifies us to receive the Spirit, and to take our place in God's assembly.<a name=51:15></a>

		This is suggested in verse 11, where we read of "the day when thy walls shall be built".<a name=51:16></a> This is clearly collective, for walls have reference to a city.<a name=51:17></a> This gives great enlargement.<a name=51:18></a> Down to this point the exercise has been an individual one until the soul is brought to behold God's righteousness.<a name=51:19></a> But now those delivered are to be put together in a city, and "the established limit" recedes.<a name=51:20></a> If the <i>limit</i> recedes there is clearly more room; there is enlargement, and a centre to which those scattered can come.<a name=51:21></a> I think it means that all who have had similar exercises to the prophet can now draw together in separation from what is evil, and in the comfort of God's light and righteousness.<a name=51:22></a> God's <i>city</i> thought is secured thus, even though <i>the land</i>, speaking of the general state of His people, is "desolate because of them that

		Jehovah's "rod" is not here (verse 14) the rod of correction, but the shepherd rod for the feeding of His people, "the flock of thine inheritance".<a name=52:4></a> How surely He may be trusted to feed those who are brought together by moving on the lines of the exercises seen in this chapter!<a name=52:5></a> Though the flock is not seen in Jerusalem, but as "dwelling alone in the forest".<a name=52:6></a> They are still in the outside position publicly, but grace makes it a Carmel, a fruitful field.<a name=52:7></a>

		Then Jehovah declares what He will do for them.<a name=52:8></a> "As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt, will I show them marvellous things", verse 15.<a name=52:9></a> He begins, as it were, afresh with them on the ground of His original thoughts.<a name=52:10></a> He does not go into what He will show them, but He describes the effect which it will have upon the nations when they see it; verses 16,17.<a name=52:11></a> Millennial circumstances are not brought in here, but something which is morally greater.<a name=52:12></a> The remnant celebrates God as known in forgiveness.<a name=52:13></a> Verses 18 and 19 enlarge upon this.<a name=52:14></a> He does not speak here of the house or the kingdom, but of their delight in God Himself as known according to the new covenant.<a name=52:15></a> They are brought to Him morally as knowing His forgiveness.<a name=52:16></a> This gives perfect liberty to approach Him, and it is powerful leverage in the heart to do so, for the one who has been forgiven much loves much.<a name=52:17></a> Those who are not free to approach do not really know the forgiveness that is in the heart of God for them.<a name=52:18></a> It would appeal to us very powerfully if we understood that forgiveness is in the heart of God because He wants us to be near Him without a shade of reserve, and in perfect liberty.<a name=52:19></a> It is because He loves that He forgives, and He does it righteously because "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:18">1 Peter  3:18</a>.<a name=52:20></a>

		Nahum probably prophesied at the time when Sennacherib took the cities of Judah and threatened Jerusalem itself.<a name=54:1></a> The immediate object of his prophecy was to comfort the distressed remnant, and to encourage their confidence in Jehovah.<a name=54:2></a>

		I believe Nineveh is the only city in the Old Testament which is called "the great city".<a name=54:4></a> It was, apparently, built by Nimrod (<i>Rebel</i>) -- see <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#10:10">Genesis  10:10</a>, 11 and note -- so that it appears to represent the developed greatness of the world on the line of rebellion against God.<a name=54:5></a> It had been warned through Jonah, and had for a time repented, so that the announced overthrow was suspended.<a name=54:6></a> This only aggravated the guilt of Sennacherib in coming violently against the people and city of the God who had so graciously spared Nineveh.<a name=54:7></a>

		But at that time Jehovah's people had become "a hypocritical nation" of whom He could speak as "the people of my wrath" (see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#10:5">Isaiah  10:5</a>, 6), and the Assyrian was the rod of His anger upon them.<a name=54:8></a> But, though this was the general state of things, by His grace there was still a remnant.<a name=54:9></a> Hezekiah called upon Isaiah to "lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#37:4">Isaiah  37:4</a>.<a name=54:10></a> There was a "virgin daughter" who could not be conquered by the Assyrian.<a name=54:11></a> God may use the violence of men as the rod of His anger upon hypocrisy and wickedness when such things are found in those who profess to know Him, but He never forgets His remnant.<a name=54:12></a> The faithful remnant was under His protecting hand all the time, and the prophecy of Nahum was given to sustain their confidence in Him.<a name=54:13></a>

		God's people may have to suffer, either from persecution or from disturbed conditions in the world, but He would have them always to recognise that "his way is in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet", verse 3.<a name=55:10></a> No one can doubt that at the present time the mountains are quaking and the earth is upheaved, and the world and all that dwell therein; verse 5.<a name=55:11></a> And God's people have to suffer along with all others; the languishing of Bashan and Carmel and of the flower of Lebanon (verse 4) would indicate this.<a name=55:12></a> But Jehovah has His way amidst all that is happening, and the "dust of his feet" indicates that there is movement on His part, though "clouds" show that His steps are not discernible by men.<a name=55:13></a> But faith has the comfort of knowing that it is so.<a name=55:14></a>

		As to Nineveh and its proud oppressor Jehovah would "make a full end of the place thereof", whatever they might have imagined against Him.<a name=55:15></a> Verse 11 shows that evil counsel is present as well as the pride of power; Satan's craftiness has its place in all the movements that are adverse to the people of God.<a name=55:16></a> But they do not baffle Jehovah.<a name=55:17></a> Indeed, He makes use of them for the chastening of His people until the time comes when He says, "And though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no

		"And now I will break his yoke from off thee, and will burst the bonds asunder", verse 13.<a name=56:7></a> There would seem to be an interesting connection between this verse and <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#10:27">Isaiah  10:27</a>: "And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck; and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing".<a name=56:8></a> The yoke being destroyed "because of the anointing" seems to suggest a moral deliverance by spiritual power even before the actual deliverance.<a name=56:9></a> Jehovah put the spirit of victory into the virgin daughter of Zion before He Smote the Assyrian; see <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#37:21">Isaiah  37:21</a> - 38.<a name=56:10></a> Whatever pressure may be upon us God would not have us to be held in bondage by it; He would have us to be freed in spirit from the yoke in virtue of the power of "the anointing".<a name=56:11></a>

		In the vision of Nahum it is seen that the people of God have been afflicted, and that He knows those who trust in Him, but their personal exercises do not appear.<a name=57:1></a> "The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see" stands in contrast with this, for it throws into strong relief the exercises of a faithful heart in a time of sore trial, and shows what that heart reaches for its own joy before there is any outward deliverance.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Habakkuk prophesied many years later than Nahum, and in his time things had reached the point when "there was no remedy" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#36:16">2 Chronicles  36:16</a>); the people were about to fall by Jehovah's judgment under the power of a terrible enemy.<a name=57:3></a> The whole state of things was most testing, and particularly because the cry of a distressed heart seemed to be unheeded.<a name=57:4></a> "Jehovah, how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear?<a name=57:5></a>.<a name=57:6></a> I cry out unto thee, Violence!<a name=57:7></a> and thou dost not save.<a name=57:8></a> Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity, and lookest thou upon grievance?<a name=57:9></a> For spoiling and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.<a name=57:10></a> Therefore the law is powerless, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked encompasseth the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted", verses 2 - 4.<a name=57:11></a> Everyone must feel that this is not altogether inapplicable at the present time, and it brings suffering upon the people of God as well as upon others.<a name=57:12></a> Faith could hardly be more severely tested than by seeing the people of God suffer oppression without any apparent intervention of God on their behalf.<a name=57:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the answer to this deep exercise was that the prophet was called to "Behold, and wonder marvellously; for I work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be declared to you", verse 5.<a name=57:14></a> It is very striking that the apostle Paul applied this scripture to the work which God is doing now, and which is declared in the glad tidings.<a name=57:15></a> This is, indeed, the greatest work which God has ever done.<a name=57:16></a> He has raised up Jesus from among the dead, and the blessed declaration is going forth: "Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through this man remission of sins is preached to you, and from all things from which ye could not be justified in the law of Moses, in him every one that believes is justified", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:38">Acts  13:38</a>, 39.<a name=57:17></a> How good it

		would be if men took account of what God is declaring now!<a name=58:1></a> There is a widespread recognition that it is suitable to pray in a time of pressure that God may intervene.<a name=58:2></a> But comparatively few seem interested to know that He <i>has</i> intervened in a most wonderful way, and that He is causing it to be declared that men may believe it.<a name=58:3></a> All the distress of men and of nations can be accounted for by the fact that men have not believed what God has declared in the glad tidings.<a name=58:4></a>

		Then God's corrective ways with His people are always going on, as they were in Habakkuk's day.<a name=58:5></a> It is always faith's privilege to recognise God's hand in the afflictions and pressures that come upon His people.<a name=58:6></a> In that day He was raising up an enemy who worshipped his own power; verse 11.<a name=58:7></a> But Habakkuk's reaction to the terrible description of the Chaldeans in verses 6 - 11 is, "Art thou not from everlasting, Jehovah my God, my Holy One?<a name=58:8></a>" verse 12.<a name=58:9></a> He takes, as it were, personal possession of Jehovah as <i>his</i> God, <i>his</i> Holy One.<a name=58:10></a> This is ever faith's answer to what seems to be overwhelming.<a name=58:11></a> Whatever Israel or Judah might have been, whatever the Chaldeans might be, Jehovah was from everlasting.<a name=58:12></a> He was the one great Reality, subsisting eternally.<a name=58:13></a> Nothing can get behind this.<a name=58:14></a> And the conclusion which faith draws from it is, "We shall not die".<a name=58:15></a> Looking at the Chaldeans would lead nature to say, We shall all die, but faith looking at the eternal God says, "We shall not die".<a name=58:16></a> However severe God's dealings may be, faith is fully assured that they are in the way of correction for His people.<a name=58:17></a> "Jehovah thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, has appointed him for correction", verse 12.<a name=58:18></a> It could not be otherwise in the estimation of faith; those who fear God and honour Him in their hearts know that He is for them and not against them, and that His correction is the correction of love, and for their benefit.<a name=58:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But faith has its exercises when it sees that God "keepeth silence when the wicked swalloweth up a man more righteous than he", verse 13.<a name=58:20></a> Why should God allow such things to pass?<a name=58:21></a> Why should He allow the wicked to take men and do as they like with them, so that men worship the very means they use when they find them Successful?<a name=58:22></a> verse 16.<a name=58:23></a> We can see these things going on today: how are they affecting us?<a name=58:24></a> Faith says, "I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer as to my reproof", chapter 2: 1.<a name=58:25></a> It is for each one of us to take up this position.<a name=58:26></a> What is God about to say to me in connection with all

		the questions which His ways raise in my heart?<a name=59:1></a> There is always some element of reproof in God's correction: He does not rebuke without cause.<a name=59:2></a> The watchful soul on the tower will hear what He says, and be prepared to answer.<a name=59:3></a> When God speaks correctively He expects an answer; He expects us to take up the exercise intelligently, and answer as having understood what He said.<a name=59:4></a> The psalmist answered when he said, "Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep thy word": "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:67">Psalm  119:67</a>, 71.<a name=59:5></a> See also <a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:1">Job  42:1</a> - 6.<a name=59:6></a>

		When we answer to God's reproving ways He always makes further communications.<a name=59:7></a> "And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.<a name=59:8></a> For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but it hasteth to the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; for it will surely come, it will not delay".<a name=59:9></a> The <i>vision</i> looks on to the full deliverance of God's people, which has so large a place in the word of prophecy; that is, it looks on to the coming of the Lord.<a name=59:10></a> It was to be made very plain that faith's hopes and expectations as to the future on earth would only be realised then.<a name=59:11></a> The <i>it</i> of <a href="../bible/Habakkuk.htm#2:3">Habakkuk  2:3</a> is changed by the Spirit of God into <i>he</i> when He quotes this passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:37">Hebrews  10:37</a>.<a name=59:12></a> There, receiving what is promised stands in contrast with losing what the Hebrew believers had possessed on earth.<a name=59:13></a> It gives added heavenly light as to the vision.<a name=59:14></a> But whether it be Israel's earthly deliverance, or the saints of the assembly getting their heavenly place in actuality, the <i>appointed time</i> is the coming of the Lord.<a name=59:15></a> The saints of the assembly will be caught up at the rapture into their own heavenly place, and the remnant of Israel will be delivered and brought into their promised earthly blessing after the Lord appears.<a name=59:16></a> The word through Habakkuk was, "though it tarry wait for it", but when the Holy Spirit quotes this passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>He says nothing about tarrying; He says, "For yet a <i>very little while</i> he that comes will come, and will not delay".<a name=59:17></a> There was a tarrying period when Habakkuk wrote the vision; Daniel's seventy weeks had to come in, but there are no prophetic periods for the assembly, no thought of tarrying now.<a name=59:18></a> The <i>vision</i>, so far as we are concerned, would put all saints in the attitude of constant expectancy, and thus entirely apart in spirit from such persons as are described by the words, "Behold his soul is puffed up, it is not upright within him", chapter 2: 4.<a name=59:19></a> The one who is just; God's just one (see note to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:28">Hebrews  10:28</a>)

		The prophet's prayer in chapter 3 sets forth what may be known by those who draw near to Jehovah in His holy temple.<a name=60:9></a> His first exercise is marked by fear as realising that the state of the people was such as to deserve wrath.<a name=60:10></a> But he looks for revival on the ground of mercy "in the midst of the years" of departure.<a name=60:11></a> And his prayer indicates that revival comes about by returning to that which was from the beginning.<a name=60:12></a> For verse 3 alludes very distinctly to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:2">Deuteronomy  33:2</a>, which refers to how Jehovah moved at the beginning for the blessing of His people.<a name=60:13></a> As it is said in verse 13 of the chapter before us, "Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, for the salvation of thine anointed".<a name=60:14></a> The full result of this will be that "his glory covereth the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise", verse 3.<a name=60:15></a> In coming out for the blessing of His people God has the heavens and the earth before Him.<a name=60:16></a> He may seem to be operating in a limited sphere, but what He does will have universal results.<a name=60:17></a> In considering Habakkuk's prayer we must bear in mind that what he dwelt upon was the deliverance of Israel, and the destruction of their enemies, but their deliverance was only a typical one; there was no redemption wrought for them, save in type.<a name=60:18></a> We have to bring what is said here into the present period to get the divine reality of what was done for Israel in a typical way.<a name=60:19></a> I have no doubt the Spirit of God had in mind in verses 3 and 4

		There is an added reason found in verses 8 and 9 for the judgment.<a name=71:9></a> It is wonderful that God can own them as His people in verse 9, calling them, "the remnant of my people".<a name=71:10></a> It means that God will dispossess those that have seized the land of Canaan, and His people will possess it.<a name=71:11></a> There are powers now, religious powers, that will keep God's people out of their inheritance; God would put all that aside and bring His people to rest in their inheritance.<a name=71:12></a> They have to be formed morally to be in suitability to the day of Jehovah.<a name=71:13></a> All this has to be taken in and we have to come into harmony with it.<a name=71:14></a> That is why we have to stand apart from the world politically, religiously and socially -- because judgment is coming on it.<a name=71:15></a> The Lord loves to gather His own together in the enjoyment of these things, and His love and His principles of acting do not change with the dispensations.<a name=71:16></a> Everything that is an idol will be annihilated in that day (verse 11): "Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day".<a name=71:17></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#82:8">Psalm  82:8</a> says, "Thou shalt inherit all the nations".<a name=71:18></a> What a comfort it is that God is coming into His own!<a name=71:19></a> What is all the power of the earth worth, viewed at from the standpoint of heaven's view!<a name=71:20></a> It is all going to be dispossessed soon.<a name=71:21></a> It is better to have what is given by God and that no power of evil can take away; and if God makes His people happy nothing can disturb their happiness.<a name=71:22></a> This is all preparatory to chapter 3, so that there is to be that which is morally suitable to come into it.<a name=71:23></a> God wants everyone of us in a state of heart that yields Him perpetual pleasure; He wants us all in that state.<a name=71:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophet Haggai prophesied in the second year of Darius the king, when the work of rebuilding the temple had been at a standstill for a number of years.<a name=74:1></a> The adversaries had been persistent (see <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#4">Ezra  4</a>) and a king had arisen who was ready to listen to them, and to give orders that the work should cease, but the work really ceased because it was no longer the chief interest of those who had been engaged in it.<a name=74:2></a> Opposition never really hinders the work of God; it is waning interest on the part of His people that is the true secret of all weakness.<a name=74:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now after an interval of about fifteen years, Haggai, with Zechariah, "prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them", <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#5:1">Ezra  5:1</a>.<a name=74:4></a> But in spite of all that had transpired, his prophecy made no reference to the external difficulty; it addressed itself to the state of the people and made manifest the real hindrance to the work.<a name=74:5></a> "Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that Jehovah's house should be built.<a name=74:6></a> And the word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying, Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses, while this house lieth waste?<a name=74:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:2">Haggai  1:2</a> - 4.<a name=74:8></a>

		There are always difficulties in the way of anything being done for God, and it is easy quietly to accept them, and to regard them as an indication that we should let things stand as they are.<a name=74:9></a> When God's chief interest ceases to be our chief interest some form of self-consideration inevitably comes in.<a name=74:10></a> Jehovah speaks of His house lying waste while they dwelt in wainscoted houses.<a name=74:11></a> It was very sad that Paul had to say of those about him at Rome, "all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ".<a name=74:12></a> Timothy stood out as a bright exception to this, caring with genuine feeling how the saints got on.<a name=74:13></a>

		The divine call is, "Go up to the mountain and bring wood, and build the house, and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah", chapter 1: 8.<a name=75:4></a> God's house cannot be built without material, and the material cannot be found without labour.<a name=75:5></a> All true spiritual labour at the present time has the house in view.<a name=75:6></a> The preaching of the gospel and all ministry of the word is only carried on intelligently as we see that it is to get material for the house and to build it.<a name=75:7></a> Let us make this our great business.<a name=75:8></a> It is not easy work to go to the mountain and hew timber, but what could be a greater honour than to do something of which God says, "I will, take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified?<a name=75:9></a>" God's great thought is that there may be a company here built together for His pleasure, and amongst whom He is glorified.<a name=75:10></a> We are all to be at this great work.<a name=75:11></a> If each one who knows something of God's chief interest were to be the means of bringing one other into the truth of God's house, and into practical accord with it, what pleasure God would take in it!<a name=75:12></a> It is the same work that began nineteen centuries ago by the labours of the apostles and others, but it has now to be done at a time when Christendom is full of bodies which are not for God's pleasure, and in which He is not glorified, for they have not the constitution or the character of His house.<a name=75:13></a> Indeed, the religious bodies of today answer to the wainscoted houses of <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1">Haggai  1</a>, and it is not difficult to see that as religious buildings get larger and finer the inward spiritual power declines.<a name=75:14></a> The Lord had spoken of the temple as His Father's house, but the time came when He had to call it "your house".<a name=75:15></a> God had ceased to have pleasure in it, and so it is today.<a name=75:16></a> Christians are running to what are really their own houses while God's house lieth waste.<a name=75:17></a> And this accounts for the spiritual dearth of which many believers complain.<a name=75:18></a> "Ye looked for much, and behold it was little; and when ye brought it home I blew upon it".<a name=75:19></a> There is much going on in an outward way, but where are spiritual results?<a name=75:20></a> Where do we find the dew of the heavens?<a name=75:21></a> Where are the precious things which answer for us to the corn, the new wine and the oil?<a name=75:22></a> Is it not time for Christians to consider their ways, and to ask why blessing is withholden?<a name=75:23></a> We need not go far for the

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is needed is that we should do as the remnant did in that day.<a name=76:2></a> They "hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, according as Jehovah their God had sent him, and the people feared before Jehovah", chapter 1:12.<a name=76:3></a> As soon as they took this ground the message was sent to them, "I am with you, saith Jehovah".<a name=76:4></a> All that is needed on our part is that we should hearken to what God says; that is, be in the spirit of obedience before Him and fear Him.<a name=76:5></a> The moment we take this ground He will be with us, and His presence with His people is their only power.<a name=76:6></a> If God is not with us, even our efforts to build His house will come to nothing.<a name=76:7></a> But if He is with us our spirits will be divinely stirred up, and we shall come and work at the house of Jehovah.<a name=76:8></a> It is a notable day when that takes place; the exact day of the month is given.<a name=76:9></a> We may be sure that when our hearts are stirred up to come and work at the house it is placed on record in heaven.<a name=76:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the one and twentieth day of the seventh month there was a further prophetic word given to fortify the hearts of the remnant against discouragement; chapter 2: 1.<a name=76:11></a> It would appear that, within a month of resuming to build, a discouraging influence was found amongst the people.<a name=76:12></a> It took the form of contrasting what was then present with the former glory of the house.<a name=76:13></a> This is a subtle form of the enemy's work because it seems rightly to make much of a glorious past.<a name=76:14></a> But it is evident that the object was to minimise, and even make nothing of, the wonderful revival that was then in movement.<a name=76:15></a> In the estimation of faith the fact that it was God's house put upon it a wondrous glory, however feeble might be the outward expression of it at the moment.<a name=76:16></a> The widow who cast her two mites into the treasury showed that the house was exceedingly precious to her as God's house notwithstanding its actual state at the time.<a name=76:17></a> If we have really seen the former glory of the house we cannot accept that if God is reviving His work He has something very inferior in view.<a name=76:18></a> We cannot accept that it is a different house now, or that anything less than the full divine thought is to be before us in our building, however feeble we may be in relation to such great thoughts.<a name=76:19></a> If we have a right thought of the house we see it as invested with all the glory that originally attached to it, and if God is with us we shall not be prepared to give up any part of what is in His mind.<a name=76:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So there is a thrice-repeated call to "be strong", chapter 2: 4.<a name=77:1></a> If we think that what we are occupied with is "as nothing" we shall be weak indeed, but if we think of God's house, and that He is with us in the building of it, we shall be preserved from fear.<a name=77:2></a> "The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit, remain among you: fear ye not", verse 5.<a name=77:3></a> It is as though God said, 'My thoughts have not changed one bit.<a name=77:4></a> I brought you to Myself that you might be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, and that you might make Me a sanctuary that I might dwell among you, and this is still what I have in My mind'.<a name=77:5></a> If God's Spirit remains among us, it is certain that He will never depart from God's original thoughts.<a name=77:6></a> Christendom may depart from them, and we may depart from them, but the Spirit never will.<a name=77:7></a> So now if there is only one stone laid upon another there is something which speaks of, and represents, the whole divine thought.<a name=77:8></a> There may be today, perhaps, only two saints in a town or village who recognise in a practical way that they are a constituent part of the house of God, and are set to further the building, but there is something which recognises the whole divine thought, and that cannot be "as nothing" in our eyes.<a name=77:9></a> Satan would desire that it might be, and that we might despise it as a small thing, and give up the practical confession of it, and the building in of what is suitable to it.<a name=77:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God would have us to know what He thinks of His house.<a name=77:11></a> He is going to shake everything with a view to His house being here filled with glory.<a name=77:12></a> Every divine shaking at the present time has in view the freeing of what will contribute to His house.<a name=77:13></a> We know that there will be a terrible shaking presently to prepare the way for God to bring in the First-begotten into the habitable world, and when He comes in there will be found material that will fill the house with glory.<a name=77:14></a> But at the present time there is much precious material in the world, and God claims it all for Himself and for His house.<a name=77:15></a> "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts", verse 8.<a name=77:16></a> The silver and the gold today are the saints secured for God as the fruit of redemption and as in new creation.<a name=77:17></a> "The desire of all nations" (verse 7) refers to everything that is precious and truly desirable in all the nations.<a name=77:18></a> It refers to apprehensions and appreciations of Christ brought by the work of God into the hearts of His saints everywhere, so that Christ has become "the preciousness" to them.<a name=77:19></a> This is what has value before God, and He intends that it should all come to His house to enrich it with glory.<a name=77:20></a> So what God has

		in mind is not diminishing glory, but increasing glory.<a name=78:1></a> "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts", verse 9.<a name=78:2></a> Each brother and sister can bring more of the glory in; it is the divine thought that we should be continually moving "from glory to glory".<a name=78:3></a> If God shakes the nations it is with a view to what is precious coming to light as the glory of His house; it is that men and saints may be shaken out of settings that are not suitable to God's house, and brought as contributors of glory to that house.<a name=78:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then two months later Haggai had another prophetic word, and this time it was a solemn warning against what is unclean.<a name=78:5></a> This is just the opposite to acquiring glory, and it seems to suggest that if we are not acquiring features of glory we shall be very likely to become unclean by contact with the uncleanness that is all around us here.<a name=78:6></a> The questions raised by Jehovah (verses 11 - 13) brought to light that holy things have no power to make holy what is not holy in itself, but what is unclean can quickly impart its own characteristic to anything which it touches.<a name=78:7></a> It is a warning against touching what is unclean.<a name=78:8></a> If we want to be suitable to the house of God, and to have features of glory, we must keep from the touch of what is unclean.<a name=78:9></a> The people in running to their own houses were really unclean; the state of their hearts in allowing the house of God to lie waste while they pursued their own interests was one of uncleanness, and it brought upon them the severe governmental dealing of God.<a name=78:10></a> This is very much the state of the Christian profession at the present time.<a name=78:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The four and twentieth day of the ninth month (verse 18) was a notable day, for there was evidently a fresh start made in building, and Jehovah took immediate notice of it.<a name=78:12></a> "From this day will I bless you".<a name=78:13></a> It is interesting to notice that this was not the first movement they had made.<a name=78:14></a> They had begun years before, but there had been a long period of slackness.<a name=78:15></a> It is often like this; there is a beginning made, but it is not followed up, and spiritual energy wanes.<a name=78:16></a> Then God sends a prophetic word and uses it to bring about revival.<a name=78:17></a> A fresh start is made, and God immediately answers it by the assurance and bestowal of blessing.<a name=78:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the same day there was a second word given to the prophet, but this time it was addressed to Zerubbabel as typical of Christ.<a name=78:19></a> It declared plainly how God would shake everything, the heavens and the earth, the throne of kingdoms and the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, but His object in all this was that Zerubbabel might be made as a signet.<a name=78:20></a> That is, God's

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is very definite help for us in these things if we pay attention to them.<a name=79:8></a> The prophets Haggai and Zechariah helped the builders in their day.<a name=79:9></a> We are told that "the elders of the Jews built; and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo", <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#6:14">Ezra  6:14</a>.<a name=79:10></a> In putting these prophecies on record the Spirit of God had in mind that they would be a help to <i>us</i> in building the house of God in our remnant times.<a name=79:11></a> May we have grace from God to profit by them!<a name=79:12></a>

		The first word that came to Zechariah called attention to the state of departure which had brought God's wrath upon His people, and was a call to return to Him, when He would return to them.<a name=80:1></a> The former prophets had called upon them to return, but they did not hearken.<a name=80:2></a> They had now to own that what had come upon them was the result of this; all had come to pass as the prophets foretold.<a name=80:3></a> Now it is important for us to remember that divine prophecies have been uttered with reference to the period in which we live, and our measure of spiritual light and prosperity largely depends upon our seeing that they have come to pass.<a name=80:4></a> For example, the Lord's words in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:24">Matthew  13:24</a> - 33 are prophecies of what the kingdom of the heavens would become publicly, ending in the whole mass being leavened.<a name=80:5></a> Then Paul's farewell to the Ephesian elders in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>makes plain that after his departure grievous wolves would come in, not sparing the flock, and even from among those present, men would rise up speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them.<a name=80:6></a> 2 Timothy is another prophecy of what the state of the Christian profession would be in the last days, and 2 Thessalonians warns us that apostasy would come.<a name=80:7></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3 give us a prophetic outline of church history ending in Laodicea being spued out of the Lord's mouth as utterly nauseous to Him.<a name=80:8></a> 2 Peter and Jude may also be considered in this connection.<a name=80:9></a> Now we have to own that all these prophecies have been fulfilled, or are being fulfilled, so that the Christian profession is manifestly the subject of divine judgment.<a name=80:10></a> If we do not see this we shall not receive much light from God as to the resources available for a faithful remnant in a day of general departure.<a name=80:11></a> There are resources, but they are only made known to those who accept the truth as to the general position of things.<a name=80:12></a> Zechariah was a young man, and he represents youthful energy such as is needed for faithful service in remnant times.<a name=80:13></a>

		Joshua the high priest is introduced here as representing the people in their actual state; even the priesthood had become defiled and unsuitable for holy service.<a name=91:12></a> There was an unclean state which God could not overlook, for He is light and in Him is no darkness at all.<a name=91:13></a> But if He had chosen Jerusalem, and had returned to her with mercies, He must needs undertake to remove the defilement, and to bring in suitable conditions for His service to go on.<a name=91:14></a> There can be no doubt that much has come in amongst the people of God which is contrary to His thought of the holy priesthood.<a name=91:15></a> This scripture suggests that priestly habiliments may be defiled even amongst a returned remnant.<a name=91:16></a> Though outwardly delivered from the captivity and corruptions of Babylon, there was a defiled state which rendered it impossible for God to be

		It is to be observed that Satan is brought personally into this matter; God is lifting the veil and exposing the very source of the evil which has come in.<a name=92:3></a> We are shown, too, that the one who was the source of the evil would do all that he could to frustrate the designs of mercy.<a name=92:4></a> But there is also another Person in the scene who is spoken of as "the Angel of Jehovah".<a name=92:5></a> I believe that when this term is used in Scripture it always has reference to Christ.<a name=92:6></a> Joshua was standing before the Angel of Jehovah; that is, he was in presence of God's mighty intervention in Christ.<a name=92:7></a> That is where faith puts us, however defiled we may be, or rather it is where infinite mercy puts us.<a name=92:8></a> If that is so, whatever Satan may wish to do, he is rebuked.<a name=92:9></a> It is a question of God's sovereignty; He has chosen Jerusalem, and He has a right of way.<a name=92:10></a> As regards Joshua Jehovah says, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?<a name=92:11></a>" In presence of Satan God asserts His right to do what He will in mercy; if He is minded to pluck a brand out of the fire He will do it in spite of Satan.<a name=92:12></a> And the more simply and fully we are prepared to take the place of being brands plucked out of the fire the more we shall learn the surpassing riches of God's grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.<a name=92:13></a> People who realise that they are brands plucked out of the fire have done with all thoughts of self-worthiness.<a name=92:14></a> I do not think any of us get rid of our filthy garments without standing in them in the presence of Christ.<a name=92:15></a> Joshua must have felt what a contrast there was between the Angel of Jehovah and himself.<a name=92:16></a>

		"And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee a place to walk among these that stand by", verses 6, 7.<a name=95:14></a> This makes clear that all that had been done for Joshua was in view of his taking up responsible service in God's house.<a name=95:15></a> If Joshua was faithful he would judge God's house and keep His courts.<a name=95:16></a> To be entrusted with the care of God's house is a wonderful favour, as we must realise, if we know God at all.<a name=95:17></a> But it is also a very serious responsibility.<a name=95:18></a> We cannot judge God's house unless we have priestly intelligence of what is suitable to the house, and then we have to apply that intelligence in a practical way.<a name=95:19></a> To judge in this sense is to exercise discernment and discrimination so that the standard of what is suitable to God is maintained in all that pertains to our collective service Godward.<a name=95:20></a> Then His courts are to be <i>kept</i>; this would imply care as to the kind of persons who are permitted to approach.<a name=95:21></a> Some would tell us that only the Spirit knows who is suitable, and that therefore we should leave

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is also said of Joshua, "and I will give thee a place to walk (or, give thee goings) among those that stand by".<a name=96:5></a> I think this is a reference to "those that stood before him" in verse 4.<a name=96:6></a> The Scripture suggests that there are servants who are near to God, and who are at hand to do His pleasure in regard to Joshua.<a name=96:7></a> They are in the knowledge of God's mind, and are available for any needed service in relation to His house.<a name=96:8></a> We may think of the apostles in connections such as this, and no doubt there have been many others.<a name=96:9></a> How blessed to have our "goings" among such persons!<a name=96:10></a> If any have been a spiritual help to us in relation to the service of God it is the divine intent that we should move with them in nearness to God, and thus in availability for any needed service.<a name=96:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Joshua is addressed further in verse 8.<a name=96:12></a> It would seem that Joshua throughout this book is a representative person in whom the defiled state of the priesthood is seen, and then the recovery of priestly conditions through sovereign mercy.<a name=96:13></a> As thus recovered he is seen as having "fellows".<a name=96:14></a> We know that Christ has "companions" or "fellows" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:7">Psalm  45:7</a>; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:9">Hebrews  1:9</a>), but here it would appear to be the priest who has been divested of "filthy garments" and invested with "festival-robes", who has "fellows".<a name=96:15></a> It clearly suggests that there is a priestly company secured on the ground of restoration by mercy, a company who have shared Joshua's experiences in some measure, and who sit before him to contemplate the priesthood as restored in mercy.<a name=96:16></a> Of course, for us, this involves the contemplation of Christ, for we could not get any true thought of priesthood if we did not apprehend it in Him.<a name=96:17></a> But the point in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#3">Zechariah  3</a>is that priestly conditions are restored in a remnant day so that the service of God's house may be taken up in a way that is acceptable to Him.<a name=96:18></a> Thank God, there are many who know what it is to sit in the presence of such a recovery today.<a name=96:19></a> One would not wish to forget the feebleness of the moment, neither would one wish to minimise the greatness of what God has done in restoring, in some measure,

		It is at this point that Jehovah says, "For behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch".<a name=97:13></a> The eyes of Joshua and his fellows are turned to Christ as Jehovah's perfect Servant.<a name=97:14></a> It was as much as to say to them, If you want to build acceptably you must consider Christ.<a name=97:15></a> It is suggested here that persons are present who can look at Christ in a priestly way; that is, they can look at Him in relation to God.<a name=97:16></a> It is a never to be forgotten moment when we come to this, that instead of thinking of Christ in relation to us we begin to think of Him in relation to God.<a name=97:17></a> Not that we lose the first by entertaining the second; it is rather greatly enlarged.<a name=97:18></a> But the Branch is Jehovah's Servant; it is He who will very shortly bring in publicly all that is for the pleasure of God.<a name=97:19></a> It is as Man that He will do this: "Behold a man whose name is the Branch", chapter 6:12.<a name=97:20></a> It is He who will build the temple, and, when He does, every whit of it will say, Glory.<a name=97:21></a> But then all that Christ will do in the future was to be before the hearts of the remnant in their building in Zechariah's day.<a name=97:22></a> And so it is to be for us.<a name=97:23></a> Everything that is right will come in for the pleasure of God when He brings forth the Branch.<a name=97:24></a> For

		The fact that Zechariah is waked at the beginning of this chapter "as a man that is wakened out of his sleep" suggests that what is set forth in this chapter is particularly intended to be understood in a time of awakening.<a name=99:1></a> The subject of the chapter is "a lamp-stand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon, seven lamps, and seven pipes to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof; and two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and the other on the left of it", verses 2 and 3.<a name=99:2></a> The angel explains these figures to Zechariah by saying, "This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts", verse 8.<a name=99:3></a> God calls our attention to a wonderful vessel of light, and gives us to understand that it sets forth symbolically a system of things which is suitable to be pervaded by the activity of His Spirit.<a name=99:4></a> This striking symbol presents to us the character of the vessel by which, and in which, He would act.<a name=99:5></a> It is important for us to consider this carefully.<a name=99:6></a>

		CHAPTER 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The vision of <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:1">Zechariah  6:1</a> - 8 contains an instruction which is as important for us as it was for the remnant in that day.<a name=108:3></a> It lets us know that God has not ceased to carry on a government in the world, though He has taken His throne from Jerusalem.<a name=108:4></a> We may remember that it is said that "Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:23">1 Chronicles  29:23</a>), and the queen of Sheba said, "Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king to Jehovah thy God", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#9:8">2 Chronicles  9:8</a>.<a name=108:5></a> Jehovah's throne was then at Jerusalem; there was a direct government of God in the earth in the midst of Israel.<a name=108:6></a> But this was conditional on the obedience and faithfulness of Israel, and particularly on that of their kings.<a name=108:7></a> The captivity showed that the throne of Jehovah was no longer at Jerusalem.<a name=108:8></a> Everything having been forfeited by Israel, authority was definitely put by God in the hands of Gentile powers, as set forth in the great image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream; <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2">Daniel  2</a>.<a name=108:9></a> It is now "the times of the Gentiles".<a name=108:10></a> God has not left things to go on in a haphazard way; He has committed authority to certain powers, which are definitely responsible to Him as to how they exercise that authority.<a name=108:11></a> If they abuse the power with which they are entrusted, God will judge them, and it will eventually be found that power -- like everything else that God has committed to man's responsibility -- will become a subject of judgment.<a name=108:12></a> The Stone cut out without hands will smite the image upon its feet, and every constituent part of it will be "broken in pieces together".<a name=108:13></a> Gentile power will be judged and broken in pieces, and the whole earth will be filled with blessing under the reign of Christ.<a name=108:14></a> The throne of Jehovah will be again set up in the earth, but not in a conditional way which may break down through man's unfaithfulness, but in a permanent way as filled by One who is in every way capable of sustaining the government.<a name=108:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people to whom Zechariah prophesied had, no doubt, read the prophet Daniel, and thus knew about the four successive
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=109>[Page 109]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		kingdoms which would run their course before the setting up of the kingdom of Christ.<a name=109:1></a> Those kingdoms were presented to Zechariah under the figure of four chariots, but the Spirit of God views them here as having a special character which does not appear in Daniel.<a name=109:2></a> In Daniel we get a public, or historical, view of the four kingdoms, and this was appropriate in the presentation of them to Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=109:3></a> But in Zechariah the angel interprets the import of the four chariots by saying, "These are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth" (verse 5).<a name=109:4></a> So they are seen here as having some distinct relation to the working out of God's plans as "the Lord of all the earth".<a name=109:5></a> This is how God would have His saints to view the Gentile kingdoms; it is, we might say, a private view, reserved for faith, but one which is very comforting when it is spiritually apprehended.<a name=109:6></a> It shows that there is a working of God in His government and providence which goes on during the time of the successive Gentile kingdoms.<a name=109:7></a> The Gentile powers are entirely unaware of this working, but it is made known to the faith of the remnant.<a name=109:8></a> It is the hidden side of the times of the Gentiles.<a name=109:9></a> There is something going on all the time which is hidden from the eyes of men, but which is providentially causing things to work out for the furtherance of the plans of the Lord of all the earth during the long period which has come in between the setting aside of the throne of Jehovah in the earth and the coming of Christ, when divine government will be publicly set up in power.<a name=109:10></a> To know this is a great comfort for faith.<a name=109:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The stability of this secret government of God is set forth by the two mountains of brass from between which the four chariots came.<a name=109:12></a> God would have us to know that, though things seem to be unstable, and to be largely marked by a conflict of human ambitions, and sometimes by the predominance of what is evil, He is over-ruling on fixed principles which cannot be interfered with by any power of man.<a name=109:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the time of the second chariot when Zechariah prophesied.<a name=109:14></a> The great head of Gentile power had completely failed to answer to the responsibility entrusted to it, and had come under divine judgment.<a name=109:15></a> That is why He says, "See, these that go forth towards the north country have quieted my spirit (or, satisfied mine anger) in the north country", verse 8.<a name=109:16></a> God judged Babylon for its pride, its idolatry, and its cruelty to His people, and in doing so He gave an intimation that all Gentile power that failed to answer to its responsibilities would also eventually be

		judged by Him.<a name=110:1></a> But in Cyrus God raised up a power that would be favourable to His people, and that would further the building of His house by the remnant delivered from Babylon.<a name=110:2></a> Publicly, Cyrus was just a great conqueror, but as known to the faith of God's people there was a spirit of the heavens operating through him for the judgment of Babylon and the deliverance of the remnant.<a name=110:3></a> It might be said that this was so obvious in his case as hardly to need faith to discern it.<a name=110:4></a> But what was obvious in his case was, and is, really true in connection with all the Gentile kingdoms.<a name=110:5></a> Each, in his turn, has been in some way instrumental in furthering the divine plan.<a name=110:6></a> So the authorities that are above us are to be recognised as set up by God, and as being the ordinance of God.<a name=110:7></a> The authority is "God's minister to thee for good".<a name=110:8></a> So Paul says, "Put them in mind to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient to rule", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:1">Titus  3:1</a>, and Peter says, "Be in subjection therefore to every human institution for the Lord's sake: whether to the king as supreme, or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers, and praise to them that do well", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:13">1 Peter  2:13</a>.<a name=110:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this has to do with our apprehension of something in the authorities, of which, perhaps, they themselves are entirely unaware.<a name=110:10></a> We recognise the "spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth", as having some place in the matter.<a name=110:11></a> This is true, even though bad men may be in positions of rule.<a name=110:12></a> Indeed, it was made known by God to Nebuchadnezzar that "the most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#4:17">Daniel  4:17</a>.<a name=110:13></a> Since the times of the Gentiles began, it has been important that God's faithful remnant should know how to recognise, and be in subjection to, the authorities that exist.<a name=110:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said of the fourth chariot, "and the strong go forth, and seek to go that they may walk to and fro through the earth.<a name=110:15></a> And he said, Go, walk to and fro through the earth, and they walked to and fro through the earth", verse 7.<a name=110:16></a> We can understand that the Roman kingdom would have a special place in this vision, because it was to be in the time of that kingdom that Christ would come in, and the assembly be found on earth.<a name=110:17></a> The wisdom of God was in this, so that the "strong" horses have a special commission such as is not given to any of the others.<a name=110:18></a> We may be sure that God has had a particular concern about the kind of Gentile power that should be running its course while

		His greatest actings were taking place.<a name=111:1></a> It was not by chance that the sphere of Roman power was so largely the area over which Christianity spread.<a name=111:2></a> There was an ordering of God in this, and the powers became publicly favourable to Christianity.<a name=111:3></a> Whatever human motives might have acted in this there was a spreading abroad of certain light as to God which had no place in the heathen world.<a name=111:4></a> So far as there was this, it was beneficial to men, and it seems to me that the angel's words in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>would lead us to conclude that there is always some working of God in connection with the powers which He has set up for government here.<a name=111:5></a> It is a hidden working, but faith would recognise that it is there.<a name=111:6></a> I think Paul would speak to Felix, or to Festus, or to Agrippa, or to Nero, with a sense of this in his heart.<a name=111:7></a> <i>They</i> were the representatives of divine government in the world, as he was the representative of divine grace.<a name=111:8></a> He addresses them with all the respect due to their position.<a name=111:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:9">Zechariah  6:9</a> another subject is introduced.<a name=111:10></a> We find that certain persons "of the captivity", who had "come from Babylon", were able to furnish gifts of silver and gold, of which crowns were made to be set upon the head of Joshua the high priest.<a name=111:11></a> The government of God, as under the hand of the first of the four empires, had brought severe pressure upon the people of God, but it had resulted in their being able to yield something which enhanced the priesthood.<a name=111:12></a> This illustrates the working of God's government in its hidden character.<a name=111:13></a> The captivity was the outcome of a long course of unfaithfulness and departure, but for those who submitted to it in the fear of God it yielded gain.<a name=111:14></a> Any of us may find ourselves in some kind of "captivity" as the result of our wrong-doing.<a name=111:15></a> I suppose there are very few saints who have not at some time suffered under God's governmental dealings as reaping what they have sowed.<a name=111:16></a> But what a comfort it is to gather from the scripture before us that if we submit to God's government we shall acquire spiritual wealth!<a name=111:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The general condition in which the Christian profession is found today is one of captivity.<a name=111:18></a> There is but little of what the apostle speaks of as "our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus", and this is the result of a departure from the truth of such long standing that most people have come to accept it as normal Christianity.<a name=111:19></a> But those who have felt it to be bondage, and contrary to God's mind, have come out of it with great spiritual gain.<a name=111:20></a> Much "silver and gold" has been found with

		those who, through the exercises of captivity, have learned to value Jerusalem and the house of God.<a name=112:1></a> Silver speaks of what God is as known in the grace of redemption.<a name=112:2></a> There was great acquisition of spiritual wealth when believers began to consider, in the light of Scripture, what had resulted from the death of Christ.<a name=112:3></a> Certain great and precious things are now subsisting realities by reason of the fact that Christ has died, and His blood has been shed.<a name=112:4></a> For example, the sins of believers have been put away, never to be remembered by God any more; and, as a result of this, Christ brings His redeemed ones to God in a priestly way; they are made nigh by His blood; they know the love of God, and have been reconciled to Him.<a name=112:5></a> As in the value of redemption, there is not a shade of distance between those who are reconciled and the blessed God.<a name=112:6></a> Then "gold" would lead us to think of divine glory as shining out in the bestowal of a wholly new place before God as children and sons.<a name=112:7></a> It carries our thoughts to what subsists in the power of new creation; an order of things where what is old has passed away, and all things have become new, and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ.<a name=112:8></a> How different all this is from what obtains in the religious world!<a name=112:9></a> But this is what supplies crowns for the priesthood.<a name=112:10></a> There is nothing more important at the present time than that the priestly service should be enhanced, and I believe God intends that this shall be brought about by all that is happening.<a name=112:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can doubt that the nations of Europe have been under God's special dealings from time to time; and God's people in many countries are under great pressure.<a name=112:12></a> But the inward working of it is to give us "silver and gold"; that is, to secure to us increased knowledge of God so that the priestly service may be enhanced.<a name=112:13></a> We should think much of this, and not merely of getting relief.<a name=112:14></a> It is possible for the service of God to take on a character beyond what has been yet known in the assembly.<a name=112:15></a> New "crowns" may be made; and those who bring their acquired wealth to make them will have them "for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah", verse 14.<a name=112:16></a> Who that loves God would not covet to have such a memorial as this, to bring something that contributes to the dignity and glory of the priestly service!<a name=112:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But at the time when Joshua has the crowns set upon his head he also receives a special word from Jehovah with reference to Christ.<a name=112:18></a> We may be sure that if priestly conditions are promoted amongst us there will be great enlargement in the knowledge of

		The word, "he shall grow up from his own place", shows how perfectly He accepted everything that was appointed for Him by the will of God, and how there was the development in Him from infancy to manhood of an obedience which was always perfect, but disclosed itself more and more fully at every step.<a name=113:11></a> That wondrous life is, indeed, an eternal study for the hearts of all the redeemed.<a name=113:12></a> I do not think it is too much to say that we may learn how He will fill every place of glory by seeing how He filled His own place in lowly incarnation.<a name=113:13></a> In one sense His place in incarnation is more wonderful than any other place which He will ever fill, for in that place He "learned obedience from the things which he suffered".<a name=113:14></a> He came into the world in a body prepared for Him that He might do God's will, and He became obedient unto death, though He was, indeed, "the Lord of glory".<a name=113:15></a> His death is not mentioned in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>, because the Spirit of God is calling attention here to Him as the Builder of the temple, and as the One who bears the glory, and who rules upon His throne and shall be a Priest upon His throne.<a name=113:16></a> But, as we know from other scriptures, He will do all this on the ground that He has glorified God in death.<a name=113:17></a>

		The "spirit of grace" was poured upon Saul of Tarsus when he said to the glorified One, "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=135:6></a>" and "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=135:7></a>" His heart was made ready in one instant to appreciate the One of whom he had been, up to that moment, the bitter enemy.<a name=135:8></a> It is the same "spirit of grace" which effects this moral revolution in hearts today, and the spirit of "supplications" still goes along with "the spirit of grace".<a name=135:9></a> The Lord said of Saul to Ananias, "Behold, he is praying".<a name=135:10></a> No doubt he was praying about the heavenly vision, and the new and wonderful light concerning Christ which it had brought into his heart.<a name=135:11></a> We must not suppose that Saul had heard nothing about Jesus before.<a name=135:12></a> He would not have been so bitter against His name if he had known nothing of it.<a name=135:13></a> No doubt he had heard much testimony from the many he persecuted.<a name=135:14></a> But he had thought that he ought to do much against that name.<a name=135:15></a> His prayer now would be that he might see everything in the light of Jesus being glorified.<a name=135:16></a> He would want to transfer all that the Old Testament had taught him concerning the Messiah to the glorified Man in heaven.<a name=135:17></a> What wonders would engage his heart and fill his prayers!<a name=135:18></a> He would want to understand how saints on earth could be one with the glorified Man.<a name=135:19></a> And he would certainly enter into that word, "They shall look on me whom they pierced".<a name=135:20></a> Now all this, in the principle of it, enters into the experience of everyone who is intelligently in the assembly.<a name=135:21></a> Jesus must become precious to us, loved as an only son, as a firstborn; He must be the pre-eminent One.<a name=135:22></a>

		The exercises of chapter 12, when gone through with God, will prepare the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to appreciate the fountain which will be opened for them "for sin and for uncleanness", verse 1.<a name=136:11></a> They will feel the need for purification from their whole former state.<a name=136:12></a> Jehovah will fulfil His word: "And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you", <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#36:25">Ezekiel  36:25</a>.<a name=136:13></a>

		While not losing sight of the direct application of this to a Jewish remnant in a future day, our chief object at present is to consider it as "written for our instruction".<a name=136:14></a> The truth of purification by water has application to us as well as to Israel, though it is, perhaps, less understood by believers generally than cleansing by blood.<a name=136:15></a> But if we have learned that we long rejected Christ, and were of the same stock as those who actually pierced Him -- if we have mourned for Him as feeling how terribly He has been treated -- we shall be thankful to know the character of the purification which is to be known today.<a name=136:16></a> We need to know this in order to have liberty to enter upon affectionate relations with Christ, and particularly at a time when He is no longer to be known according to flesh.<a name=136:17></a>

		It may be observed that John's gospel -- which from the outset views Christ as rejected (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:11">John  1:11</a>) -- is the gospel which chiefly presents the thought of purifying.<a name=137:5></a> He alone speaks of water as flowing from the pierced side of Christ as well as blood.<a name=137:6></a> The Lord told Nicodemus that it was necessary to be "born of water and of the Spirit" to enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=137:7></a> By natural birth we came into a state of sin and uncleanness, but as "born of water" we derive moral being from an entirely new source.<a name=137:8></a> If we are "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:23">1 Peter  1:23</a>), that word gives character to those born of it.<a name=137:9></a> A distinct feature of purification is brought in.<a name=137:10></a> It is not that the flesh is purified, but the one "born of water" is purified from it, as now knowing that there is no element of good in it.<a name=137:11></a> As entering into the kingdom of God he moves away practically from the will of the flesh into the sphere of the will of God, and it becomes very clear that moral cleansing has been affected.<a name=137:12></a>

		Washing with water, as applied to saints in the New Testament, is always spoken of as a thing accomplished.<a name=137:13></a> The Lord spoke of His own which were in the world as persons who were "washed all over", and now only needed to have their feet washed (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:10">John  13:10</a>), where a different word is used in the original.<a name=137:14></a> In this connection He said, "And ye are clean, but not all.<a name=137:15></a> For he knew him that delivered him up: on account of this he said, Ye are not all clean".<a name=137:16></a> The disciples, with the exception of Judas, had been washed and were clean.<a name=137:17></a> The Lord said, further, "Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:3">John  15:3</a>.<a name=137:18></a> The word which Jesus had spoken to them had displaced in them the natural and the fleshly.<a name=137:19></a> His word had made Himself known in their affections, and what an immense inward purification this was!<a name=137:20></a> <i>They</i> did not understand the full bearing of it, but <i>He</i> did, and viewing them as having Him in their hearts as the Object of faith and love, He could say that they were "already clean".<a name=137:21></a> Then the water flowing from His

		The teaching of Paul is in accord with what we have seen in John.<a name=138:4></a> He said of the believers at Corinth that they were "washed", contrasting their former state with what was now brought about in them by the work of God.<a name=138:5></a> Paul also speaks in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:26">Ephesians  5:26</a> of the assembly as having been purified by Christ "by the washing of water by the word".<a name=138:6></a> Purification by water is seen here in its most complete aspect.<a name=138:7></a> It includes the whole purifying service of Christ for the assembly.<a name=138:8></a> In the practical application of "the word" the truth of Romans comes first.<a name=138:9></a> We learn that as baptised unto Christ Jesus, and to His death, we have died with him and that "if we have died with Christ, we believe we shall also live with him".<a name=138:10></a> Colossians says, further, that we have not only died with Christ, but that we are risen with Him.<a name=138:11></a> In both Colossians and Ephesians saints are addressed as having put off the old man and put on the new.<a name=138:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The washing of water is "by the word"; that is, it is by the application to saints of what is in the mind of God in its own purity and completeness.<a name=138:13></a> There is no admixture of what is defective in "the word"; it is not contaminated or diluted by our faulty or imperfect experiences.<a name=138:14></a> When we hear Christ, and are instructed in Him, we learn the truth as in Jesus.<a name=138:15></a> Nothing comes short of God's mind in Jesus, and the truth as in Jesus is that we have put off the old man and put on the new.<a name=138:16></a> There is no thought in "the word" of it not being done, or of it only being partly done.<a name=138:17></a> <i>Our</i> washing at the fountain is the application to our souls by Christ of the truth as it is in Jesus.<a name=138:18></a> This, as <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:21">Ephesians  4:21</a> - 24 clearly states, is our having put off the old man and having put on the new.<a name=138:19></a> It is not that we ought to do so; it is Christian truth applied to us for purifying.<a name=138:20></a> We shall never walk in the practical power of any truth until we accept it as the truth.<a name=138:21></a> We are then definitely committed to it; it governs the heart and the conscience and forms our exercises and prayers, and Christian practice follows.<a name=138:22></a>

		We see in the scripture in Ezra that there was a power that would cause the work of the house of God to cease, and recent events have reminded us that that power still exists.<a name=151:1></a> There is a great power active to cause the work of the house of God to cease and we are all liable to fall under the influence of that power more or less.<a name=151:2></a> It is therefore of great importance that we should learn how to stand in spiritual power against it and how to secure the completion of all that belongs to the service of the house of God.<a name=151:3></a>

		Haggai gives us another reason why the work ceased; it was not really Artaxerxes and the enemies that caused the work to cease, but the state of the people themselves.<a name=151:4></a> They were occupied with their own things, and the house of God had lost its place in their interest and affections.<a name=151:5></a> In Paul's day all sought their own things and not the things of Jesus Christ.<a name=151:6></a> That state of things prevails in the Christian profession and we have to see to it with jealous care that it does not prevail in our hearts.<a name=151:7></a>

		Zechariah is, I believe, the most important of the post-captivity books because it gives us the secret of success in the carrying on of the work and service of the house of God.<a name=151:8></a> So the teaching of the prophet Zechariah is of vital importance to us, and I have on my mind to say a few words on the fact that the saints are called upon to take up features which are set forth in Joshua and in Zerubbabel.<a name=151:9></a> These men represent saints like ourselves, who are brought by divine grace into a condition in which they can minister to the work of the house of God.<a name=151:10></a> Joshua and Zerubbabel were the two anointed ones or "sons of oil", and I venture to hope that it is our holy desire and purpose to be such, because the maintenance of the divine testimony in the house of God depends on there being "sons of oil".<a name=151:11></a>

		I cannot but think that Joshua represents the state of the Christian profession generally in regard to priesthood, and alas!<a name=152:4></a> it may be more or less descriptive of my state and yours.<a name=152:5></a> But it is blessed to see that Jehovah in the sovereignty of His love undertakes to make this unsuitable man suitable: He undertakes to do it all from His own side.<a name=152:6></a> No doubt Joshua had deep exercises, for it is a solemn thing to think of serving God in a priestly way and to be conscious that one has no fitness to take up the service -- our associations, or manner of life, our personal state, all unsuitable to priesthood, and therefore disqualifying us from being "sons of oil".<a name=152:7></a> But it is most encouraging to see that the blessed God undertakes to put Joshua into true priestly conditions.<a name=152:8></a> We do not find that Joshua had a single word to say; all that he was called upon to do was to submit himself to the actings of holy love.<a name=152:9></a> Are <i>we</i> prepared to submit ourselves to the actings of love?<a name=152:10></a> They take place in such a meeting as this -- the Spirit of God touching spots of defilement here and there, perhaps as yet not even known to ourselves, but in the sovereignty of love God exposing things that are unsuited to priesthood.<a name=152:11></a>

		There can be no flow of the Spirit apart from holy conditions and such are the conditions of priesthood.<a name=152:12></a> Priesthood is one of the two "sons of oil", and it is in view of Joshua becoming one of them that Jehovah says, "Take away the filthy garments", and there were those standing before Him who were ready to do this service.<a name=152:13></a> How blessed to know that God does not do everything Himself; He loves to call in His people, His saints, and to make them serviceable in this great work of bringing about holy conditions amongst His people, so that priesthood may have its true holy character before Him.<a name=152:14></a> There are those standing before Him who are ready to serve us, and the ministry of the Word is the effective means by which our state is brought home to us, and then a blessed activity of divine love comes in to deal with it so that conditions result that are suitable to God.<a name=152:15></a>

		The thought of royalty is that one has the mind of God so as to be able to apply it in a practical way.<a name=153:1></a> So David says, "Give the king thy judgments"; the great thought of the king is that he has the mind of God, and has kingly ability to apply it.<a name=153:2></a> Zerubbabel represents the royal element amongst the people of God, and he gets instruction by this wonderful figure of the golden lamp and its seven lamps, and the oil flowing through golden pipes.<a name=153:3></a> By all this he is instructed in the great fact that in connection with the work of the house of God it is "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts".<a name=153:4></a> That is instruction for the king; if building is to go on according to God there must be the recognition that there is no power whatever but that of God's Spirit, involving the practical renunciation of every other kind of power.<a name=153:5></a>
