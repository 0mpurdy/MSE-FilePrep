		Paul addresses them as the assembly of God in Corinth at the outset, but he also speaks of some as despising the assembly of God; in the very way they were coming together they were despising the assembly of God.<a name=45:1></a> There were divisions, and then each one was eating his own supper; things were being taken up entirely, and even publicly, in an individual way.<a name=45:2></a> Surely these things in their moral application are not to be limited to Corinth.<a name=45:3></a> Many of those who think they are eating the Lord's supper are really eating their own supper, that is, they take what they call the 'Sacrament' or the 'Holy Communion', but they take it entirely on an individual basis, though it may be with a grateful and affectionate sense that the Lord has died for them  --  they delight to think of that; but it is more what the Lord has done for them that is before them, and if what the Lord has done for me is the prominent thought in my mind, I am not eating the Lord's supper, I am eating my own supper.<a name=45:4></a> The Lord's supper is divinely intended to bring the saints together.<a name=45:5></a> We cannot eat the Lord's supper alone because it is a collective matter; we have fellowship.<a name=45:6></a> If we all partake of one loaf and one cup, it is a collective matter.<a name=45:7></a> The Lord's supper stands connected with Paul's ministry.<a name=45:8></a> Paul says emphatically, I received from the Lord".<a name=45:9></a> The twelve, one might say, received it of the Lord in the days of His flesh, but Paul was the only one who received it from the Lord as risen and glorified.<a name=45:10></a> He says, I received from the Lord"; the Lord gave it to Paul in connection with his ministry in regard to the assembly.<a name=45:11></a> It is the centre, the true rallying point of the assembly of God; and it raises a question with every one of us as to whether we are, in our souls, on the ground of the assembly of God which gives the Lord's supper the central place, or whether we are on sectarian ground.<a name=45:12></a> Some of those at Corinth were on sectarian ground; although they were actually all coming

		I think it would be pretty generally admitted by all christians that we are not in a very bright spiritual state.<a name=152:6></a> I am sure most of the believers in this city would admit that they are not so bright in soul as they might be, or would, perhaps, like to be.<a name=152:7></a> We do not know much about being filled with all joy and peace in believing, and abounding in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=152:8></a> This being so, a question of great importance arises.<a name=152:9></a> How can we be lifted up from our low state?<a name=152:10></a> This epistle, in great measure, supplies the answer.<a name=152:11></a>

		In the first place the apostle brings before us our holy dignity.<a name=153:3></a> Believers were then, and are now, "the assembly of God"; they were then, and are now, "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints".<a name=153:4></a> Thus we have great and holy dignity.<a name=153:5></a> If the thought of this got hold of us we could not possibly come down to the miserable things of the world which so often attract us.<a name=153:6></a> When a christian is carnal and worldly he has lost sight of his holy dignity as a saint.<a name=153:7></a>

		If we turn to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:7">Acts  15:7</a> - 9, 13, 14 we see three things.<a name=153:12></a> First, the belief of the gospel; Peter says, "God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe".<a name=153:13></a> Second, the gift of the Spirit; "the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit as to us also".<a name=153:14></a> Third, those who believed, and received the Spirit, were taken out from the gentiles for God's name (verse 14).<a name=153:15></a>

		Until a person has believed the gospel and received the Spirit he is not really a christian.<a name=153:16></a> There are many pious and God-fearing people who have not really believed the word of the gospel.<a name=153:17></a> Cornelius was a very pious man, and I suppose, a believer in Jesus before Peter went to him.<a name=153:18></a> He was addressed as knowing the word "which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:36">Acts  10:36</a>.<a name=153:19></a> But he had not heard the word of the gospel until

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of the gospel proclaims a risen Saviour, and remission of sins through faith in Him.<a name=154:3></a> It presents a blessed Man who was in death and under judgment, but now for ever out of both in resurrection.<a name=154:4></a> Peter spoke to Cornelius and his friends of a risen and glorified Saviour, and told them that "every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins".<a name=154:5></a> They all believed and immediately received the gift of the Spirit.<a name=154:6></a> Christian blessing is all connected with Christ risen and glorified.<a name=154:7></a> A risen Saviour was the great subject of the apostles' testimony all through the Acts.<a name=154:8></a> If Christ is risen and glorified the whole work of redemption is finished, and every foe laid low.<a name=154:9></a> He has come forth triumphant  --  raised for our justification.<a name=154:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It must be evident that to be of God's assembly necessitates a very high degree of sanctification.<a name=155:9></a> We could not be of any assembly of dignity in the world without having qualifications suitable to that assembly.<a name=155:10></a> We could not be of the Privy Council or the House of Lords without suitable qualifications.<a name=155:11></a> Now the qualification for the assembly of God is sanctification.<a name=155:12></a> Nothing else would suit God; He is holy, and He has called us in sanctification (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:7">1 Thessalonians  4:7</a>).<a name=155:13></a> All believers are "sanctified in Christ Jesus".<a name=155:14></a> If we think of qualification for a human assembly, a man must have certain rank in order to be of the House of Lords, and there are two ways in which he may get it  --  by inheritance or by gift.<a name=155:15></a> Now it is quite certain that none of us have inherited sanctification in a natural way.<a name=155:16></a> We inherited sin and defilement (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51:5">Psalm  51:5</a>).<a name=155:17></a> The king, by the exercise of his royal prerogative, can make a man a peer who has not inherited any title.<a name=155:18></a> He can confer the honour as a gift.<a name=155:19></a> It is on that principle that we obtain sanctification; by God's infinite grace we are "sanctified in Christ Jesus".<a name=155:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me try to put it simply.<a name=156:6></a> Suppose God takes account of me, what would He have to record in His book?<a name=156:7></a> Many sins, a polluted nature, and, to conclude, the sentence of death recorded against me.<a name=156:8></a> Would there be nothing else?<a name=156:9></a> No good works, no redeeming features, not one item on the credit side of my account?<a name=156:10></a> No, not one.<a name=156:11></a> God could not take account of anything else in me but these three things.<a name=156:12></a> But if Christ Jesus came into the world in love to bear my sins, and to be made sin sacrificially on my behalf, and to die for me  --  and He did all this by the grace of God  --  what is there left for God to take account of in regard to me?<a name=156:13></a> The three things which comprised everything in me of which God could take account are all disposed of and blotted out of His book.<a name=156:14></a> If you ask how I stand with God according to His grace, the answer is that God does not take any account of me.<a name=156:15></a> All that belonged to me was taken account of and ended at the cross.<a name=156:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are some parts of Scripture that are attractive to the hearts of all believers because they present the grace of God or the Person and love of Christ in a special way.<a name=162:1></a> It is always a joy to the servants of the Lord to speak on such scriptures.<a name=162:2></a> The verses I have read can hardly be said to have this attractive character, but they are nevertheless deeply important.<a name=162:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If that which is of God is to be built up in the souls of His people it is often necessary to pull down things which are contrary to God in order to make way for what is spiritual.<a name=162:4></a> The ground has to be cleared.<a name=162:5></a> If we do not get on spiritually it is because there is some hindrance at work; a scripture like this calls our attention to the hindrances that we may judge them and get rid of them.<a name=162:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle reverts to the history of the children of Israel to point out the solemn possibility of there being a great contrast between the dispensation of God and the condition of those who are brought into the benefits of that dispensation.<a name=162:7></a> Christianity is, on God's part, the most wonderful dispensation of blessing ever brought near to men and it subsists here in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=162:8></a> Everyone who has acknowledged Jesus as Lord and come into the christian profession has come within the circle of that dispensation.<a name=162:9></a> The apostle is pointing out that it is possible to be externally in a great system of blessing, and yet, as to our condition, to be displeasing to God.<a name=162:10></a> It is very solemn to think of this.<a name=162:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Five features of God's dispensation are mentioned, and then five characteristics of the condition of the people are alluded to by way of contrast.<a name=163:1></a> The condition of the people was entirely out of harmony with the dispensation of God in the outward benefits of which they were found.<a name=163:2></a> This drew down judgment upon them: "they were strewed in the desert".<a name=163:3></a> We are told that "all these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come".<a name=163:4></a> This is very solemn and instructive.<a name=163:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us first look a little in detail at what I have spoken of  --  for want of a better word  --  as the dispensation of God.<a name=163:6></a> I mean by this the way by which God had made Himself known to the people, and in which He had acted for their blessing.<a name=163:7></a> Certain things were true on God's side; He acted on His part in the fulness of grace, and all the people came, in an outward way, into the benefit of His attitude towards His people.<a name=163:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, "all our fathers were under the cloud".<a name=163:9></a> It is very striking that this should be the first statement.<a name=163:10></a> Paul does not begin by saying that they were under the blood, but "under the cloud".<a name=163:11></a> He begins at the point when Israel first learned that God was for them.<a name=163:12></a> God would not only provide a shelter from deserved judgment, but in presence of all the power of the enemy He would cover them with the cloud of His power and love.<a name=163:13></a> God was for His people, let them be what they were.<a name=163:14></a> In His love and in His pity He redeemed them to make Himself an everlasting and glorious Name.<a name=163:15></a> In His everlasting love He overshadowed the people with the cloud of His presence.<a name=163:16></a> He knew what they were and what they would prove themselves to be, but He also knew His own thoughts concerning them, and, regarding them according to those thoughts and on the ground of the blood of the Lamb, He overshadowed them with the cloud of His glory.<a name=163:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we want to know God's thoughts concerning His people we may learn them in the words of Balaam at a later date in Israel's history: "He hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.<a name=164:1></a> He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#23:20">Numbers  23:20</a>, 21.<a name=164:2></a> It is good thus to see the disposition of God's heart towards His people.<a name=164:3></a> He is for them in the most absolute way; they are under the guardian cloud of His power and love.<a name=164:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, we read that they "all passed through the sea".<a name=164:5></a> They passed through that which was typical of the death of Christ on to entirely new ground before God.<a name=164:6></a> It is by redemption that God secures His people for Himself.<a name=164:7></a> He takes them up, not according to what the flesh is, but according to the value of the death of Christ, according to the efficacy of that in which the flesh has been judged and ended before God.<a name=164:8></a> And if God takes up His people on that ground it becomes a necessity that they should by faith occupy that ground before Him.<a name=164:9></a> Hence we read, "By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:29">Hebrews  11:29</a>.<a name=164:10></a> Death is the place where man has no footing, but in the death of Christ God has turned the sea into dry land, so that there is solid ground on which we may walk by faith into an entirely new place with God where Christ risen is known as our righteousness.<a name=164:11></a> The gospel of the grace of God makes known the blessed fact that the believer is justified before God and that Christ is his righteousness.<a name=164:12></a> This is the simple and blessed truth of christianity.<a name=164:13></a> It is the mind of God concerning those who believe.<a name=164:14></a> So the apostle could say to the Corinthians, "But ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:11">1 Corinthians  6:11</a>.<a name=164:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third, "All were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=165>[Page 165]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in the sea".<a name=165:1></a> With an evident allusion to christian baptism the apostle speaks thus.<a name=165:2></a> Outwardly, and in the most significant way, the people were committed to the control and leadership of Moses.<a name=165:3></a> They were identified with him in the most singular and impressive way.<a name=165:4></a> The christian is baptised unto Christ; he is identified with Christ in the mind of God, and in baptism he is identified with the name and lordship of Christ in this world.<a name=165:5></a> He may not be true to his baptism; he may fail to realise what is involved in it, but that is the character of it.<a name=165:6></a> Every baptised person is on the ground of obedience to Christ as Lord.<a name=165:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourth, "All ate the same spiritual food".<a name=165:8></a> The reference here is undoubtedly to the manna, and it seems probable that the Lord's supper is in the mind of the Spirit who is seeking to show that there might be outward participation in things which expressed the favour of God to His people without any real answer to His pleasure.<a name=165:9></a> The Lord's supper is surely a very great expression of divine favour, but the fact that we partake of it is no guarantee that we really answer to His pleasure.<a name=165:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifth, "All drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them: (now the rock was the Christ;)".<a name=165:11></a> All participated in the favours which God was dispensing to His people, but the Holy Spirit calls our attention to this to point out that there was no pleasure for God in most of those who did thus participate in His mercy and favour.<a name=165:12></a> "Yet God was not pleased with the most of them, for they were strewed in the desert".<a name=165:13></a> Intensely solemn words!<a name=165:14></a> They are words not to be neglected by us, for we are expressly told that "these things happened as types of us, that we should not be lusters .<a name=165:15></a>.<a name=165:16></a>.<a name=165:17></a>".<a name=165:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The manifestations of divine grace in christianity are wonderful.<a name=165:19></a> There is no poverty, no lack of blessing.<a name=165:20></a> In a coming day God will give effect in power and glory to His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		own thoughts about His people, and it is a comfort to think of this in presence of all the failures of today.<a name=166:1></a> But the great thing is that the thoughts of God should lay hold of our souls now.<a name=166:2></a> If His grace and purpose dwell in our hearts they will necessarily displace what is of the flesh.<a name=166:3></a> If what is of God comes into our hearts it must displace the flesh and the world.<a name=166:4></a> But the solemn thing is that we may be in the circle where all God's favour and blessing is made known without our being morally affected and formed by it.<a name=166:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God does not call upon us to originate anything; what He looks for is response.<a name=166:6></a> There is nothing good in man save that which responds to God, the outcome of His own grace in man.<a name=166:7></a> God rolls down a full tide of blessing on His people and He looks for response.<a name=166:8></a> If there is no response to God there is no life.<a name=166:9></a> It shows that people are identified in their affections with the world and the flesh rather than with the thoughts of God.<a name=166:10></a> We are either identified in heart with what is of God, or with what is under God's judgment.<a name=166:11></a> The people who identified themselves with the flesh "were strewed in the desert".<a name=166:12></a> Many of the Corinthian assembly were not really responding to God, and many among them were falling in the wilderness: "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a>.<a name=166:13></a> Flesh was in activity and it was being dealt with in judgment by the Lord.<a name=166:14></a> In this matter it is impossible to maintain neutrality.<a name=166:15></a> If we do not respond to God we most surely respond to the flesh and the world.<a name=166:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In sad and painful contrast with all the privileges of the people was their practical condition.<a name=166:17></a> The apostle brings forward five characteristics of that condition.<a name=166:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, "That we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted".<a name=166:19></a> I conceive that the reference intended here is to what we find recorded in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11">Numbers  11</a>.<a name=166:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=167>[Page 167]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people had been more than a year in the wilderness: more than a year they had experienced God's gracious ways with them.<a name=167:1></a> At the end of this time we find them first complaining and then lusting.<a name=167:2></a> I have observed that a complaining spirit is the sure precursor of further evil.<a name=167:3></a> A satisfied heart would not be likely to turn towards Egypt.<a name=167:4></a> And solemn indeed is the cause of their complaint: "There is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:6">Numbers  11:6</a>.<a name=167:5></a> Alas, alas!<a name=167:6></a> when the perfect grace of Christ, seen in perfection in the steps of His blessed pathway of humiliation here and now ministered by Him from glory to His own in wilderness circumstances here, becomes distasteful to the heart and mind of the believer!<a name=167:7></a> It is not exactly discontent with circumstances here, but distaste for what comes from heaves.<a name=167:8></a>.<a name=167:9></a> It is but a short journey from this point to lusting after evil things, the things of Egypt, the fish, cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.<a name=167:10></a> It has often been remarked that these things were the food of slaves in Egypt.<a name=167:11></a> They typify the things which appeal to the taste and appetite of the flesh.<a name=167:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are things in the world which are most gratifying to the flesh, and there is always danger of the taste for them being revived.<a name=167:13></a> As it has been remarked, the reminiscences of Egypt are a fruitful source of danger.<a name=167:14></a> And a very solemn thing in connection with this is that, as a rule, God allows us to have what we lust after.<a name=167:15></a> Eve, Lot, Achan, David and many others bear witness to the general truth of this, and it is plainly stated in the words of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106:15">Psalm  106:15</a> "He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul".<a name=167:16></a> God does not restrain His people in an arbitrary way, as a general principle, for we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:15">Hebrews  11:15</a>, "If they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned".<a name=167:17></a> If we sow to the flesh we shall surely of the flesh reap corruption.<a name=167:18></a> "Jehovah smote the people

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, "Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play".<a name=168:3></a> It was in the absence of Moses that this idolatry took place.<a name=168:4></a> It was thus at a moment which is typical of that in which our lot is cast.<a name=168:5></a> Christ is on high, and many who profess His name might well say, "We do not know what is become of him", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:1">Exodus  32:1</a>.<a name=168:6></a> How suggestive it is that Aaron, the religious leader of the people, is the one to cause them to err.<a name=168:7></a> It has been thus in the history of christendom.<a name=168:8></a> An unseen Person on high, having His interests maintained by an unseen Person here, would have no hold upon the mind of the flesh.<a name=168:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men have craved something visible, either as an object of worship or as an aid to worship, and their leaders have furnished them with pictures, images, crucifixes, magnificent buildings, music and a sacramental system with a visible priesthood which is well qualified to meet every desire of the religious mind.<a name=168:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Along with all this, licence is given to men to enjoy everything that is in the world.<a name=168:11></a> There is no mourning an absent Christ, no confession of the sad state of the world that has rejected Him, no simple and true confession of His blessed name.<a name=168:12></a> The theatre, the ballroom, the racecourse and all the ten thousand frivolities of modern society are held to be quite consistent with regular attendance at church!<a name=168:13></a> In such cases the actual object of worship is man's lusts and pleasures, and the fact that a certain form of godliness is maintained at the same time in no wise changes the actual character of it in the sight of God.<a name=168:14></a> Such persons are idolaters.<a name=168:15></a> While we see this so conspicuously in christendom let us not forget that the very essence of this idolatry is self-indulgence in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		absence of Christ.<a name=169:1></a> One may travel a long way on that road without going to the extreme lengths of which I have spoken.<a name=169:2></a> It is a serious question for everyone who calls on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as to how far we are living a life of self-indulgence and self-gratification.<a name=169:3></a> It is possible to be doing so in a very quiet and orderly way, and with a line strictly drawn at certain things which we are pleased to designate as worldly.<a name=169:4></a> Yet, withal, it may be true that we get on very comfortably and enjoyably in the world, and as to any practical place that Christ holds in the heart it might be said, "We do not know what is become of him!<a name=169:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no time for self-indulgence, for joining in the merriment of fools.<a name=169:6></a> Woe betide the christian who descends to traffic in the unholy mirth of the ungodly, who sits down to eat and drink the world's fiction and its foolish jests!<a name=169:7></a> It is no time to be frivolous, for amid the almost universal pleasure seeking, a voice sounds clearly out as of old, "Who is on the Lord's side", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:26">Exodus  32:26</a> (Authorised Version) Moses would recognise no neutrality.<a name=169:8></a> He called for pronounced and uncompromising loyalty, loyalty that would be prepared to gird on the sword and to "slay every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbour", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:27">Exodus  32:27</a>.<a name=169:9></a> This is no holiday amusement, no easy-going path of self-indulgence, but it is a divine picture of the path of discipleship today.<a name=169:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to note that it was in connection with this same idolatry that the tent came to be pitched outside the camp.<a name=169:11></a> We are told "it came to pass that every one who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:7">Exodus  33:7</a>.<a name=169:12></a> What follows this is most interesting, for we see, in perfect contrast to the idolatry of the people, Moses admitted to the most intimate nearness to Jehovah.<a name=169:13></a> "Jehovah spoke with

		Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:11">Exodus  33:11</a>.<a name=170:1></a> Encouraged by this favour Moses prays, "And now, if indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, make me now to know thy way, that I may know thee", (verse 13), and then later he says, "Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory", (verse 18).<a name=170:2></a> It was all over with the people on the ground of responsibility, and therefore it became with the man of faith entirely a question of what God was.<a name=170:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is something profoundly interesting in all this; it is lovely in its moral beauty and perfection.<a name=170:4></a> But we must not dwell longer upon it at present or it will take us too far away from our present theme.<a name=170:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third, "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand".<a name=170:6></a> It is very solemn to note that this occurred just at the end of the wilderness, "by the Jordan of Jericho", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#26:3">Numbers  26:3</a>.<a name=170:7></a> It was Satan's last assault upon the people before they crossed the Jordan.<a name=170:8></a> They had had to do with him as the oppressor in Egypt, and as the destroyer (Amalek) in the wilderness, but now they fall into his power as the crafty seducer.<a name=170:9></a> It was by the counsel of Balaam (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#31:16">Numbers  31:16</a>) that they were taken in this snare and it is expressly said by Jehovah, "They have harassed you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#25:18">Numbers  25:18</a>.<a name=170:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many who can endure a great amount of opposition and pursue this way in spite of many difficulties, who fall before the seducing power of the world.<a name=170:11></a> Hence the apostle John in writing to those who were strong and had the word of God abiding in them and had overcome the wicked one, exhorts them to "love not the world".<a name=170:12></a> We might apply to the world the solemn warning of the wise king, "Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths: for she hath cast down many wounded, and all slain by her were strong", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#7:25">Proverbs  7:25</a> - 26.<a name=170:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The world is presented in Scripture as the great rival to God in the affections of His people.<a name=171:1></a> To be a friend of the world is to be an enemy of God.<a name=171:2></a> There is a peculiar power in the world to displace God from the hearts of His people.<a name=171:3></a> It may often seem very fair and attractive, and it often allures by things which seem innocent enough, but there is a terrible power in it to displace God in the hearts of men.<a name=171:4></a> When we see this it helps us to understand the language which is used in connection with that part of Israel's history which is now before us.<a name=171:5></a> Jehovah says of Phinehas, "He was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#25:11">Numbers  25:11</a>.<a name=171:6></a> If on the one hand it is very blessed that God is jealous as to the affections of His people, on the other hand it is intensely solemn.<a name=171:7></a> "Jealousy is cruel as Sheol: The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, Flames of Jah", <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#8:6">Song of Songs  8:6</a>.<a name=171:8></a>

		God cannot tolerate a rival in the affections of His people.<a name=171:9></a> If we admit the world into our hearts we admit something that God will have to burn up some day.<a name=171:10></a> He will assuredly destroy that which loves the world.<a name=171:11></a> I have no doubt the Corinthians had been guilty in large measure of this spiritual fornication.<a name=171:12></a> They were entangled in all kinds of unholy and worldly associations and God was practically destroying the flesh by discipline which had extended in many cases as far as death itself.<a name=171:13></a> "Many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a>.<a name=171:14></a>

		Fourth, "Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents".<a name=172:4></a> It is of interest to note that there were two Meribahs in the wilderness: we read of one in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>, and of the other in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>; that is, one was at the very beginning of the wilderness and the other was at the end.<a name=172:5></a> I think the two are connected in the mind of the Spirit in this verse in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>.<a name=172:6></a> They serve to show that the flesh is the same all through.<a name=172:7></a> Forty years experience of the goodness and mercy of God made not the slightest difference in the disposition of the flesh.<a name=172:8></a> They tempted the Lord at the beginning and they tempted Him at the end.<a name=172:9></a> "Give us water, that we may drink!<a name=172:10></a>" was their cry to Moses in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:2">Exodus  17:2</a>.<a name=172:11></a> "And Moses said to them, Why do ye dispute with me?<a name=172:12></a> Why do ye tempt Jehovah?<a name=172:13></a>" And in verse 7 we read, "He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they had tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?<a name=172:14></a>" (Massah means 'temptation' and Meribah 'contention').<a name=172:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is before me tonight, beloved friends, is to say a little, as the Lord may help me, about the assembly as the place where our souls are edified.<a name=175:1></a> It is a very blessed thing for us to consider that God has provided us with a home in this world.<a name=175:2></a> If we have been brought to know the Lord Jesus as the One who was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification, so that we have peace with God through Him, God would have us to know that there is a place for His saints in this world, and that place is the assembly.<a name=175:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look round us in the religious world we see all kinds of sects and parties, and they all profess to be right, and they all have some scripture to allege as proof that they are right.<a name=175:4></a> But we do not find in Scripture that it was either God's mind that His saints should be isolated individuals or that they should be found in sects of their own choosing.<a name=175:5></a> What we find in Scripture is that God has an assembly; Paul addressed the Corinthians as the church or assembly of God, and all through his epistle he takes it for granted that they would come together in assembly because they loved one another.<a name=175:6></a> Now, beloved friends, we have to recognise the fact that we are called by God's grace to have a place in God's assembly, not in any sect but in God's assembly.<a name=175:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important for us to realise the great dignity of this place.<a name=175:8></a> James says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:14">Acts  15:14</a> that God has "visited to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable that eleven chapters of this epistle pass by before the apostle begins to speak on the subject of spiritual manifestations; that is, before he alludes to those activities of the Spirit in the assembly which work for the edification of the saints.<a name=176:8></a> Now what are these eleven chapters taken up with?<a name=176:9></a> Well, it seems to me that the apostle lays down the lines on which all true edification must come.<a name=176:10></a> If we preach and talk one to another without knowing what we are about, instead of there being edification there will be disorder, and the saints will be diminished instead of enlarged.<a name=176:11></a> The apostle first lays down the lines upon which all true edification must proceed.<a name=176:12></a> Four things come out in the previous eleven chapters; and it is along the lines of these four things that all true edification proceeds.<a name=176:13></a> The first is the grace of God, the second is the faithfulness of God, the third is the

		If you turn to chapter 1, verse 4 he says, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him" and so on.<a name=177:2></a> And in verses 30 and 31, of the same chapter, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption; that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in the Lord".<a name=177:3></a> If we do not understand the grace of God, we shall not have our faces in the right direction for edification.<a name=177:4></a> The apostle gives thanks that the grace of God had been given to the saints in Christ Jesus; in everything they were enriched in Him.<a name=177:5></a> Now that gives the soul an entirely new starting point; God has come out to us according to the grace that is set forth in Christ Jesus.<a name=177:6></a> God has enriched us with the grace that is found embodied in a risen and glorified Man.<a name=177:7></a> That is God's starting point.<a name=177:8></a> Very often we think of everything from our side, and we think of the death of Christ as the climax, but the death of Christ was God's way, not God's end.<a name=177:9></a> He sent His Son into this world  --  "come of woman, come under law"  --  that He might accomplish redemption, that He might bear our sins, that He might come under death and judgment for us, so that He might close up our history as in the flesh by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=177:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then along with the grace of God you get the preaching of the cross.<a name=178:16></a> There are two things the apostle speaks of in the first chapter of this epistle.<a name=178:17></a> He speaks of the preaching of Christ and he speaks of the preaching of the cross.<a name=178:18></a> It is easy to see that God's grace has come to us in that risen, glorified Man, and it is on the ground of the cross in which is set forth the entire rejection of man after

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the second point is the faithfulness of God.<a name=179:8></a> Paul says, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>.<a name=179:9></a> In chapter 10, verse 13 he says, "No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that ye should be able to bear it".<a name=179:10></a> There you get an explicit statement of the faithfulness of God.<a name=179:11></a> It is very wonderful that the apostle should speak of the faithfulness of God to the Corinthians.<a name=179:12></a> They had entirely broken down under the grace of God.<a name=179:13></a> In the light and blessing of God's grace they had proved themselves a complete failure.<a name=179:14></a> The apostle was going to let the light of God shine in upon them, but before he does so he lays it down as the impregnable rock of blessing that God is faithful.<a name=179:15></a> It is an immense thing for us to see this.<a name=179:16></a> I suppose we have all felt more or less how we have failed under the grace of God.<a name=179:17></a> We have been made to feel how very little we have answered to it, how little we have walked here in the joy and power of grace and in the light

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The faithfulness of God is an impregnable rock in the midst of man's breakdown and the confusion of christendom.<a name=180:8></a> We have to turn to God.<a name=180:9></a> What marks the true saint is that he clings to the faithfulness of God.<a name=180:10></a> He is willing to admit his own failure and breakdown and that everything that has been put into man's hand has come to ruin but he clings to this, that God is faithful.<a name=180:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember in 2 Timothy, when the apostle is speaking of all the disorder that has come in, he says, "Yet the firm foundation of God stands".<a name=180:12></a> God is faithful to His own thoughts and purposes; He is faithful to what is in His own mind and He is not going to give up the blessing of His saints; He is not going to be thwarted.<a name=180:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we do not get the comfort of this unless we are walking in holy separation from the world of evil.<a name=180:14></a> God has called us to a holy fellowship.<a name=180:15></a> "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=180:16></a> God is not only faithful to His eternal purposes  --  but that is only one side of it  --  but He is faithful to His eternal principles.<a name=180:17></a> Immediately after it says that "the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his", we read, "Let

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very important point, because we should all like to have the comfort of God's faithfulness.<a name=181:3></a> I do not suppose there is any christian but would like this.<a name=181:4></a> Well, if we want the comfort of God's faithfulness we shall have to act on God's principles.<a name=181:5></a> God has called us to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and if we are true to that fellowship it involves being found in the fellowship of Christ's death.<a name=181:6></a> We get that in chapter 10.<a name=181:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a broad line of separation between the christian company and the world.<a name=181:8></a> There is nothing more pitiful than to see christians creeping as near to the world as they can get.<a name=181:9></a> It has been said that there are many Christians who want as much of the world as they can get with a good conscience.<a name=181:10></a> But if our hearts were right it would not be a question of how near we could get to the world, but how far we could get away from it.<a name=181:11></a> We have to remember that God called us to be a separate people, and the measure of our separation cannot be anything less than this, that Christ has died here.<a name=181:12></a> The cross of Christ has come between the christian and this world.<a name=181:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, are we afraid of the cross and death of Christ?<a name=181:14></a> Do you know that if God puts the cross, the death of Christ, between us and the world, it is not to deprive us of anything that is good, but it is to preserve us from the contamination of the world?<a name=181:15></a> You may depend upon it, beloved young christian, that though the world puts on a pleasant smile for you, and has all kinds of interesting things to put before you, there is great contamination in it, and you cannot touch it without being hindered and damaged.<a name=181:16></a> You do not want what is of man if you are in the light and joy of what is of God.<a name=181:17></a> God has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to the third thing, the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=182:4></a> Let us read chapter 3, verse 16, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=182:5></a> If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye", and in chapter 6, verses 15 - 17 it says, "Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ?<a name=182:6></a> Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make them members of a harlot?<a name=182:7></a> Far be the thought.<a name=182:8></a> Do ye not know that he that is joined to the harlot is one body?<a name=182:9></a> for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.<a name=182:10></a> But he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit".<a name=182:11></a> Now we come to another great fact in christianity.<a name=182:12></a> We not only know God in grace and know Him in faithfulness, but we are the temple of God, because the Spirit of God dwells in us.<a name=182:13></a> Many a man who has the Spirit has never come to the recognition of that great fact.<a name=182:14></a> You will notice how the apostle says three or four times, "Do ye not know?<a name=182:15></a>" He did not mean simply, 'Are you aware of the fact?<a name=182:16></a>' but 'Have you really recognised the fact?<a name=182:17></a>' We all believe that christians have the Spirit; we hold it as part of our creed, but it is a wonderful moment in the history of a soul when he comes to recognise that he has the Spirit.<a name=182:18></a> God's Spirit dwells in us and in that way we become the temple of God collectively, and our bodies become the members of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit.<a name=182:19></a>

		I have often thought about those mighty men of David spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#11:13">1 Chronicles  11:13</a>, 14.<a name=184:5></a> When the Philistines came there was a little piece of a field with some barley in it, and it is recorded that those men stood up against the Philistines and delivered it.<a name=184:6></a> And God said it was a great deliverance  --  a little piece of a barley field!<a name=184:7></a> It was a bit of God's land and they held it for God, and it was a great deliverance.<a name=184:8></a> You have got your little bit of a field  --  that body that is a member of Christ.<a name=184:9></a> It is not your own: you have been bought with a price and you have to hold that bit for Christ.<a name=184:10></a> We have to hold ourselves for Christ and for God in this world.<a name=184:11></a>

		Now there is another thing I want to speak of, and that comes out in chapter 11, verses 23, 24.<a name=184:12></a> "For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me".<a name=184:13></a> I read that scripture because it seems to me that the great thing that comes out in connection with the Lord's supper is divine love.<a name=184:14></a> And I do not know anything that has power to subdue what is of the flesh like divine love.<a name=184:15></a> The Corinthians were going on with the outward act of eating the Lord's supper, but it is very clear that it had ceased to be to them the voice of divine love, so they were not subdued, they were not lowly in heart.<a name=184:16></a> They were eating the Supper in a merely external way, without being really in the presence of divine love.<a name=184:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=185>[Page 185]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is something peculiarly blessed and holy about the Lord's supper.<a name=185:1></a> There are three things expressed in the very fact that we come together to eat the Supper, and the first is that the Lord loves His saints.<a name=185:2></a> The bread and the cup speak of that in which His love has found its most profound and blessed expression; He loves His saints.<a name=185:3></a> And the second thing is that His saints love Him.<a name=185:4></a> The Lord's supper is the most simple thing conceivable; if you look at it from a natural point of view it is a company of people come together to break bread and to drink of the cup; but what makes it so great and blessed is that there is a company here of those who love the One who died.<a name=185:5></a> It is by His death that He has put the seal of His love for ever on our hearts.<a name=185:6></a> And the third thing is that they love one another.<a name=185:7></a> These are the three great things that centre in the Lord's supper.<a name=185:8></a> The Lord loves His saints, and His saints love Him, and they love one another.<a name=185:9></a> It is a circle of love.<a name=185:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not learn divine love by reading about it, or hearing about it, or even by praying about it.<a name=185:11></a> We learn divine love in the circle where it is at home, and when the Lord brings His own together to eat His supper, He binds their hearts to Himself and to one another in the immediate presence of His living love.<a name=185:12></a> It is there we learn divine love.<a name=185:13></a> And the effect is we are subdued, humbled, and profound self-judgment is brought about.<a name=185:14></a> When I think of myself according to the flesh, what am I?<a name=185:15></a> I am Judas, I am the man that is not a bit affected by the love of Christ.<a name=185:16></a> There was a man who did not care a bit about the love of Christ, and the flesh in you and me does not care any more about the love of Christ than Judas did.<a name=185:17></a> He was insensible to the love of Christ.<a name=185:18></a> But if we have been born of God and have been brought into the circle of grace and been taught of God, we become very sensitive to the blessed love of Christ, and He brings us to the

		Supper in order to bring us under the influence of that love.<a name=186:1></a> The effect is that we are formed in the blessed character that is spoken of in chapter 13 of this epistle.<a name=186:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle can speak about spiritual manifestations, and in chapters 12 and 14 he speaks about the action of the Spirit in the assembly by which souls would be edified.<a name=186:3></a> What I wanted to suggest was that the line on which edification proceeds is laid down in the previous part of the epistle.<a name=186:4></a> We have to be built up in the knowledge of God's grace and God's faithfulness.<a name=186:5></a> We have to be brought to recognise the moral consequences of the Spirit of God being here.<a name=186:6></a> We have to be built up in the consciousness of divine love, the love that has been expressed in the death of Christ and is continually brought afresh to our hearts in the Lord's supper.<a name=186:7></a> This is the line of edification, and the result would be that we are all bound together and consider one another in love, just as in the natural body every member serves all the other members in unselfish love.<a name=186:8></a> There is not a single member of your body that has the least bit of selfishness about it.<a name=186:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If danger threatened your head, every other member of the body would come to the rescue without considering its own safety at all.<a name=186:10></a> There is perfect unselfish love in the members of the natural body, and in the same way with the body of Christ.<a name=186:11></a> The saints are bound together in the knowledge of the grace of God and His faithfulness, and in all that subsists here in the power of the Spirit and in the knowledge of divine love.<a name=186:12></a> If God's people were bound together in the knowledge of these things they would be delivered from the miserable selfishness that belongs to the flesh.<a name=186:13></a> Paul could tell the Corinthians that they were the body of Christ.<a name=186:14></a> Well then, if that is the case let it be manifested.<a name=186:15></a> The result would be that the whole body bound together would be nourished, ministered to, and would edify itself in love.<a name=186:16></a>

		God has furnished us with a circle where we can find edification.<a name=187:1></a> I would like the youngest believer here to remember that God has called us to have a place in His assembly, and in God's assembly the things that are prominent are all of God.<a name=187:2></a> Everything that is prominent in God's assembly must be of God  --  His grace, His faithfulness, His love.<a name=187:3></a> We may get into this circle as very little babes, knowing very little about either God's grace, or His faithfulness, or His love.<a name=187:4></a> But we come there to grow and every influence that we find in God's assembly helps us to understand better His grace, His faithfulness and His love.<a name=187:5></a> God's assembly has not been taken away from this earth and every influence in that assembly tends to help and edify.<a name=187:6></a> There are distinctions of gifts, of services and of operations (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:4">1 Corinthians  12:4</a> - 6), but everything that is in God's assembly tends to make His grace and His faithfulness and His love greater realities to our hearts.<a name=187:7></a> Thus we are built up in the knowledge of God, we serve one another in unselfish love, and in that way the body edifies itself.<a name=187:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=197:1></a>C.<a name=197:2></a> It is evident that the gift of the Spirit is so great and viewed in Scripture in so many ways that the difficulty is to compass it at all.<a name=197:3></a> It must be so when a divine Person comes in and is pleased to take a place on man's side, indeed to dwell in men.<a name=197:4></a> The very fact that it is so shows what an entirely new footing everything stands on for God: we must begin with that, that everything stands for God on the footing of Christ, of His death, His resurrection and ascension.<a name=197:5></a> I think if we see that everything is on that new footing for God we shall begin to understand the possibility of the Spirit being given.<a name=197:6></a> I do not know if anyone could understand the possibility of it apart from those great realities.<a name=197:7></a>

		All the promises subsist in the Son of God; there is no yea and nay, no uncertainty, nothing in a provisional way; it is all yea in Him.<a name=198:3></a> If you think of man after the flesh, the first man, he was always nay; he was the negation of everything in the will of God.<a name=198:4></a> If you look at him in innocence, he was corruptible; if you see him fallen, every kind of evil has place with him; if you see him under government, under the promises, under the law, in the presence of the divine testimony of the prophets, in the presence of Christ, and in the presence of the Holy Spirit, he is a negation.<a name=198:5></a> Now you turn to another Man  --  all this is presented in the gospel, it is not advanced truth  --  God has established everything for His own pleasure in Christ.<a name=198:6></a> If you have faith in that Man who is risen, ascended and glorified in heaven, you receive the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Spirit.<a name=198:7></a> If people have not faith in Christ risen and glorified how can they receive the Spirit?<a name=198:8></a> He is preached in order that men may be transferred in faith and affection from Adam to Christ; then God gives the Spirit.<a name=198:9></a> The Spirit is given in relation to all that God has brought in and established for Himself in a risen and glorified Man; there is no other footing on which the Spirit could be given.<a name=198:10></a> Therefore the faith that secures the Spirit is faith in a risen and glorified Man.<a name=198:11></a>

		All this exercise goes on down here in the one who has been conscious of being caught up to paradise as "a man in Christ".<a name=388:3></a> If, on the one hand, we touch the infinite privilege of "a man in Christ", we must be prepared, on the other, for the discipline of God which brings death in upon what we are naturally, so that we may prove the grace of the Lord, and learn how divine power is perfected in human weakness here.<a name=388:4></a> A servant of the Lord now with Christ used to say that the angels excel in strength but that saints excel in weakness.<a name=388:5></a> It was so with Paul.<a name=388:6></a> He gloried in his weakness that the power of Christ might tabernacle on him.<a name=388:7></a> Many christians are too strong to learn what this means.<a name=388:8></a> Will and energy are the great things in the world, and a great many think that what is effective in the world can be effective in the things of God.<a name=388:9></a> But it is not so.<a name=388:10></a> Divine power does not work along with human power.<a name=388:11></a> Human power has to be set aside that divine power may be perfected in human weakness.<a name=388:12></a> Many a man is no good in the service of God because he is too strong.<a name=388:13></a> If we pray for more divine power it is most likely God will answer by causing us to experience our own utter weakness and nothingness as never before.<a name=388:14></a> This is humbling to us, but it is God's blessed and holy way of preparing vessels for His mighty power.<a name=388:15></a> The power of man must be set aside if the power of God is to come in.<a name=388:16></a>
