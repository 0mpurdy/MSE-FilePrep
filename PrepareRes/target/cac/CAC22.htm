	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The letters of our beloved departed brother, Charles Andrew Coates, were in his lifetime a source of comfort, help and instruction to many, and it has been thought that the publication of a selected number would be for general edification.<a name=1:1></a> Our brother's active service was for many years much restricted through bodily weakness, and this contributed, under the Lord's hand, to the development of those choice spiritual feelings which are so evident in his correspondence.<a name=1:2></a> His mind was remarkably formed by the teaching of the Holy Scriptures, and all that he wrote was the result of prayerful consideration.<a name=1:3></a> Hence the combination of unswerving faithfulness to the Lord with true humility and gracious sympathy in the spiritual experiences of others.<a name=1:4></a> Above all else, the reader cannot fail to remark in these pages our beloved brother's deep appreciation of the Person of Christ, and his wholehearted devotedness to His interests on earth, centring in "His body, which is the assembly".<a name=1:5></a> No matter affecting the Lord or His saints was regarded as too trivial for his interest and prayers, and the smallest service done for His Name and glory found recognition and appreciation.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may well desire that these features may be more developed with us all, and that the One from whom they can alone be derived may have a greater place in our hearts.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the custom of our beloved brother from an early date to preserve copies of his more important letters and these form the foundation of the present volume.<a name=1:8></a> In addition many letters have been made available by the recipients and are included.<a name=1:9></a> Thanks are due to all who have contributed thus, and in other ways, to this service.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Scripture quotations are in general from the translation by J.<a name=1:11></a> N.<a name=1:12></a> Darby, which our brother habitually used.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The letters have been printed in chronological order, except where the dates are not known; the undated letters, including some previously published in booklet form, are grouped at the end of the volume.<a name=1:14></a> Indexes have been added as to the general subject matter of the letters, and the scriptures to which special reference is made therein.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be of interest to mention that the writer of these letters was born at Bradford on the 7th December, 1862, and departed to be "with Christ" at Teignmouth on the 7th October, 1945.<a name=1:16></a><br>W.<a name=1:17></a>M.<a name=1:18></a>B.<a name=1:19></a><br>1878.<a name=1:20></a>

		... As to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:26">Luke  9:26</a>, it is a word for the conscience and is meant to have a solemn force for all who hear it -- whether saved or unsaved.<a name=1:26></a> Nothing is more evil than the practice, which is very prevalent, of turning aside the point of such passages by supposing that they refer only to unsaved ones.<a name=1:27></a> Some were quite surprised when I said at -- the other day that "How shall <i>we</i> escape if we neglect so great salvation?<a name=1:28></a>" had a solemn and searching application to each one of us, for we all need to "give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip".<a name=1:29></a> It is a very evil thing to set one scripture against another, and to use one to weaken the force of another.<a name=1:30></a> Each scripture is needed, and while we must be careful that the scriptures which touch our responsibilities do not weaken our sense of grace, we must not allow the thought that because of grace there is no such thing as responsibility.<a name=1:31></a>

		MY DEAR SISTER IN CHRIST, -- I have just returned from a few days in the north of Lancashire, and found your letter.<a name=1:33></a> I am sorry -- very sorry -- to hear of the many trials through which you have had to pass, but I count it a privilege to be able to pray for you.<a name=1:34></a> The present time is a time of <i>suffering</i> for all Christians.<a name=1:35></a> Some appear to have to pass through more painful experiences than others, but all have to suffer.<a name=1:36></a> And is it not sweet to know that we suffer <i>with Christ</i>, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a>.<a name=1:37></a> We are taken into partnership with Christ both in His sufferings and His glory.<a name=1:38></a> <i>He</i> suffered, and was the Man of sorrows when in this world -- so full of sin and its effects.<a name=1:39></a> So long as we are here <i>we</i> must suffer too, but how sweetly does the apostle say, "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us".<a name=1:40></a> Then again Peter says, "Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.<a name=1:41></a> If ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye, for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:13">1 Peter  4:13</a>, 14.<a name=1:42></a> The same apostle

		also tells us that "when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:20">1 Peter  2:20</a>.<a name=2:1></a> So that we have a certain joy and a peculiar and blessed sense of the Lord's love and approval when we are suffering for His Name's sake which we do not have at other times.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your question about Mary anointing the Lord in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14">Mark  14</a>, I think she thought Him worthy of her all, and she had an instinctive sense that He was going out of the world, and she therefore took the opportunity of expressing how she counted Him worthy of everything.<a name=2:3></a> The ointment was costly -- she had done what she could -- she had given her all to Him.<a name=2:4></a> The disciples murmured at her, but the Lord approved and appreciated her devotion.<a name=2:5></a> They were thinking of the <i>poor</i> -- she was thinking only of <i>Him</i>.<a name=2:6></a> What a pattern for us!<a name=2:7></a> It should teach us to think less of the opinions of others, and more of the blessed Lord Himself, that we may be also found doing the very things that will give His heart pleasure.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take courage, dear sister, and trust in the Lord at all times!<a name=2:9></a> Make Him your refuge and strength and in all things you shall be more than conqueror through Him who loves you.<a name=2:10></a>

		<i>The Soul's Awakening</i>.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great turning point in the history of a soul is when it becomes consciously an object of divine love, Mercy and goodness are often apprehended long before there is any true knowledge of love.<a name=3:2></a> The perfectness of redemption may be known with clearness and certainty, and all the common difficulties and exercises of a convicted sinner may find such an answer that the conscience is in peace, and yet the heart may not have found its perfect rest in divine love.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well when our hearts learn to put things in this order -- "who <i>loved me</i>, and <i>gave himself</i> for me".<a name=3:4></a> Many know Christ as an infinite Benefactor, and are deeply grateful to Him for what He has done, without having realised that all has been the outflow of His measureless and everlasting love.<a name=3:5></a> In such cases there is no true response to His heart, and He looks in vain for the answering affection which the knowledge of His love would kindle.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The soul's awakening is a wonderful epoch in its history, and by this I mean not conversion or peace, but the first consciousness of being loved by the Son of God.<a name=3:7></a> The effect is indescribable.<a name=3:8></a> To know Him in the greatness of His Person in the brightness of the Father's throne -- supreme in heavenly glory -- and to know that there is a living eternal link of inconceivable love between Him and me!<a name=3:9></a> Such knowledge as this revolutionises the affections; throws the dim and worthless, though often cherished, idols of the earth into the shade to which they properly belong; and makes heaven supremely attractive because of the One who is there!<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this does not come all at once.<a name=3:11></a> It seems to me there are three distinct steps in the appreciation of His love.<a name=3:12></a> First, I learn that He loves me so much that He has saved me.<a name=3:13></a> I survey all His grace to me as a vile sinner -- I consider His amazing work -- my soul explores the vast range of its blessing and I see it all as the outflow of His personal love.<a name=3:14></a> This kindles the heart, and sets it all aglow with responsive affection.<a name=3:15></a> "My Beloved is mine" becomes the rapturous utterance of the soul.<a name=3:16></a> His love thrills the heart which is filled to overflowing with a sense of what it has got in Him.<a name=3:17></a> The thought of having <i>Him</i> is uppermost.<a name=3:18></a> He is the soul's treasure, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is the heart's delight to think of Him in His all-varied excellence and beauty.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If this apprehension of His love is maintained in power it speedily leads to what I call the second step of affection.<a name=4:2></a> That is, the consciousness that He loves me so much that He has a right to me.<a name=4:3></a> All believers will admit this, but it is another thing to reach it in affection.<a name=4:4></a> I may acknowledge the right of the Lord Jesus to command me -- he would be a strange Christian who would not -- but this does not bring in any power if I do not reach it in affection.<a name=4:5></a> His lordship is not a measure of duty or responsibility alone; it is a claim acquired by love and gladly rendered by love.<a name=4:6></a> To use again the language of the song, Jesus is owned as Lord when the heart says: "I am my Beloved's".<a name=4:7></a> I belong to Him, He has a right to me; and this not merely because of the righteous claim which redemption has given Him, but because of the love of His heart.<a name=4:8></a> He has paid the full price, but the love that paid is greater than the price.<a name=4:9></a> He loved me; He would have me for Himself.<a name=4:10></a> When this love is known it produces true devotedness, and maintains the heart in pure and holy liberty.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the foregoing steps were taken a third would be quickly reached -- the consciousness that He loves me so much that He wants my company.<a name=4:12></a> "His desire is towards me".<a name=4:13></a> Love's delight is found in the company of its object.<a name=4:14></a> It is to secure this that He acts as our Priest -- lifting us above the pressure here that we may join Him in the sanctuary.<a name=4:15></a> For this He washes our feet to free us from the influences of the present scene around us so that we may have part with Him who has gone to the Father.<a name=4:16></a> To this end He is presented to us by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures and in all true ministry, that our hearts may be drawn away from the place where He is not to the scene of His exaltation and glory.<a name=4:17></a> He wants our company.<a name=4:18></a> His love delights to share with us the joys of that blessed world -- to make us familiar with the Father's house even now -- in a word, to have us near Himself.<a name=4:19></a> May we know in a deeper way, and in fuller measure, the sweetness of personal intimacy with "the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me".<a name=4:20></a>

		... I am sure that you will be glad to have news of beloved J.<a name=5:1></a>B.<a name=5:2></a>S.<a name=5:3></a> I found him sitting up in his chair near to the window, and with the exception that he is a little thinner than he was and has a white beard there is no change in his appearance.<a name=5:4></a> His colour is as fresh as ever, and his eye as bright as in other days.<a name=5:5></a> He seemed pleased to see me, and spoke with great animation -- so much so that I felt I must make my visit short lest he should exhaust himself.<a name=5:6></a> He asked after many brethren in the West Riding by name, and said: "Tell me now, who is there who is really set to go on with the Lord?<a name=5:7></a>" He said it was his great joy when he was awake at nights to think of those in the different meetings who were "going on", and to pray for them.<a name=5:8></a> He had just been writing a message to the -- meeting, and what he said to me was very much on the same line, so I send you an extract from the message that you may have it in his own words:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"I have only one suggestion to make to you, and that is, that you not only follow Him in heart adoringly for His wonderful service and interest in you down here, but that each of you study to know something of beholding His glory.<a name=5:9></a> Not so much what you say to Him as what He is to you.<a name=5:10></a> Not so much your prayers, as the sense of being lost in the blessedness of being near Him outside this world, and this you will find will have a greater effect on you than even His hearing your prayers".<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives the substance of what was on his mind in speaking to me, and I was most thankful to have such a word from him probably the last I shall ever hear from his lips.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He seemed very glad to hear that his present papers were being so widely read.<a name=5:13></a> He seems to have really left everything behind but the interests of Christ, and to be living entirely in that blessed circle to which he has so often directed the thoughts of our hearts.<a name=5:14></a> He spoke most affectionately of the brethren, and his last words to me were: "Give my love to all the brethren", and then with much emotion he added "The Lord knows how I love them".<a name=5:15></a>

		... It is an immense thing to see how we are "alive to God".<a name=6:1></a> I think a great many are <i>trying</i> to live to God, That is, they want to reach it in their responsible life, instead of seeing that it is "in Christ Jesus".<a name=6:2></a> I believe that many conceive of living to God as being in their responsible life down here; that is, they think that it is in a life of practical righteousness and holiness that they are to live to God.<a name=6:3></a> The "<i>likewise</i>" is forgotten or not understood.<a name=6:4></a> Christ has died unto sin, and lives unto God.<a name=6:5></a> He lives not only personally free from sin (He was ever this), but He is outside the whole range of sin.<a name=6:6></a> He lives unto God in scenes where sin can never come, and where all things are of God.<a name=6:7></a> His death is <i>my title</i> to live to God in the same sphere.<a name=6:8></a> Such is the grace of God that I may appropriate Christ's death, and count that I have died to sin.<a name=6:9></a> It is only thus that I could reach "alive to God in Christ Jesus".<a name=6:10></a> Dead to sin is not the terminus -- it is the station en route -- the terminus is "alive to God <i>in Christ Jesus</i>".<a name=6:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I could not live in sin -- that is, in the life of Adam -- and live to God in Christ Jesus at the same time.<a name=6:12></a> I must have died to sin by the appropriation of Christ's death, in order to be alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=6:13></a> "Dead to sin" is not that I abstain from sinning, but I quit the life of Adam altogether by the appropriation of Christ's death, and count myself alive to God <i>in Christ Jesus</i>.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of this is that in my responsible life I yield myself to God, and my members as instruments of righteousness to God.<a name=6:15></a> It is because I know what it is to be "alive unto God" that I can do this.<a name=6:16></a> A good many are reversing the process.<a name=6:17></a> They are trying to live to God by putting the responsible life right.<a name=6:18></a> What a blessed thing it is to be under grace!<a name=6:19></a>

		MY DEAR Miss --, -- .<a name=8:1></a>.<a name=8:2></a>.<a name=8:3></a> Our time at Ilkley was good for us physically, and I think somewhat profitable also in a spiritual way .<a name=8:4></a>.<a name=8:5></a>.<a name=8:6></a> For some weeks we had readings every morning at the Room from 10 to 11:15.<a name=8:7></a> We began with Colossians and these were very good readings and, in my judgment, superior to what followed.<a name=8:8></a> I think the Lord gave us help as to the Christian circle, and what is connected therewith, and much came out that was edifying as to Christ as <i>Head</i>.<a name=8:9></a> When we had got through Colossians it was proposed that we should have one or two readings to note the characteristic differences between Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=8:10></a> These were good, but no very special unfolding of the mind of God, at least, so I thought.<a name=8:11></a> Then we had two readings on priesthood which were profitable; followed by some on John's gospel in which I thought we got very little of what there was for us.<a name=8:12></a> I think perhaps the Lord saw that we had already had as much as we could digest, and it was probably His mind that we should chew the cud rather than feed any more.<a name=8:13></a> Then in the evenings we had readings or addresses every evening either at Ilkley, Burley, Otley or Bradford, so that it was quite a day of visitation for that district.<a name=8:14></a> As far as I was concerned it was chiefly a time of rest.<a name=8:15></a> I preached on the Lord's days, I believe twice at Ilkley, three times at Bradford, once at Otley, and once at Halifax; and gave two or three addresses each at Ilkley, Bradford and Halifax.<a name=8:16></a> It was quite a treat to me to hear the ministry of others .<a name=8:17></a>.<a name=8:18></a>.<a name=8:19></a>

		It is most lamentable how this precious scripture has been <i>claimed</i> as the exclusive property of certain companies of saints, and often the <i>claim</i> has been loudest where the moral conditions which might have justified it have been most lacking.<a name=16:8></a> No spiritual mind would dare to emulate this unholy assumption.<a name=16:9></a> To claim the sanction and support of the Lord's presence if we have it not is the worst form of Laodiceanism.<a name=16:10></a> It is a poor thing to claim something of which we cannot display the moral evidence.<a name=16:11></a> The evidence of the Lord's presence would be that the saints would be preserved from evil and worldly principles, and on the other hand there would be the ministry of the mind of God -- of divine light -- so that the truth and power of Christianity according to God would be increasingly known amongst the saints.<a name=16:12></a> I should claim nothing, but I would assert most boldly -- 'Here in Scripture is the pledge of the Lord's presence in the way of most blessed support to those who are gathered in His interests here, and the realisation of this is what I am set for, and I am thankful to know a few others who are also set for it'.<a name=16:13></a> It is no business of mine to say that others have not the Lord's presence.<a name=16:14></a> I cannot venture upon such ground as this.<a name=16:15></a> If they are set for His interests they will have His presence, and the moral effect of it will manifest itself in the maintenance of what is of Himself.<a name=16:16></a>

		It may be said that many in the sects are as much set for the Lord's interests as are any of those in fellowship.<a name=17:2></a> That there is much devotedness and energy in service amongst many of these dear Christians may be most thankfully admitted, but it would be difficult to find amongst them any true and spiritual idea of the church according to the mind of God which is the great interest of Christ at the present moment.<a name=17:3></a> The fact is they have not sufficiently companied with Him; they have not spent their three and a half years, so to speak, under His shadow, so as to learn His thoughts and the true nature of His interests.<a name=17:4></a> They are eager to do what they believe is for His glory and for the promotion of His cause, but often without having been inside with Him to learn His pleasure.<a name=17:5></a> If we speak thus it is with the lowly remembrance that only by God's sovereign grace have any of us been different.<a name=17:6></a> It was by that sovereignty that the truth concerning Christ and the church was restored to saints on earth in the early part of this century, and it is by the same sovereignty that any of us have been brought into touch with it, or have had our hearts awakened in any small measure to know its blessedness and greatness.<a name=17:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be said that there are many in fellowship with little or no idea of Christ's interests in the sense in which I am speaking.<a name=17:8></a> This is true, but it does not alter the fact that they partake of the benefits of a circle of fellowship which has been formed by the truth, and according to the truth -- a fellowship which has resulted from the testimony of the Lord being made known in these last days.<a name=17:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To get, a true idea of the whole matter one must take a general survey of what has happened.<a name=17:10></a> It is now over seventy years ago that the Lord was graciously pleased to make known to beloved J.<a name=17:11></a>N.<a name=17:12></a>D.<a name=17:13></a> the true nature of His interests here, and the paper on "The nature and unity of the church of Christ" appeared.<a name=17:14></a> Several hearts were at once arrested and attracted by the truth -- doubtless prepared of the Lord to receive that which He was imparting through His honoured servant.<a name=17:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time, or very soon after, it was realised that the breaking of bread was expressive of the true fellowship of the church, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a> assured several hearts that if they were in the current of the Lord's thoughts and interests they

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		might count upon His presence and support even if they ventured to break away from everything which had the countenance of men.<a name=18:1></a> Acting on this four brothers broke bread together in Dublin, and a fellowship formed by the truth and according to Christ's interests was actually in being for the first time since the days of the apostles.<a name=18:2></a> It does not follow that each of the four brothers entered fully into what was involved in their seemingly simple act, or that each of them really apprehended the interests of Christ, i.<a name=18:3></a>e.<a name=18:4></a>, what the church was in its nature and unity -- but they were in a fellowship formed by the truth, and consistent with the interests of Christ, and each must have benefited to a very great extent because they found themselves for the first time where the Spirit of God was free to act, and where the presence and support of the Lord could be known.<a name=18:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Time passed on; the truth spread in all directions, and was taken up by many -- taken up spiritually by some, mentally by others.<a name=18:6></a> The enemy was roused to activity and sought to swamp the whole thing at Plymouth.<a name=18:7></a> The Spirit of God lifted up a standard against him -- again using J.<a name=18:8></a>N.<a name=18:9></a>D.<a name=18:10></a> Then Bethesda enunciated a base principle of neutrality when the Person of Christ was in question, and adopted the idea of total independency both of gatherings and of individuals.<a name=18:11></a> That is, it was a complete subversion of everything that constituted the present testimony of the Lord.<a name=18:12></a> The nature and unity of the church was quite given up.<a name=18:13></a> That is, the very thing which essentially constituted Christ's interest here was given up.<a name=18:14></a> Thus with those who went away at that time the moral evidence of the Lord's presence is entirely wanting.<a name=18:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since then there have been three secessions caused outwardly by the influence of certain teachers, but of which the inward cause must have been a certain degree of unwillingness to go on with the testimony, or of lack of appreciation of truth that was really at stake in each case.<a name=18:16></a> In result those who have separated have in different ways failed to maintain what is of God.<a name=18:17></a> They have not been supported in the testimony, and thus they fail to display the moral evidence of the presence of the Lord.<a name=18:18></a> Of course when we come to this it is entirely a matter of spiritual discernment; it is the spiritual who discerns all things; that is, it is the man who is walking in self-judgment and in the light of God who discerns what and where the testimony is.<a name=18:19></a> It is not a question of intelligence but of

		spirituality.<a name=19:1></a> The simple who are spiritual see clearly what the learned ones miss; and often one has heard simple souls say, 'I cannot explain the truth but I know it is of God'.<a name=19:2></a> There is such a thing after all as the "unction from the holy one".<a name=19:3></a> If it be alleged that there are meetings with the seceders with more light than some in fellowship, it only proves what I have just said -- that there may be intelligence as to the letter of things without spiritual discernment.<a name=19:4></a> And be this as it may, it is a very great thing to be identified with the present testimony of the Lord.<a name=19:5></a> Those who clave to Paul to the end were much better off, I apprehend, than those who turned away from him, even though those who turned away might appear to have much more intelligence and ability.<a name=19:6></a> I doubt whether Onesiphorus was <i>in</i> the testimony to the same extent as Paul, but he was thoroughly identified <i>with it</i>, and with the one who was its chosen vessel.<a name=19:7></a> And the simplest soul may have this great privilege.<a name=19:8></a> There is great benefit in being identified with the testimony of the Lord, and those who are so are preserved more than they suspect from the evils and snares and corruptions which run riot in the profession generally.<a name=19:9></a> They are where the Spirit can act, and there is much gain in this.<a name=19:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to realising the presence of the Lord in the "holiest" and as "minister of the sanctuary", it must be borne in mind that this is the very consummation of privilege and divine favour here.<a name=19:11></a> The very fact that it has been so much presented to us by the Lord in ministry of late is a very great proof of His presence and favour.<a name=19:12></a> Do you suppose that these precious things have even been to any extent before the minds of the seceders?<a name=19:13></a> I very much doubt it.<a name=19:14></a> And not only have these infinite thoughts and purposes of divine love been brought before the minds of the saints, but it cannot be denied that there has been a very considerable awakening of heart as to them and more exercise and desire of heart after the realisation of them than has been known aforetime.<a name=19:15></a> Where else in christendom would you find hearts with any true idea of the divine greatness and attractiveness of these precious and holy thoughts of infinite love?<a name=19:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The <i>honest</i> persons to whom you refer have probably never had any spiritual idea of the holiest at all.<a name=19:17></a> Most of them would be likely to say if the truth was put before them that it was transcendental or mystical or too high to be practical!<a name=19:18></a> They

	<div class="paragraph">
		If many of those in fellowship are not after these things I am very sorry for them, and earnestly desire the awakening of their souls.<a name=20:13></a> But so long as they do not resent and oppose the truth one loves to walk with them and to seek their blessing.<a name=20:14></a> They are at any rate within the circle where light is found, and they benefit by it more than may be supposed.<a name=20:15></a> But the true vital power of the fellowship lies in the testimony of the Lord, and in those who are in heart set for it.<a name=20:16></a> These may be few -- they are few -- but it is in them that the whole thing is maintained according to God, though many others may to a great extent get the benefit of it.<a name=20:17></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have received your letter of the 24th inst.<a name=22:8></a>, and I am very sorry to learn from it that Mr.<a name=22:9></a> -- persists in a course which alienates him from the confidence and fellowship of many brethren who would gladly have the fullest fellowship with the gospel.<a name=22:10></a> I have no fellowship whatever with a course which can only be justified on the supposition that theatres, placards, and newspapers are <i>essential</i> to the furtherance of God's work in this world.<a name=22:11></a>

		If these things are <i>not essential</i>, and Mr.<a name=22:12></a> -- might admit that they were not, I think it is a very ungracious spirit which thrusts them to the front and forces them upon saints in spite of repeated protests.<a name=22:13></a> I regard the self-willed spirit which this betrays as being more serious in itself and in its effects upon the saints than the methods which it pursues.<a name=22:14></a> It is a spirit which will sacrifice unity and fellowship rather than abandon its own methods, and which works on lines of expediency rather than spiritual judgment and intelligence.<a name=22:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=22:16></a> -- knows very well what I think on these matters, and if he represents me as having fellowship with his course, all that I can say is that he has much mistaken what I have said to him.<a name=22:17></a> It is quite possible that at some time he may have mentioned in writing to me that he was going to preach in a theatre, and I may have said in reply that I hoped God would bless souls through his ministry of the gospel.<a name=22:18></a>

		It is indeed very sad that Christians are so divided, and especially so that those who profess to be gathered in the Lord's Name should thus practically discredit in the eyes of the world all that they profess.<a name=29:10></a> For it is certain that if we were all under the control of the Lord -- holding fast His word and not denying His Name -- there would be no divisions amongst us.<a name=29:11></a> But sad as this is it is only what Scripture would lead us to expect, and there is an aspect of it which must not be forgotten, and of which the Holy Spirit reminds us when He says, "There must be also heresies (sects or divisions) among you, that they which are approved among you may be made manifest", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:19">1 Corinthians  11:19</a>.<a name=29:12></a>

		The serious point about a division amongst brethren is the absolute certainty that at least one of the parties has entirely missed the Lord's mind as to the matter on which they have divided.<a name=29:13></a> That is, instead of having the Lord's mind and

	<div class="paragraph">
		judgment on the matter they have acted on their own mind and judgment.<a name=30:1></a> And if, in consequence of this mistaken act, they take up a position of permanent separation from those who had the Lord's mind on the matter they must suffer incalculable loss.<a name=30:2></a> Indeed as to principle they have got back to the very thing which has caused the countless divisions of Christendom -- they are simply acting on their own will.<a name=30:3></a> I do not say that this is the case with the many simple souls who are led by the influence of those to whom they look as leaders.<a name=30:4></a> The exercise of will is in the leaders but those who are led astray necessarily suffer much loss in their souls, and are deprived of much blessing which they would undoubtedly have received if they had remained in a position which was according to the mind of the Lord.<a name=30:5></a> It is the consideration of this which renders it impossible for any one who takes a place intelligently with brethren to ignore the divisions which have taken place or to assume that it does not matter much with whom they break bread.<a name=30:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course there are many hundreds breaking bread with the different sections of brethren who simply look upon brethren as a superior kind of sect with more scriptural light than others, and whose services are conducted more in accordance with the Word of God.<a name=30:7></a> Such persons would be well content anywhere where there was a breaking of bread every Lord's day and the gospel was simply preached.<a name=30:8></a> But an easy-going acceptance of things as they are, in this way, will never satisfy a really exercised conscience or a heart whose supreme desire is to follow the leading of the Shepherd.<a name=30:9></a> Alas!<a name=30:10></a> there are but few who have ears for no voice but His, but richly blessed is their portion.<a name=30:11></a> I am thoroughly convinced that the Lord will not fail to lead all such to be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment, nor will He fail to lead them into the whole counsel of God.<a name=30:12></a>

		With reference to the subject of baptism I may at once say that I believe it is right for a Christian to have his household baptised.<a name=30:13></a> Household baptism is plainly taught in Scripture.<a name=30:14></a> But views on baptism are not the ground of fellowship, and a difference of opinion on this point is no justification for a breach of Christian fellowship.<a name=30:15></a>

		<i>to be done by the believer</i>, whereas it is invariably presented in Scripture as admission to privilege, and it is always regarded as the act of the one who baptises -- not of the one baptised.<a name=31:1></a> It is clearly connected in Scripture with <i>profession</i>, and it gives admission, not to any spiritual or heavenly blessing, but to that circle on earth where the Name of the Lord is owned, and where the outward privileges of Christianity are enjoyed.<a name=31:2></a> It is evident that there can be no assurance that every baptised person is really converted.<a name=31:3></a> But every baptised person is admitted to the circle of Christian profession.<a name=31:4></a> It is much more easy to see what baptism is in the case of a heathen or a Jew than in a country like this where the profession of Christianity is general.<a name=31:5></a> A Jew may believe what he likes so long as he is not baptised.<a name=31:6></a> But the moment he is baptised his relatives disown him.<a name=31:7></a> He has now become a Christian -- not necessarily a true believer, but a Christian in profession in this world; he is no longer a Jew.<a name=31:8></a> In the early days of the church those who received the testimony of the apostles and other evangelists were at once baptised in the Name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=31:9></a> And all who were thus baptised were introduced to a circle of Christian privilege and profession on earth.<a name=31:10></a> It does not follow that all were converted; indeed we know that very soon men like Simon Magus came into the circle of profession.<a name=31:11></a> But the circle existed and every baptised person came within it and partook of its privileges.<a name=31:12></a> Of course if he remained unconverted this only added to his responsibility, but the privilege of being in the circle of Christian light was not less a very real one.<a name=31:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If once it is accepted that there is a circle of privilege on earth into which baptism introduces us, and I think this is as clear as can be, the baptism of believers' households presents no difficulty to any mind instructed in the principles of God's ways.<a name=31:14></a> If there is any principle clearly established in the Old Testament it is that a man's household is always associated with himself in the governmental ways of God.<a name=31:15></a> "Come thou and all thy house into the ark", is the earliest and one of the most striking illustrations of this principle.<a name=31:16></a> In Exodus it is "a lamb for a house".<a name=31:17></a> And so in innumerable instances.<a name=31:18></a> Whenever it is a question of the government of God or of external privilege the household goes with its head.<a name=31:19></a>

		this household principle is clearly stated in connection with baptism.<a name=32:1></a> We read that "Lydia was baptised and her household", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>; we read that the jailer "was baptised, he and all his".<a name=32:2></a> Paul speaks of having baptised "the household of Stephanas", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:16">1 Corinthians  8:16</a>.<a name=32:3></a> So there are three examples given of the baptism of households.<a name=32:4></a>

		And the divine suitability of this will appear to every one who is able to recognise what is suitable to the ways of God.<a name=32:5></a> Would the Jew, who had been divinely instructed of old to associate his household with himself in every external privilege, have understood that this was to be so no longer in Christianity, without some very plain declaration to that effect?<a name=32:6></a> And where can such a declaration be found in the New Testament?<a name=32:7></a> Indeed, the only intimation which seems to be given as to the relative position of the children in Judaism and in Christianity tells forcibly in the very opposite direction.<a name=32:8></a> In Old Testament times the children of a mixed marriage were not admitted to the external privileges of which we are speaking (see <a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#10:3">Ezra  10:3</a>), but in the New Testament it is expressly said that "the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:14">1 Corinthians  7:14</a>.<a name=32:9></a> That is, Christianity is more gracious as to the children than the dispensation which preceded.<a name=32:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believing Jew who owned the Name of the Lord in baptism, and who thus put himself under the lordship of Christ as to his position in this world, could never have been content to leave his household on any other ground.<a name=32:11></a> If Jesus was Lord to him, Jesus must be Lord to all his household.<a name=32:12></a> And his faith would put them all on that ground in baptism; not looking on it as a fleshly ordinance which could confer some grace or blessing on the flesh, but doing it in faith that recognised the true meaning of baptism -- a figure of the total setting aside of man in the flesh, and a practical expression of the fact that his faith looked for their blessing only on the ground of the death of Christ.<a name=32:13></a> His children would thus, equally with himself, be introduced to the outward circle of profession and privilege of Christianity.<a name=32:14></a> They would be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=32:15></a> They would be taught the Scriptures.<a name=32:16></a> They would partake in all the outward privilege of the Christian circle.<a name=32:17></a> The exhortations in the epistles to Christian parents and children are evidently

	<div class="paragraph">
		Personally I do not believe that a person can be re-baptised.<a name=33:3></a> If one has been baptised in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit I would not counsel him to be re-baptised whether it had been done by sprinkling or immersion or whether as an infant or an adult.<a name=33:4></a> I believe it is the scriptural mode to immerse, and I would use this mode myself.<a name=33:5></a> And I would not baptise any beyond the households of believers, but, seeing that it is a matter which has to do with the external circle of profession only, I do not feel free to ignore the baptism of the whole of professing and responsible christendom.<a name=33:6></a> Still, if anyone is exercised, and gets a conscience about the matter, I would say to such a one, "You must keep a good conscience, and if you feel that you ought to be baptised as a believer, be baptised".<a name=33:7></a> I believe such a one is mistaken in his idea of baptism, but I respect his conscience.<a name=33:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The really important moment as to baptism for us as believers is when we realise what is involved in it and accept in our souls that to which we were committed in baptism.<a name=33:9></a> It is easy to be occupied with the externals of the institution and totally miss its kernel and spirit.<a name=33:10></a> We are baptised not because we are saved, as Baptists teach, but because we are lost.<a name=33:11></a> All that <i>we</i> are must go in death.<a name=33:12></a> Baptism is, in figure, the complete setting aside of man in the flesh.<a name=33:13></a> It is not an ordinance to add some grace to the flesh.<a name=33:14></a> It is the solemn figure of the fact -- fully proved by the death of Christ -- that the end of all flesh has come before God.<a name=33:15></a> Every baptised person in the world is on that ground as to his profession; he is committed in baptism to the fact that it is all over with him, and that blessing can only reach him on the ground of the death of Christ.<a name=33:16></a> This is a most powerful ground of appeal to merely nominal professors in the Church of England.<a name=33:17></a> Such are often soothed into spiritual indifference by the thought that their baptism has secured something for them in the way of spiritual blessing.<a name=33:18></a> In reality it is the solemn witness and figure of their wholly lost condition as children of Adam.<a name=33:19></a> Nothing will do before God but "newness of life" -- life

		DEAR --, -- .<a name=36:9></a>.<a name=36:10></a>.<a name=36:11></a> Since the finer weather came in we have been getting out all day into the villages around here with gospel books, etc.<a name=36:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Your question is a very interesting one -- How can the young people in fellowship with us be helped?<a name=36:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I can say that this subject has often been forced upon my attention in much the same way as you remark.<a name=36:14></a> That is, one comes across young people, and old ones too, breaking bread with us whose hearts do not appear to have any real desire after Christ.<a name=36:15></a> The secret of this grave defect is that they have never had any real soul-exercise, and what they suppose to be <i>faith</i> is, in many cases, merely a kind of intellectual assent to what they have so constantly heard.<a name=36:16></a> They take the place of being <i>believers</i> and have been received into fellowship on that ground, but they are evidently not <i>lovers</i> of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=36:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I fear that in not a few instances the unwise dealing of would-be evangelists, in ministering comfort to souls scarcely conscious of any need and urging them to take the place of professed believers, has resulted in souls taking a religious position far beyond the true measure of God's work in them.<a name=36:18></a> Then young people in the households of the saints as children or servants sometimes come into fellowship much on the same ground as they would be confirmed and begin to take the sacrament if their associations had been with the Establishment.<a name=36:19></a> They think it the right thing to do, but <i>Christ</i> is not really the life of their hearts -- their interests are practically in the things of the world and of this present life.<a name=36:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=37>[Page 37]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For such a state of things what is the remedy?<a name=37:1></a> I should say, in the first place, continued and fervent prayer to God on the part of all those who are cognisant of it.<a name=37:2></a> These precious souls need to know the gospel of the grace of God -- they need <i>Christ</i> presenting to their hearts in Holy Ghost power -- they need deliverance, salvation, conversion.<a name=37:3></a> There may be the feeble beginning of a divine work in them, but to the positive grace, power, and joy of Christianity they are entire strangers, they need to be convicted, converted, and saved, and for this no power but that of God is sufficient.<a name=37:4></a> Hence the imperative necessity for much prayer if we would see this blessed miracle wrought.<a name=37:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to any help that can be rendered to such souls, it must be remembered that the <i>one</i> thing they need is to become conscious that Christian blessings are <i>realities</i> -- that <i>Christ</i> is a real, living Person, and that His love has power to displace every earth-born motive in the heart.<a name=37:6></a> They need, in most cases, to come in contact with vital <i>Christianity</i>.<a name=37:7></a> <i>So</i> that the best -- the only true -- way to help them is to be what we desire they should be, so that in contact with us, and by knowledge of us, they may see us possessed of that in <i>Christ</i> which they know nothing of.<a name=37:8></a> Thus would God produce in their hearts the desire for "wisdom", and the world would be thrown into the shade in the light of a glorified Christ.<a name=37:9></a> I apprehend that hundreds of souls were thus awakened and brought into exercise by beloved Mr.<a name=37:10></a> Stoney's testimony -- not so much by his ministry as by the fact that they could see <i>he</i> was in a light to which <i>they</i> were strangers.<a name=37:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the many who profess to want help for their souls, and who complain that "brethren" do not look after them and care for them, I am inclined to suspect that this is only a poor excuse for spiritual slothfulness.<a name=37:12></a> I admit with sorrow that the number of these who <i>lay themselves out</i> to help the young is not very large, but I am perfectly sure that any soul really desirous of spiritual help can get it more easily and in very much fuller measure amongst "brethren" than anywhere else.<a name=37:13></a> The fact is, these complaining souls do not desire to get on at all.<a name=37:14></a> They want people to make a fuss of them, and undertake to wheel them to heaven in a perambulator.<a name=37:15></a> If they were really exercised and prayerful they would speedily find themselves furnished with as much spiritual help as they

	<div class="paragraph">
		could avail themselves of.<a name=38:1></a> But exercise and prayer are not much in the line of those you refer to.<a name=38:2></a> They would not mind being edified if somebody else would take all the trouble of doing it for them!<a name=38:3></a> Young ducks may be fattened by the use of the cramming machine, but young saints will only grow by that for which they have spiritual appetite.<a name=38:4></a> And if this appetite exists it will find abundance of "royal dainties" to feed upon as it feasts on the fatness of God's house and drinks of the river of His pleasure.<a name=38:5></a> The man or woman does not breathe who could honestly say, My heart thirsted for spiritual blessing, and I prayed to God for it, but He has disappointed me and sent me empty away .<a name=38:6></a>.<a name=38:7></a>.<a name=38:8></a>

		I have no doubt -- referring now to the subject of your letter -- that many young souls are terribly disappointed and chilled by the company they fall amongst when they come into so-called fellowship.<a name=38:14></a> They are not much acquainted with Christ, nor, indeed, very firmly established with grace, but they are willing to go on, and if kept under right influences their course would be very different from what it is when they fall amongst thieves at tennis and croquet parties.<a name=38:15></a> I have met with young souls who have heard wonderful and blessed things at the meetings, and have been terribly puzzled to find that these things were not more the theme of converse amongst some of those breaking bread.<a name=38:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it seems to me that the assembly in the midst of which He sings praise is viewed in the light of having reached this place of spiritual privilege in virtue of the drawing and leading of which you speak.<a name=61:3></a> He sings in the midst of a company in perfect accord with Himself.<a name=61:4></a> That this is God's mind for all His saints is certain, but it is equally certain that but few have reached it in spiritual reality.<a name=61:5></a> I am sure that you would labour that this should be wrought in the souls of the saints in divine power and reality, and I believe this to be a necessary condition for the fulfilment of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>.<a name=61:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is why I hesitate about using the terms "abstract", "general", and "unconditional" in connection with this Scripture.<a name=61:7></a> These terms seem to me to suggest that what is involved in the verse is true of all saints apart from the work of God which alone could make it spiritually good.<a name=61:8></a> That it is <i>for</i> them in God's mind and purpose I rejoice to believe, but there are many, alas!<a name=61:9></a> who have never reached it.<a name=61:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To sing praise in the midst of the assembly is a characteristic position and action of Christ, but I do not see that it is necessarily a continuous action.<a name=61:11></a> The coming together of saints in assembly is an abiding characteristic of Christianity, but this does not imply that it is continuous at all times.<a name=61:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly gives expression to its existence by coming together, and thus takes form locally in every place where saints call on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=61:13></a> And it seems to me that the enjoyment of assembly privilege is connected with this, and would be entered upon in proportion to the spirituality of the saints, and the measure in which the work of God has become effective in them.<a name=61:14></a> And I look upon <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>, 12, as the crown of assembly privilege -- the goal which divine love has set before our hearts in all its blessedness and attractiveness to draw us on to its realisation, and to make it an exercise and desire that we may reach it on each occasion when coming together in assembly.<a name=61:15></a>
	</div>

		I will say briefly how the first part of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>presents itself to me.<a name=62:9></a> The apostle prays that the Ephesian saints should know "what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead".<a name=62:10></a> It is of all importance that the saints should estimate in a divine way the greatness of God's power towards them.<a name=62:11></a> It is not only that He wrought in the Christ, but it is according to the working which He wrought in Christ that His power is towards us who believe.<a name=62:12></a> That power expressed itself once in the Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and this is the measure of the power that is towards those who believe, and is exercised in the way of quickening with the Christ, etc.<a name=62:13></a>, those who had previously been dead in offences and sins.<a name=62:14></a> What blessed encouragement there is in considering that so great a power is toward us -- a power that quickened men, and raised them up from the earth and made them sit down in the heavenlies in Christ!<a name=62:15></a> To make this simply <i>purpose</i> is to my mind to destroy all the force of the Scripture.<a name=62:16></a> It is Gentiles and Jews -- persons having a past history as such on earth, and whose condition and walk are described in the passage, who by the working of God's power -- the outcome of His rich mercy and great love -- are quickened with the Christ.<a name=62:17></a> It is the saints viewed not in the light of purpose, but of God's workmanship; that is, it is <i>purpose effectuated by God's power</i> -- spiritually now, actually

		It is that by which the saints are locally convened from time to time, and are thus found "in assembly".<a name=66:19></a> Scripture supposes the whole Christian company as coming together to break bread.<a name=66:20></a> "When ye come together to eat".<a name=66:21></a> Indeed I think the expression "come together" occurs four or five times in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>.<a name=66:22></a> It is the Lord's way of bringing His own together so that their hearts may be in spiritual contact with each other, in blessed engagement with Himself in His pre-eminent love of which the assembly is the subject.<a name=66:23></a> He has a company here loved infinitely by Him, and He appointed

		the Supper to be eaten together by that company as expressing their appreciation of His love, not simply as blessed individuals, but as those who confess in thus eating it together the peculiar bond which makes them one.<a name=67:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now amongst believers generally all the peculiar sweetness of this is lost.<a name=67:2></a> They take what they call "the communion", but in their thoughts it is entirely individual.<a name=67:3></a> Pious souls take it in affectionate gratitude to their Saviour and Lord, and have Him before them in doing so, and no doubt find blessing.<a name=67:4></a> But there is not the thought of coming into heart-contact with His own, so as to be found in that blessed unity of responsive affection which is the true privilege of the Christian company, and which would, if known, result in a blessed unity of testimony to the absent One on the part of all His own.<a name=67:5></a> The more one thinks of what the Supper is in the heart and mind of Christ, the more is one impressed with the thought that it holds a peculiar and central place in the circle of His own.<a name=67:6></a> And the voice of His love in the Supper addresses itself to the whole company of His own.<a name=67:7></a> You will say, They do not all -- respond.<a name=67:8></a> No, but they ought to.<a name=67:9></a> If the Supper is being eaten anywhere it claims on the Lord's part the participation of every one who loves Him.<a name=67:10></a> There is nothing personal or private about it.<a name=67:11></a> If it is truly the <i>Lord's</i> supper it is <i>His</i> call to <i>His</i> company to come together, and being together thus they are "in assembly".<a name=67:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is the consideration of all this, and much more might be added, which would hinder me (if I were confined at home) from desiring to have the Supper as a private and personal privilege.<a name=67:13></a> I should prefer to accept the ways and orderings of God for me, and recognise His hand in the deprivation.<a name=67:14></a> I would seek to be in spirit with the company who were eating the Supper, and would engage my heart with that which was before them.<a name=67:15></a> In this way I should expect to participate in their joy and gain, though not permitted to take my place in the body with them.<a name=67:16></a>

		I am very thankful for all you are able to tell me of the spiritual exercises of the dear brethren.<a name=74:18></a> It encourages me to continue in prayer, feeling confident that the Lord has very definite instruction and blessing in view for us all in the new experiences we are passed through.<a name=74:19></a> It has struck me that the brethren of what we may call the present generation have not had the deep and special exercises through which our elders found the divine path in keeping with the truth and the testimony of our Lord.<a name=74:20></a> Things have been to a large extent ready-made for us, and, while this has been in the way of infinite goodness and mercy to us, it is also true that we have missed, perhaps, some of the maturity and solidity that might have been gained by deeper exercise.<a name=74:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		one cannot help feeling that the Lord is giving them in this way to wait in a very real way upon Himself, so that they may learn His mind and be confirmed in what is of God and find for themselves the divine path for this day.<a name=75:1></a> Trained men are needed for the ranks of the testimony in its last solemn hours, and one would earnestly desire to be such as the Lord can support for His Name's sake in true correspondence with Himself and responsive to Him in the affections of the bride at such a time as this.<a name=75:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure that the consideration of God will yield much profit to those who seek Him as to it.<a name=75:3></a> I am sure the natural mind is not able to give due place to both sovereignty and responsibility and hence all theological systems fail on one side or the other.<a name=75:4></a> But it is clear that Scripture maintains both, and the spiritual mind is always in accord with Scripture.<a name=75:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God carries out His purposes in the sovereignty of His mercy and love; if He did not do so, they would most certainly fail completely, man being what he is.<a name=75:6></a> But the work of God is a moral one, and God addresses Himself to the conscience and heart of His poor fallen creature, and deals with him in a thousand ways which recognise his responsibility and awaken the sense of it in his soul.<a name=75:7></a> The fear of God might almost be defined as the recognition of responsibility on man's part; yet it is undoubtedly brought about by a sovereign act of God in new birth.<a name=75:8></a> God works sovereignly along lines which always recognise and maintain responsibility.<a name=75:9></a> The principle runs all through the history of the saints also.<a name=75:10></a> God is working out in them His purpose, which will culminate in their being conformed to the image of His Son in glory.<a name=75:11></a> But in view of purpose He works along moral lines, and on this line the obedience of faith comes in, self-judgment, watchfulness and prayer, purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord, faith in Christ Jesus and love to the saints, Christ as Object and Teacher, meekness and lowliness as learned of Him.<a name=75:12></a> Sowing to the Spirit and walking in the Spirit come in here also, and all this and everything connected with the moral exercises of the saints cannot be dissociated from the thought of responsibility.<a name=75:13></a> Thus the moral or responsible line and purpose line are very intimately blended in Christianity and both will ultimately coalesce, when saints are seen not only as the fruit of God's purpose, but also as the subjects of His work and ways.<a name=75:14></a> We only reach the land, the sphere of purpose, through the wilderness and

	<div class="paragraph">
		through the innumerable exercises to which our responsible history gives occasion.<a name=76:1></a> At the end of the wilderness it can be said of the saints: "What hath God wrought!<a name=76:2></a>" They are brought into moral suitability for introduction into the land.<a name=76:3></a> We cannot <i>mentally</i> reconcile sovereignty and responsibility, but we can <i>spiritually</i>, as seeing that the maintenance of both is essential.<a name=76:4></a> The Spirit alone can maintain the right balance of the two in our thoughts and I am sure, as we go on, we learn to attach the true value to each, neither letting ourselves off easily by enfeebling the thought of responsibility, nor stopping short of that depth of holy self-judgment that casts us altogether upon sovereign mercy and love.<a name=76:5></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- In answer to your letter I am glad to send you a few remarks on the subject of divine healing, though it be simply to call attention to what Scripture sets before us.<a name=82:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The healing of the sick, accompanying the preaching of the glad tidings of the kingdom, was one of the great characteristics of the presence and service of the Son of God in this world.<a name=82:2></a> Every form and fruit of the power of evil had to give way before Him; every result of sin -- disease, and even death itself -- had to bear witness to the greatness of divine power which was active here in compassionate goodness to men.<a name=82:3></a> It could not be otherwise in the presence of God manifest in flesh.<a name=82:4></a> The power was present which could and did relieve men of every pressure, so that it was manifest that He was here who will in a coming day "swallow up death in victory", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#25:8">Isaiah  25:8</a>, and bring about such a state of things that the inhabitants shall not say "I am sick".<a name=82:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And not only was every act of healing a testimony of what was in God's heart in loving-kindness to His ruined creature, but it was a figure of an even greater deliverance by which men should be set free from every moral disease so as to be for God's pleasure, serving Him "without fear in piety and righteousness all our days".<a name=82:6></a> The works of power of the age to come were illustrative of the moral healing by which alone man could answer to God's will as set forth in the teaching of the Lord.<a name=82:7></a> And it is very touching to see that every act of healing was at the cost of suffering to the blessed Healer, for, as the prophet had said, "Himself took our infirmities and bare our diseases", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:17">Matthew  8:17</a>.<a name=82:8></a> He did not remove any infirmity by His power without bearing the burden and sorrow of it in His spirit, and this was true of "every disease and every bodily weakness", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#9:35">Matthew  9:35</a>.<a name=82:9></a> He thus understands perfectly, and can sympathise with every form of bodily suffering, and this is a sweet comfort to all His "brethren" who are sick.<a name=82:10></a> For that such might be sick is clearly intimated in His own words, "I was ill, and ye visited me", explained by "Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:36">Matthew  25:36</a>, 40.<a name=82:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see Him giving the twelve, and then the seventy, power to heal diseases.<a name=82:12></a> They had no need to talk about the power, or to write books about it, or to try to make people believe they had it.<a name=82:13></a> They <i>had</i> it, and they exercised it in the simplest

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		possible way.<a name=83:1></a> When we pass from the gospels to the Acts we find the same divine power accompanying the service of Peter and Paul, in testimony to the Name of Him who was no longer here but glorified in heaven, though it may be noted that neither in the Acts nor in the epistles do we find any instance of a Christian being restored from bodily sickness by a miracle.<a name=83:2></a> Then we learn from 1 Corinthians that "gifts of healings" were set, amongst other gifts, "in the assembly".<a name=83:3></a> And James says "Is any sick among you?<a name=83:4></a> Let him call to him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.<a name=83:5></a> Confess therefore your offences to one another and pray for one another, that ye may be healed".<a name=83:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are also told that "the body is .<a name=83:7></a>.<a name=83:8></a>.<a name=83:9></a> for the Lord, and the Lord for the body", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:13">1 Corinthians  6:13</a>, and again "He is Saviour of the body", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:23">Ephesians  5:23</a>.<a name=83:10></a> All this is to be weighed and valued as a blessed witness of what divine power and goodness can effect in the way of preservation or healing of the body.<a name=83:11></a> It has encouraged the faith of God's people to count upon Him in innumerable instances, so that I suppose there are very few of His children who have not known personally of cases in which prayer has been most distinctly answered in regard to the body.<a name=83:12></a> It is simply a question of faith counting upon God and getting its answer.<a name=83:13></a> In each case it is a matter of individual exercise and faith on the part of the sick one, or of those concerned about him.<a name=83:14></a> One would wish to encourage in oneself, and in one's brethren, more simple piety and confidence in God as to the body and its health.<a name=83:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remarkable sign gifts, such as "tongues", "gifts of healing", "miraculous powers", existed in the assembly at the beginning; God bore witness with His servants to His great salvation "both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:4">Hebrews  2:4</a>.<a name=83:16></a> There was one blessed company presenting a united testimony on God's part in the midst of a hostile world, and He was pleased to accredit that testimony in a public and unmistakable way.<a name=83:17></a> But where might we expect such credentials to be found today, compelling the attention of men by manifesting His power miraculously, even to sight?<a name=83:18></a> It is a day of departure and ruin, and it could hardly be expected that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=84>[Page 84]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God should accredit in a public way a condition of things which is contrary to His mind.<a name=84:1></a> If, on the other hand, sign gifts were bestowed on such saints as were individually approved of God, it would put such saints publicly in an extraordinary position, as being distinguished from the church generally -- from all other saints -- by the possession of miraculous powers.<a name=84:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think a heart that felt aright the true condition of the church would shrink from the idea of such a position.<a name=84:3></a> The assembly has departed from first love and is in a fallen state; Christ and the Spirit have lost their place; and man's will and order (which is really confusion) are seen on every hand.<a name=84:4></a> We are in 2 Timothy days, and the Spirit shows us there the path of righteousness and faith for those who are found calling on the Lord out of a pure heart at such a time.<a name=84:5></a> There is no word of sign gifts being recovered or miraculous powers being conferred on the faithful.<a name=84:6></a> There is a call to be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, to be prepared for suffering, to strive diligently to present oneself approved to God, to shun profane vain babblings, to withdraw from iniquity, to separate from vessels to dishonour, to flee youthful lusts, and to pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with them that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=84:7></a> All is put on moral and vital ground, and though the servant addressed had frequent illnesses, and another valued brother is mentioned in the epistle as being left behind sick, Paul drops no hint as to their being healed by faith.<a name=84:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are in a day of ruin, with utter and final apostasy close at hand.<a name=84:9></a> There cannot be the smallest question as to God's power: He can heal the bodies of His saints today, as at any time, if it pleases Him to do so.<a name=84:10></a> But the condition of the assembly -- the vessel of testimony -- is such that faithful individuals would be concerned rather as to spiritual healing -- that the saints should be found walking together according to truth, and in holy separation from the world, and from everything that is not according to the will of the Lord; that full place should be given to the Holy Spirit and His ministry of the glory of Christ; that the relations of Christ to the assembly and of the assembly to Christ should be known and entered into; that the members of the body of Christ should recognise their corporate bond with one another, and be found acting happily and healthfully in their mutual relations as such;

		that the joints of supply should be in such living contact with the Head as to minister of His fulness continually, so that the body may be united together and increase with the increase of God; that saints may hold the truth in love, and "grow up to him in all things who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:15">Ephesians  4:15</a>, 16.<a name=85:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are very great subjects for exercise and desire, and it is to be earnestly wished that saints were more concerned about them.<a name=85:2></a> There is a danger of missing the distinctive character of Christian blessings -- of being diverted from the spiritual and the heavenly -- and we have to see to it that we do not lose our crown.<a name=85:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Any pretension to miraculous powers in such a day as this would need to be tested in every way by the Holy Scriptures; the spirit of those claiming to exercise such powers would need to be discerned as being of God, and their teaching judged by the truth.<a name=85:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are drawing near to the moment of apostasy, and we read of one to come "whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved", <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:9">2 Thessalonians  2:9</a>, 10.<a name=85:5></a> Alleged cases of healing have been found in connection with grave error as to the truth, and this renders it necessary that the children of God should exercise spiritual judgment, and apply the test of truth to those who assume to exercise healing powers.<a name=85:6></a> The desire for signs was one marked feature of Jewish unbelief, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:1">Matthew  16:1</a> - 4, etc.<a name=85:7></a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:22">1 Corinthians  1:22</a>.<a name=85:8></a> Man naturally loves the marvellous, without desiring in conscience or heart to be brought near to God; and in the last days the enemy will gain power over men by gratifying this desire, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:24">Matthew  24:24</a>.<a name=85:9></a>

		In considering the Scripture in <a href="../bible/James.htm#5">James  5</a>we have to remember that when he wrote the assembly was a distinct and united company, and the elders were known individually who could be sent for as being <i>officially</i> in a position to act administratively for the Lord.<a name=85:10></a> The assembly cannot be found today; it is fallen, scattered and submerged in the world.<a name=85:11></a> Elders, as of divine appointment officially, there are none.<a name=85:12></a> Does this

		tremendous change of conditions make no difference?<a name=86:1></a> The very first exercise of a sick saint brings home to him that on the administrative side all is changed through man's failure.<a name=86:2></a> But he can still pray, and if anything is on his conscience he can confess his offences to his brethren, and saints can pray for one another that they may be healed.<a name=86:3></a> We can go fully on the ground of <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:16">James  5:16</a>, though probably few spiritual persons would care to take the ground of acting officially as elders according to verse 14.<a name=86:4></a> It is all a question of exercise, spiritual uprightness, and faith, and I suppose we have all known instances in which the Lord has come in to heal and raise up the sick in answer to prayer.<a name=86:5></a> But it is a great thing not to suffer our thoughts of things to get out of proportion.<a name=86:6></a> If we are more concerned about physical health than we are about spiritual health we need adjustment.<a name=86:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear from <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a> that bodily weakness and even death may be the discipline of the Lord upon that which is displeasing to Him.<a name=86:8></a> John also refers to this when he says "If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for those that do not sin unto death.<a name=86:9></a> There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:16">1 John  5:16</a>, 17.<a name=86:10></a> It would evidently be an exercise from the Lord as to whether sickness were of this nature or otherwise, and if a believer felt in his conscience that it was so, and was brought to repentance, it would be good for him to confess his wrongdoing.<a name=86:11></a> Such conviction and confession would lead to prayer for the sick one and his sins would be forgiven, and, generally speaking, he would be healed and raised up.<a name=86:12></a> There might indeed be the solemn case of sin unto death -- which would be spiritually discerned -- when there might be no faith to make request for recovery, but such a case would probably be exceptional.<a name=86:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is much sickness that is not discipline for unfaithfulness.<a name=86:14></a> Epaphroditus was sick close to death "for the sake of the work", and his sickness was the cause of much exercise to Paul and also to the Philippian saints.<a name=86:15></a> If healing had been the normal thing in Christianity we should surely have found an example of it in this instance, but there is no suggestion that he was thus healed.<a name=86:16></a> Paul records with much thankfulness, just as we should of any sick brother who had been raised up, that "God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow",

		<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:27">Philippians  2:27</a>. There is something peculiarly touching in his case: the reason for his sickness, the exercise of Paul (and no doubt others also) about it, the concern of the Philippians when they heard of it, and his own distress because they had heard of it.<a name=87:1></a> I venture to believe that all these exercises, and the activities of sympathy and love in the saints called forth by his sickness, were a sweeter expression of the love and "bowels and compassions" of the Christ than any act of miraculous power by which he might have been instantly healed.<a name=87:2></a>

		How many thousands of saints have been happy to assert that they would not have missed for anything the exercises of prolonged sickness and suffering!<a name=87:3></a> They have so learned the grace and sympathy and succour of Christ as the living Priest, and they have been the subjects of so much precious and tender interest and consideration flowing from the spiritual affections of His saints, that they have become conscious of infinite gain and enrichment.<a name=87:4></a> And surely the development and exercise of such affections as these, eternal in their nature, though called into activity by circumstances connected with conditions of weakness and time, is a greater triumph of divine love and power than restoring the sick ones to health.<a name=87:5></a> I cannot but feel it is a real loss for the attention of saints to be turned from the spiritual dealings of the Lord with His saints, and from all that is the moral result of those dealings, to be concentrated upon the thought of bodily healing.<a name=87:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The experience of weakness and suffering may not only be of the greatest advantage to the spiritual welfare of the sufferer, but it may be absolutely essential to his preservation in service.<a name=87:7></a> We see a striking example of this in Paul himself, who suffered intensely from some form of physical infirmity.<a name=87:8></a> He was deeply exercised as to being relieved of this pressure, and besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him.<a name=87:9></a> However it was not the Lord's will to remove the infirmity, whatever it was, but to make His grace sufficient for His servant, and to perfect His power in His servant's conscious weakness.<a name=87:10></a> Is it not apparent that the removal of the infirmity by divine healing would have meant a real loss to Paul's soul and service, and not a gain?<a name=87:11></a> To suppose that relief from physical weakness and suffering is the greatest good is a profound mistake.<a name=87:12></a> To prove the grace of the Lord and the power of Christ in the suffering is very often greater gain than to be relieved of it.<a name=87:13></a>

		We are called to walk in the truth.<a name=88:1></a> If God is pleased to give physical healing in answer to prayer, as He has done in thousands of cases, we thankfully acknowledge His mercy and goodness.<a name=88:2></a> If it came to our knowledge that He has been pleased to confer a distinct gift of healing, manifest as such to sober and spiritual persons, we should thank Him for this also.<a name=88:3></a> But apart from the difficulty which we might have in verifying the truth of any claim to such gift, we ought not to allow even divine gift to divert us from the truth, or from a path which we have learned to be according to the truth.<a name=88:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Many true and divine gifts -- evangelists, pastors, teachers -- are found labouring in connection with things which we have seen to be contrary to the will of the Lord.<a name=88:5></a> We own them as gifts, but we do not walk with them, and we discern that even as gifts they suffer loss, and the church fails to receive the full measure of edifying through them because of the association with systems which are of men's ordering.<a name=88:6></a> To have gifts for ministry or miraculous powers for healing is not the crowning glory of faithful saints in a day of ruin.<a name=88:7></a> It is rather to be addressed by Him who is the Holy One and True in these words: "Behold I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name .<a name=88:8></a>.<a name=88:9></a>.<a name=88:10></a> I have loved thee.<a name=88:11></a> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole habitable world to try them that dwell upon the earth.<a name=88:12></a> I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".<a name=88:13></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I think I can understand your exercises, and all that you feel as to lack of <i>continuous</i> enjoyment.<a name=89:15></a> It is surprising how <i>mixed</i> our exercises often are practically.<a name=89:16></a> I have thought of it in connection with the word, "I am black but comely".<a name=89:17></a> The exercises and afflictions of the remnant under God's discipline will be a severe test, and they will be conscious that it has an effect upon them which they deprecate.<a name=89:18></a> They will feel that they do not come out in the divine beauty which they would desire.<a name=89:19></a> When one is under discipline it is not at the time seen to be matter of joy, but of grief, and this is not exactly divine beauty.<a name=89:20></a> There is the consciousness of being affected by it in a way which gives evidence of weakness and imperfection in ourselves -- an inability to be superior to the burning rays of the trial through which divine faithfulness may see fit to pass us.<a name=89:21></a> And such an experience is not at all inconsistent with conscious comeliness as blessed and accepted in Christ.<a name=89:22></a> It is helpful to see the two exercises -- apparently

		The more definitely we seek and cherish continuous nearness to the Lord, and the manifestation of Himself to our hearts, the more will His love be free to take its own way with us.<a name=90:5></a> It is His own thought to have us near, and if it is the conscious upright desire of the heart to be near there can be no doubt that His purpose and pleasure, and the heart's desire, will have their answer.<a name=90:6></a> His love, and the Spirit given, are the sure pledge of this.<a name=90:7></a>

		<i>(The substance of several letters revised)</i>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first of these Scriptures it seems to me that four distinct actions are contemplated.<a name=91:10></a> Of course, they all operated together at Corinth, but they are distinguishable one from the other.<a name=91:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The apostolic action in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, with which the saints (as gathered together and having the power of our Lord Jesus Christ) are identified, by which the wicked person was delivered to Satan for destruction of the flesh.<a name=91:12></a> I think it would be generally agreed that there is no apostolic power to act thus today.<a name=91:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. That with such a one there was to be no mixing -- "not even to eat".<a name=91:14></a> The application of this would clearly be individual, and it is as obligatory on each individual saint as ever.<a name=91:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves".<a name=91:16></a> This was to be the act of the whole company of saints.<a name=91:17></a> The evil-doer was to be no longer of their company.<a name=91:18></a> He was to be excommunicated from the privileges and fellowship of the assembly, and outside there was nothing for him but the world of darkness and Satan's power.<a name=91:19></a> It was a "rebuke" terrible in its nature, and, as we know, well-nigh overwhelming in its effect.<a name=91:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened".<a name=91:21></a> This was a deeper and more searching exercise than merely getting rid of the wicked person.<a name=91:22></a> The fact that such a one was amongst them, and known to be so, without any

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		mourning being caused, exposed their general state, and it was this which, I think we might say, was the most serious aspect of the case.<a name=92:1></a> There was general puffing up, boasting and the allowance of what was fleshly in many ways.<a name=92:2></a> All this "leaven" was to be purged out, that the assembly might be practically true to its character as a "new lump" and "unleavened".<a name=92:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is before us in its solemnity and force as the commandment of the Lord.<a name=92:4></a> In proportion as we limit it in thought to anything less than the whole assembly of God we lose in our souls its import, its unspeakable gravity, and it is well that a deep sense of this should be retained.<a name=92:5></a> The desire to preserve the force of this makes me hesitate to use "yourselves" in a limited sense.<a name=92:6></a> That is, to appropriate the "yourselves" of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a> to a few saints who are perhaps today the one-hundredth part of the assembly of God in a town.<a name=92:7></a> The assembly as such could, and did, act then effectively as an administrative body with divine authority.<a name=92:8></a> The "yourselves" was the whole Christian company -- a concrete company from which a wicked person could be excluded.<a name=92:9></a> The fact that the assembly is not in view as such a company today is the sad evidence of ruin through man's failure.<a name=92:10></a> Indeed it was the appalling contrast between what he saw the church to be in Scripture, and what it had become in his day, that led Augustine to speak of the "invisible church" and the expression has been in common use ever since.<a name=92:11></a> The use of such an expression is in itself the most complete evidence of utter ruin.<a name=92:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to feel, and it is right we should feel, the changed conditions.<a name=92:13></a> We may be sure that the heart of Christ is very deeply affected by the ruin, and He will not suffer His saints to be unaffected by it.<a name=92:14></a> It is really a very holy privilege to be sympathetic with the heart of Christ as to the ruin of that which bears His Name in this world.<a name=92:15></a> If we are so, it will surely lead us to act with simplicity and lowliness becoming the present state of things.<a name=92:16></a> We have, I trust in some measure, the sorrow of being conscious that in the present conditions no such corporate action of the assembly as could be taken at Corinth is possible.<a name=92:17></a> It brings home to us that we are in the <i>last</i> days and not in the <i>first</i>.<a name=92:18></a>
	</div>

		But are we, on that account, to give up the truth, and accept

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		association with evil?<a name=93:1></a> Far be the thought!<a name=93:2></a> If any principle or pretext were alleged which would have the effect of causing saints to continue in association with evil it would be obviously making the commandment of God of none effect.<a name=93:3></a> We must certainly in the light of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>refuse all fellowship and intercourse with a wicked person.<a name=93:4></a> But we must also recognise that all the conditions in the Christian profession are changed.<a name=93:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is these changed conditions which have been distinctly taken account of, and provided for, in 2 Timothy.<a name=93:6></a> In that epistle we have the Lord's mind as to how faithful saints should act in the last days, and how those saints should <i>walk together</i>.<a name=93:7></a> But it is essential to the right understanding of 2 Timothy that we should see that the light of the ministry of the gospel and of the ministry of the assembly is supposed to be possessed by the persons who are in view.<a name=93:8></a> That is, the epistle is addressed to an individual who has heard things of Paul, and who is thoroughly acquainted with Paul's doctrine, <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:2">2 Timothy  2:2</a>; 3: 10.<a name=93:9></a> These things, entrusted to faithful men, are to be the subject of instruction amongst the saints.<a name=93:10></a> This would clearly include what we have in Romans and Corinthians, and also Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=93:11></a> Every Scripture is also spoken of as "divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>, 17.<a name=93:12></a> This proves that no part of Paul's doctrine, or indeed of any Scripture, is to drop out of account.<a name=93:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the light of all this the faithful saint is to "shun" vain babblings (2: 16), everyone who names the name of the Lord is to "withdraw from iniquity" (2: 19), and he who would be "a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" must purify himself from vessels to dishonour "in separating himself from them" (2: 21).<a name=93:14></a> He must "flee" youthful lusts (2: 22), and "avoid" foolish and senseless questionings (2: 23).<a name=93:15></a> These things, negative though they be, are most necessary in the midst of a profession where iniquity abounds.<a name=93:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is something positive also.<a name=93:17></a> We are to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (2: 22).<a name=93:18></a> The pursuit of these things would clearly involve practical consistency with every

		part of the truth which the individual has heard and known as Paul's teaching.<a name=94:1></a> As <i>in the light of the truth of the assembly</i> he finds here definite instructions in relation to his walking together with other like-minded saints.<a name=94:2></a> The "with" clearly brings in what is collective.<a name=94:3></a> He is not to be isolated.<a name=94:4></a> How could he be in the light of the assembly?<a name=94:5></a> Righteousness, faith, love, peace, are bound up with the practical recognition of our divine bond with all saints as members of one another in Christ's body, and as built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.<a name=94:6></a> We cannot pursue these four things <i>alone</i>; in the very nature of the case it must be "<i>with</i> those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=94:7></a> This necessitates much individual exercise, for if I am not pursuing righteousness, faith, love, peace, how shall I be able to discern others who are doing so in dependence upon, and desiring loyalty to, the Lord?<a name=94:8></a> "A pure heart" suggests that there must be more than the <i>claim</i> to be such; it must be a reality before the Lord, and when it is so there will hardly be the need or desire to <i>claim</i> it.<a name=94:9></a> The heart is set on maintaining it <i>under His eye</i> in spiritual reality.<a name=94:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly exists, and all truth pertaining to it -- including 1 Corinthians -- remains as divine light for us, but our path amidst the ruin is marked out in 2 Timothy.<a name=94:11></a> No company can claim to have the status of the assembly, or to act as such.<a name=94:12></a> But saints can still, in the light of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, refuse intercourse with a wicked person.<a name=94:13></a> It is imperative that they should do so.<a name=94:14></a> Indeed it is clear that none of such as were characterised by the moral traits of <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a> would go on with a wicked person.<a name=94:15></a> To recognise the authority of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a> as the commandment of the Lord, and to be consistent with it, is part of the "righteousness" we are to pursue according to 2 Timothy, and we do so in company with our brethren who are treading the same path.<a name=94:16></a> Saints <i>act together</i> as pursuing "righteousness".<a name=94:17></a> And they not only have in mind the necessity for withdrawing from iniquity, but they act as those who have apprehended the true character of the assembly, God's house, as being essentially holy, and thus necessarily <i>exclusive of evil</i>.<a name=94:18></a> Profound exercise as to this before God, and eating the sin-offering, is of the deepest importance.<a name=94:19></a> But all this is spiritual and priestly exercise <i>within</i> -- a <i>temple</i> character of things which forms the moral basis in souls of the action taken in public.<a name=94:20></a> This must have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is characterised by purity, it is the abode of God's holiness.<a name=95:2></a> If the saints are the shrine where God dwells, this necessitates the positive refusal and rejection of evil.<a name=95:3></a> But we do not limit the thought of the purity and holiness of God's house to any special company of saints.<a name=95:4></a> All saints are of that house, and we apprehend things from that point of view.<a name=95:5></a> At Corinth there was a concrete company which had that character, and from which a wicked person could be excluded.<a name=95:6></a> But we are in a time of ruin, and though the assembly still exists, and is still characterised by holiness, it is not in view as a concrete company.<a name=95:7></a> But exercised saints can apprehend the character of God's house, and walk together consistently with it, in spite of the ruin, though, of course, very much affected by it.<a name=95:8></a> If we walk together in the light of what pertains to the whole company we necessarily take action and we do so together.<a name=95:9></a> We come to the solemn judgment as before God that an evil-doer is unfit for Christian fellowship, and we sever all our links of association and fellowship with him.<a name=95:10></a> Nothing could be more simple and definite, or more absolutely in keeping with <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=95:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saints do not claim to act as the assembly, or as being the "yourselves" contemplated in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a>, because they take account of the true scope of "yourselves", and they realise the present ruin under the eye of the Lord.<a name=95:12></a> But they seek to maintain consistency with every part of assembly truth, and every divine principle.<a name=95:13></a> They seek to come together and act together, in such a way that the Lord may be able to own them as gathered to His Name and acting in His Name.<a name=95:14></a> They desire, above all, that His presence with them may be their support, and that every act may be so carried out as to have moral value under God's eye.<a name=95:15></a> But they own the ruin, and do not set up to be anything.<a name=95:16></a> They are conscious that their place of blessing and power is to be a poor and afflicted people whose trust is in the Name of the Lord.<a name=95:17></a> He will not fail such.<a name=95:18></a> They act together in refusing to be linked with evil, but the only community or corporate body which they recognise is the whole assembly.<a name=95:19></a>

		I should say that the two or three are "of the assembly" and are therefore responsible to judge themselves, and to see to it that their associations, ways and spirit are in keeping with its holy character.<a name=97:2></a> It is also one of the first elements in "righteousness" that they should recognise and own the ruin into which things have fallen in the assembly of which they form part.<a name=97:3></a> In proportion as they are here for Christ, and devoted to His interests, they can be found gathered together unto His Name and acting in His Name, and they will have <i>assembly character</i>.<a name=97:4></a> But if their actions are such as to manifest indifference to Christ, or failure to maintain His rights, or are out of accord with the truth, though they are "of the assembly" they are not found in <i>assembly character</i>.<a name=97:5></a> There are many "believers' meetings" which could not be recognised as having assembly character at all, though all believers in them are "of the assembly".<a name=97:6></a> It is as saints are formed in these moral features which properly belong to the assembly that it may be said that they come together in <i>assembly character</i>.<a name=97:7></a> But the more truly they come together in assembly character the less disposed will they be to claim to do so in any formal or ecclesiastical way.<a name=97:8></a> The character of their assembling, and of their actions, will speak for itself, and be justified by the truth.<a name=97:9></a> To speak, in a day of ruin, of coming together in <i>assembly character</i> in any other sense than as having the moral features of the assembly would be, I fear, that very ecclesiasticism which F.<a name=97:10></a>E.<a name=97:11></a>R.<a name=97:12></a> and others have so dreaded and deprecated, and with which J.<a name=97:13></a>N.<a name=97:14></a>D.<a name=97:15></a> would not have had an atom of sympathy.<a name=97:16></a>

		At the present time moral formation goes on in the sphere of responsibility, and hence is always accompanied and promoted by activity of the conscience.<a name=105:7></a> But in a scene where all is wholly and eternally good it is difficult to see what place conscience could have.<a name=105:8></a> Evil is <i>known</i> in that scene, but it is known as having been fully exposed and judged in the death of the holy and righteous One, and as having disappeared from God's reconciled universe.<a name=105:9></a> Good that is without measure is known there in its fulness in the blessed God, and every vessel is filled out of that fulness -- God is all in all.<a name=105:10></a> But both good and evil are known in the divine nature, even as God knows them -- a nature which is abhorrent of evil, and all whose activities, the unceasing outcome of love, are only good.<a name=105:11></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Many thanks for yours.<a name=107:16></a> It is very kind of you to write so fully, and I value the opportunity of considering your thoughts on the subject which is a matter of exercise at present.<a name=107:17></a>
	</div>

		It is in the desire to maintain the full force and scope of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a> as the commandment of the Lord that I recognise His will to be that a wicked person should be excluded from the privileges and fellowship of the assembly, and from the company of all who call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=107:18></a> I think this is the scope of the Scripture in a just and sober interpretation of it, taken in its divine setting in an epistle addressed as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>.<a name=107:19></a> I hold that it is obligatory not only on all saints, but on all who call
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=108>[Page 108]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		upon that holy Name, even though it be in profession only.<a name=108:1></a> That, in its full and proper scope, it is not now obeyed is obvious, and is the evidence of departure and ruin, which is humbling to us all as having our part in it.<a name=108:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am unable to see that the acceptance of the above interpretation involves that "we must necessarily judge as evil all the various judgments of the past and consequently our own present position".<a name=108:3></a> It seems to me that if brethren had now come to the conclusion that it was <i>wrong</i> to exclude a wicked person from their fellowship there would be force in your argument!<a name=108:4></a> But the matter is on quite a different footing from this.<a name=108:5></a> Brethren are, thank God, as much set to exclude evil from their associations as ever.<a name=108:6></a> They regard those "various judgments" as morally right, and as come to in the fear of God, with true and upright desire to maintain what was due to the Lord; and what was suitable to the abode of God's holiness.<a name=108:7></a> But there have been many things in the practice of brethren, and terms frequently used in years past, which have quietly dropped out through exercise in the presence of increased light.<a name=108:8></a> For many years, and particularly since we were so much helped by F.<a name=108:9></a>E.<a name=108:10></a>R.<a name=108:11></a>'s ministry, brethren generally have been exercised to avoid taking any ground, or using any terms, that might seem to involve pretension in the scene and circumstances of the church's ruin.<a name=108:12></a> But we do not "judge as evil" what was done uprightly, and for the honour of the Lord's Name, and which was, as to its substance, approved of Him, though we might not feel free to do things just in the same way now.<a name=108:13></a> We do not "judge as evil" the measure of light and truth we had forty years ago, though we were happy to say and do many things then which we should not say or do now.<a name=108:14></a> To be thankful for increased light does not involve that we "judge as evil" our former measure of spiritual intelligence and growth.<a name=108:15></a> The "dilemma" you speak of does not present itself to my mind as being such at all.<a name=108:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would suggest that the "ground" on which any action may be taken is distinguishable from the "object" or "motive".<a name=108:17></a> It is true that all links with an evil-doer should be severed on the "ground" that he is unfit for any Christian fellowship.<a name=108:18></a> But the "object" in view would be, first, to maintain conditions suitable to the Lord, and in accord with His holy Name, and in keeping with the character of God's house.<a name=108:19></a> And, secondly, in the spirit of grace and love, that the offender
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=109>[Page 109]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		might be exercised, convicted, and fully restored.<a name=109:1></a> The "motive" in all that was done would be the obedience of faith working through love .<a name=109:2></a>.<a name=109:3></a>.<a name=109:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My power is very small, but I would certainly earnestly desire to use it to the utmost to prevent disintegration, and to build saints up in Christ, that as formed in the divine nature they may be comforted and knit together in love.<a name=109:5></a> May we have wisdom to discern the movements which really tend to divide and scatter, and spiritual power to resist them as strong in the Lord and in the might of His strength.<a name=109:6></a> And in every way may we be found "seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed"!<a name=109:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		... Brethren generally are in such substantial agreement as to the principles involved in the present exercise that the idea of division on the subject seems to be simply preposterous.<a name=109:11></a> As to the essential matters, which might justly be regarded as vital to fellowship, there seems to be, happily, universal concurrence of judgment.<a name=109:12></a> That is (1), that all links of association or fellowship with a wicked person should be severed, and (2) that all ecclesiastical pretension should be felt to be utterly unsuitable in the present condition of the church.<a name=109:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But a third question has come in, and become the occasion of diverse judgments running in some cases to the point of serious difference.<a name=109:14></a> That is, whether as to our public attitude, and the public statement of that attitude, in relation to a wicked person, we should take church ground and put him away from amongst ourselves, as could be done at Corinth, or whether it is not more suitable and seemly to take 2 Timothy ground and to act together on the basis of individual faithfulness, but, of course, in the light of all assembly truth and principles.<a name=109:15></a> It must be one or the other.<a name=109:16></a> Whatever terms are used there is really no middle course.<a name=109:17></a> Much has been brought before us in ministry as to this for many years past, and it seems to be the Lord's mind that this question should be now definitely faced.<a name=109:18></a>

		The very fact that there is exercise, with different phases of expression, but which in each case maintains with jealous care separation from evil, and the purity of the saints' associations, and the honour due to the Lord's Name, is something to be thankful for.<a name=110:1></a> It is evidence that the Lord is not suffering us to drop down into formality, but is preserving exercise as to the import of things, and as to the moral state which can alone take them up rightly.<a name=110:2></a> There is nothing in the exercise which, in my judgment, should be regarded as raising the question of fellowship.<a name=110:3></a> It is an exercise for brethren to take up together, and to seek the Lord about, that He may make clear His mind and confirm it in the judgment of His saints.<a name=110:4></a> It is surely not a matter which calls for division.<a name=110:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I go most fully with what has been said; viz.<a name=110:6></a> "The church -- as set up in responsibility here -- has failed, and there is no corporate body now that we can look to.<a name=110:7></a> We must recognise this, and our own part, too, as contributing to the failure.<a name=110:8></a> Further, it is a principle in the ways of God that when the corporate thing fails the principles that belong to it are maintained in individual faithfulness".<a name=110:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A principle clearly laid down in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>is that of withdrawing or separation from iniquity or vessels to dishonour.<a name=110:10></a> It is a principle of very wide -- we might say universal -- application.<a name=110:11></a> If it is true that we cannot now look to any corporate body to maintain divine principles, in individual faithfulness we can still act on this basic principle of withdrawal or separation from what is evil.<a name=110:12></a> It is a most valuable divine provision for the last days.<a name=110:13></a> The faithful saint can never be forced to accept association with evil; he can always withdraw from it.<a name=110:14></a> If <i>two</i> were walking together, and one of them became characteristically a wicked person the other could, and would, withdraw from him.<a name=110:15></a> And if 50 or 500 are walking together, each one must walk individually in regard to him on the withdrawal principle.<a name=110:16></a> It is only as each one acts on this principle that we can follow righteousness together.<a name=110:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in dealing with such a person those who walk together act together.<a name=110:18></a> And the question arises whether there may not be an element in such collective action additional to that of individual withdrawal.<a name=110:19></a> I cannot doubt that when faithful saints thus act there is an additional element, and a very important one.<a name=110:20></a> If "two or three" take action, as gathered
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		together to the Lord's Name, and with the support and sanction of His presence, their action -- as to spiritual reality, and in the estimation of faith -- has assembly character.<a name=111:1></a> The Lord's presence, and His power and authority, are concerned in the matter.<a name=111:2></a> But the support and confidence which the consciousness of this gives are known only to faith and love, and to the holy and priestly exercises of saints in private with God.<a name=111:3></a> I think we should instinctively feel that it would be out of place and unbecoming to take or claim any such ground as to our public position here.<a name=111:4></a> Every sober and lowly mind would shrink from it as savouring of pretension.<a name=111:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it seems to me that if the difference between these two things were recognised, as it ought to be, the difficulties as to present exercises would be greatly diminished.<a name=111:6></a> Some seem to fear that the first is in danger of being given up.<a name=111:7></a> No one has any thought of giving it up; it is the supreme joy and strength of faith.<a name=111:8></a> But what is said or done in public should be in keeping with the public position, which is that of a few feeble individuals seeking to walk together in the truth in the midst of assembly ruin and confessing that ruin.<a name=111:9></a> Hence if brethren feel it comely to say that they "withdraw" from a wicked person I cannot regard such action as an evil so great that it ought to be separated from.<a name=111:10></a> It is, at any rate, safe ground to take, as based on a clear divine principle of universal application.<a name=111:11></a> And it is unpretentious, and consistent with a condition of things when, admittedly, "there is no corporate body that we can look to".<a name=111:12></a> It is acting on a broad divine principle which is clearly available even in the most extreme conditions of weakness, and it surrenders nothing unless it be the claim to act publicly as having church position and the presence and power of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=111:13></a> But surely all saints would agree that this latter, as I have remarked already, is to be known today as the comfort and support of faith <i>within</i>, rather than taken up as giving a status or authority to be claimed <i>without</i>.<a name=111:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust that brethren will be patient, and prayerfully consider the principles involved.<a name=111:15></a> If the Lord be waited on and confided in I have no doubt as to the result.<a name=111:16></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The question as to responsibility, which occasioned a good deal of controversy some five years ago, arose through some remarks made at a brothers' reading in London.<a name=112:21></a> These remarks were to the effect that if the assembly had not failed in its responsibility it would not be translated.<a name=112:22></a> This seemed to many of us a very strange statement, and it was challenged.<a name=112:23></a> Much discussion followed, mainly turning on the question as to whether complete failure in responsibility

		... I believe the Lord allowed the question to be raised to call attention to the divine provision -- in the gift of the Spirit -- for saints to be found in wilderness conditions according to the pleasure of God.<a name=113:7></a> It had been seen clearly that man in the flesh was a complete ruin, and that on the line of purpose man was set up in perfection in Christ outside responsibility altogether.<a name=113:8></a> But it was not so clear in many minds that the grace of God, and the power of His kingdom, had come in to bring believers under the moral sway of God, and to give them divine capability in the Spirit to answer to His will in the sphere of responsibility.<a name=113:9></a> So that Christianity, looked at according to God's mind, does not contemplate failure in responsibility, but the fulfilment of responsibility.<a name=113:10></a> It is not a question of whether I or anyone else has done it perfectly -- we know that in many things we all offend -- but of the true character of the present dispensation of God.<a name=113:11></a>

		I should suppose that it was intended to convey that the predominant suggestion in the Supper is the Lord's death as the witness of His love.<a name=113:18></a> It is for the calling of <i>Himself</i> to mind.<a name=113:19></a> In instituting it the Lord had in view the making present to the affections of His own during His absence -- all that He had been as amongst them in the service of love,

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I am sorry that you have had a difficulty with regard to the paragraph in the little volume on Genesis (page 202) to which you refer.<a name=114:12></a> I certainly had no thought of putting off the Lord's coming.<a name=114:13></a> I rather intended to call attention to that blessed work of God by which it is being brought spiritually near to many hearts at the present moment.<a name=114:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think if you will be good enough to read the paragraph again you will see that the subject which is being dwelt upon, as suggested by <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26">Genesis  26</a>, is that of spiritual revival.<a name=114:15></a> And, in connection with this, attention is called to the fact that at the end of the Revelation the Spirit and the bride are found in concert, saying, Come.<a name=114:16></a> And it is said that on the side of divine working everything is moving to this end.<a name=114:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was ever true from the standpoint of what is presented in Scripture as the hope of the saints that the Lord might come at any moment.<a name=114:18></a> This was as true five hundred years
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ago as it is at this moment.<a name=115:1></a> The promise was there just as it is for us.<a name=115:2></a> But <i>all</i> the virgins slumbered.<a name=115:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now to take account of a further fact.<a name=115:4></a> Not only is the promise of the Lord's coming presented in the fullest and clearest way in Scripture, but God has actually intervened in the way of revival.<a name=115:5></a> We must recognise a divine and spiritual movement such as is suggested by the midnight cry, and the subsequent awakening of the virgins and trimming of their lamps.<a name=115:6></a> And all this in view of the virgins being "ready" when the Bridegroom comes.<a name=115:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That what people call the Reformation was the beginning of this revival I suppose few spiritual persons would question.<a name=115:8></a> And it has continued and deepened ever since, until in the last century the truth of Christ's headship and of the presence of the Spirit was revived, giving back to the faith and affections of the saints the peculiar and distinctive place of the assembly.<a name=115:9></a> All this has been in view of the development, through divine working, of moral state and bridal affections in the saints.<a name=115:10></a> And God is carrying on this blessed work, as well as calling sinners in grace to the knowledge of Himself as a Saviour God.<a name=115:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The recognition of this does not surely put the Lord's coming off, but it awakens a deep and intelligent interest in what God is doing at the present moment in view of His coming.<a name=115:12></a> And, indeed, it is only as that blessed reviving goes on in our souls that the coming of the Lord is spiritually near to us.<a name=115:13></a> Many thousands now profess to hold that the Lord may come at any moment, but it needs divine revival to make this blessed hope a divine and effective reality.<a name=115:14></a> And it is a comfort and encouragement to see that God is specially working in the way of revival.<a name=115:15></a> It moves the heart with desire to be found in the current of what He is doing.<a name=115:16></a> One would wish all saints to be conscious that they are living in a time of wondrous revival, that their exercise might be to get the full gain of it.<a name=115:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that the present revival has remnant character, but the remnant, viewed properly, includes all that is for God, and what God is doing in reviving grace and power has, I believe, "all saints" in view.<a name=115:18></a> All that is given from the Head is really for the whole body, and nothing less, and it should be regarded in this light.<a name=115:19></a> How far <i>all</i> -- or indeed any of us -- have been affected by it is another matter, and one of exercise for both conscience and heart.<a name=115:20></a> But we cannot tell
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=116>[Page 116]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		how God can spread abroad what is of Himself, and give it a place in the hearts of His saints.<a name=116:1></a> It is like a stone dropped into a pond which makes widening circles to the very circumference.<a name=116:2></a> I suppose there is scarcely an exercised saint anywhere who has not benefited in some way by what was ministered through J.<a name=116:3></a>N.<a name=116:4></a>D.<a name=116:5></a>, though many of them have never even heard his name.<a name=116:6></a> As cherishing the thought of the assembly one would not in one's affections limit the blessed reviving which God is granting to anything less than the whole body.<a name=116:7></a> It is intended in divine love to affect all saints.<a name=116:8></a>
	</div>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=116:19></a>.<a name=116:20></a>.<a name=116:21></a> When the question came up about the notices I was not at first much impressed by the desirability of mentioning them at the commencement of the meeting.<a name=116:22></a> But the raising of the question led me to consider whether the Lord might not have something to say in the exercise, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		certain things have tended to confirm the thought that it is so.<a name=117:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we have for a long time been freed from the thought that assembly privilege could be brought to a formal conclusion.<a name=117:2></a> We have realised a little, I trust, that in having the gain of Christ's headship, and in tasting the joy of association with Him in the presence of His God and Father, we are touching what is eternal.<a name=117:3></a> We cannot at present remain always together in the enjoyment of this privilege, but to suppose that it could be formally concluded would suggest that its true character and blessedness had not been entered into.<a name=117:4></a> Hence the concluding prayer -- so general forty years ago -- has dropped out.<a name=117:5></a> I do not think it desirable that the reading of notices should <i>practically</i> take its place as a formal dismissal.<a name=117:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It cannot be said, I think, that the notices form no part of the meeting, and that they come in after the meeting is quite over.<a name=117:7></a> This would fail to give them their true place and importance.<a name=117:8></a> So far as they relate to order and administration they form an integral part of what is connected with being "together in assembly".<a name=117:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then at what part of the meeting is it most suitable that they should be introduced?<a name=117:10></a> Are they not more in keeping with the conditions in which we "come together in assembly", and the order which pertains to that coming together, than they are with the place of spiritual privilege to which we may be led in association with Christ as Head in the midst of the assembly?<a name=117:11></a> I think upon consideration, most would feel that they belong to the former rather than the latter.<a name=117:12></a> The question is, whether they should have their place there, or whether we should formally return, after perhaps enjoying our place as Christ's brethren and as sons with Him, to that which pertains to assembly order here?<a name=117:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There might occasionally be notices of a sad or sorrowful nature, but the Lord would not have such things ignored.<a name=117:14></a> They have to be taken account of in the assembly as incidental to the conditions which exist in the place from which He is absent, and where our hearts are "with woe familiar".<a name=117:15></a> His priestly grace may be counted on to afford the help that is needed to free the spirits of His saints in connection with such things, as from other conditions which surround us here.<a name=117:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust that brethren may move happily together in this exercise with consideration for the Lord and for one another,

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- Many thanks for yours of the 15th inst.<a name=118:4></a> This is just a line to let you know that we enjoyed our week's visit to Weymouth.<a name=118:5></a> We were able to call and see most of the saints, and we had three readings in the Room.<a name=118:6></a> On Saturday we looked at our place as sons and as little children.<a name=118:7></a> On Tuesday we had -- because they expressed a local exercise as to it -- the subject of fellowship.<a name=118:8></a> Then on Wednesday we considered a little the Lord's supper.<a name=118:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on Thursday we moved on to Yeovil, and had a reading there.<a name=118:13></a> We looked at the fellowship (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>) as that which is provided for <i>man</i> for complete deliverance from the idolatrous world, and then at the Supper (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>) as securing an affectionate place for <i>the Lord</i> here when His headship can be realised.<a name=118:14></a> I was feeling very tired and not up to much, but I trust there was help.<a name=118:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#9">Leviticus  9</a>answered more to the blessing side of the fellowship as seen in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>.<a name=118:16></a> I think the sanctuary sometimes means the holiest, and sometimes the whole tabernacle, but in the latter case it is the whole viewed as taking character from the holiest where God dwells.<a name=118:17></a> The failure of the sons of Aaron was really the breakdown of the whole system, and hence <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>takes up -- or rather suggests -- what is known in full result in Christianity and Israel's true blessing in another day also.<a name=118:18></a>

		MY DEAR --, -- It is a long time since I heard anything of you, and as you came rather specially before me today I thought I would write to ask how you are.<a name=119:1></a> I trust you are preserved in a fair measure of health during this time of much sickness, and that the Lord keeps Himself before your heart, and gives you continual joy in Himself and in the precious thoughts of His love.<a name=119:2></a> How sweet to know that all those thoughts were the Father's thoughts, committed to the Son to be brought into effect!<a name=119:3></a> If each of us can say, "The Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me", He did so because it was the Father's will that He should do so.<a name=119:4></a> And so with every service of love that He delights to render us.<a name=119:5></a> He would have us to trace it all to the Father, that the Father might become to our hearts the Source of all, and that in the consciousness of this we might cry, "Abba, Father!<a name=119:6></a>" The gospel of John shows us how the Lord put the Father before the hearts of His disciples as the One who had sent Him, and as the One who had communicated all to Him that He made known to them; as the One whose words He spoke and whose works He did.<a name=119:7></a> What a joy it was to Him to be able to say to the Father, of them, "Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee; for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received them, and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:7">John  17:7</a>, 8.<a name=119:8></a> Those who truly love the Lord have peculiar pleasure in seeing what was of such precious interest to Him, and in yielding themselves to be led into that knowledge of the Father which is essential if we are to be "for him", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>.<a name=119:9></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=122:10></a>.<a name=122:11></a>.<a name=122:12></a> I can sympathise with your exercise as to the question of paying rates for meeting rooms, as some years back the same exercise arose in my mind, and I was much inclined to think that it would be well to pay them and avoid any appearance of being favoured in a religious way by the government of the country.<a name=122:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I must say that further consideration of this matter, and more information as to how it really stands in the law of the country, lead me to doubt whether anything in the way of divine principle is really involved.<a name=122:14></a> It has seemed good to the powers that be to decide that buildings used for religious purposes shall not be liable to payment of rates.<a name=122:15></a> This is their ordinance, with the making of which we had nothing to do.<a name=122:16></a> We did not seek it, but if they say that a building used for what they call religious service shall be exempt from rates it is clearly not according to the law of the land that rates should be paid for such a building.<a name=122:17></a> That this is a certain benefit to us is clear, but so is also the liberty to meet at all.<a name=122:18></a> We value the latter privilege, and gladly use it as granted to us in the mercy of God through His ordering by way of the laws which secure to us this liberty.<a name=122:19></a> We own with thankfulness that government takes a course in this respect which is very favourable to us, and it is different from what obtains in some countries.<a name=122:20></a>

		If the non-payment of rates necessitated that we should take the place of a religious denomination we might well have serious misgivings about it.<a name=123:1></a> But the law distinctly recognises those who decline to be known by any particular name, and extends to them the exemption from rates.<a name=123:2></a> This exemption does not put those to whom it applies under any obligation to the State.<a name=123:3></a> It does not confer upon them any claim to State-aid, nor are they even required to have the voting lists affixed to their doors.<a name=123:4></a> I am aware that this is often done, and it gives the impression that the building is in some way part of the machinery of the State.<a name=123:5></a> But I am informed that the law which requires this only applies to chapels of the Established Church, and that the authorities have no right to affix them to the doors of other buildings.<a name=123:6></a>

		At that time those in the sects were marked individually and collectively by a very considerable degree of separation from the world, and by much true devotedness; they preserved in large measure purity of doctrine as to fundamental truth.<a name=126:10></a> Before the movement of separation began it is obvious that whatever light there was, or whatever faithfulness or testimony there was, was found in those bodies.<a name=126:11></a> There were "a few names" in Sardis of whom the Lord could say that they had not defiled their garments, and that they should walk with Him in white, for they were worthy.<a name=126:12></a> Such had preserved in holy integrity what was consistent with the truth so far as they knew it.<a name=126:13></a> If there had not been such, there would have been no material suited to receive the Lord's further testimony.<a name=126:14></a> But there was material out of which something truly Philadelphian in character could be formed as ministry was given from Christ as Head.<a name=126:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not learn from Scripture that it has ever been God's way to suddenly disown, or break the link with, what has been, in its day, of Himself when He brings in further and greater light.<a name=126:16></a> He acts in patient consideration for His people.<a name=126:17></a> He respects, if one may so say, His former ways.<a name=126:18></a> He has regard to that which He may have been pleased to use even though it fell short of what was in His mind.<a name=126:19></a> It was so when Judaism was superseded by Christianity; there was a transition period during which the separation between the old and the new was not definite.<a name=126:20></a> The faithful remnant entered into the blessings of the new order without altogether severing themselves from the former system -- now really set aside by God.<a name=126:21></a> It was not until the epistle to the Hebrews was written that they were definitely called to "go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach".<a name=126:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a certain analogy between what the epistle to the Hebrews was to the believing remnant of Israel, then made partakers of the heavenly calling, and what 2 Timothy is to us as calling us into separation from those things in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christian profession which are not suitable to the present testimony of God, and which largely have the character of Judaism.<a name=127:1></a> But the application of 2 Timothy was accompanied by much consideration -- which was, I believe, at the time, of the Spirit of God -- for faithful and pious souls, even though they were not fully prepared to take the path of complete separation to the Lord.<a name=127:2></a> The practice of eighty or ninety years ago was probably, at that time, of the Lord, for it was important to make manifest that the spiritual movement was in no way a sectarian one, but that it opened up a path, through divine favour, for all saints.<a name=127:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But every exercised Christian must see that there is an immense and solemn change in the whole condition of things since those days.<a name=127:4></a> Evil has come in like a flood; there has been no power to keep it out of religious bodies; all kinds of leavening influences are at work.<a name=127:5></a> No grave and exercised mind can be unaware of the tremendous change.<a name=127:6></a> It calls imperatively for greatly increased vigilance and care on the part of those who desire through grace to maintain what is due to the Lord, and to preserve a purity of associations which shall be in keeping with the truth of God's assembly, and with the principles of <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>.<a name=127:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it must not be overlooked that if there has been a terrible down-grade movement affecting more or less all the organised bodies, there has been another movement marked by the following of righteousness, faith, love, peace, and by calling on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=127:8></a> It is evident that the breach between these two movements must necessarily have been widening all the time.<a name=127:9></a> The separation between them becomes continually more definitely marked.<a name=127:10></a> And I have no doubt that this is felt, and that it has the effect of restraining persons from wishing to break bread who are not prepared to break their links with what is, in the light of Scripture, unrighteous.<a name=127:11></a> So that it becomes increasingly rare for any to wish to break bread while still retaining their links with the systems.<a name=127:12></a> I think the incompatibility of the two positions is felt by many who have not even seriously weighed the reasons for it.<a name=127:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Things can only be maintained for God as we act on the principles laid down in 2 Timothy.<a name=127:14></a> The two-fold seal of God's foundation is that "The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw

		from iniquity".<a name=128:1></a> We cannot have Christian fellowship in any definite or practical sense except on this line.<a name=128:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God works by the ministry of what is positive -- by the truth.<a name=128:3></a> Certain things have been seen to be evil, and they have been withdrawn from because they have been judged in the light of the positive truth.<a name=128:4></a> The lordship and headship of Christ, the presence of the Holy Spirit, the truth of the body and the house, the divine order of the assembly, the spiritual character of all that is for God's pleasure, the heavenly calling of the saints, and much more that might be mentioned in detail, are the great and precious realities by which saints have been revived and moved in these last days.<a name=128:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the light of these things the present condition of the Christian profession generally has been discerned to be one of great departure from the truth, and this we have to humbly own as having our part in the responsibility of it.<a name=128:6></a> But the instructions of 2 Timothy have provided an open door by which to escape from things which are inconsistent with the truth, and with the fellowship to which believers are called.<a name=128:7></a> This open door is available for all saints.<a name=128:8></a> The truth of the fellowship is only known practically as we avail ourselves of it.<a name=128:9></a> The fellowship of God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, and of the body and blood of Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, and of the apostles, is the only fellowship which Scripture recognises as being a divine one.<a name=128:10></a> It is because the truth of this fellowship could not be realised in systems characterised by human order and clerical office, or where a sectarian bond was recognised or boasted in, that so many have definitely separated from such systems.<a name=128:11></a> Souls have been freed from these things by the power of positive truth, as they have moved after Christ, and after what is of God, with a desire to realise the true position and wealth of the assembly in the Holy Spirit.<a name=128:12></a> And in proportion as there has been separation to Christ, and giving place to the Holy Spirit as practically recognising His presence and action in the saints, there has been great enlargement in the communication and apprehension of the truth concerning Christ and the assembly.<a name=128:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible to say that there is anything sectarian about this.<a name=128:14></a> It is a path clearly indicated in 2 Timothy, and it is open to all saints, and every one who has truly found that path would earnestly wish that all saints might also be found in it.<a name=128:15></a> And there is an unrestricted ministry of positive divine

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every Christian is divinely called to the fellowship; it is there for every one who has faith and affection to take it up.<a name=129:3></a> And I think it must be admitted that being true to the fellowship morally precedes the eating of the Lord's supper together.<a name=129:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>precedes <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>.<a name=129:5></a> We get first "the teaching and fellowship of the apostles"; then "breaking of bread and prayers", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>.<a name=129:6></a> But the truth of the fellowship clearly raises the question of associations.<a name=129:7></a> It did so at the beginning.<a name=129:8></a> How much more so -- may we not say?<a name=129:9></a> -- in the midst of all the confusion of the last days.<a name=129:10></a> Can there be any doubt that 2 Timothy is given to us as a special guidance for the last days?<a name=129:11></a> And does it not raise the question of associations very definitely?<a name=129:12></a> It is a powerful divine call to take heed to our moral condition, and to look well to our associations.<a name=129:13></a>

		In the last days fidelity becomes of the utmost importance and the faithful word must have its place.<a name=129:14></a> "For if we have died together with him, we shall also live together; if we endure, we shall also reign together", etc.<a name=129:15></a>, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=129:16></a> It is needful to purify oneself from vessels to dishonour in separating from them, if one would be a vessel to honour.<a name=129:17></a> And we are to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=129:18></a> I would submit that the title of any Christian to be received to partake of the Lord's supper has now to be conditioned by the principles laid down in 2 Timothy.<a name=129:19></a> Our companying with saints is clearly to be on those lines.<a name=129:20></a> This raises grave considerations as to how far those should be received to the eating of the Lord's supper who are obviously not maintaining fidelity to the truth of the fellowship.<a name=129:21></a> To partake of the one loaf and to drink of the one cup is the most intimate and holy expression of our participation in the fellowship.<a name=129:22></a> It is a serious thing for any to commit themselves in a most solemn act to a fellowship which in their minds they are not prepared to take up.<a name=129:23></a>

		No doubt many look upon the Lord's supper merely as individual privilege and do not consider that it involves any definite fellowship.<a name=130:1></a> But it is really the most definite commitment to the fellowship, and to all that the fellowship involves.<a name=130:2></a> To sign a deed of partnership is a serious matter even in human things; how much more so in the holy things of God!<a name=130:3></a> If souls are not prepared for the path of separation from evil, in the light and blessedness of all the good that is of God, they would do well to wait upon the Lord until they are assured as to the path in which He would have them to walk.<a name=130:4></a>

		Members of religious bodies stand publicly committed to the acts of those bodies, and these are often such as to raise a question as to whether those who remain identified with them could be regarded as calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=130:5></a> Not, of course, forgetting that we can only take account of what becomes manifest, and of what persons are identified with in public profession.<a name=130:6></a> Present-day conditions call for careful and godly door-keeping.<a name=130:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a further serious aspect of this question which we have to face.<a name=130:8></a> The course of the testimony during the last hundred years has been attended by many conflicts.<a name=130:9></a> And succeeding separations have tested the saints, and have left permanent results in a form that is sorrowful and humiliating, but which cannot be ignored.<a name=130:10></a> We cannot now say that we are free to receive Christians without raising any question as to their associations.<a name=130:11></a> It would mean confusion and looseness, and would commit us to the practical acceptance of principles which we believe to be contrary to divine assembly order, and to the honour of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=130:12></a> So far as we have learned the mind of God we wish to maintain it in a practical way.<a name=130:13></a> The principles which govern the fellowship are universal and abiding.<a name=130:14></a> They have had to be maintained in times of conflict at the cost of separation from many brethren.<a name=130:15></a> But it is impossible to accept identification with principles which we have definitely separated from as not being of God.<a name=130:16></a> The door is widely open for any to acknowledge the divine principles which they may have formerly refused.<a name=130:17></a> But to receive them without this would be to deprive them of the spiritual gain of the exercise which the Lord permitted to be raised.<a name=130:18></a>

		At the beginning of each Gospel attention is called to the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, as the One who would baptise with, or in, the Holy Spirit.<a name=132:2></a> It is particularly pointed out that this action would characterise Him.<a name=132:3></a> After His death, resurrection, and ascension to the right hand of God we find Peter saying, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>; and he connects this with the call of God.<a name=132:4></a> "For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call".<a name=132:5></a> There is sometimes a tendency to lose sight of divine calling in relation to the gift of the Holy Spirit, but it is the called ones of God who receive this gift.<a name=132:6></a> Certain conditions come in on man's side, such as repentance, faith, obedience, purity of heart, love, desire for the Spirit, but the call of God lies behind all these things.<a name=132:7></a> God calls persons in His sovereign mercy and love that He may give them His Holy Spirit.<a name=132:8></a> The effect of divine calling is that repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ are produced in the soul.<a name=132:9></a> Obedience, purification of heart by faith, and love for the Lord Jesus Christ are brought into evidence in the called ones.<a name=132:10></a> It is sometimes as difficult to say which feature manifests itself first as it is to say which spoke of a wheel moves first.<a name=132:11></a>

		It is helpful to view this subject from the divine side.<a name=132:12></a> "Not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>, 6.<a name=132:13></a> The death of Christ is the ground on which the Spirit is given, as we see in type in the smiting of the rock, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:6">Exodus  17:6</a>.<a name=132:14></a> The proposal to give the Spirit was on God's part; the promise of the Spirit is to all whom He calls; and He gives the Spirit through Jesus Christ, and in virtue of the death of Christ.<a name=132:15></a>

		The epistle to the Romans sets forth in an orderly way the truth of the glad tidings, and its effects in the souls of men.<a name=133:8></a> And we find that at the point reached in the early verses of chapter 5 the believer has received the gift of the Spirit.<a name=133:9></a> "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us", verse 5.<a name=133:10></a> There is not a word about the Spirit being given until the believer is justified by faith and has peace with God, righteousness being reckoned to him.<a name=133:11></a> Then immediately we find the Spirit busy in the heart, having been given to shed abroad the love of God there.<a name=133:12></a>

		Even as to the reception of the Spirit, and the conditions to be found in those to whom He is given, how varied are the presentations in the New Testament!<a name=136:3></a> Repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, baptism in His Name, the reception of remission of sins through believing on Him, believing the report of faith, trusting in Christ as having heard the word of the truth and having believed the glad tidings of salvation, the being sons by faith in Christ Jesus, are seen as conditions in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>; 10: 44; 19: 2 - 7; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:2">Galatians  3:2</a>; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>.<a name=136:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a> and <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a> prayer is the condition, and in this connection it is of interest to note that it was on Jesus "praying" that the Holy Spirit descended (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:21">Luke  3:21</a>, 22), that it was after ten days of "continual prayer" that the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost, and that Cornelius had been "supplicating God continually", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:2">Acts  10:2</a>.<a name=136:5></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a> the Spirit is spoken of as given to those who <i>believe</i> on Jesus; in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a> He is given to those who <i>obey</i> Him; in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:15">John  14:15</a>, 16 to those who <i>love</i> Him.<a name=136:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:8">Acts  15:8</a>, 9, the gift of the Spirit is God's witness to hearts which He has purified by faith.<a name=136:7></a> These varied presentations are to be taken account of, for they show clearly that even the reception of the Spirit is not always viewed in the same aspect, and this would preserve us from thinking of any one condition in too rigid a way to the exclusion of the others.<a name=136:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Cornelius and his friends were the first-fruits to be received from the Gentile world, and one would conclude that their case might justly be regarded as a pattern of how the Gentiles would receive the Spirit.<a name=136:9></a> We see moral conditions there: Cornelius was pious; he feared God with all his house; he gave much alms to the people; and he supplicated God continually.<a name=136:10></a> God chose that they should by Peter's mouth hear the word of the glad tidings and believe.<a name=136:11></a> The Holy Spirit fell upon them even before they were baptised, while Peter was speaking the words, "To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes on him will receive

		I quite believe that many persons who fear God have not received the Spirit.<a name=137:4></a> But such are not yet in true Christian blessing.<a name=137:5></a> They need the gospel.<a name=137:6></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is presented to men in the glad tidings in all His trustworthiness as the One in whom God delights, the One who has completely glorified God in bearing the judgment due to sinners, the One whom God has now raised from among the dead, and given to be the Mediator -- the glorious Administrator -- of all His grace to sinful men.<a name=137:7></a> Believing on God, and on the Lord Jesus Christ, as thus made known in the glad tidings, they will assuredly receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=137:8></a> God delights to put His divine Seal on the faith that thus honours Him and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=137:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John's gospel the conditions leading to the reception of the Spirit are thirst, and the coming to Jesus to get that thirst quenched.<a name=137:10></a> The Spirit does not come in there in relation to the forgiveness of sins, or justification and peace, but as the divine answer to the unsatisfied state of a heart that craves the knowledge of God.<a name=137:11></a> For this there must be a personal transaction with Jesus.<a name=137:12></a> He alone can give living water; the thirsting one must come to Him and drink, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a>; 7: 37 - 39.<a name=137:13></a>

		DEAR --, -- In answer to your letter of the 3rd inst.<a name=143:10></a> asking what is meant by the expression, "the good of reconciliation", in one of my books, I may say that I understand this to mean that the soul is in full accord with the precious divine truth of reconciliation.<a name=143:11></a> God has reconciled us to Himself through the death of His Son.<a name=143:12></a> He has removed from before Him everything about us that was unsuitable to Himself.<a name=143:13></a> He would have us in His presence completely divested of all those features which gave Him no pleasure -- features which came in by our connection with the fallen man.<a name=143:14></a> Everything connected with that condition has been completely judged and sacrificially removed in the body of Christ's flesh through death.<a name=143:15></a> It has no place now before God.<a name=143:16></a> We are with Him on the footing of Christ, and of what has been effected in the death of Christ.<a name=143:17></a> This has in view our being presented holy and unblamable and irreproachable before the Fulness of the Godhead (See <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>).<a name=143:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to be in the good of this would imply that our souls have come by the work of God into accord with His mind.<a name=144:1></a> We have judged that all those moral features which we derived from Adam fallen are displeasurable to God, and we are thankful to know that they have been removed in a death of infinite value, which has glorified God, and set Him free to have us before Him according to the good pleasure which He has found in Christ.<a name=144:2></a> It now becomes our exercise and joy to refuse practically all those things which have been the outcome of our condition of alienation and enmity, and to give place to those blessed features of Christ in which God delights.<a name=144:3></a> This is a matter of continual exercise; it involves the cleansing ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, and the perfecting of holiness in the fear of God.<a name=144:4></a> It is not brought about all at once, but is the product of an exercise worked out in dependence upon God, and by His Spirit, through which we purify ourselves even as Christ is pure, knowing that we have been taken up to be fully conformed to Him eternally.<a name=144:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has effected reconciliation so that He might have us before Him completely detached from what came in by Adam, and invested with the beauty of Christ.<a name=144:6></a> As we come spiritually into the good and gain of this it leads to the refusal of what is not Christ in a practical way, and to the putting on of the beautiful features of Christ.<a name=144:7></a> The end in view is that nothing may appear in us but what is of Christ.<a name=144:8></a> This will be fully attained in conditions of glory, but it becomes the pleasure of the saint to move morally in that direction now.<a name=144:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		those in the family of the one in regard to whom this exercise has arisen, are happy as to the associations in which she is at present found.<a name=146:1></a> I should fully share the exercises of the brethren in regard to this, and should have serious doubts as to whether the holding an official place in such a movement could be regarded as consistent with a desire to be in separation to the Lord, and to walk in the truth of Christian fellowship.<a name=146:2></a> My exercise as to this would be intensified if the applicant had had opportunity of being instructed in the truth.<a name=146:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If one who was identified with such an organisation asked to break bread I should certainly feel it right to raise the question of her associations, and to seek to exercise her on the line that the truth of fellowship precedes the truth of the Lord's supper, and that there is but one fellowship recognised by the Spirit of God.<a name=146:4></a> I should consider that it was for the good of the applicant to raise this question, with a view to her disentanglement from an association that could not be spiritually helpful.<a name=146:5></a> And I should expect the raising of the question to lead to a clearer apprehension of the nature of Christian fellowship.<a name=146:6></a> In many cases the only thought is to break bread in remembrance of the Lord, but it is well that souls should understand that they are divinely called to a fellowship or partnership, and that they definitely commit themselves to that fellowship in breaking bread, and that it raises the question of all their associations.<a name=146:7></a> It is a bond to which we have to be true at all times.<a name=146:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have never ceased to be thankful for the months I was kept waiting when I desired to break bread.<a name=146:9></a> It taught me to judge my own will, and the workings of my mind, and to see the importance of subjection to the Lord, in a way that was a great blessing to me.<a name=146:10></a> Such things become a test as to whether we are prepared to be in subjection as those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=146:11></a> If I only want His will and way it simplifies everything wonderfully.<a name=146:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it must be admitted that an organisation of a semi-religious character stands on quite a different footing from what is merely educational, or of the nature of personal influence.<a name=147:7></a> To be formally connected with such an association I should regard as a very serious entanglement for a Christian.<a name=147:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot but feel concerned to learn that the exercise which the brethren have had on this matter has not been appreciated by the relatives of the young sister, and that there is even a possibility of their ceasing to break bread with us on this account.<a name=147:9></a> This looks very much as if <i>they</i> might be ready to make this association a "test of fellowship" by insisting on its acceptance by brethren.<a name=147:10></a> They cannot surely think that to maintain liberty to belong to an organisation of this kind is of greater importance and value than the privileges connected with the fellowship!<a name=147:11></a>

		With reference to the case of a sister who refuses to meet another sister desiring to break bread I think she ought to do so, or furnish the brethren with some valid reason for her refusal.<a name=147:12></a>

		For some time there has been desire for a further revision of the hymn book, but nothing of a very definite nature has been done in the matter so far as I know.<a name=147:13></a> It is very probable that there are hymns now which it would be a spiritual gain to have available, and there is room for some revision of those in the present book.<a name=147:14></a> I do not think brethren are the least bit inclined to take up "fanciful ideas".<a name=147:15></a> I believe there is an increasing desire to subject things very carefully to the test of Scripture.<a name=147:16></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was much interested in your letter and in the local exercise to which it referred, and am sorry to have been unable to send you a line in reply until now.<a name=155:1></a> I have more than once looked to the Lord to guide and help you in dealing with the matter, and I have no doubt He will do so.<a name=155:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can sympathise with the feeling of <i>difficulty</i>, for I know by experience that it is not easy to arrive at a clear and definite judgment as to how far the Lord would have the element of compassion to weigh in cases where there is evidently a want of mental balance.<a name=155:3></a> I think these cases cast us much on the Lord that we may really get His mind and act with Him in reference to them.<a name=155:4></a> I have noticed, more particularly of late, how often there is a mental, or semi-mental, side to cases which exercise the brethren.<a name=155:5></a> I have no doubt that the enemy seeks to take advantage of mental abnormality to introduce moral disorder.<a name=155:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If a person is quite irresponsible he is hardly a subject for disciplinary action, but rather for medical care and restraint.<a name=155:7></a> Such cases have simply to be accepted as a sorrowful and humbling discipline.<a name=155:8></a> But the <i>difficulty</i> is more of a test when, along with moral disorder of a pronounced kind, there is sufficient sanity to pursue in large measure the ordinary duties of life.<a name=155:9></a> There may be much irrationality without irresponsibility.<a name=155:10></a> And there is a point when things pass from the stage in which they can be regarded compassionately as being the outcome of mental derangement, or in which they can be dealt with by admonition, to the stage in which it may be needful for the honour of the Lord's Name, and to maintain the holiness which becomes God's house, that the saints should pronounce a definite judgment of assembly character upon them.<a name=155:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the saints are called upon to judge, their judgment must necessarily proceed on moral grounds.<a name=155:12></a> Priestly discernment puts "difference between the holy -- and the unholy, and between unclean and clean", <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#10:10">Leviticus  10:10</a>.<a name=155:13></a> I do not see that we are called upon to fix the exact amount of personal responsibility in every case, for this is often -- as you say -- only known to God.<a name=155:14></a> The judgment of the saints must be in reference to what is suitable to God, and to those amongst whom He dwells.<a name=155:15></a> I have thought that <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5">Numbers  5</a>-- which has been under your consideration -- is important in its bearing on a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=156>[Page 156]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		certain cases.<a name=156:1></a> In Leviticus there is nothing said about the one with an issue, or defiled by the dead, being put out of the camp.<a name=156:2></a> The uncleanness of the issue is emphasised that a moral judgment may be formed as to it.<a name=156:3></a> But when the camps of Israel are definitely set in relation to "the tabernacle of the tent of testimony" it becomes imperative that those camps be not defiled "in the midst whereof I dwell".<a name=156:4></a> The thought of being defiled by the dead is, previously to Numbers, only suggested, I believe, in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#21">Leviticus  21</a>, where the priests are not to make themselves unclean for a dead person, save an immediate relation.<a name=156:5></a> But in Numbers this thought is somewhat prominent (Numbers chapters 5, 19, 15), and it gives occasion to the striking statute in regard to the red heifer.<a name=156:6></a> It is now a question of what defiles the camps in the midst of which God dwells, and of defiling the tabernacle of Jehovah (19: 13), and the sanctuary of Jehovah (19: 20).<a name=156:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It strikes me that the instruction of this is important.<a name=156:8></a> The leper would be one in whom the will of the flesh was active in a marked way.<a name=156:9></a> The one with an issue would represent, as I suppose, an unrestrained manifestation of what one was naturally, but something less serious morally than leprosy.<a name=156:10></a> But to be defiled by the dead would be often, in the conditions of the wilderness, inevitable, so that, it seems to me, this case emphasises not the responsibility of the individual but the question of what is suitable to God and to the holiness of His dwelling.<a name=156:11></a> Things being taken account of from this standpoint, all three classes were to be put out of the camp, though they doubtless would represent three different degrees of personal responsibility.<a name=156:12></a> Neither the "camps", the "tabernacle", nor the "sanctuary" are to be defiled, and what does, or does not, defile is to be discerned according to a spiritual estimate of its moral character as under the eye of God.<a name=156:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know that I have, at present, anything more definite in the way of light from Scripture to suggest.<a name=156:14></a> It does not add anything to what you have already had before you.<a name=156:15></a> But I am glad to share a little in your exercises.<a name=156:16></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, The burial of the Lord Jesus is clearly -- from <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:4">1 Corinthians  15:4</a> -- an integral part of the glad tidings, and I believe it to be connected with the "until thou return to the ground" of the divine sentence in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:19">Genesis  3:19</a>.<a name=157:1></a> Man, after the order of Adam, was not only to die, but to "return to the ground".<a name=157:2></a> He was taken out of it, and now -- having become a fallen and sinful creature -- he would return to it.<a name=157:3></a> How marked and explicit is the extent of the divine judgment!<a name=157:4></a> It reminds man of his origin, and shows him that he has by sin forfeited his whole status with God as a creature, so that he goes back by the judgment of God to the ground from which he was taken.<a name=157:5></a> His returning to the ground does not come in merely in an incidental way; it is definitely part of the divine sentence on the fallen man.<a name=157:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the Lord says, "For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:40">Matthew  12:40</a>.<a name=157:7></a> And in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:9">Ephesians  4:9</a> we read, "But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?<a name=157:8></a> He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=157:9></a> The Lord Jesus has not only died, but He has been in the heart of the earth.<a name=157:10></a> He has descended into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=157:11></a> I believe this to have direct reference to the sentence upon the fallen man.<a name=157:12></a> The Holy One of God has taken up in infinite grace, and for the glory of God, the whole condition of the fallen man, and the sentence passed upon that man.<a name=157:13></a> He has taken it up vicariously, though altogether free personally -- as we well know -- from the sin which He bore sacrificially, and from the penalties attaching to that sin.<a name=157:14></a> But He has been made sin sacrificially, and He has died, and He has also been buried.<a name=157:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first man was "out of the earth, made of dust", but that man fell and came under penalties, one of which was that he should return to the ground from out of which he was taken.<a name=157:16></a> Now the Second Man out of heaven has taken up in grace those penalties that as the Last Adam He might be a quickening Spirit.<a name=157:17></a> He has died for our sins; He has been made sin for us; He has become subject in grace to all that had passed upon us by reason of sin.<a name=157:18></a> And in the full accomplishment of this for the glory of God, and to secure blessing for us, He has descended into the lower parts of the earth.<a name=157:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is as definitely revealed as any other part of His blessed and perfect work.<a name=158:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consideration of this becomes the basis in our souls of the understanding of those most important statements of Holy Scripture -- "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>; "buried with him in baptism", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=158:2></a> It seems to me that these scriptures clearly intimate that the burial of Christ presents a position in which He has been found, through infinite grace, that had in view the penalty of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>on the one hand, and on the other our accepting that penalty as carried out in His blessed Person so that we might be able to take the ground of being buried with Him.<a name=158:3></a> It was part of what was vicariously undergone by Him that we might be able -- while still alive upon the earth -- to take the ground of burial with Him.<a name=158:4></a> For baptism clearly contemplates not only death but burial.<a name=158:5></a> That He was most blessedly perfect in all -- in life, in death, in burial, in resurrection -- is clearly evident to all who are divinely taught.<a name=158:6></a> He was God's Holy and Anointed One.<a name=158:7></a> But death and burial were man's portion as fallen, and Christ entered into them on man's behalf, thus maintaining what was due to God and the penalty which He had pronounced on the fallen creature, but making death and burial available as a way of blessing in grace for men.<a name=158:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more clearly we see the nature of the penalty, and the full and blessed way in which it has been taken up by Christ, the more shall we be prepared intelligently to occupy the ground on which our baptism has set us.<a name=158:9></a> One feels how good it would be for us all -- for all Christians -- to realise the solemnity of the sentence which has divinely passed upon us as connected with the first and fallen man.<a name=158:10></a> Our place and status are completely forfeited; we are sentenced to death and burial.<a name=158:11></a> There is but one door of hope for us, and that is that God's Anointed has died for us and has been buried.<a name=158:12></a> Both these things speak of the penalty under which we lay.<a name=158:13></a> But resurrection speaks of the glorious power of God acting because of what Christ was, and it speaks, indeed, of the power that was inherent in Christ Himself.<a name=158:14></a> Now we can take the ground in liberty and joy of having died with Christ and being buried with Him.<a name=158:15></a> We can accept the termination in death, and the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The children of believing parents need to be born anew, and to become the subjects of a gracious work of God, just like any others.<a name=160:11></a> For that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and the children of believers have to learn this in their own experience even though they are relatively "holy" as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:14">1 Corinthians  7:14</a> teaches.<a name=160:12></a> They have to learn that in their flesh dwells no good thing.<a name=160:13></a> But in many cases God begins His work very early -- sometimes even from infancy -- and as children grow up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and knowing the Holy Scriptures, like Timothy, from childhood, the divine work in the soul proceeds by almost imperceptible stages.<a name=160:14></a> Conviction of sin is brought about through inward exercises rather than by an outwardly evil course.<a name=160:15></a> God and the Lord Jesus get a more and more definite place in faith and love.<a name=160:16></a> And affections go out to the people of God, and their company is delighted in.<a name=160:17></a> There may be much evidence in this way of a real work of God without there having been any definite point in the history when the soul turned round from

		a course of sin to walk in the ways of the Lord.<a name=161:1></a> Conversion really means turning round; the converted person has been going in one direction, but now he has turned round and is going in the opposite direction.<a name=161:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many of us who have been brought up in Christian homes, and with every spiritual advantage, have from early days turned to our own way, and followed our own fleshly desires, and we have needed to be distinctly converted.<a name=161:3></a> But this is the sorrowful evidence that we have preferred our own will and desires to the control of the Lord.<a name=161:4></a> But if the fear of God is established early in the heart, and through grace there is subjection, the naughty will of the flesh may be judged in secret, and its desires refused.<a name=161:5></a> Then a course would be followed from which one would not need to turn.<a name=161:6></a> Scripture regards the children of believers as being in subjection to their parents, and as being brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, owning His claim and right over them.<a name=161:7></a> From such a course they do not need to be converted.<a name=161:8></a> But this supposes that in God's sovereign mercy He has put His fear in their hearts from early days.<a name=161:9></a> It would not, and could not, be apart from being born anew.<a name=161:10></a> It is this which Christian parents would look to God to effect in their children.<a name=161:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One would not expect that in children of believers there would be in every case evidence of a definite point when they turned round from a course of sin to God.<a name=161:12></a> There often would be this, but not necessarily in every case.<a name=161:13></a> But one would always look for some evidence of true self-judgment -- that it was realised that flesh was sinful flesh -- and that there was a sense of the need of Christ and of His precious sin-bearing work.<a name=161:14></a> One would look for a sense of deserving nothing, and of deep thankfulness to God for bringing in His great salvation in Christ.<a name=161:15></a> It would always, of course, be a matter of much interest to know how any soul had been brought to know the Lord, but this might not always be at a definite turning point which could be marked as the time of conversion.<a name=161:16></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- It is always a pleasure to me to see a line from your pen, and I thank you for your letter.<a name=163:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of "the cup" is so important, and lies so near to the heart of the Lord in relation to His own, that one is glad to have one's attention drawn to it again and again.<a name=163:10></a> I have noticed in relation to the cup that <i>the Lord</i> refers to repeated partaking -- "as often as ye shall drink it" -- suggesting that He had pleasure in contemplating the frequency of its being done.<a name=163:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think there can be any question that it was <i>one</i> vessel which the Lord took when He instituted the Supper, and which He gave to His disciples, saying, "Drink ye all of it", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:27">Matthew  26:27</a>, and of which it is expressly said, "they all drank out of it", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:23">Mark  14:23</a>.<a name=163:12></a> It was expressive of the new and holy communion in which He would set His loved ones together.<a name=163:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That "one loaf" is essential to the communion would be admitted by all intelligent believers, but some seem to think that we can have two or more cups without in any way detracting from the significance of what we do.<a name=163:14></a> But are we justified in thinking so?<a name=163:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=164>[Page 164]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We all realise that a number of little squares of bread do not suggest "one loaf" and that where things are done in this way the thought of the Supper being a communion or fellowship is almost, if not quite, lost, though no doubt in many cases where it is so done there is personal affection for the Lord.<a name=164:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not get the actual words "one cup" in Scripture, but we do get repeatedly "<i>the</i> cup", referring to the vessel of which we are told that at the time of the institution "they all drank out of it".<a name=164:2></a> In doing so their participation in the blessings of the new covenant as a source of divine joy was set forth in a striking and divinely appointed symbol.<a name=164:3></a> They did not enter into it merely as individuals, but as something common to them all.<a name=164:4></a> It was not what people would do naturally, though it may be imitated in other fellowships, and even in demon-worship.<a name=164:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My impression is that <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> has some reference to the Supper, and that all being "given to drink of one Spirit" is a suggestion which has some relation to the cup.<a name=164:6></a> Indeed it is as all drinking of one Spirit that we can alone truly participate in the new covenant.<a name=164:7></a> We are here in a region of most blessed spiritual realities which have their appropriate and divinely appointed symbols in the loaf and the cup.<a name=164:8></a> Who would care to intrude into such a region by suggesting that two cups express the divine thought just as well as one?<a name=164:9></a> I know that beloved brethren say that they regard it as one cup, though put into two or more vessels for convenience.<a name=164:10></a> I am sure they do, but I do not find two vessels in the institution.<a name=164:11></a> I read that all present drank out of one vessel, and I learn from 1 Corinthians that their doing so is expressive of a communion which in its very nature is marked by unity.<a name=164:12></a> We can only get clear on any spiritual matter by approaching it from the spiritual side.<a name=164:13></a> I see the Lord setting up amongst His own a new and divine communion -- they partake of one loaf, they drink out of one vessel.<a name=164:14></a> The more we think of what the loaf and the cup are in their spiritual significance, the less shall we be inclined to weaken the thought of the unity and communion expressed thereby by any concession to convenience.<a name=164:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we add a feature which had no place in the Lord's institution of the Supper, can we be quite sure that it will not interfere (perhaps in some way unobserved by us) with His
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=165>[Page 165]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thought and design in it?<a name=165:1></a> It may possibly have a more far reaching bearing than we suppose.<a name=165:2></a> For example, if it had been realised that the Lord's thought was that all who ate His Supper together should drink out of one vessel, it would have intimated to the saints that He did not contemplate the Supper being eaten by companies larger than could suitably do so.<a name=165:3></a> It would have reminded them that under His ordering, when there were in one locality five thousand men besides women and children, they sat down in companies -- "by hundreds and by fifties" as in Mark, "by fifties" as in Luke.<a name=165:4></a> It would have suggested an increase in the number of places where the saints came together rather than largely increased numbers in one place.<a name=165:5></a> There would have been no place, under such an arrangement, for large and pretentious buildings; huge churches and cathedrals would never have been thought of.<a name=165:6></a> Much that has grown up in christendom would have been entirely shut out.<a name=165:7></a> With increasing numbers there is always the tendency to lose family character and to become congregational, and this gives room for the clerical element to come in.<a name=165:8></a> We can all see that this has been so in christendom.<a name=165:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In many places professing Christians have introduced individual cups on hygienic grounds.<a name=165:10></a> We cannot wonder that where such innovations are introduced the spiritual thought of communion is wholly lost.<a name=165:11></a> What should be the sweet and holy expression of the communion of saints is reduced to individual privilege.<a name=165:12></a> I am sure that all intelligent believers would repudiate this, but if we introduce the hygienic thought into the Supper we have begun to move in that direction.<a name=165:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not conceivable that any person who was suffering from a disease likely to be contagious would fail to exercise consideration for the saints.<a name=165:14></a> Such a person would accept the dealings of God, and would either take the cup after others, or abstain from bringing infection amongst the saints, or to give occasion, at such a moment, to thoughts or fears of a distracting nature.<a name=165:15></a>
	</div>

		It is impossible for us at a distance to judge of local conditions and details.<a name=166:3></a> Responsibility as to this rests on those who are near to the seat of trouble.<a name=166:4></a> In this matter they have all reached a common judgment, which has been accepted by neighbouring meetings (who have also some measure of local knowledge) without question.<a name=166:5></a> It would be a very serious matter for us at a distance to challenge this.<a name=166:6></a> We should feel it needful to have the clearest evidence that the decision was an unrighteous one before taking a step which would certainly seem to be contrary to the normal order of the house of God.<a name=166:7></a>

		I fully recognise the value and importance of suspending fellowship in cases where this course is called for.<a name=166:8></a> It has been the divine way, I believe, of dealing with some cases.<a name=166:9></a> But I think you will agree that it is not a mode of action to be adopted automatically without spiritual exercise in every case of local breaches.<a name=166:10></a> I have known at least one instance in which it was sought to be wrongly applied by brethren at a distance from the local trouble.<a name=166:11></a> It is available for application in spiritual intelligence in cases which call for it.<a name=166:12></a> But if a breach were obviously caused unrighteously, or in support of principles not in accord with the truth of fellowship in a general sense, no shutting up of <i>both</i> parties to the breach would be called for.<a name=166:13></a> It must be in each case a question of spiritual exercise and priestly discernment.<a name=166:14></a> Responsibility of judging as to this would specially attach to those in the immediate neighbourhood, and I think the Lord could be counted upon to give wisdom to those responsible as waiting upon Him in uprightness and dependence.<a name=166:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the case the brethren in the district around have judged that it was not a case for shutting up.<a name=166:16></a> We, at a distance and knowing very little of the local conditions, are not prepared to say that it was.<a name=166:17></a> Our brethren have judged that the seceders went out without justification for so doing, and that they can only be regarded as having acted in a way contrary to the truth of the fellowship.<a name=166:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There was evidently sufficient enquiry, or evidence of some kind, to carry the consciences and judgment of saints in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should not be prepared to rule out, as prejudice, a moral judgment which may have been formed during years of exercise by those who in neighbouring meetings have been anxiously watching the course of events in a meeting where conditions were unhappy.<a name=167:4></a> Is there not, at least, a possibility of there being a sober and godly character about such vigilance, as even a spiritual and priestly power of discernment as to what was working?<a name=167:5></a> If so, how could it be set aside as having no weight, or as a matter which should not enter into account, in view of a godly judgment?<a name=167:6></a> If there were priestly qualities present in neighbouring meetings should we not expect a far more just estimate of local conditions than could be formed by those at a distance?<a name=167:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think it would be right to set aside as prejudice the judgment of "godly and upright men deserving of esteem", who have been in personal touch with the state of things locally.<a name=167:8></a> If any have had, in the ordering of the Lord, special opportunities of forming a spiritual estimate of what was going on, it can hardly be laid down as a principle that the judgment of such persons must be regarded as prejudice.<a name=167:9></a> They have not pre-judged in any unrighteous sense.<a name=167:10></a> Weighing of things in godly exercise does not, surely, disqualify persons from exercising a responsibility which may subsequently attach to them of expressing a formal judgment.<a name=167:11></a> If there is a priestly element in it it is precisely what qualifies them to lead the saints to a righteous judgment.<a name=167:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's mind may be missed in a local judgment, or in the judgment of a district as to a local breach.<a name=167:13></a> But I am convinced that normal order in the house of God is maintained by respecting a local judgment, or -- in the case of a local breach -- a judgment of adjacent meetings, rather than by saints at a distance challenging it without most unquestionable proofs of its being an unrighteous judgment.<a name=167:14></a> If a mistake is made it would appear to be a godly course to wait on the Lord to adjust it locally, though this would not exclude the expression of exercise by others if need be.<a name=167:15></a> The normal order would be

		I believe that "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, presents the Lord as having taken His place in the midst of assembled saints, and that His doing so is dependent on the existence of assembly conditions suitable to God.<a name=170:11></a> The Hebrew word <i>kah-hahl</i> -- used in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:22">Psalm  22:22</a> -- is translated some seventy times in the Septuagint by the Greek word <i>ecclesia</i> (assembly).<a name=170:12></a> The word "assembly" was thus familiar to the Jewish mind, and the disciples were prepared for its use by the Lord in reference to the new company which was to be the result of His death and of the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=170:13></a> It is also to be noted that the word in the Old Testament is used in the same twofold way that it is used in the New.<a name=170:14></a> That is, sometimes it means Israel generally, but sometimes it means the congregation as actually together.<a name=170:15></a> In which sense it is used must be determined by the context and by spiritual discernment.<a name=170:16></a> I believe that everywhere in the Psalms the word means the company of God's people as assembled together.<a name=170:17></a> The scriptures which refer to one speaking to or in the congregation, or praising there, must be taken, I apprehend, as meaning the company of God's people as assembled together.<a name=170:18></a> The congregation or assembly of God never had, nor could have had, its true character according to His mind until His Name

		The writer in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>quotes <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>as one of the blessed proofs of Christ's humanity, into which He has come in view of the suffering of death.<a name=171:11></a> By the grace of God He has tasted death for everything, and has been made perfect as the Leader of salvation through sufferings.<a name=171:12></a> The whole teaching of the epistle stands connected with the fact that God has spoken Son-wise, that purgation of sins has been made, and that Christ is in heaven as Priest, Forerunner, Leader of salvation, etc.<a name=171:13></a> Hence, as it seems to me, the writer designedly quotes first from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>as showing what comes about as the fruit of the sin-offering sufferings of the Messiah.<a name=171:14></a> He can declare God's Name in the fullest possible way to those whom He has sanctified.<a name=171:15></a> There is an assembly in the midst of which He can sing God's praises.<a name=171:16></a> He puts this in the first place as securing God's portion in the service of praise in the assembly.<a name=171:17></a>

		Christ speaks prophetically in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>of praising in the midst of the congregation, It has in view the time when all the ends of the earth shall turn to Jehovah and all families of the nations worship before Him.<a name=172:9></a> That is, it applies as a matter of strict interpretation to the world to come when Christ will be spiritually present in the midst of God's praising congregation, and will praise in their midst.<a name=172:10></a> But the epistle to the Hebrews put the remnant of that day into the light and power of the world to come anticipatively in a spiritual way.<a name=172:11></a> They were in the gain of God's speaking and of Christ's expiatory work, sanctified according to the value of His Person and offering, and therefore at that present time they constituted the true congregation of God, and as such were exhorted not to forsake the assembling of themselves together.<a name=172:12></a> The holy convocations were to continue in the present light of what belongs to the world to come, and by those who have the additional peculiar privilege of boldness for entering into the holy of holies -- a privilege distinctive, as I suppose, of the present interval of Christ's being within the veil.<a name=172:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think it can be questioned that the thought of a praising congregation or assembly of God is continued through this present period.<a name=172:14></a> It is not a thought that has lapsed, Paul quotes the prophetic utterance of Christ in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#18:49">Psalm  18:49</a> as having a present application, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:9">Romans  15:9</a>.<a name=172:15></a> He certainly did not sing to God's Name among the nations in the days of His flesh, nor in His days as the risen One upon the earth.<a name=172:16></a> It is now, in the days when those of the nations are being called, that He sings amongst them, anticipating, as before

		MY DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD, -- I am sorry that I have been unable to reply sooner to your letter, but I have thought of you with much interest in relation to your exercises, and have prayed that the Lord may grant you an abundant furnishing of grace, mercy and peace at all times, and particularly when depressing conditions are present.<a name=179:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are certain physical conditions which tend to depression, and the enemy is ever ready to take advantage of them that our joy may be diminished and the Lord may not receive the full note of praise of which He is so worthy.<a name=179:12></a> As to the sins of the past we glorify God and the word of His grace by simple confidence that the death and blood of Christ have settled every question.<a name=179:13></a> It is our privilege to cherish the thought that full forgiveness is in the heart of God; He refuses every charge; He remembers our sins and iniquities no more; and He ever regards us as those to whom He has made Christ to be wisdom and righteousness and holiness and redemption.<a name=179:14></a> I take it that you have not any <i>difficulty</i> as to this, or as to the complete satisfaction of God in the Person of Christ and in His sin-purging work, but that you are troubled at times by depression which deprives you of conscious joy in divine favour.<a name=179:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a comfort to know that nothing can touch the ground of peace on which our souls are with God.<a name=179:16></a> That is, Christ and His precious work are unaffected by any experiences through which our souls may pass.<a name=179:17></a> Physical and mental conditions may have a great effect on our feelings, and the amount of joy which we have consciously, but Christ in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Certain conditions may even be the direct consequence in God's government of past evil.<a name=180:2></a> Such things have to be humbly accepted as the mighty hand of God upon us; they help to maintain true self-judgment in our souls before Him, so that repentance is deepened as time goes on.<a name=180:3></a> But then all this is in view of our being exalted in Christ.<a name=180:4></a> The learning of what I am, and of what I have been, is truly humbling, but it need not be distressing if I see that all those conditions which have been present with me have just been the occasion for God to bring to light what is in His own heart.<a name=180:5></a> When I see this those very conditions magnify before my soul the greatness of His salvation in Christ.<a name=180:6></a> The weakness that is in myself, and the many things which I have to deplore in my past, or perhaps even in my present, make me thankful to know that God has brought in <i>another Man</i>, and has secured in Him all His own thoughts of blessing man-ward.<a name=180:7></a> There is what is perfect and absolutely for God's satisfaction and delight in Him, and it remains unaffected by what I find in myself.<a name=180:8></a> Nay!<a name=180:9></a> every self-discovery makes His perfection more a necessity to my heart.<a name=180:10></a> What I learn and experience in myself makes me rejoice to believe on Another in whom every promise of God is Yea and Amen.<a name=180:11></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- The question raised in connection with <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>has come up a good many times.<a name=183:1></a> The contrast before the mind of the apostle is between the things that are seen and those which are not seen.<a name=183:2></a> The earthly tabernacle house is not eternal, but there is a house of eternal character.<a name=183:3></a> When living believers are changed, or dead ones raised, they will have a house divinely suited to heaven and to eternal conditions.<a name=183:4></a> It will be that kind of bodily condition which is now in heaven in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that it can be spoken of as "out of heaven".<a name=183:5></a> It will be wholly of new creation kind.<a name=183:6></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>is quite in keeping with this, because it says as to resurrection of the dead, that it will be raised in incorruptibility, glory, power, a spiritual body.<a name=183:7></a> But resurrection supposes that persons have been buried.<a name=183:8></a> It applies to those who, as the Lord said, "are in the tombs".<a name=183:9></a> A person is so identified with his body that his body is spoken of as being himself.<a name=183:10></a> "Pious men buried <i>Stephen</i>", and as to the Lord <i>He</i> was buried, and the angel said, "Come see the place where <i>the Lord</i> lay".<a name=183:11></a> The patriarch David has been buried, as Peter said, but he has not yet been raised; he is still in his grave.<a name=183:12></a> All living for God, such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob do, involves that they are so identified with their bodies as to make resurrection a divine necessity.<a name=183:13></a> I do not see how one could speak of a "purely spiritual" part being <i>raised</i>.<a name=183:14></a> The "purely spiritual" part is surely not in the grave, but with the Lord.<a name=183:15></a> But all that was spiritual in saints has been identified with their bodies, so much so that <i>they</i> can be regarded, and are regarded in Scripture, as being in their graves.<a name=183:16></a> Resurrection is relative to what was buried, and not exactly to what comes out of heaven.<a name=183:17></a> It is the taking out by divine power from the domain of death of those who have died and been buried.<a name=183:18></a> All the force of resurrection is lost if this is not seen.<a name=183:19></a> Resurrection, as I understand it, is relative to all that is behind it -- the power of death and the grave.<a name=183:20></a> Complete victory has been achieved by the Lord having died and risen, and the saints as raised will participate actually in His victory.<a name=183:21></a> The house out of heaven has in view rather the whole heavenly scene for which that kind of bodily condition is suited and essential.<a name=183:22></a> I think if this distinction is kept in mind it helps in the apprehension of how things are presented in Scripture.<a name=183:23></a> Resurrection involves a backward look to where saints have been as in death and the grave.<a name=183:24></a> The house out of

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I gather from <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:1">Deuteronomy  21:1</a> - 9 that certain conditions may be found "in the land" which are altogether abnormal, and which by their seriousness affect the whole of God's people.<a name=184:6></a> The matter has occurred in a certain locality, but it is a concern for the elders and judges universally, and for all the people; it is not merely local.<a name=184:7></a> I judge that we have instruction here as to a case which, in its bearing and issues, cannot be confined to the locality in which it arises, but which has to be viewed as affecting the responsibility and fellowship of saints generally.<a name=184:8></a> Something fatal to the enjoyment of the land has taken place, and this is a matter which affects all God's people; all have to prove themselves to be pure in the matter.<a name=184:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gravity of such a case required that it should not be left undetermined; it had to be definitely taken up <i>somewhere</i>, and it was ordained by God that the nearest city should do so.<a name=184:10></a> It was not left to any city to act that might feel inclined to do so; responsibility to do so on behalf of God's people generally was definitely assigned to a particular city.<a name=184:11></a> Divine support can always be counted on when responsibility is taken up according to the mind of God.<a name=184:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The case contemplated here is not one of mere local unhappiness, but of the working of things which are <i>fatal</i> to a fellowship which is according to God.<a name=184:13></a> In the former case the Lord must be waited on to grant local adjustment and recovery.<a name=184:14></a> In the latter the whole of the people of God have to clear themselves of what is evil.<a name=184:15></a>

		There may be much local friction without the definite action of an evil principle, but if, for example, clericalism as at Plymouth, or independency as at Bethesda were definitely

		working they would be things in regard to which all the people of God must prove themselves pure.<a name=185:1></a> A local breach amongst brethren raises the question whether it is a case of local confusion which the Lord may adjust locally, or whether it is the evidence that saints are standing in faithfulness against principles which are really fatal to spiritual fellowship.<a name=185:2></a> In either case it seems to me that <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>appears to give the mind of God as indicating that any necessary steps or proving the saints generally to be pure in the matter are assigned in the wisdom of God to those nearest.<a name=185:3></a> It is a principle which J.<a name=185:4></a>N.<a name=185:5></a>D.<a name=185:6></a> insisted on, and I am not aware that any other principle has ever been put out by intelligent brethren as having divine sanction.<a name=185:7></a> It may be that brethren have not always been consistent in acting on it.<a name=185:8></a>

		In a case of local disagreement, without the setting up of my principle contrary to those which govern the fellowship generally (as at Alnwick), matters must be left for the Lord to adjust locally, brethren giving such help by prayer and counsel as they are enabled to do.<a name=185:9></a> In a case where principles contrary to the truth are the cause of local division, and this is fully ascertained, it is the responsibility and privilege of the brethren to identify themselves with those who are seeking to maintain what is due to the Lord, and to repudiate what is contrary.<a name=185:10></a> There is no interference whatever with local responsibility in either case.<a name=185:11></a> If the nearest meeting has no special responsibility in such cases, who has?<a name=185:12></a> To leave such matters altogether undetermined would be fatal to true fellowship either locally or generally.<a name=185:13></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- It has been said, as you know, that a meeting could only act for itself in such cases, and not so as to bind others by its decision.<a name=188:16></a> But this would need to be modified by the consideration that fellowship is general or universal.<a name=188:17></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=189:8></a>.<a name=189:9></a>.<a name=189:10></a> The Lord's words in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>, 20 abide, and will abide, in all their precious value so long as the assembly is here.<a name=189:11></a> They are, I trust, more cherished amongst us than ever, but even if we should give them up they would still remain true.<a name=189:12></a> They were a peculiar encouragement 100 years ago, as assuring those who were constrained to leave all that was approved in the religious world that the Lord would sanction by His presence even two or three who were gathered together unto His Name.<a name=189:13></a> They felt that they needed no other sanction.<a name=189:14></a> And all that the Lord's words meant to faith and love then they mean to faith and love now.<a name=189:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we are sorrowfully aware that those precious words of our Lord soon became in the minds of many the statement of a ground of gathering, as contrasted with meeting on sectarian ground, and many different companies now claim to be gathered unto His Name and to have His presence.<a name=189:16></a> I am afraid with many it is still a case of "supposing Him to be in the company" when He is not!<a name=189:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My impression is that the words of the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:17">Matthew  18:17</a> - 20 stand in an administrative connection, such as we should expect in this gospel, rather than with assembly privilege.<a name=189:18></a> They can ever be counted upon when, assembly conditions being present, there is dependence upon God in relation to the interests of Christ.<a name=189:19></a> So verse 19 directly refers to agreement in prayer, and verse 20 widens out to embrace every occasion when "two or three" might be "gathered together unto my name".<a name=189:20></a> For many years this precious word has been a comfort to me as assuring the Lord's presence for <i>support</i> in relation to His interests, and particularly in relation to what partakes of administration of assembly character.<a name=189:21></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:4">1 Corinthians  5:4</a> would be a concrete example of this, and I have no doubt it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=190>[Page 190]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		could be counted upon in a care meeting of brothers.<a name=190:1></a> I am sure it helps to note the setting in which things stand in Scripture.<a name=190:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's presence in the midst of the assembly according to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a> is clearly in another relation, viz.<a name=190:3></a> that of assembly privilege.<a name=190:4></a> Having declared God's Name to His brethren, He has a company in the midst of whom He can sing God's praise.<a name=190:5></a> This is the assembly viewed as in spiritual privilege God-ward, brethren of Christ and in concert with His singing.<a name=190:6></a> You would hardly suppose, I think, that this was known at Corinth, where they were carnal and ill-regulated even as to assembly order locally.<a name=190:7></a> The supper of which they partook was not allowed by the apostle to be the Lord's supper.<a name=190:8></a> The presence of Christ in their midst as Head, according to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, could not have been known under such conditions, nor is it once alluded to in the epistle.<a name=190:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a> the Lord promises, as I understand it, that His coming to the company of His lovers would be characteristic of the period during which the world sees Him no longer.<a name=190:10></a> He comes in the activity of His love to satisfy the love that would be inconsolable without Him.<a name=190:11></a> He manifests Himself to lovers.<a name=190:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come together to eat the Lord's supper in the place where He died, and from which He is absent.<a name=190:13></a> It has the character of a memorial, as J.<a name=190:14></a>N.<a name=190:15></a>D.<a name=190:16></a> says.<a name=190:17></a> We love the absent One, and remember Him; our affections and thoughts are unified by engagement with Him in the character in which the Supper presents Him.<a name=190:18></a> The Supper does not, in <i>itself</i>, suggest the thought of the Lord's presence with us, but rather of how He would engage our hearts with Himself as remembered during His absence, and while we have to announce His death until He comes.<a name=190:19></a> It is a question of intelligently apprehending the spiritual setting of the precious institution.<a name=190:20></a> We may be quite sure that the Lord will verify His own words whenever suitable conditions are found with His saints, and that He will vouchsafe His presence in the manner that is suitable to each aspect of it that Scripture brings before us.<a name=190:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not, surely, forget, in coming together to eat the Lord's supper, that He lives, or that we can know Him as near to us in His love, but at the moment we are engaged in responding to the presentation of the Lord which the Supper conveys to our hearts, the spiritual import of the one loaf and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=191>[Page 191]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the one cup.<a name=191:1></a> He has, in the wisdom of His love, ordained that it should be so, and He knew best how to awaken response to Him in the hearts of His own.<a name=191:2></a> To thus respond to the love which instituted the Supper does not mean that we forget or ignore the precious scriptures which speak of His presence with His own.<a name=191:3></a> But it means that, at the moment, we give place in thought and affection to that which the Lord is Himself calling our attention to.<a name=191:4></a> Namely, that He is calling us to remember Him in the place where He has died, and that in the emblems before us He is bringing most touching impressions of Himself and His love to bear upon our hearts -- impressions which, if yielded to, would put us all into heart-condition such as would attract Him to us according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>, and such as would liberate us for that spiritual sphere of privilege where He can sing as Head in the midst of His brethren, the assembly.<a name=191:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To desire this, to look for it, to see how the Supper would spiritually prepare us in affection for it, is not to give anything up, but to add immensely to the range of our spiritual apprehensions.<a name=191:6></a> We get a sense of the holy conditions, and the affectionate conditions, which alone secure the Lord's presence in any aspect.<a name=191:7></a> We estimate more fully the favour of that presence; we look more for the conscious realisation of it.<a name=191:8></a> Instead of assuming that we always have it -- apart from conditions -- we become more sensitive to its blessedness when granted, and to the deprivation when, either through company conditions, or our own individual condition, we fail to have it or to realise it.<a name=191:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing new in all this.<a name=191:10></a> It has been continually ministered for many years, and I believe it has helped the saints in their affections and spiritual apprehensions.<a name=191:11></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- In reply to your letter I may say, in the first place, that the question raised in regard to the expression "the eternal Son", as applied to our Lord, is not at all a question as to His Deity, or His eternal personality.<a name=191:14></a> The dear brethren are all, thank God, perfectly clear as to these great and vital matters of revelation and of faith.<a name=191:15></a> The Son was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the question is raised as to whether Scripture ever uses the expression "the eternal Son" in speaking of Christ, or whether He is ever called the Son when spoken of as subsisting in the form of God?<a name=192:3></a> If Scripture does so speak the question would be settled at once for all who own its authority.<a name=192:4></a> But if we find the Son, or the Son of God, spoken of in many scriptures as sent, or given, or as coming down from heaven to do the will of the One who sent Him, or as sanctified by the Father and sent into the world, or as the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father declaring God, we see that in many scriptures, at any rate, the designation applies to Him viewed as in a mediatorial position.<a name=192:5></a> Now is there any scripture which speaks of Him as the Son when there is clearly no reference to what is mediatorial but to His eternal place in Deity?<a name=192:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know that He existed eternally in the form of God, in a character of Being which we, as creatures, have no power to apprehend.<a name=192:7></a> It is infinitely beyond us in ineffable majesty and greatness, "whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>.<a name=192:8></a> We cannot connect the thought of "begotten", nor any idea of derivation, or relative inferiority, or posteriority, with One who is in the inscrutable glory of Godhead.<a name=192:9></a> He was <i>God</i>, in all the incomprehensible and unsearchable greatness which that holy Name conveys.<a name=192:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to write with much self distrust, and with great reverence, knowing that these subjects are thrice-holy.<a name=192:11></a> And I hold myself ready to be corrected in every way by Scripture.<a name=192:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know the Godhead as revealed, and only so, and in the economy of revelation divine Persons have been pleased to be known in the terms of a relationship known to us as men -- a relationship created, I have no doubt, in view of God's purpose so to reveal Himself.<a name=192:13></a> In the economy of revelation there is a certain subordination of both the Son and the Spirit; both are regarded as sent and given, and as taking up services committed to Them.<a name=192:14></a> Son is a relative term, and it implies a certain positional difference which Scripture never loses sight of.<a name=192:15></a> Now, so far as I have been able to trace, Scripture
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=193>[Page 193]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		does not carry back this relative and positional difference into the essence of Deity, or what is spoken of as "the form of God".<a name=193:1></a> We are brought by Scripture into presence of the profound and majestic fact that "the Word was God".<a name=193:2></a> As such He is incomprehensible by creatures.<a name=193:3></a> We have to recognise that there are depths which are beyond us, and to be thankful that we can know divine Persons as and when revealed.<a name=193:4></a> The Persons are eternal, but the names by which we know Them belong to the economy of revelation.<a name=193:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine Persons were known to Themselves alone in the past eternity, known in mutual affections, for God is love, but known in a way that Persons in Deity alone could know each other.<a name=193:6></a> According to divine good pleasure One of those Persons -- now known to us through revelation as the Word and the Son -- created the universe.<a name=193:7></a> It was in the form of God that He did so, for "in the beginning <i>God</i> created the heavens and the earth".<a name=193:8></a> Scripture does not say that He created as Son, but <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>make known to us that the One whom we know as the Word, and as the Son of the Father's love, the One in whom God has spoken Son-wise, was the Creator -- God of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102:25">Psalm  102:25</a>, and many other scriptures.<a name=193:9></a> Creation was an act incomprehensible to creature minds, but it is a matter of revelation, and is understood by faith.<a name=193:10></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I think I can understand the exercises expressed in your letter of March 25th, with reference to such terms as "the eternal Son", and the "everlasting Word", for mine was a similar attitude when the subject was suggested for our consideration over thirty years ago.<a name=195:16></a> One has had to learn that on all great and holy subjects, and especially on that which relates to the Son of God, our Lord and Saviour, absolute subjection to the Holy Scriptures is the only safe

		ground.<a name=196:1></a> And it is important that we should be careful to make sure that Scripture does really say what we have been accustomed to think that it says.<a name=196:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will confine myself for the present to the scriptures which you have mentioned, viz.<a name=196:3></a>, <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>, 18.<a name=196:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel sure that I cannot give you any greater help than to beg you to consider well these scriptures.<a name=196:5></a> They refer, <i>unquestionably</i>, to the Word and to the only-begotten Son as incarnate, as in a condition in which His glory could be contemplated by men.<a name=196:6></a> His disciples contemplated One who dwelt among them full of grace and truth, and who had unique glory "as of an only-begotten with a father".<a name=196:7></a> The whole point of the statement lies in the fact that this unique glory was contemplated by men; it was the glory of the Word as become flesh.<a name=196:8></a> So manifest is this that I cannot recall that any other interpretation was ever put upon it by intelligent Christians.<a name=196:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then verse 18 states that the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared God.<a name=196:10></a> It is a statement of what He has done as incarnate in time, and that He has done it as having this wonderful place "in the bosom of the Father".<a name=196:11></a> It is the unique place which He occupied as incarnate in the affections of the Father, and from which He declared God.<a name=196:12></a> That He did not have a less place in the past eternity we may be well assured, but what the Scripture states is the place which He occupied in relation to His declaration of God, which was clearly as incarnate.<a name=196:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure that the One spoken of in verse 18 is "I <i>am</i>", but I should have thought that <i>eis</i> referred to His characteristic place in the Father's affections rather than to His essential Being.<a name=196:14></a> You have no doubt observed that <i>eis</i> is used characteristically in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>, 31; 6: 46; 8: 47; 18: 37.<a name=196:15></a> I may add that I do not follow what is in your mind in saying that <i>eis</i> "in New Testament Greek" is used without any idea of motion into, as I am sure you must have noticed that it is used in this sense more than 100 times in John's gospel.<a name=196:16></a> But I do not pretend to know Greek.<a name=196:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture establishes without any possibility of question the eternal Personality in Godhead of Him whom we know and adore as known through revelation as the Word and the Son.<a name=196:18></a> Scripture is full of the relationship in which He stands to God and the Father as Son, being found in manhood in that relationship.<a name=196:19></a> But to say that that relationship "ever subsisted"

	<div class="paragraph">
		We only know divine Persons <i>as</i> and <i>when</i> revealed, and in relation to purposes of love formed before the foundation of the world.<a name=197:2></a> <i>In purpose</i> all that attaches to the names or titles of the Son, the Word, the Christ, even the Lamb, was there eternally, but it awaited time and the incarnation for manifestation.<a name=197:3></a> It must be obvious that the Scriptures speak of the Son as sanctified, sent, given, as coming down from heaven to do the will of the One who sent Him.<a name=197:4></a> The blest name of Son marks Him as the Father's sent One.<a name=197:5></a> That is, He is presented as holding a mediatorial place.<a name=197:6></a> Why should we not allow our hearts to expand in all the wealth and blessedness that has come to us from God in Him?<a name=197:7></a> We shall find enough within the bounds of revelation to fill us with deep divine joy now and in eternity.<a name=197:8></a> We recognise that essential Deity is altogether beyond creature ken, but in boundless love to the creature, and for His love's own satisfaction, God has come into the light of revelation.<a name=197:9></a> In that light He is known as the Father, known by the presence here on earth of the Son, and I am sure that the revelation brings to us the light of affections between divine Persons so far as it is possible for creatures to know them.<a name=197:10></a> The revelation is in a form suited for creature apprehension, though surely only truly apprehended in virtue of the presence and teaching of the Holy Spirit.<a name=197:11></a> We glory in it, find it our blessing and joy, and we adore the grace that marks it.<a name=197:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We could not, as creatures, know the manner or the character of affections that subsisted between divine Persons in essential Deity.<a name=197:13></a> But they have been disclosed to us, so far as it is possible, by the coming of One divine Person into manhood to be known by men as the Object of the Father's love in the relationship of Son, and as responding in Son's affections to the Father.<a name=197:14></a> We can get no nearer to essential Deity than it is our holy privilege to be as we contemplate the Son in manhood loved by the Father and loving the Father.<a name=197:15></a> To be with Him where He is, and to behold the glory given Him by the Father, is to get the nearest and fullest apprehension of the love that existed before the foundation of the world that it is possible for creatures to have.<a name=197:16></a> But the wondrous thing about it is that it is glory <i>given</i> to One who has taken the place of glorifying the Father on earth, and completing the work given Him by

		the Father to do, and who asks and receives all from the Father.<a name=198:1></a> He is in that place according to divine purpose from eternity, but it is a place of doing what Another has given Him to do, and of receiving all from Him.<a name=198:2></a> It is in this way that the mediatorial glory of the Son of the Father shines for the adoring contemplation of creatures.<a name=198:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should be fully prepared to say that the mutual relations and affections of divine Persons in essential Deity in eternity could not be <i>less</i> than they are now as known in revelation.<a name=198:4></a> But I think we should also be prepared to admit that there are inscrutable depths in Deity which are wholly beyond creature apprehension, and which therefore do not have place in revelation, which must in the wisdom of divine love have regard to creature capacity.<a name=198:5></a> All that has been said of late is with a view to reserving this, that the proper and essential greatness and majesty of God may have due place in our thoughts, and in the attitude of our souls towards Him.<a name=198:6></a> The result will be that the love and grace of the revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself mediatorially in the Son will be greatly magnified before our hearts.<a name=198:7></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I am glad to send you a brief line with reference to the difficulty which you express as to the Lord Jesus being said, in certain hymns, to have shed His blood, though I may not be able to say anything that you have not already fully considered.<a name=199:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole matter stands, as I am sure you will agree, on how Scripture speaks.<a name=199:2></a> And you have, no doubt, noticed that there are only three scriptures which speak of the <i>shedding</i> of Christ's blood.<a name=199:3></a> The subject of our inquiry, then, is to learn how these scriptures present it to us.<a name=199:4></a> The three scriptures are <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:28">Matthew  26:28</a>; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:24">Mark  14:24</a>; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:20">Luke  22:20</a> -- all being our Lord's own words at the Supper table, and referring to the blood of the covenant as shed for many, or, as in Luke, "for you".<a name=199:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now do our Lord's words on that deeply touching occasion refer to an act of violence on man's part, or do they refer to the infinite love in which the covenant was about to be secured by Christ on God's part?<a name=199:6></a> I have no hesitation in saying that I am persuaded that the latter is the truth.<a name=199:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that each of these scriptures views the shedding of Christ's blood from the divine side, and it is from that side He would have it to be thought of affectionately by His own as they remember Him in eating His Supper.<a name=199:8></a> His blood was shed, or poured out (it is the same word as used of the Holy Spirit in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:45">Acts  10:45</a> and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>) that expression might be given to all that was in the heart of God, and in His own heart, as made known in the covenant.<a name=199:9></a> It was a profound and blessed testimony of divine love.<a name=199:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole point of the Lord's words is that He Himself was about to give expression, by the giving of His body and the pouring out of His blood, to the will and love of God.<a name=199:11></a> To introduce, <i>at that moment</i>, the thought that it was the act of another -- and he a wicked man -- seems to me to greatly detract from what the Lord would impress on our spirits as we hear His words and eat His Supper.<a name=199:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the Lord Himself who has spoken of the shedding of His blood, and He has spoken of it in a connection which puts it altogether on the divine side, and as securing the blessing of the covenant for men.<a name=199:13></a> This was surely His own act and deed, and not that of another.<a name=199:14></a> If this is so the references in the hymns are justified.<a name=199:15></a>

		But I think that further consideration of the Scripture you refer to (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:3">Hebrews  7:3</a>) will make it very clear to you that the subject of that Scripture is the present priesthood of Christ the Son.<a name=200:6></a> It is the Son, begotten in time according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, now perfected through suffering, and sitting at God's right hand according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, who is saluted of God as High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.<a name=200:7></a> It is as entered within the veil that He is "become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec".<a name=200:8></a> Melchisedec was "assimilated to the Son of God" as being a priest in his own personal right, and deriving nothing from his ancestors, so that it is not even mentioned that he had any, neither is it said that he had any "end of life".<a name=200:9></a> His assimilation to the Son of God is in priestly office -- "assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually".<a name=200:10></a> Jesus "because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable".<a name=200:11></a> He is constituted High Priest as the "Son perfected for ever".<a name=200:12></a> To apply <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:3">Hebrews  7:3</a> to the past eternity is to confuse priesthood (which is clearly taken up by Christ the Son in manhood) with what pertains to eternal Deity.<a name=200:13></a> He was God, the eternal <i>I am</i>, previous to incarnation, but He has become Priest as having become higher than the heavens as the exalted Man.<a name=200:14></a> It is His present office which the whole Scripture (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5">Hebrews  5</a>- 8) has in view.<a name=200:15></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- The consideration of the correspondence which you have kindly permitted me to read, and which I return herewith, has confirmed in my mind the conviction that in such cases as the one referred to it is most important to take serious account of the exercises of brethren who know their history, and the details connected with them.<a name=202:20></a> Those at a distance obviously do <i>not</i> know, and I think it is according to divine principles that they should identify themselves with the exercises and spiritual judgment of those who do know, and with whom they are one body.<a name=202:21></a> A case which has occasioned serious exercise where it was local is one to be handled with priestly care and a considerable measure of holy reserve.<a name=202:22></a>

		You have referred to the law of leprosy (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#13">Leviticus  13</a>and 14), and it is instructive to see that in a case of suspected leprosy it is necessary for the priest to make sure that the person is clean before he is given the liberty of the camp.<a name=203:1></a> He is to be "shut up" until there is clear evidence of this.<a name=203:2></a> During the period of being "shut up" the priest is under no obligation to prove that he is unclean; it is sufficient that there are suspicious features present which have to be considered, and it has to be manifest to the priest that he is "clean" before he can be pronounced to be so.<a name=203:3></a> Your letters seem rather to go on the line that the priest can be called upon to furnish legal proof that he is unclean, but what is requisite is that the priest whose attention has been called to the case should be satisfied that he is clean.<a name=203:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When it is a question of priestly discernment it is hardly wise to assume that an individual, or even a company of brethren, at a distance have more ability for this than those who have had it before them as a godly concern in their own locality.<a name=203:5></a> Would it not be right to assume that those whom we recognise as moving in accord with the Lord's mind in A are as well acquainted with divine principles, and are as spiritual in their regard for the true good of a soul, and for what is due to the Lord, as the brethren at B?<a name=203:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that in the judgment of godly brethren there is even a shade of misgiving about a case should make us very careful.<a name=203:7></a> A person "shut up" would clearly not be a subject of friendly or social intercourse, but of holy and priestly care.<a name=203:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add that in my judgment it is a mistake to suppose that the reception of a person to fellowship, or the subsequent giving letters of commendation, renders it out of order to raise any questions as to events in the past history of that person.<a name=203:9></a> If it was clear that certain facts were known, and the person had been received as having judged himself relative to them, it would be contrary to grace and righteousness to raise them again, but if things unknown to the brethren subsequently come to light they are by no means covered by the fact that such a person had been received or commended.<a name=203:10></a>

		There is no doubt that Satan takes advantage of such a condition to harass, but on the other hand there is the support of the intercession of Christ.<a name=205:8></a> It is well for a soul in such a condition to recognise that the thoughts and feelings which are so unhappy are manifestations of infirmity, which are a subject of divine compassion.<a name=205:9></a> It is true that the unbelief and naughtiness of the flesh come into evidence also -- I mean inwardly and in thought -- but the mind of the believer does not consent to such thoughts, or find any pleasure in them.<a name=205:10></a> On the contrary, as your friend knows well, they are a cause of profound distress.<a name=205:11></a> According to the inward man, which, through grace, takes sides with God, she judges these thoughts.<a name=205:12></a> In her true self she is not identified with them, but hates them.<a name=205:13></a> In her depressed nervous state she cannot rise above them, but this is a physical depression, and is as much an infirmity as if she had a stiff leg.<a name=205:14></a> To recognise that it is so is often a relief.<a name=205:15></a> Then confidence in God is not to be cast away; it is the true antidote against despair.<a name=205:16></a> The special exercises which accompany physical conditions, whether these conditions are hereditary, or otherwise brought about, have their place in the ways of God with us, and in the end all these ways will be justified.<a name=205:17></a> I would exhort your friend always to pray and not to faint, and to be assured that God hears every true cry of need.<a name=205:18></a> And she should encourage her heart to think of Christ as perfectly expressing the love of God to her, and as expressing, too, how she stands in divine favour through Him and in Him.<a name=205:19></a> The wreck and disorder which has left such marks on our outward man does not, and cannot, touch what is of God in Christ.<a name=205:20></a> The Spirit would make much of that to us, and give us to value more and more the blessed fact that God has in love given us a new Head.<a name=205:21></a> We are entitled to dwell on what is ours in Him.<a name=205:22></a> We value it all the more by learning what

		DEAR --, -- I thank you for the kind letter of greeting received on my birthday.<a name=211:7></a> It is a comfort to be assured of the interest and prayers of the saints, and, indeed, one counts on it always.<a name=211:8></a> I continue to pray for --, and am always glad when I hear a good account of the meetings and of the brethren.<a name=211:9></a> There are many things which come in to test whether we are content to go on with the Lord's approval, or whether we want to stand well in "man's day".<a name=211:10></a> The qualities of the new man get their opportunity when we come up against trying elements in others.<a name=211:11></a> But we have all to learn that having a right thought of what ought to be does not, in itself, give capability to carry it out.<a name=211:12></a> But the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ suffices for all things, and it can be got through prayer.<a name=211:13></a>

		DEAR MR.<a name=212:1></a> --, -- I received your letter as written with a true desire to maintain the truth as to the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, and I am in full sympathy with this desire, for, like yourself, I believe that "all divine truth centres in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ", and also "that all error, of every kind and degree, is against His Person".<a name=212:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is an infinite fulness in the testimony of Scripture concerning His Person and glory, and it is well that we should soberly and reverently enquire how the Scriptures present His varied glories to us.<a name=212:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With reference to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>, I think you will agree with me that that precious verse contrasts what the law could <i>not</i> do with what God <i>has</i> done.<a name=212:4></a> He has condemned sin in the flesh by sending His own Son into the place of being "for sin", of course in a vicarious and sacrificial way.<a name=212:5></a> He was the anti-type of the brazen serpent, in the likeness of that in which the venom was, but wholly free of the venom in Himself.<a name=212:6></a> He was sent into the place of sin and death, but the One who was sent was God's own Son.<a name=212:7></a> He was sent "for sin", that is to be in the place of sin sacrificially, and He was not this until He was upon the cross.<a name=212:8></a> It was at God's cost that such a sacrifice has been furnished, for it was His "own Son" who was sent "for sin" -- the One who was His delight according to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a> and many other scriptures.<a name=212:9></a> His going to the cross that in Him sin in the flesh might be condemned is thus the expression of infinite love on God's part.<a name=212:10></a> The more we enter into His perfection, and into the delight which God found in having such a Son, the more we shall be affected to think that such a Person should be sent "for sin".<a name=212:11></a> In no other person, and by no other sacrifice, could sin in the flesh be condemned in such a way that God should be glorified in its condemnation, and a new status in Christ Jesus and in the Spirit made possible to saints.<a name=212:12></a> His Deity is, of course, behind it all, but it is as One perfect in manhood that He was sent "for sin".<a name=212:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not exactly His coming into the world that the Spirit is calling our attention to in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>, though of course, He could only be a sacrifice for sin as having come here, but the point is that One who was God's own Son has been sent in love to the place of sin that sin in the flesh might be condemned.<a name=212:14></a> "His own Son" is that blessed One who in His holy perfection, and in His delightfulness to God as Man here, was suitable in His spotless purity to be a sacrifice "for sin".<a name=212:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=213>[Page 213]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of all that He was as God's "own Son", as it is presented to us in the gospels, gives a most touching force to such a One as that being sent into the place of sin and sin's condemnation.<a name=213:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then if we pass on to verse 32 the import of the precious words "his own Son" becomes yet more evident.<a name=213:2></a> God "has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all".<a name=213:3></a> When was He "not spared"?<a name=213:4></a> When was He "delivered up"?<a name=213:5></a> Such words could not possibly apply to Him as in eternal Deity, They apply, and could only apply, to that solemn period immediately preceding the cross when His "hour" came, and He was delivered up to man's hour and the power of darkness.<a name=213:6></a> But the One who when that hour arrived was not spared but delivered up, in view of the accomplishment of redemption, was God's own Son -- a divine Person here in holy manhood.<a name=213:7></a> The whole force of the Scripture is lost if this is not seen.<a name=213:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust you will understand that I do not make these few remarks in any spirit of controversy, but as setting forth my apprehension of the scriptures you refer to.<a name=213:9></a> I am conscious that though I have been slowly learning in the school of God for more than fifty years there is much that I have yet to learn.<a name=213:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Eternal life" is a distinctive blessing, spoken of in the Old Testament in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:3">Psalm  133:3</a> and <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:2">Daniel  12:2</a>.<a name=214:5></a> It is seen in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>to be commanded where brethren dwell together in unity as under priestly anointing, and under the divine refreshing of the dew of Hermon.<a name=214:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12">Daniel  12</a>it is connected with awaking out of the dust of the earth, clearly a resurrection figure.<a name=214:7></a> Both these scriptures give a very exalted and spiritual view of life eternal.<a name=214:8></a> The Jews rightly gathered from them that life eternal described the blessedness which those favoured of God would inherit in the world to come -- see <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:17">Mark  10:17</a>; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:25">Luke  10:25</a>, etc.<a name=214:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord makes plain, by the words to which you refer in John's gospel, that this great and wondrous blessing is available now, and is the portion of those who believe on Him.<a name=214:10></a> Eternal life is the divinely given portion of every believer just as Canaan was the allotted portion of Israel by God's gift before they left Egypt, but to possess and enjoy it experimentally they had to take the journey and put their foot on the land which was given.<a name=214:11></a> So that the Lord's words are not to be taken merely as words of assurance that we possess something of which we know nothing, but they are intended to move our hearts to go up and possess the land.<a name=214:12></a> Eternal life is truly given to us in the Son of God, but as something to be known experimentally now.<a name=214:13></a> To have it consciously we must be characterised by eating the flesh of the Son of man and drinking His blood (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:54">John  6:54</a>), and we must have the Spirit as the Fountain of living water in us springing up into eternal life, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>.<a name=214:14></a> And there must also be a sowing to the Spirit, for Paul says, "He that sows

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=215:2></a> Raven sought to encourage the saints to go in for the enjoyment of their portion, and not to be content with title without possession.<a name=215:3></a> This is highly important, for otherwise we may be saying that we have eternal life when we are perhaps practically living after the flesh and in the world.<a name=215:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take some other precious statement of the Lord.<a name=215:5></a> "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a>.<a name=215:6></a> "He that believes on me shall never thirst at any time", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:35">John  6:35</a>.<a name=215:7></a> These statements, and many others which might be quoted from John's gospel, show the immense possibilities that are opened up to men in the love of God, all to be possessed on the principle of believing on His Son.<a name=215:8></a> They are there as precious divine proposals, but what they mean is unknown until they become conscious realities by the Spirit.<a name=215:9></a> It is possible to find carnal and worldly persons saying that they have eternal life, but such persons do not really know what eternal life means.<a name=215:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your second exercise I think we have to learn that Scripture uses the words "saved" and "salvation" in different connections, and it is well to consider each passage separately.<a name=215:11></a> We shall find that this will give us a very extended view of the subject.<a name=215:12></a> While, in a general way, one would have no difficulty about speaking of believers as being "saved", meaning that they have come through faith to the value of Christ as God's salvation, one would be glad if persons knew more definitely and intelligently what they mean when they say that they are "saved".<a name=215:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is "for salvation to the end of the earth".<a name=215:14></a> There is complete deliverance in Him from every enemy and from every evil.<a name=215:15></a> So that we can say confidently to any one who feels distressed about his present condition, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>.<a name=215:16></a> His whole lost condition will be divinely met.<a name=215:17></a> But this means a great deal; its completeness will open up more and more to him as long as he lives, for the believer's whole course as cleaving to the Lord is a continual learning of the greatness of the salvation of God.<a name=215:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite scriptural to say of persons who trust in Christ, "By grace ye are saved", but this views them as in the completeness of it, so that they are seen as raised up together

	<div class="paragraph">
		and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, And when it is said, "Who hath saved us", we read that it is "according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:9">2 Timothy  1:9</a>.<a name=216:1></a> It is salvation viewed in all its completeness according to divine purpose.<a name=216:2></a> But then salvation is sometimes looked at as needed all along our course as in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a>.<a name=216:3></a> And sometimes it is future as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:9">Romans  5:9</a>; 13: 11; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:13">Matthew  24:13</a>.<a name=216:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is probably a sense of the greatness of salvation, and its many and varied aspects, which makes brethren not use the word "saved" so freely as some do.<a name=216:5></a> But we can tell any man that there is salvation in Christ for him, and if he finds salvation there he can say, "The Lord is my strength and my song and he is become my salvation".<a name=216:6></a> But, speaking practically, I am afraid that many believers are not yet fully delivered from the working of their own wills, but salvation would include this, <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>, 13.<a name=216:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to your third exercise I can only say that I am sorry if -- you have not found the brethren diligent in gospel service; they ought to be.<a name=216:8></a> I can assure you that many brethren do earnestly seek souls, and I am thankful to say that I often hear of persons being brought to the Lord.<a name=216:9></a> There may be places where there is not much evangelistic gift, and this is a matter to pray about.<a name=216:10></a> I am sure it would be good if we were all more zealous in the gospel.<a name=216:11></a> But it must be borne in mind that what is distinctive of the spiritual movement which called saints into separation is the recovery of the truth of the lordship and headship of Christ, and the presence here of the Holy Spirit, and, in connection with these precious realities, the constitution of the assembly, and the divine principles which govern the fellowship which pertains to it, have come out.<a name=216:12></a> And it is to be noted that there has been a constant tendency to let these things get into the background through attention being given almost exclusively to evangelising.<a name=216:13></a> I believe it was this, conjoined with Baptist principles, which led to the defection of 1848.<a name=216:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust you will be divinely led and helped in all your exercises.<a name=216:15></a> With true desire for your blessing and spiritual enlargement, I remain,

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- In answer to your letter of the 17th inst.<a name=217:1></a> I may say that I should be truly thankful if I were enabled of the Lord to do anything helpful in regard to the adjustment of the very unhappy difference which has continued so long between you and -- .<a name=217:2></a> It is a very real grief to me and to the brethren generally.<a name=217:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But no help which your brethren can afford can take the place of personal exercise on your part before the Lord.<a name=217:4></a> And no better counsel can be given you than the Lord's own specific commandments.<a name=217:5></a> I think you would be helped by considering very prayerfully and in a spirit of subjection the law of trespass and of the trespass offering -- <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5">Leviticus  5</a>and 7.<a name=217:6></a> This part of Scripture directly bears on the subject, and, though typically presented, it is the word of God to us, and cannot be disregarded with impunity.<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice that the law of trespass is more exacting in its requirements than the law as to sin of inadvertence.<a name=217:8></a> Something more than acknowledgment of wrong done is required, The "principal" has to be restored, and a "fifth part" more added thereto.<a name=217:9></a> There is the thought of a reparation which leaves one on better terms with one's offended brother than before the trespass.<a name=217:10></a> Nothing less than this could be in the Lord's mind when He said, "first go, be reconciled to thy brother".<a name=217:11></a> He puts upon the offender the responsibility to "be reconciled".<a name=217:12></a> He does not suggest the thought that it will be attempted in vain.<a name=217:13></a> He will Himself see that if it is sincerely sought it will be gained.<a name=217:14></a> But it must be sought by one who feels that he has trespassed against the affections which pertain to a very close and tender and divine relationship.<a name=217:15></a> It is "thy brother".<a name=217:16></a> How touching is the appeal!<a name=217:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of what is due <i>to the Lord</i> in the matter is also to be fully owned.<a name=217:18></a> The ram of the trespass offering must be brought to Jehovah and eaten in the holy place.<a name=217:19></a> I do not need to enlarge on this.<a name=217:20></a> It shows how serious <i>as before God</i> is any trespass against one's brother.<a name=217:21></a> Nothing could remove it from before God's holy eye but the death of Christ.<a name=217:22></a> But that blessed One loved us so much that He would die and bear in judgment what was due to our trespass.<a name=217:23></a> In the light of that how could we hesitate to go down before an offended brother?<a name=217:24></a> to surrender all thought of our own importance or dignity?<a name=217:25></a> What a lead our precious Saviour and Lord has

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=218:8></a>.<a name=218:9></a>.<a name=218:10></a> Your exercise as to the body and the bride is a very interesting one.<a name=218:11></a> I do not know that I can contribute much, but I am glad to send a few lines.<a name=218:12></a> So far as I see, your thought as to not connecting the idea of <i>union</i> with the family or children of God is right.<a name=218:13></a> There is community of nature, and they become, as the Lord said, "one in us", but the idea of union does not come in in this connection.<a name=218:14></a> Of course it is a little difficult to speak of the scriptural force of a term which is not actually found in Scripture, and which appears to be used by Christians in rather different ways.<a name=218:15></a> But it has been generally used amongst brethren, and particularly by J.<a name=218:16></a>B.<a name=218:17></a>S.<a name=218:18></a>, as indicating the assembly as brought to Christ in the place where He is and united to Him there.<a name=218:19></a> That is, it is not quite the thought of Eve being taken from Man, but of her being brought to Him.<a name=218:20></a> She was first of Adam as deriving from him, and then she was brought <i>to</i> him in marriage union.<a name=218:21></a> If this is the scriptural thought of union, as it appears to be, John would touch it in speaking of the marriage of the Lamb being come.<a name=218:22></a> And this is anticipated by the saints of the assembly being brought by the Spirit's power to Christ where He is, so that as thus brought to union the assembly is looked at in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>as being already in the place of the wife.<a name=218:23></a> As thus in union the heart of her Husband doth safely trust in her, and all her interests are merged in His.<a name=218:24></a> The assembly is "his own flesh" in the sense that all that she is morally is derived from Christ, and she is thus suited to be united to Him.<a name=218:25></a>

		The thought conveyed in the body would seem to be rather of an organic unity into which we are baptised by one Spirit -- the living organism here in which Christ is set forth for the pleasure of God, and which is His fulness.<a name=219:1></a> The saints are "one body" marking their unity, and they are Christ's body as called to set Him forth morally.<a name=219:2></a> Christ being Head of the body, the assembly would be one marked feature of His glorious pre-eminence, but in Ephesians He is "Head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all".<a name=219:3></a> This is the place God has given Him of widest headship, and as having it He is Head to the assembly -- all supplies and direction flow from Him to the assembly as having relation to Him as His body.<a name=219:4></a> No other company of saints will ever have the place of being His body; this is peculiar to the assembly.<a name=219:5></a> It is altogether of Himself in the most intimate way, and as being so there is no disparity, so that union can take place.<a name=219:6></a> The man and his wife of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:31">Ephesians  5:31</a> are two entities, but the man becomes united to his wife so that they become one flesh by union.<a name=219:7></a> And in speaking of this Paul tells us that he has Christ and the assembly in view.<a name=219:8></a> So that union seems to be associated with the idea of marriage rather than with the organic constitution of the body.<a name=219:9></a> But the two thoughts run so closely together, and almost into one another in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>, that it is by no means easy to draw the line between them.<a name=219:10></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I have looked over the paper in connection with the truth of our Lord's Sonship which you left with me on Thursday.<a name=221:1></a> The different scriptures referred to have all been fully examined during the course of the enquiry into this great subject, and the matter published upon it should be carefully read by any one who wants help.<a name=221:2></a> I cannot take up every statement in the paper (this would mean writing a pamphlet) but I send a few remarks.<a name=221:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to "Thou art my Son; I this day have begotten thee", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a>, I quite agree that it must be interpreted in the light of the New Testament quotations.<a name=221:4></a> These, however, concur in referring it to Christ as incarnate.<a name=221:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:33">Acts  13:33</a> the promise is fulfilled in the raising up of Jesus, "as it is written", etc.<a name=221:6></a> This is the raising up of Jesus as God's Son begotten in time; it does not refer to His resurrection.<a name=221:7></a> His resurrection is spoken of in verse 34 but not in verse 33.<a name=221:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:4">Hebrews  1:4</a> He inherits a Name, and verse 5 shows that it is the Name of Son.<a name=221:9></a> He could not be said to "inherit" a Name which belonged to His essential Being as in Deity.<a name=221:10></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:5">Hebrews  5:5</a> is the priesthood of Christ, which is clearly taken up in manhood.<a name=221:11></a> So that when we examine the context of the quotations we find that they definitely establish the truth that the Son begotten refers to Him as incarnate.<a name=221:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Colossians, Hebrews, and John's gospel do say plainly that the Son was the Creator.<a name=221:13></a> But it is clear that they were all written after the Son had been here as Man, and had become the Object of faith to many thousands.<a name=221:14></a> Such were now divinely taught by these inspired writings that the Son in whom God had spoken to men, and on whom they had believed, was no less than the divine Person who created all things.<a name=221:15></a> It is a Person now known and believed on as the Son of the Father's love who was the Creator, the One in whom we now have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, this necessitating His humanity and death.<a name=221:16></a> He did not have the kingdom, nor had the saints redemption in Him, nor was He the image of the invisible God, until He became Man.<a name=221:17></a> But as knowing all that He is and has brought to pass by coming into manhood, we are also permitted to know that long before He became Man, or the saints had redemption in Him, creation was brought about in His power.<a name=221:18></a> It is clearly looking back from how He is known now, subsequent to incarnation, to state what was accomplished in His power and through Him long

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>, 14, it will be obvious, upon careful consideration, that the whole mission of the Son of God is in each case in view.<a name=222:24></a> It is in each case the object in view in the sending that is stressed -- that He might redeem, that we might receive sonship, that we might live through Him.<a name=222:25></a> "His Son" in Galatians is the One announced as glad tidings; that is, the thoughts of God as to men are set forth in Him.<a name=222:26></a> "The fulness of the time" evidently refers to the making known those thoughts, in contrast to the "child" state in which the people of God were as under law.<a name=222:27></a> But then this necessitated the Son of God being here as "come of woman, come under law;" it is One in the place of man who was sent forth to redeem, and whose Spirit has now been sent out into our hearts.<a name=222:28></a> It is clearly not eternal Deity that is dwelt upon, but One, who was indeed eternally divine, now viewed as in the relationship of Son in view of our receiving sonship.<a name=222:29></a> No scripture brings out more plainly than this one does that the title Son of God is relative to divine thoughts as to men, and that those thoughts are secured through a divine Person coming into that relationship in manhood.<a name=222:30></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=225:7></a>.<a name=225:8></a>.<a name=225:9></a> The glad tidings of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a> clearly refer to the Son of God as known and preached by Paul.<a name=225:10></a> You cannot legitimately detach "his Son" from the context, that is, from the fact that He is "Jesus Christ our Lord;" the glad tidings are concerning Him in His present condition and position -- in which alone Paul knew Him.<a name=225:11></a> But Paul tells us further that these glad tidings had been "before promised by his prophets in holy writings".<a name=225:12></a> We turn to those holy writings to see what was "before promised" and we find that all the promises centre in One who is spoken of as the Seed of the woman, the Seed of Abraham, the Seed of David, the Son of man, the virgin's Son called Immanuel as born of her, the Christ, the Son of God.<a name=225:13></a> There is nothing metaphysical about any of these promises.<a name=225:14></a> And if we turn particularly to the prophecies in regard to Christ as the Son of God (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:14">2 Samuel  7:14</a>; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:27">Psalm  89:27</a>; <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#7">Isaiah  7</a>; <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:1">Hosea  11:1</a>) we find that they all refer to Him as come of David's seed.<a name=225:15></a> And it is thus that Paul speaks of Him.<a name=225:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indeed Paul himself has enlarged on <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a> - 4.<a name=225:17></a> His own preaching reported in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>is an exact and illuminating exposition of those verses.<a name=225:18></a> It gives us an actual example of how he carried out the ministry to which he was separated.<a name=225:19></a> We get it all there -- the promises fulfilled in the bringing to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's glad tidings are concerning His Son.<a name=226:4></a> But, having said this, Paul, as though anticipating that some learned commentator in the last days would darken counsel by speaking of a "metaphysical sonship", adds at once, "come of David's seed according to flesh".<a name=226:5></a> Nor is this an isolated connection; the whole usage of the New Testament falls into line with it; it ever links together the thought of the Christ and the Son of God.<a name=226:6></a> Nathaniel's confession (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>) and Martha's (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>) show the connection in the mind of pious Jews.<a name=226:7></a> It was Jesus who had appeared to Paul in the way whom he preached "that he is the Son of God".<a name=226:8></a> Do you not think that his Jewish hearers in the synagogues would understand this as referring to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>?<a name=226:9></a> The signs in John's gospel were written that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.<a name=226:10></a> Paul speaks of "the Son of God, Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:19">2 Corinthians  1:19</a>, of "Jesus the Son of God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:14">Hebrews  4:14</a>.<a name=226:11></a> John says that "Jesus is the Son of God", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:15">1 John  4:15</a>; 5: 5, and speaks of "Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father", <a href="../bible/2John.htm#3">2 John  3</a>.<a name=226:12></a> Then there are several passages in which the same phrase is found as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:3">Romans  1:3</a>; viz.<a name=226:13></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:3">1 John  1:3</a>, 7; 3: 23; 5: 20, every one of which absolutely excludes any "metaphysical" idea.<a name=226:14></a> In short the testimony of Scripture is everywhere clear and unequivocal that the title Son of God is applied to Him either as viewed personally as Jesus, or officially as the Christ.<a name=226:15></a> If there is a scripture anywhere which connects the relationship of the Son with Him as in the past eternity, let it be produced.<a name=226:16></a> If this is so vital to the glad tidings as you would have us to think, how comes it that Scripture is absolutely silent with regard to it?<a name=226:17></a> I agree with you that it is the introduction of the Son that brings light and understanding, but He must be introduced as Scripture presents Him, and things must not be regarded as essential and necessitous of which Scripture says nothing.<a name=226:18></a> Scripture does contain definite statements as to the pre-incarnate

		Those who talk of a "metaphysical sonship" must first prove from Scripture that such a Sonship exists; the whole usage of the New Testament is to speak of the Son of God in a way which precludes such an idea.<a name=227:3></a> Your opinions as to the terrible consequences which logically follow the refusal of your ideas have not the slightest weight because you must first establish your premises before you are entitled to draw deductions from them.<a name=227:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glad tidings to which Paul was separated, and of which he became minister, concerned the Son of God.<a name=228:3></a> He, as revealed in Paul (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>), and as Paul knew Him, is the great and blessed Subject of the glad tidings.<a name=228:4></a> That He was pre-existent as subsisting in the form of God is of the very essence of the faith, but as divinely pre-existent He was not, and could not be, the subject of glad tidings.<a name=228:5></a> How could there be glad tidings for sinful men apart from redemption and the revelation of God's righteousness?<a name=228:6></a> Apart from the incarnation and death of our Lord, Paul could have had no apostleship or ministry of glad tidings.<a name=228:7></a> So he carefully asserts that it is the Son of God as come of David's seed according to flesh, and marked out Son of God in power by resurrection, who is the Subject of God's glad tidings.<a name=228:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those glad tidings were "before promised .<a name=228:9></a>.<a name=228:10></a>.<a name=228:11></a> in holy writings", but they were not announced in Old Testament times for the very simple reason that the facts which they announce, and which constitute their essence and substance, had not then come to pass.<a name=228:12></a> That which would, in due time, be made known to the nations as glad tidings was promised, but every child knows that a promise is not the thing promised.<a name=228:13></a> All was before the mind of God, as purposed by Him to be brought to pass in due time.<a name=228:14></a> But to say that the glad tidings existed, and had a living subject, prior to the incarnation of our Lord, is pure nonsense.<a name=228:15></a> The glad tidings are not a purpose, nor are they a promise; they are the blessed ministry confided to Paul of God's righteousness and grace, revealed on the ground of accomplished redemption, which God would have made known to the nations, and wherein His Son is preached as the blessed glorified Man in whom every divine thought as to the blessing of men is set forth.<a name=228:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The question at issue between us is not as to our Lord's eternal pre-existence in the form of God; I trust we are of one mind as to that.<a name=228:17></a> The question is, When did He become the Subject of the glad tidings of which Paul was minister?<a name=228:18></a> Clearly not until after He was risen.<a name=228:19></a> Every Old Testament promise showed what God had in His mind, but those promises

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is absolutely certain that the glad tidings of which Paul speaks in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a> - 4 concerned the Son of God as incarnate and risen.<a name=229:4></a> It is equally certain that the promises in holy writings of old referred to Him as in conditions which were yet future.<a name=229:5></a> You insist, without one word of Scripture to substantiate it, that they concerned Him as in pre-incarnate Deity, and that if we do not accept this "we might just as well argue that the God who promised the glad tidings did not exist as God"!<a name=229:6></a> I think you must see how absurd is such reasoning.<a name=229:7></a>

		DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD, -- I am interested to have your letter, and to know something of your exercises before the Lord.<a name=230:8></a> I feel assured that He will help you, as you continue to seek Him about the matter, and will give you light as to the path in which He would have you to walk.<a name=230:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am glad that you have arrived at a definite judgment as to the failure of Open Brethren to recognise the truth of the one body in its practical bearing on the fellowship of saints.<a name=230:10></a> This will make your way clear as to continuing association with them, and it will also help you much in regard to other difficulties which beset the path of faith in this day.<a name=230:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is easy to answer the first part of your question.<a name=230:12></a> The Christians with whom I am privileged to walk do recognise the truth of the one body, and this not only in an abstract way (as I suppose all Christians do) but in its practical bearing.<a name=230:13></a> That is, the essential and vital unity of the body is not merely local but universal; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> establishes this.<a name=230:14></a> So that local assemblies are not independent congregations who may agree to work and walk together with mutual inter-communion,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=231>[Page 231]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but the saints who meet locally in assemblies form an integral part of a universal unity, and thus no assembly can be independent of any or all the other assemblies.<a name=231:1></a> It is not merely a question of agreeing to act on the same principles, but the unity is a vital and organic unity.<a name=231:2></a> So that any disciplinary or administrative action is taken in the light of the universal fellowship and the divine principles which govern it, and also as recognising the vital unity of the body, which underlies that fellowship.<a name=231:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brethren at Bethesda chapel, Bristol, in 1848 did not recognise that saints generally were as definitely committed to the refusal of evil which had come to light at Plymouth as were those who had the immediate responsibility of dealing with it.<a name=231:4></a> They held that a judgment of evil in Plymouth did not necessarily bind other assemblies; each assembly must judge for itself, or not judge at all, if it thought best to be neutral!<a name=231:5></a> This was clearly to make the assemblies independent units, and this principle is still maintained by those known as Open Brethren.<a name=231:6></a> What was judged at Plymouth was a clericalism which would have set aside all that the Spirit of God was recovering as to the truth of the assembly.<a name=231:7></a> Later it was found that along with this grave error there was the propagation of most serious evil teaching as to the Person of Christ.<a name=231:8></a> The latter was professedly judged at Bethesda <i>after</i> division had been caused by the refusal to judge it, but the principle of independency (which had left it an open question whether it should be judged or, not) was never judged as evil, but is still maintained.<a name=231:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second part of your question, in which you ask, "Seeing there are so many different companies of 'Exclusives', how can one know for certain which is the true expression of the one body?<a name=231:10></a>" is more difficult to answer.<a name=231:11></a> To begin with, I doubt whether the Lord would have us to look for a company which should be the true expression of the one body.<a name=231:12></a> I think this would be too pretentious a ground to take in the midst of all the confusion of these last days.<a name=231:13></a> I believe the Lord would have His saints to recognise the truth of the one body, and every other part of the truth, and to seek to maintain consistency with it by following righteousness, faith; love, peace, and that in so doing there will be found a divine path of separation from evil in which they can walk in the light of all the truth of the assembly, and have the Lord with them in so doing.<a name=231:14></a>

		But each heart seeking to be in the truth and power of what is of God, and to give expression to it according to the measure of what is made available to us.<a name=232:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To find the company which has the Lord's approval and presence is a matter which involves not only the truth and principles which have been in question in each case, but also where the different companies stand spiritually at the present time.<a name=232:2></a> I would not care to attempt to prove that one certain company was right.<a name=232:3></a> It is largely a matter of spiritual indications which the Lord will undoubtedly afford to any who only desire His mind.<a name=232:4></a> To follow the man with a pitcher of water is a good guide.<a name=232:5></a> Look out for a living and spiritual ministry of Christ, and for purification from the influences of the world.<a name=232:6></a> But this calls for spirituality of discernment which can only be acquired by nearness to the Lord.<a name=232:7></a> So that we cannot look for certain guidance apart from our own personal communion with the Lord.<a name=232:8></a> For, after all, it is a question of where the Lord is, and of where souls are truly gathered to His Name.<a name=232:9></a> And this, as I think you will understand, can only be appreciated in a spiritual way.<a name=232:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a matter of history each breach amongst brethren which has resulted in permanent separation has been caused either by the attempt to introduce principles or teachings which were contrary to the truth, or by the refusal to accept light which the Lord was giving and which could be substantiated by Scripture.<a name=232:11></a> These things speak indeed of human failure, but they have been permitted as an exercise for faith; they cannot now be ignored, and therefore they cast every enquiring heart very much on the Lord, who does not fail those who wait on Him.<a name=232:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot offer you better counsel than to suggest that you continue to wait much on the Lord, with readiness to follow any spiritual leading which He has given you, or which He may yet give you.<a name=232:13></a> As you move in faithfulness to the light which He gives you it will increase and your path will be made very clear to you.<a name=232:14></a> I shall be interested to hear from you again, if you care to write and let me know how you are being led.<a name=232:15></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I was interested to have your letter and to know of the exercise in --, as to having another room.<a name=235:12></a> I believe that the Lord has greatly encouraged the brethren in different places who have moved on the line of reducing the numbers who break bread in one place by opening up new rooms.<a name=235:13></a> The new meetings thus started have brought into happy service many who had not previously much opportunity, and it has been found that smaller companies have given liberty to many to take part whose voices were not heard in the larger meetings.<a name=235:14></a> This is surely a great gain to the dear brethren and also to the Lord.<a name=235:15></a> I trust you will be much cheered as you move in this way.<a name=235:16></a>

		As to the age limits for levitical service, I think it is clear that these are to be taken in the way of what they suggest spiritually rather than as literally.<a name=235:17></a> No one would suppose that Peter or Paul or John finished their levitical work when they became 50 years old.<a name=235:18></a> How much the assembly would have lost if J.<a name=235:19></a>N.<a name=235:20></a>D.<a name=235:21></a> or J.<a name=235:22></a>B.<a name=235:23></a>S.<a name=235:24></a> or F.<a name=235:25></a>E.<a name=235:26></a>R.<a name=235:27></a> had retired from active service at that age!<a name=235:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought suggested by the levitical age limits is that the work of the Lord is to be carried on in spiritual maturity and in full spiritual efficiency.<a name=235:29></a> Some young men of 20 are marked by more gravity and competency for holy service than others of 50 or 60.<a name=235:30></a> "Let no one despise thy youth" was said to Timothy.<a name=235:31></a> That is, he was to act with such sobriety and discretion that no one could disregard him as a young man of no weight.<a name=235:32></a> It would be obviously out of keeping with all that becomes the house of God for a young man to take up service therein unless he were marked by qualities which commended him to the confidence of the brethren.<a name=235:33></a> But these would always be estimated by moral worth rather than by literal age.<a name=235:34></a> It is a good exercise for the younger

		brethren to give themselves to prayer that they may quickly qualify for service in the house of God.<a name=236:1></a> Our spiritual age is measured in a moral way by soul-history with God, and development in this way need not be delayed if there is purpose of heart to seek Him out.<a name=236:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the other end of the scale it is for brothers to see to it that they do not get past 50.<a name=236:3></a> Elder brethren need to be preserved in continual watchfulness and prayer that no signs of spiritual weakening make their appearance.<a name=236:4></a> The "grey hairs" sometimes come unperceived by ourselves though others notice them.<a name=236:5></a> <i>Renewing</i> is a great element in Christianity, and so long as it has place actively -- the inward man renewed day by day -- we shall not get past 50.<a name=236:6></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- In reply to your letter of the 8th inst.<a name=236:9></a> I may say that I do not see much moral difference between going to concerts, etc.<a name=236:10></a>, listening to church music and sermons, by being actually present, and listening interestedly to these things over the wireless.<a name=236:11></a> I can understand a certain scientific interest in the means used to transmit and receive these sounds, which might lead one to listen a time or two simply on this ground.<a name=236:12></a> I know how this would have appealed to me as a youngster without my having the slightest interest in what might be actually heard.<a name=236:13></a> I am afraid that young people are sometimes drawn into a snare in this way -- the tastes of the flesh being awakened by being ministered to, perhaps for the first time, in that way.<a name=236:14></a> So that even this has to be watched.<a name=236:15></a> But I cannot understand a brother professedly walking in separation to the Lord wishing to install permanently in his house apparatus which links him on with all that the world is interested in, and more particularly with that in which it finds entertainment.<a name=236:16></a> This is certainly not to preserve the character of a covered vessel, and one would not expect to find such a one wearing priestly garments on any occasion.<a name=236:17></a>

		How such a case should be dealt with is a matter for exercise to those who come in contact with it.<a name=237:1></a> I should think that it would first be dealt with as a matter for pastoral care.<a name=237:2></a> Paul served at Ephesus "with all lowliness and tears".<a name=237:3></a> The "tears" showing that there had been much which was a sorrow in the service, but it had patiently continued, so that he was clean from the blood of all.<a name=237:4></a> If personal service in love failed to produce exercise it might become matter for admonition on the part of elders, and each case which reached this stage would have to be treated according to the state which came to light, and the indications which the Lord might give to the brethren locally.<a name=237:5></a> He loves to be counted on as the Source of wisdom in all such matters.<a name=237:6></a>

		MY DEAR MR.<a name=237:9></a> --, -- I am glad to send a few lines in answer to your letter.<a name=237:10></a> It seems to me that, as having the light of God's mind in regard to what He has before Him, <i>we</i> are able to view all our fellow-believers in relation to that mind.<a name=237:11></a> But we have sorrowfully to feel that most of them know little or nothing practically of the truth of their divine relations with their fellow-saints.<a name=237:12></a> We might, indeed, own that we ourselves are only slowly learning what those relations are, and what they involve.<a name=237:13></a> But as to those who are still held in the trammels of human systems they are in a position which is so contrary to the truth that it effectually hinders them from any true apprehension of it.<a name=237:14></a> How could they get any idea of what the service of God is in His house when they are engaged in carrying on a service which is humanly ordered, and usually carried on in a way which does not require the power of the Spirit of God!<a name=237:15></a> There is a fixed order, and generally one person officially appointed to perform the service according to it.<a name=237:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>there are distinctions of gifts and services, all manifesting unity in their operation, so that it becomes evident that one Spirit is the power of all, and that there is an anointed vessel in which all are baptised into

		one body.<a name=238:1></a> Now to come into the truth of this in a practical sense saints have had to leave the whole human order which obtains in christendom.<a name=238:2></a> The recognition of the presence of the Spirit has led many to do so.<a name=238:3></a> This is the true starting point of godly exercise.<a name=238:4></a> For if the Spirit of God is here He does not depart from the order which was originally set up in His power, nor does He sanction what is contrary to it.<a name=238:5></a> While quite admitting that He acts sovereignly in conversion and in all ministry of the truth, yet it is evident that He does not act according to the divine order in systems which are quite contrary to that order.<a name=238:6></a> I understand the "divine system" to be that which is divinely regulated in every detail, and answers to the mind of God.<a name=238:7></a> Many saints have realised that human systems do not answer to this at all, and therefore they have left them so that they might realise, at any rate in some measure, what is true of the divine system.<a name=238:8></a> All those who have the Spirit have competency to fill a divinely appointed place in the divine system, but it seems to me that it is important to see that that system will not fit in to any human order, and therefore to move in it according to God requires separation.<a name=238:9></a> Apart from this I do not think there will be any spiritual apprehension of the truth of the body or of the house.<a name=238:10></a>

		MY DEAR MR.<a name=238:12></a> --, -- I thank you for your further letter, and also for sending me the copy of the notes to which you refer, and which I now return herewith.<a name=238:13></a> I have looked at the sentence to which you have called my attention, and I do not see anything in it that seems to be particularly likely to be misunderstood.<a name=238:14></a> But perhaps I do not quite apprehend what you have in your mind about it?<a name=238:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought it was important to see that human "systems" as viewed in the light of the truth are really complete disorder, for they are contrary to what has been made known as the mind of God.<a name=238:16></a> But Scripture gives us much instruction as to an order of things which is according to God's mind, and a great part of this is found typically in Exodus and Numbers.<a name=238:17></a> It is because we are learning the features of the divine system

	<div class="paragraph">
		that we have been constrained to leave what is manifestly inconsistent with it.<a name=239:1></a> The order of God's assembly is a beautiful order, for His glory and wisdom appear in it, but it is utterly unknown in the religious organisations of men.<a name=239:2></a> It can only be known where place is given to the Spirit of God, and where the regulation of divine principles is accepted.<a name=239:3></a> It may be said, of course, that this is only true in measure of those who walk in separation from the systems of men.<a name=239:4></a> But I trust the faces of many are definitely set in that direction, and there can be no doubt that much help has been given from on high, so that the true character of the "divine system" is much better known, and practically entered into, than it was.<a name=239:5></a> But we all need to enter into it more fully and spiritually that God may increasingly have glory in the assembly.<a name=239:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With reference to the young sister who wishes to be baptised and to take her place with the saints in fellowship, I should suppose that she has already told her parents of her exercise, and of the step she proposes to take.<a name=239:7></a> She would no doubt be able to tell you what their attitude in regard to the matter is, and if they were in measure sympathetic, as I should expect them to be in regard to the baptism at any rate, as they would look upon this as a right thing to be done, though they might not much care about our way of doing it, it would be nice to give them the opportunity of being present if they desired.<a name=239:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course the young sister is not under responsibility to her parents in this matter, but to the Lord, but as honouring her parents she would certainly communicate to them the step she intended to take.<a name=239:9></a> This would be a comely confession, which the Lord might use in blessing to them.<a name=239:10></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- In answer to your letter of the 29th inst.<a name=239:12></a>, I may say that I believe the remarks referred to were made in connection with a question which was raised about withdrawing from one who had already withdrawn from us.<a name=239:13></a> It seemed to be in the minds of some that if one had withdrawn from fellowship with the saints he could not be the subject of any disciplinary action.<a name=239:14></a> If this were so, an unrighteous person could at any time save himself from coming under discipline by withdrawing.<a name=239:15></a> But if unrighteousness is definitely

		Sometimes persons withdraw through getting cold and losing interest in the Lord and His things, and it is even possible that a working of conscience may lead in such cases to a feeling of being unfit for the position and privilege.<a name=240:6></a> These are cases for pastoral care rather than for discipline; they really test the measure of our spirituality.<a name=240:7></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I thank you for your letter.<a name=245:6></a> I am much interested in your approaching marriage, if God will, and have had the privilege of praying for you both in relation to it.<a name=245:7></a> It would have been a pleasure to me to be present, and it was with a feeling of disappointment that I found that your marriage was arranged for the same day as the one at -- .<a name=245:8></a> But we shall have you specially in mind, and the <i>two</i> occasions will give more opportunity for prayer than <i>one</i>, and of this I trust that both couples may get the full gain.<a name=245:9></a> I am sure you will have the hearty fellowship of your local brethren and of all who know and love you.<a name=245:10></a> The setting up of another "goodly" tent is an event in which the lovers of God have much interest, for assembly testimony and welfare largely depend on prayerful and spiritual conditions being maintained in the households of the saints.<a name=245:11></a> I see more and more clearly that the strength of things lies there, and also that vigorous personal piety is needed on the part of both husband and wife to secure the unhindered liberty of their prayers.<a name=245:12></a> I am thankful to be assured that you have both known something of the blessedness of having to do with God in your separate pathways, and I pray that as united in marriage you may have an enlarged and deepened experience of it.<a name=245:13></a> The exercises that are inseparable from any new step in life -- and particularly one so important as marriage -- are intended to give a fresh impetus to everything that is spiritual in our souls.<a name=245:14></a> Our God and Father does not overlook the comfort that He ministers through natural affections.<a name=245:15></a> It has its own sweetness and value as sanctified by His fear, and the knowledge of His love.<a name=245:16></a> And I trust that even on the natural side you will have together an abundant experience of His loving-kindness, reaching down into the smallest detail of your lives.<a name=245:17></a> But I trust you will not be detained, even by the mercies granted you, from rising

		DEAR BROTHER, -- I gather from your letters that you wish to maintain that in a case of local disorder amongst saints the service or help of brethren outside the locality is to be regarded as "an infringement of the Lord's prerogative in relation to a local assembly", and that the attempt to render such help is introducing "a feature foreign to the administration of the local assembly".<a name=246:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I fully acknowledge that each local assembly is, like the one in Corinth, under direct responsibility to the Lord to maintain righteousness in administration, and conditions such as are in keeping with the holiness of God's house.<a name=246:4></a> But this in no wise sets aside the fact that a local company may need and obtain much help from brethren outside the locality.<a name=246:5></a> Corinth is an outstanding example of this.<a name=246:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul asserts that the saints locally are "Christ's body and members in particular".<a name=246:7></a> Thus reminding them that they are part of a universal organism, and cannot be, in any sense, independent of it.<a name=246:8></a> He also calls attention to the fact that "God has set certain in the assembly" -- clearly the assembly universally, for "apostles" are not set in any local assembly and he mentions amongst those thus set "helps" and "governments".<a name=246:9></a> Those who have that character by divine ordering would surely be responsible to serve according to it in any locality where they might become available.<a name=246:10></a> Paul recognised in Timothy and Titus men who could give spiritual help in any locality, and he sent them to Corinth as knowing the local need, and also begged Apollos much that he would go there with the brethren.<a name=246:11></a> If Corinth needed so much help from outside, where they were one company, who could be addressed as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", how can a few believers today who are consciously humbled by sorrowful local conditions assume to be independent of any help which God has set in the assembly?<a name=246:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For it must not be thought that such help is to be limited to the ministry of the word in a general way, because "governments",
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=247>[Page 247]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for example, would evidently stand in relation to matters involving order, and administration according to universal assembly principles.<a name=247:1></a> God would certainly not set aside local responsibility in any way, but He did in His faithfulness and grace give much help at Corinth so that the local responsibility might be carried out according to His pleasure.<a name=247:2></a> And He has been pleased to let us know that He has set those in the assembly generally whom He can use to furnish local help even in regard to order and administration.<a name=247:3></a> It is precisely help of this kind which is often most urgently needed, as it was at Corinth.<a name=247:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the light of this I cannot accept that there is any violation of divine principle if brothers seek to help, according to the measure of grace given to them, in cases of local difficulty.<a name=247:5></a> I do not think that the attitude which you have taken up will commend itself to brethren generally as being of God.<a name=247:6></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- The enquiry which you raise is one of much interest and importance, and it is well worthy of consideration.<a name=252:14></a> No doubt there is something for us to learn from the fact that the particular form of words used by the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>in giving the eleven their commission is not said to have been used by any in the Acts.<a name=252:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that the Lord's words are more comprehensive than any of the terms used in the Acts.<a name=252:16></a> The making disciples of all the nations was in view of men being brought into that great economy of revelation connected with the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.<a name=252:17></a> This economy included all that was made known of God as revealed in grace in the Son, and it also had in mind the Holy Spirit as subjective

		<a name=253>[Page 253]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		power to make the revelation effective in human hearts.<a name=253:1></a> The nations were to be baptised to that Name with a view to their coming into the blessedness of it in that true spirit of subjection which would mark the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=253:2></a> The Lord seems to have in mind the great positive gain that would come to all the nations through the service of His disciples, so that it would look on in result to a day that is still future.<a name=253:3></a> But His words are an authoritative commission in the light of which we can baptise now, as having a great sense of the Name to which we baptise, and of all the fulness of blessing which is wrapped up in it.<a name=253:4></a> I am sure this should have a great place in our thoughts as we baptise.<a name=253:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Acts what is made prominent is the Name of Jesus Christ or the Name of the Lord.<a name=253:6></a> God having made Him Lord and Christ raises a direct issue with those who had crucified Him.<a name=253:7></a> Repentance in regard to what they had done, and the public recognition of the Name of Jesus Christ in baptism, would secure the remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=253:8></a> Baptism here is that by which men clear themselves in respect of the dreadful deed that has been done.<a name=253:9></a> So that it is the divine way of escape from a perverse generation into a position on earth where God's blessing and favour can be known and enjoyed.<a name=253:10></a> It is evident that from this point of view the name of Jesus Christ is the important matter to make prominent in connection with baptism.<a name=253:11></a> It is not exactly in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a> that it is done <i>in</i> His Name, but His Name supplies the occasion or condition on which it is done.<a name=253:12></a> There is the recognition of His Name in doing it on the part of those baptised.<a name=253:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:48">Acts  10:48</a>, it is "in the name of the Lord".<a name=253:14></a> It is done as directly under His authority.<a name=253:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:5">Acts  19:5</a> it is "to the name of the Lord Jesus;" He being known now as having come, they were set by baptism in relation to His Name like being baptised to Moses in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:2">1 Corinthians  10:2</a>.<a name=253:16></a> So also in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:3">Romans  6:3</a>, 4, and <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:27">Galatians  3:27</a>.<a name=253:17></a> So that in the Acts and in the epistles we see how baptism stands in relation to the Name of Jesus Christ and to the Name of the Lord, and that it is to Christ.<a name=253:18></a> It is needful to see clearly that baptism is a matter of the Lord's authority, and that it is to Him.<a name=253:19></a> It seems to me that this is what would generally be stressed at baptisms at the present time, and that it is on this account that it is so presented in the Acts and epistles.<a name=253:20></a>

		But this does not in any way mean that we are to lose sight of the great scope of what the Lord presented in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>.<a name=254:1></a> But the latter requires more maturity of spiritual understanding as embracing the whole economy of grace -- one might say the whole mediatorial system.<a name=254:2></a> Those of the nations are to be baptised to that.<a name=254:3></a> We have that in mind when we baptise, so that it is quite in order that persons should be baptised to that Name.<a name=254:4></a> Nothing less than that is really in view, but it is a vast and wondrous presentation of God as known in three Persons.<a name=254:5></a> The whole Christian economy is bound up in it -- God as saints of the assembly know Him.<a name=254:6></a> But in the actual taking up of things we first come to the recognition of the Name of Jesus Christ; that Name becomes the occasion of our baptism; we identify ourselves publicly with that Name here where He has been crucified.<a name=254:7></a> Then in being baptised to Him we are permanently committed to Him to own Him as Lord, and, as He has died here, to accept identification with His death.<a name=254:8></a> All this involving a public position here in which believing parents are entitled to have their children with them, in view of bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.<a name=254:9></a> All this, it seems to me, is more the side of how we take up baptism, while <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>gives the whole great result as known to the Lord, and as in the minds of those who baptise intelligently.<a name=254:10></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I greatly value your letter and the care which you and the dear brethren are expending on the case before you, which is in many ways so sorrowful, and yet in connection with which there seem to be some rays of divine light, and some prospect of a maturing of the work of God.<a name=254:12></a> As having had the matter brought before me I feel now under obligation to share the exercise with you, at any rate in my prayers.<a name=254:13></a>.<a name=254:14></a>.<a name=254:15></a>.<a name=254:16></a>

		From what I heard I was a little concerned lest the moral disorder of the past, which in this case is very sorrowfully manifest, should be in any way regarded as a barrier to one being received to fellowship who now judges it and has thus been morally cleansed from it.<a name=255:5></a> Your letter makes very clear that you have not this at all in your mind.<a name=255:6></a> I think you are right in wishing to be assured that moral cleansing has taken place, so that what was wrong is now viewed as wrong though it is now manifestly impossible to retrace the steps and undo the past.<a name=255:7></a> There is the sprinkling of clean water upon the subjects of the new covenant as well as the full discharge of sins and lawlessnesses being remembered no more.<a name=255:8></a> But in relation to this it is well to bear in mind that there is not the same capacity for self-judgment in all, and the sin-offering of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5:11">Leviticus  5:11</a> would have a bearing on this.<a name=255:9></a>.<a name=255:10></a>.<a name=255:11></a>.<a name=255:12></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I am interested to have your letter, and I enter very sympathetically into your feelings and exercises as to the matter referred to.<a name=256:1></a> God has pleasure in a sensitive conscience, and He dwells "with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#57:15">Isaiah  57:15</a>.<a name=256:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>how we are reminded of what we were in times past, and also in <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:3">Titus  3:3</a>, but this is evidently to intensify our appreciation of the wondrous grace that has come to us, and to fill us with profound gratitude.<a name=256:3></a> For all our sins have been forgiven and forgotten by God; He does not hold a single thing against us.<a name=256:4></a> In your own case you have made confession, not only to God but also to the one trespassed against, and there is no moral question outstanding in regard to the matter.<a name=256:5></a> It seems to me that Satan is seeking to hinder your liberty by keeping before you a matter which has really been dealt with in a righteous and holy way, and which grace entitles you to regard as divinely settled in all the sin-cleansing value of the precious blood of Christ.<a name=256:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can well understand that any mention of a similar subject revives a certain recollection which is of a humbling nature.<a name=256:7></a> It can hardly be otherwise under the circumstances.<a name=256:8></a> But I believe God would give you immediately the consciousness by His Spirit of how perfectly you have been relieved of the moral stain, and that through the one offering of Christ you are perfected for ever.<a name=256:9></a> Your heart would thus be lifted up in grateful thanks.<a name=256:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that Peter charged upon the Jews that they had "denied the holy and righteous one".<a name=256:11></a> He must surely have thought, as he uttered the words, of how he himself had denied Him, and yet he was now so freed from it by self-judgment and confession that he did not hesitate to bring the charge upon their consciences.<a name=256:12></a> God was really honoured in this, for we honour Him by taking full account of His grace.<a name=256:13></a> It does not honour Him if we, as it were, pull a cloud over our spirits which He does not put there.<a name=256:14></a> Satan would like to rob God of the glory that is due to His grace by retaining a cloud where God would give sunshine.<a name=256:15></a> You must watch and pray against giving way to anything of this kind.<a name=256:16></a> The very sensitiveness of your heart and conscience may be taken advantage of by the enemy in this way, but he is to be resisted by stedfastness in faith.<a name=256:17></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- It is evident, I think, that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>and 25 contemplate two classes which are clearly discriminated when the Lord comes.<a name=257:10></a> There is the faithful and prudent bondman in chapter 24, and also the evil bondman; the five prudent virgins in chapter 25, and also the five foolish ones; and in relation to the talents the two good and faithful bondmen, and also the wicked and slothful bondman.<a name=257:11></a> It is said particularly of the foolish virgins that they "did not take oil with them".<a name=257:12></a> In a dispensation characterised by the presence of the Spirit they wholly lacked the essential element.<a name=257:13></a> It is clearly not a question of receiving the Lord into the midst of His assembly, but of going forth to meet Him, and going in with Him to the wedding feast.<a name=257:14></a> And the door being shut shows that the exclusion is final, and there is no response to the cry, "Lord, Lord, open to us", save that He answers, "Verily I say unto you, I do not know you".<a name=257:15></a> If there were any work of God there the Lord would never say, "I do not know you".<a name=257:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When it is a question of His coming in to us it is He who knocks, and it is for us to open to Him, as we see in what is written to Laodicea.<a name=257:17></a> He is in the attitude of standing at the door and knocking; there is no thought of His shutting the door upon Laodicea; there is a last solemn moment when He will spue her out of His mouth, but that means final and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=258>[Page 258]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		eternal rejection by Him.<a name=258:1></a> But Laodicea has her door shut upon Him, and He waits in the patience of His love to see if anyone will hear His voice and open the door.<a name=258:2></a> If so He will come in to that one and sup with him, and have that one to sup with Him.<a name=258:3></a> It does not seem to be in accord with Scripture to think of the Lord shutting out at the present time any of those who are His by redemption, and by a work of God in them.<a name=258:4></a> They may keep Him outside, alas!<a name=258:5></a> but His love is such that He will never shut the door upon them, or declare that He does not know them.<a name=258:6></a> His heart longs for them all, and He waits in the patience of His love for them to open the door to Him.<a name=258:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a matter of interpretation I believe the five foolish virgins represent those who are in the place of profession, but who have no personal link with the Bridegroom and who have not the Spirit.<a name=258:8></a> When the others go in with Him to the marriage they do not go in, and the door is shut, and when they come to knock He tells them that He does not know them.<a name=258:9></a> He says this after He and the wise virgins have gone in to the marriage.<a name=258:10></a> This present period of going forth to meet Him is then over, and there is no longer any opportunity to do so.<a name=258:11></a> This could not possibly be applied to any saints at the present time; however lax and worldly they may be, Jesus would still say, "Let him that hears say, Come.<a name=258:12></a> And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=258:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		more particularly to how things stand in Scripture, and in the light of this He expects us to adjust our practices so that they more and more bear the impress of what is in accord with the mind of God.<a name=259:1></a> And for two or three years past it has been brought before us that the local assembly is the administrative unit, and that there is no scripture for a certain number of meetings agreeing to work together in a systematic way.<a name=259:2></a> A fellowship meeting is, of course, entirely the responsibility of those in the place where it is held.<a name=259:3></a> It gives opportunity for the ministry of those gifts whom God has set in the assembly to become available to many brethren, and the only limit to this is the number that can be practically provided for.<a name=259:4></a> But even for fellowship meetings it seems to be desirable that invitations should not always be sent to exactly the same places.<a name=259:5></a> We want to reach out as far as is practicable to all that are within our reach, so that it might sometimes be well to leave out one or two meetings so that we might take in one or two others.<a name=259:6></a> So that our area does not become too sharply defined.<a name=259:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the light of current exercises we have felt it happy to give up the united readings of the three meetings -- Newton Abbot, Dawlish and Teignmouth -- as savouring of a kind of special fellowship.<a name=259:8></a> But the brethren are, of course, free to go to the local readings, and always have done more or less, so that the giving up of the special readings does not really diminish the opportunities for fellowship.<a name=259:9></a> But it removes what might grow into what is not in accord with assembly principles.<a name=259:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am convinced that the increased number of fellowship meetings amongst us is evidence of a distinct work of God, and it is ministering to spiritual increase and prosperity.<a name=259:11></a> So that anything that is being given up, as being not exactly in line with divine principles, is being very largely compensated for by an increased wealth of spiritual ministry becoming available in this way for saints generally.<a name=259:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thankful to be here for a little time, and I feel encouraged to see the local interest and the exercises of the dear brethren.<a name=259:13></a> We had a special reading last night to consider the subject of local meetings for edification.<a name=259:14></a> This exercise has been before the brethren here for a considerable time, and I think it is now coming to maturity.<a name=259:15></a>.<a name=259:16></a>.<a name=259:17></a>.<a name=259:18></a>

		<a name=261>[Page 261]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		mention very briefly some of the considerations which have brought this about.<a name=261:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		About 100 years ago there began a movement of the Spirit of God amongst His children in many different parts which produced wide-spread exercise in regard to the truth of the church, or assembly, of God.<a name=261:2></a> There were national bodies in evidence then, as now, and also different sects possessed of more or less truth.<a name=261:3></a> But neither of these different forms of religious association answered to the truth as presented in Scripture.<a name=261:4></a> The national bodies nominally included all baptised persons within their area, including a great mass of persons who were not converted at all.<a name=261:5></a> This was manifestly far too wide to be a true basis of Christian fellowship.<a name=261:6></a> On the other hand each of the sects had its own membership of persons who adopted its particular form of church organisation and theological views.<a name=261:7></a> By taking a distinctive name each sect marked itself off from all others, and had thus confessedly a narrower fellowship than the assembly of God.<a name=261:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Scriptures were prayerfully considered, and the Holy Spirit was recognised as being here to give illumination in the mind of God, it was soon perceived that there was nothing in Scripture to justify the arrangements which were in force by human ordering.<a name=261:9></a> It was learned from 1 Corinthians that the saints in any particular place formed the assembly of God in that place, and that they could come together to exercise discipline, if necessary (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>), to eat the Lord's supper (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>), and for edification (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>), without any appointed minister or leader.<a name=261:10></a> It was seen that the Holy Spirit operated, and divided as He pleased spiritual gifts amongst the saints, so that it might appear that they were one body by the way the different members functioned together (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>).<a name=261:11></a> One Member of the body cannot possibly function as a substitute for the other members, however gifted he may be.<a name=261:12></a> So that <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>and 14 completely set aside the clerical system, and show that an entirely different system is in the mind of God for His assembly.<a name=261:13></a> Each local assembly has "body" character (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>), and is therefore intended to function body-wise.<a name=261:14></a> Now neither in the national bodies nor in the sects is there normally any such coming together.<a name=261:15></a> That is, there is no such coming together as is contemplated in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=262>[Page 262]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture as the normal coming together of the assembly of God.<a name=262:1></a> In the light of this what can any exercised believer do, who wishes to walk in the light of God's mind as made known in Scripture, but separate from an order of things which leaves no room for the divine order?<a name=262:2></a> The assembly is not merely a congregation or an organisation; it is an organism, the members of which function together in unity.<a name=262:3></a> It is clearly suggested in Scripture that the service of God assembly-wise will go on under such conditions.<a name=262:4></a> If there is no room for the manifestation of the Spirit in different members of the worshipping body, is it not a grave departure from the divine order?<a name=262:5></a> Why should not the worshipping company pass on from the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup to praise divine Persons in the beauty of holiness -- the different members functioning according to the measure given in the service of praise?<a name=262:6></a> This would secure a living service with unlimited possibility of spiritual expansion, so that with deepening spirituality there may be a deepened and enlarged volume of praise ascending from the body as the worshipping company.<a name=262:7></a> One can hardly conceive what the service of praise would be if all the vessels of the sanctuary were available in a practical way.<a name=262:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of Christian fellowship involves separation from what is evil.<a name=262:9></a> This is clearly seen in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>and <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6">2 Corinthians  6</a>, and our definite instruction for the last days is: "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity (or unrighteousness)".<a name=262:10></a> It is as the people of God have acted on this principle that they have received great light as to the spiritual privileges and constitution of the assembly.<a name=262:11></a> Indeed, every part of the truth concerning Christ and the whole counsel of God has been ministered by the Holy Spirit amongst those who have honoured God and the Lord Jesus by separating from what was not in accord with true assembly order as laid down in Scripture.<a name=262:12></a> Room was made by the grace of God for a ministry which could not possibly have been given in conditions where there was no room for it.<a name=262:13></a> How could assembly truth be brought out where there were no assembly conditions?<a name=262:14></a> It is a common thing for those who are not prepared to separate from evil to desire to benefit by the spiritual wealth which has been given to those who have walked in separation.<a name=262:15></a> But this would be to hold the truth in unrighteousness.<a name=262:16></a> The ministry is, indeed, available

		It is evident from Scripture that there are different families named of the Father -- Old Testament saints, and the different companies in the Revelation -- and each family will have its own place in the universe of bliss.<a name=265:3></a> I should not like to say that there are different families now, because this is the assembly period, the day of the Spirit, and I am not aware that there is any thought in Scripture of other families having a concurrent place in the ways of God.<a name=265:4></a> I think we should be getting off solid ground if we began to speculate on the possibility of there being other families now.<a name=265:5></a> "In the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit".<a name=265:6></a> The Lord's servants were sent into all the world to preach the glad tidings to all the creation.<a name=265:7></a> There is no thought, so far as I see, of any other testimony going forth alongside the glad tidings.<a name=265:8></a> Our business is to take account of what is revealed, and to see that those with whom we come in contact truly hear the present testimony of God.<a name=265:9></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD, -- In reply to your letter of the 10th inst.<a name=267:10></a> with reference to the sorrowful case which you have under consideration at --, it seems to me that the withdrawal of the brother in question raises a question of principle, in regard to which it is due to the Lord that there should be some expression of assembly judgment.<a name=267:11></a> I do not think any of us would be free to accept that the principles of association which mark --, or --, are such as we have learned, by divine favour, to be those of the assembly of God.<a name=267:12></a> The brother, it appears, has not identified himself personally with those bodies, so that it is not exactly a question of his <i>conduct</i> but of the <i>principles</i> which he avows.<a name=267:13></a> A principle adopted and adhered to after remonstrance and instruction is quite as serious as conduct.<a name=267:14></a> It is perhaps more serious, as involving a leavening influence which may spread if it is not judged.<a name=267:15></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD, -- .<a name=268:15></a>.<a name=268:16></a>.<a name=268:17></a> I think it is evident that the one who had so sinned at Corinth is regarded as one whose spirit was to be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name=268:18></a> That is, he is viewed as a believer.<a name=268:19></a> But his conduct made him a subject of judgment and discipline from the Lord, and the assembly was called upon to act in accord with the Lord's mind in this.<a name=268:20></a> As Paul, by the Spirit calls him a "wicked person" I conclude that he had not, as yet, judged himself.<a name=268:21></a> He is presented in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>as guilty of that which must be judged as evil by the assembly of God.<a name=268:22></a> This was, no doubt, in view of his judging it by the same judgment as the assembly.<a name=268:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that the apostle uses the word "brother" in relation to very evil conduct in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, but he modifies it by saying, "if any one <i>called</i> brother".<a name=269:5></a> It is as much as to say, he has had that place publicly, but whether he is truly a brother may be somewhat questionable.<a name=269:6></a> It does not seem to me that a meeting for discipline is exactly the time to emphasise the fact that the evil-doer is a "brother".<a name=269:7></a> It is an occasion for marking the Lord's solemn judgment of evil, in which the assembly is in accord with Him.<a name=269:8></a> In some cases we may be well assured that the one in question is a brother.<a name=269:9></a> If he is known to have repented of the evil he has done there is good reason to own him as a brother, and the assembly will look forward with confidence to his restoration to Christian privilege.<a name=269:10></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER IN THE LORD, -- It has been a very definite exercise with me ever since I began to break bread that the printed ministry ought not to be made the source of financial profit.<a name=274:1></a> The first tracts which I wrote, about 55 years ago, I published myself at cost price, and the brethren generally greatly appreciated the opportunity of getting gospel tracts at a low price.<a name=274:2></a> But the Tract Depots did not approve of profits being eliminated, and I had at that time to fall in with the system current.<a name=274:3></a> But I clung to the thought that the Lord's work should not be regarded as a profit making business.<a name=274:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For many years there has been a growing exercise that books of ministry were sold at prices which seriously curtailed their circulation .<a name=274:5></a>.<a name=274:6></a>.<a name=274:7></a> It was felt that the Lord was giving very much that was intended by Him for the blessing of His saints universally, and that gospel books were rightly to be distributed as widely as possible.<a name=274:8></a> It seemed clearly to be wrong to impose an unnecessary check upon the circulation of that which had been so freely given from on high.<a name=274:9></a>.<a name=274:10></a>.<a name=274:11></a>.<a name=274:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will be able to gather from the above how I regard the matter.<a name=274:13></a> Of course the elimination of the commercial element from this particular part of the Lord's work involves in principle that it should be eliminated from the distributing agencies also.<a name=274:14></a> That is, the Tract Depots should be regarded as kept for the furtherance of the work of the Lord, and not for the purpose of making profit on the ministry which is sold.<a name=274:15></a> And brethren should be prepared to have fellowship in the necessary cost of maintaining the Depots.<a name=274:16></a> Adequate compensation for this would be found in the fact that the ministry would be available at less than half the cost, so that two or three books could be given away in place of one.<a name=274:17></a> Indeed, the very large increase of the circulation of the printed ministry is marked evidence of the need there was of a change.<a name=274:18></a> But even apart from considering what has resulted I feel sure that you will agree that it is not good that the commercial element should so influence the publishing of spiritual ministry that the circulation of it is restricted.<a name=274:19></a> Our desire is that it should go abroad as freely as possible for all those for whose benefit the Lord has given it.<a name=274:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		BELOVED BROTHER, -- Many thanks for allowing me to see the letter which I return herewith.<a name=275:1></a> Our dear and esteemed brother writes in a nice spirit "as only having in view the better elucidation of the subject of propitiation", so that I feel free to make a few remarks on his letter which you are welcome to send on to him with my love in the Lord, if you think well to do so.<a name=275:2></a> I comment on his letter as being thoroughly one with him in the desire that "this important aspect of the truth might be clarified", and I trust the Lord may help to this end.<a name=275:3></a> My contribution will be confined to pointing out what seems to me to be a fundamental misconception of the subject.<a name=275:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our dear brother sees that God has in love provided the propitiation (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:10">1 John  4:10</a>), and he concludes from this that -- propitiation is from God to man, and that it carries the thought of God being propitious (favourable) toward man.<a name=275:5></a> He illustrates propitiation by the coats of skin (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>), and by the mercy-seat in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>.<a name=275:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to suggest for the consideration of our dear brother that the scriptural view of propitiation is that it is wholly God-ward.<a name=275:7></a> Not, surely, to bring about any change in God, but to glorify Him in holiness so that He may consistently with His own glory make Himself known in mercy and grace to sinful creatures.<a name=275:8></a> God is propitious to man the sinner, but it is on the ground that Christ has been the propitiation in all the value God-ward of His offering for sin.<a name=275:9></a> J.<a name=275:10></a>N.<a name=275:11></a>D.<a name=275:12></a> has well expressed the truth in saying, "Propitiation is presenting to a holy God what the righteousness and holiness of that God necessarily claim, while infinite love has provided, and infinite love has offered, the spotless sacrifice".<a name=275:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If this is accepted as being true it will be evident that the coats of skin do not in themselves give us the idea of propitiation.<a name=275:14></a> They express typically what God in righteous grace can put upon man as the result of propitiation.<a name=275:15></a> It has been said many times that "skin" showed that death had taken place.<a name=275:16></a> If propitiation is to be found in this type it would be set forth in the death of the animals, and not in the coats of skin which resulted, and which became a covering for man.<a name=275:17></a> Righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ is now towards all, and upon all those who believe, but this is on the ground of propitiation.<a name=275:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then our dear brother has adopted the idea that "mercy-seat"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=276>[Page 276]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is the scriptural meaning of "propitiation", and it is probably this which has formed his thoughts on the subject.<a name=276:1></a> But though this statement has often been made it is not true.<a name=276:2></a> J.<a name=276:3></a>N.<a name=276:4></a>D.<a name=276:5></a>'s note to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a> in the New Translation is certainly right.<a name=276:6></a> It was the blood being put upon the mercy-seat which effected atonement or propitiation.<a name=276:7></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>leaves no doubt whatever about this.<a name=276:8></a> Paul, in speaking of Christ Jesus being set forth a mercy-seat, evidently had in mind the mercy-seat as it was after the day of atonement, when the blood of the sin offering was upon it.<a name=276:9></a> It is evident in the type that that the mercy-seat was distinguishable from the blood of the sin offering which was put upon it.<a name=276:10></a> It was the latter which made atonement.<a name=276:11></a> Now the propitiation and the mercy-seat are identified, for both meet in one Person.<a name=276:12></a> He is the propitiation in all the value of His sacrifice for sin.<a name=276:13></a> And He is also the mercy-seat as set forth by God for the showing forth of His righteousness in passing by the sins of His people of old, and now in justifying.<a name=276:14></a> Christ as set forth by God to man as the Mercy-seat is never to be separated from what He is as the propitiation.<a name=276:15></a> We cannot set forth the righteousness of God as known in the glad tidings without bringing in the thought of propitiation.<a name=276:16></a> "His blood" is that of the sin offering which has met every claim of the divine glory.<a name=276:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Atonement" is the great word in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>.<a name=276:18></a> It means a covering, and it is not used in the New Testament, I suppose because the Son of God having been sent as the propitiation there is very much more brought into it than merely covering sin.<a name=276:19></a> God is glorified in an infinite way about that which was abhorrent to Him.<a name=276:20></a> But all that lies in the word "atonement" in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>lies in the word "propitiation" in the New Testament.<a name=276:21></a> Christ suffered for sins, and He was forsaken by God as made sin, and in this way He became the propitiation.<a name=276:22></a> It was the only ground on which God could be righteously a Saviour God or a Justifier.<a name=276:23></a> God required propitiation as the basis of all His actings in mercy and grace, but He provided it Himself in wondrous love.<a name=276:24></a> The whole principle of offering for sin brought out that God required what met His glory in this way.<a name=276:25></a> Propitiation is the rendering to God what is due to His holy glory by One bearing the judgment of sins and sin.<a name=276:26></a> That God is favourably disposed towards His fallen creature is blessedly true, and it did not need propitiation to make it true.<a name=276:27></a> But without providing for His own glory by atonement

		Satan seeks to corrupt what is of God very largely by mixing it up with what is not of God.<a name=280:10></a> And he even uses what is of God to accredit institutions and associations which are not of God.<a name=280:11></a> For example, every earnest clergyman who preaches some measure of the truth accredits by it the system with which he is connected.<a name=280:12></a> The wrong system derives some sanction from the fact that earnest and godly men remain in it.<a name=280:13></a> They ought all to withdraw from unrighteousness, and to purge themselves from vessels to dishonour by separating from them.<a name=280:14></a> If they do not do so they are in a false position, even though God in the sovereignty of His mercy may use them to bring some measure of light and blessing to souls.<a name=280:15></a> It would not be right for us to go to them in a false position -- a position which God has shown us to be contrary to His mind.<a name=280:16></a> It would be giving up what God has committed to us for testimony, and we should inevitably drop down to the level of what we associated with.<a name=280:17></a>

		Then the shaking and overthrowing at the end of the chapter are in view of Zerubbabel being made "as a signet".<a name=281:15></a> That is, God has in mind to put the impress of Christ upon persons for His pleasure.<a name=281:16></a> It is good to bear in mind that this is what God is after, and He will make the general shaking further it.<a name=281:17></a> He will produce an impressionable state that will be prepared to be moulded under His chosen Signet.<a name=281:18></a> Having this in mind, we could not but be very sympathetic with the sorrows of suffering humanity, and this would establish a point of contact with souls which God would use for blessing.<a name=281:19></a> Surely we all desire at such a time as this to be serviceable vessels!<a name=281:20></a>

		Holy Spirit being sent cannot be regarded as an exception unless it can be made evident that it is one.<a name=283:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is manifest that as "sent" the Son had a mission to carry out; He was in the position of doing the will of Another.<a name=283:2></a> He said Himself, "For I am come down from heaven, not that I should do my will, but the will of him that has sent me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:38">John  6:38</a>.<a name=283:3></a> This does not imply any inequality between Him and the Father in the Godhead, but it does assert that as come down from heaven He took a relative position in which He did not do His own will but that of the Father.<a name=283:4></a> Jesus is God, but obedience is not a proof of His Deity, but of His perfection as Man.<a name=283:5></a> It may be said that His own will could not be otherwise than right, but this does not alter the fact that if He had done His own will it would have been to give up the whole principle on which He lived as Man.<a name=283:6></a> No believer needs to be reminded that at a most solemn hour He said, "But not as I will, but as thou wilt".<a name=283:7></a> It is as Man that He is seen to be the sent One of God the Father.<a name=283:8></a> So John can say, "And we have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:14">1 John  4:14</a>.<a name=283:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=283:10></a> -- says that to speak of "sent" in this way is to deny "absolute equality to God the Holy Spirit, for He was 'sent'".<a name=283:11></a> He asks, "In what way, then, was the Holy Spirit 'sent' and 'given'?<a name=283:12></a>" The answer is very simple.<a name=283:13></a> He was sent by the Father and by the Son as glorified to take a special place with and in the saints which was, and is, quite distinct from the place which He has as in absolute Deity.<a name=283:14></a> If this is not maintained as the truth, the place which the Holy Spirit holds in the present divine economy will not be understood.<a name=283:15></a> I hold, through grace, that the Holy Spirit is God in the most absolute sense.<a name=283:16></a> But I also see that He has come into a special place, and is carrying on a special service, as sent by the Father and the Son, and that this special place and service of the Holy Spirit gives character to the economy in which God is known today.<a name=283:17></a> The Holy Spirit is God, and He has part in all that belongs to Godhead, including omniscience and omnipresence.<a name=283:18></a> But as sent by the Father and the Son His activities are limited to those to whom He has been sent.<a name=283:19></a> He indwells the saints, and is known to them as the Comforter, the Spirit of truth; He announces to them certain things which He has heard and received.<a name=283:20></a> The fact that the Holy Spirit hears and receives before He announces shows that, as thus spoken of, He has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=284>[Page 284]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a place in the divine economy which corresponds with the place which the Son has taken in that economy.<a name=284:1></a> Not that the Holy Spirit has become incarnate, but as indwelling the saints He operates in a special way to do what He was sent to do, and which is clearly set forth in the scriptures which speak of it.<a name=284:2></a> There is a speciality about the present service of the Spirit which we shall not clearly apprehend if we do not distinguish it from those universal activities which pertain to Him as a co-equal Person in the Godhead.<a name=284:3></a> His place in the Godhead remains unchanged and unchangeable eternally, but as "sent" He has come into a place in which He was not before, nor could be until redemption had been accomplished and Jesus glorified.<a name=284:4></a> His position, and the service which He renders in that position, are entirely new to Him, and they belong to the present economy in which the Father and the Son are viewed as sending, and the Holy Spirit is seen as "sent" for certain specific purposes which do not cover all that He is as a Person in the Godhead.<a name=284:5></a> Both the Son and the Spirit when viewed as "sent" have a particular sphere of service to fill, but each of Them has also His own place in eternal Deity.<a name=284:6></a> What belongs to divine Persons in Themselves is one thing; the place which Two of Them have come into as "sent" is another.<a name=284:7></a> The latter belongs to the present divine economy.<a name=284:8></a> One of the co-equal divine Persons has become Man; Another of Them has come to dwell in the saints.<a name=284:9></a> All this is infinitely profound and blessed, but it is the plain and simple truth as stated in the Holy Scriptures.<a name=284:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What the Holy Spirit does as "sent" is confined to the circle of the saints, and it moves on the lines indicated by the Lord's words and by other scriptures.<a name=284:11></a> But I do not suppose that any intelligent believer would say or think that there is no action of the Spirit, as One of the Persons in the Godhead, outside the circle to which He has come as "sent".<a name=284:12></a> He acts in His own sovereign divine power universally, but as "sent" by the Father and the Son He acts in a particular and limited sphere, and on certain lines which Scripture presents in a very definite way.<a name=284:13></a> The Spirit has a place in the divine economy which is special and for particular objects, but which does not cover all that He is and does as a divine Person in the Godhead.<a name=284:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With reference to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, it is clearly to be seen that the writer tells us that he is speaking of "the habitable world which is to come".<a name=284:15></a> He is not thinking of Adam in innocence,

		but of the Son of man.<a name=285:1></a> "The son of man" in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is, literally, "the son of Adam", and it is certain that Adam could not be the Son of man.<a name=285:2></a> It is the Son of man of whom certain things are predicated in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:7">Hebrews  2:7</a> which will be fulfilled in the world to come.<a name=285:3></a> In the meantime "we see Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour".<a name=285:4></a> The Spirit of God has used these words, and they leave no doubt that Jesus was found as in manhood in a position of relative inferiority, though never ceasing to be, as to His own Person, all that is said of Him in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>.<a name=285:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		seemed to call for it.<a name=293:1></a> But these honoured servants spent their lives in labouring that saints might be brought into the truth of the assembly, and might walk together according to it in spiritual reality.<a name=293:2></a> So that the warning against assuming in a formal way to be "the assembly" is quite consistent with the earnest desire that not one iota of the truth in regard to the assembly shall be a dead letter.<a name=293:3></a> I believe that the Lord intends us to walk in the light of every part of that truth.<a name=293:4></a> He has, in wondrous mercy, revived a testimony to what is in the mind of God, and I believe that He will maintain it.<a name=293:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot understand saints who have had light as to the assembly, and who believe that the divine thought of fellowship, and of assembly features and privileges, has been revived in mercy, and that these things are known in a practical way by thousands of saints the world over, taking the ground that assembly administration in dealing with evil is not to have any place.<a name=293:6></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a> - 20 is clearly part of the truth as to the assembly; it is a divine provision for matters which the Lord knew would arise.<a name=293:7></a> It may, of course, be said that the assembly is not in evidence in a concrete way as it was at Corinth.<a name=293:8></a> But if a few saints are in the light of the assembly, and in suitable moral conditions, assembly features will be there without any formal claim to be "the assembly".<a name=293:9></a> My impression is that, without any pretension, there is an increased cherishing of every part of the truth concerning the assembly, and increased desire to maintain it in a practical way.<a name=293:10></a> In order to this there must necessarily be the feature of assembly administration.<a name=293:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord appears to have had a day of departure in mind when He added <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>, 20 to what He had said before as to "the assembly".<a name=293:12></a> "Two of you" would be two of the assembly -- two who hold assembly ground spiritually, however great the general departure may be.<a name=293:13></a> If only "two" are available they can maintain what is due to the Lord in the assembly, in dependence upon His Father, and with the support and sanction of His presence.<a name=293:14></a> This, when the conditions of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>, 20 are found, is not a pretension but a spiritual reality, and it can be carried out in faithfulness to the Lord without any formal claim to be "the assembly".<a name=293:15></a>

		I fully admit the weakness of things in the present day.<a name=293:16></a> It is manifested by the fact that I, or any other brother, may maintain the truth at one time and discredit it at another.<a name=293:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not able to write as fully as I could wish, but I hope I have written enough to make clear what is in my mind.<a name=294:4></a> I fear that the statements in "Righteousness in the last Days" may not have been sufficiently guarded, and it may be they would need to be balanced by the statement that assembly truth and principles can be maintained, by the grace of God, without any formal claim to be "the assembly", There has been a good deal of ministry which bears upon this with which I am in the fullest accord.<a name=294:5></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- The question you raise as to speaking of the assembly of God in a place where no saints come together as in the light of the truth is of interest and importance.<a name=295:15></a> I am free to submit my thoughts as to this to your judgment.<a name=295:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not that such would publicly or formally claim to be the assembly of God, but they walk together as in the light and faith of the assembly position, and they are, I think we may say, the assembly of God representatively.<a name=296:9></a> There is something under the eye of God, and known to faith, which has the true character of the assembly of God in contrast to the many religious bodies which have not that character at all.<a name=296:10></a> There may be many believers in a place, but if they are all found on sectarian or independent ground how can we rightly speak of the assembly of God in that place?<a name=296:11></a> Through the enemy's work, and man's unfaithfulness or infirmity, the assembly of God is not there in any concrete expression.<a name=296:12></a> There may be material for the house there, and perhaps we may do something to get it built together, but, so far as I can see, nothing has taken assembly form as yet.<a name=296:13></a>

		I know that it has often been said that all the believers in a place make up the assembly of God in that place.<a name=296:14></a> But this is looking at the matter very abstractly, and it does not carry us beyond what any pious person in the sects would say, and the practical result of holding this idea is that exercise is set aside, and believers made content to remain where they are.<a name=296:15></a> I do not see that Scripture contemplates the local assemblies of God in any such a vague and intangible way.<a name=296:16></a> They are always, I believe, definite companies of persons who have certain customs, and who can depute messengers to carry their practical love to saints in other localities, and who can receive letters of commendation.<a name=296:17></a> It seems to me that if we

		In all typical characters it is very needful to distinguish between what they were personally and those incidents in which they were typical of Christ.<a name=306:20></a> This is especially needful in such a case as Samson's.<a name=306:21></a> His personal weaknesses are marked, and yet he has faith (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>) and power by the Spirit of Jehovah.<a name=306:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#16:3">Judges  16:3</a> it is not the Spirit exactly, but his own inherent power by which he escapes from the

		snare.<a name=307:1></a> It is good when we see a believer who has been caught by the enemy proving that he has power to extricate himself.<a name=307:2></a> In so doing he shows that there is inward power notwithstanding his sad failure.<a name=307:3></a> So that Samson does something which the Spirit of God can use as typical of Christ.<a name=307:4></a> There was something there by the work of God which asserted itself in the crisis of verse 2.<a name=307:5></a> We might wonder how such weakness and such power can be in the same man, if we did not know something of our own history!<a name=307:6></a> God knows how necessary it is that we should be humbled by our own weakness if we are to be in any marked way the vessels of His power.<a name=307:7></a> God sometimes uses that which has something discreditable about it, so that there may be no glorying in man, and in times of disorder like we see in Judges it would be likely that He would do so.<a name=307:8></a> He takes up what is not commendable, but disciplines the vessel so as to bring out features of Christ, and these are enhanced by the previous contrariety.<a name=307:9></a> I think Samson is very instructive for us in the last days.<a name=307:10></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- .<a name=307:18></a>.<a name=307:19></a>.<a name=307:20></a> As to Revelation, and the bearing of current events, there can be no doubt that things are moving in the direction which the prophetic word indicates.<a name=307:21></a> But we have always to bear in mind that the assembly period is not the subject of prophecy.<a name=307:22></a> It is instructive to observe, in connection with the fourth beast, that the Spirit of God passes over to the events of the last days, and gives little or no intimation as to what would transpire during the time that saints of the assembly are being called.<a name=307:23></a> The present is a gap in

		prophetic time, and it has always proved fruitless and misleading to try to connect what is happening now with prophecy, though many believers have wasted time in the attempt.<a name=308:1></a> One thing is certain, that the mystery of lawlessness was already working when 2 Thessalonians was written, and it has been developing ever since.<a name=308:2></a> But there is divine restraint upon it, so that the principles at work are not allowed to mature so long as the assembly is here.<a name=308:3></a> The "opened door" set before Philadelphia cannot be shut.<a name=308:4></a> We know not what changes may take place before the ten-kingdomed confederacy takes shape, and it is not well to try to forecast the course of human events.<a name=308:5></a> Our great concern should be to understand what wonders God is bringing to pass in gathering Christ's joint-heirs, and in securing His own inheritance in the saints.<a name=308:6></a>

		I believe, as it has often been said, that the first movement that we should look for will take place at the right hand of God.<a name=308:7></a> Our eyes and hearts must be there.<a name=308:8></a> The great subject of our prayers should be that God will give increasing power with His word so that the elect may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory, and that saints may more and more find their portion outside this world, as being linked up in mind and affection with the Coming One, and be fully set for His interests here.<a name=308:9></a> We do not look for events, but for a Person, and the more simply we have this in view the better will it be for our souls and for our testimony.<a name=308:10></a> With much love in the Lord,

		As to the action of the Holy Spirit in human systems, there are no doubt pious and God-fearing persons in those systems, who may serve individually in the power of the Spirit in preaching or teaching according to the measure of their light or gift.<a name=315:3></a> When such believers serve they may be blessed in conversions, or in helping those who are the Lord's.<a name=315:4></a> But there is no Scripture for choosing a pastor.<a name=315:5></a> They have devised this out of their own hearts, or it is part of the system which they have adopted.<a name=315:6></a> It is really confusion and disorder from a scriptural point of view.<a name=315:7></a> But we must bear in mind that in the very mixed condition which prevails in the religious sphere God respects those who act with a good conscience, according to the measure of light which they have.<a name=315:8></a> And if a company of pious believers pray that they may get a minister who will preach the truth and help them spiritually, it is very possible that God will hear and answer their prayers.<a name=315:9></a> Alas!<a name=315:10></a> I am afraid that practically such exercises and prayers tend to diminish greatly, and the spiritual quality of the preaching declines very much.<a name=315:11></a> This, to a large extent, results from the unscriptural practice of congregations choosing their pastors.<a name=315:12></a> In such cases the majority decide, and the majority is rarely composed of the most spiritual elements.<a name=315:13></a> The Spirit acts in His sovereignty by whomsoever He will, but He is greatly hindered, and often positively quenched in human systems.<a name=315:14></a> It is for us to show them from Scripture, and in actual practice, a more excellent way.<a name=315:15></a>

		The paragraph on pages 48 and 49 of the "Outline of Revelation" simply calls attention to certain statements of Scripture
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=317>[Page 317]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with reference to the book of life.<a name=317:1></a> We may be quite sure that all that Scripture says is true and very profitable for us, and if there is anything we do not understand we can pray about it, and also get help from others.<a name=317:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first time the book of life is mentioned in Scripture, indeed, the only time in the Old Testament (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:32">Exodus  32:32</a>, 33 refers to it simply as God's book) is in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:28">Psalm  69:28</a>, which speaks prophetically of those who hated Christ without a cause, and who would destroy Him, being His enemies wrongfully (verse 4), and who persecuted Him (verse 26).<a name=317:3></a> It is said of them, "Let them be blotted out of the book of life".<a name=317:4></a> To understand this we must remember that the Jews and their leaders were in a place of great privilege as having the oracles of God, the promises, the service of God, and even having Christ amongst them.<a name=317:5></a> They were in the book of life as having great divine privilege, in contrast with the dark heathen world; Christ owned them as "his own", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:11">John  1:11</a>.<a name=317:6></a> But by their wicked rejection of Christ they forfeited all right to the privilege which God had conferred upon them, and they were blotted out of the book of life.<a name=317:7></a> Many today are in a place of light and privilege, but if they neglect the great salvation, and perhaps even persecute Christ in His people, it will come true, if they do not repent, that they will be blotted out.<a name=317:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first mention of the book of life in the New Testament is in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:3">Philippians  4:3</a>, where we read of certain fellow-labourers of Paul -- "whose names are in the book of life".<a name=317:9></a> They were not at all the kind of persons to be blotted out.<a name=317:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:5">Revelation  3:5</a> the promise, "I will not blot his name out of the book of life", is given to the overcomer in Sardis.<a name=317:11></a> If we watch, and do not defile our garments, there is no fear of our names being blotted out.<a name=317:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be noticed that the above scriptures have a certain reference to our place as in responsibility here.<a name=317:13></a> They raise the question as to whether we are really in the list of the living, or have we merely, like those in Sardis, a name to live?<a name=317:14></a> But the simplest believer who knows the Saviour's love, and who knows that his sins have been washed away by the blood of Christ, is entitled to know that he is one of Christ's sheep and that he will never perish.<a name=317:15></a> But he also knows that he cannot keep himself, and that his security lies in keeping near the Shepherd; he does not, and dare not, trust himself.<a name=317:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=318>[Page 318]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the closing chapters of the Bible the book of life is spoken of in a different way.<a name=318:1></a> It is called "the book of life of the slain Lamb", and we learn that the names written in it were written "from the founding of the world", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13:8">Revelation  13:8</a>; 17: 8.<a name=318:2></a> The book of life in these scriptures has clearly to do with God's purpose as made sure on the ground of redemption.<a name=318:3></a> Nothing in that connection depends on man's responsibility.<a name=318:4></a> It is purely of God's sovereign love and mercy that names are written in the book of life of the slain Lamb.<a name=318:5></a> There can be no thought of blotting out in that connection.<a name=318:6></a> Those written in that book are God's elect, and will be surely kept by His power through faith.<a name=318:7></a> None of the names written in that book will ever be blotted out.<a name=318:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we take Scripture simply as it stands we shall not get into any difficulty.<a name=318:9></a> We shall see that the book of life is sometimes viewed as containing the names of those who have a place of privilege and responsibility in relation to God, such as Israel had in Old Testament times, and such as the Lord's bondmen have now.<a name=318:10></a> This may be illustrated by the fact that the name of Judas is on the list of the twelve apostles, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:2">Matthew  10:2</a> - 4.<a name=318:11></a> He was numbered amongst the apostles, but he was never converted or saved, and by transgression he fell, and his name was blotted out.<a name=318:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust these few words may serve to clear up any difficulty.<a name=318:13></a> With love in the Lord,.<a name=318:14></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- It seems to me that what it is to speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit may be gathered from <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:30">Mark  3:30</a>, "Because they said, He has an unclean spirit".<a name=324:1></a> See also <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:22">Matthew  12:22</a> - 32.<a name=324:2></a>

		There was every evidence that the power of divine goodness was operating in Jesus, and that men were being delivered from the power of evil and its consequences.<a name=324:3></a> There could be no question that God was with Jesus in infinite goodness, and that He was spoiling Satan's house after having first bound him.<a name=324:4></a> But the Pharisees, knowing this, for it was plainly before their eyes, said out of the pure wickedness of their hearts that Jesus cast out demons by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.<a name=324:5></a> They knew that divine goodness was there, operating to deliver men from Satan's power, but they said it was Beelzebub.<a name=324:6></a> It was a question of <i>the character</i> of the power that was operating; was it "an unclean spirit" or was it the <i>Holy</i> Spirit?<a name=324:7></a> They knew better, but their wicked hearts attributed what was of the <i>Holy</i> Spirit to Satan.<a name=324:8></a> It was charging the Holy Spirit with evil, and for this sin there was no forgiveness.<a name=324:9></a> Resisting the Holy Spirit is not quite the same as charging Him with evil.<a name=324:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Man as fallen has the knowledge of good and evil, though it is only those who are the subjects of a divine work who have their senses exercised for distinguishing the two in a spiritual way.<a name=324:11></a> But man does know the difference between good and evil.<a name=324:12></a> Man knows that evil is of Satan and good is of God, and if he says that good is of Satan it shows him to be morally perverse in his will.<a name=324:13></a> It is not that his judgment is at fault, but his will; he hates the good.<a name=324:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit was the power by which all the works of Jesus were wrought, and they were wrought amongst a people who had not only the knowledge of good and evil but had also the Scriptures of the Old Testament.<a name=324:15></a> They had every means of knowing what was of God and what was of Satan.<a name=324:16></a> But notwithstanding all this, when the works of the Holy Spirit were before them in the miracles of Jesus, they said those works were wrought by the power of Beelzebub.<a name=324:17></a> For this there was no forgiveness; it made manifest that they were of their father the devil.<a name=324:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one born anew could possibly be guilty of this sin, though Satan often harasses poor souls by leading them to fear that they have.<a name=325:5></a> But it is clear enough that if people are afraid of the very thought of such a thing they are certainly not guilty of it.<a name=325:6></a> Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is not merely a wicked thought which Satan may put in the mind, but a thought expressed in words and maintained as a definite judgment.<a name=325:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Upon careful consideration of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:5">Matthew  8:5</a> - 13 and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:1">Luke  7:1</a> - 10 I think it will be seen that there is no discrepancy between the accounts given.<a name=327:8></a> Luke adds to the account given by Matthew the interesting circumstance that the centurion sent twice to the Lord before he came himself.<a name=327:9></a> Luke, writing to a Gentile, relates circumstances which bring out in a striking way the conscious unworthiness with which a Gentile officer approached the Lord, yet, withal, his implicit confidence in the divinely conferred authority of the One to whom he appealed.<a name=327:10></a> Luke, by inspiration of the Spirit, records facts which Matthew did not, but they do not conflict in any way with what Matthew writes.<a name=327:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew tells us that two possessed men met the Lord; Mark and Luke only mention one.<a name=327:12></a> You say that the two latter tell us there was only one.<a name=327:13></a> If they had said so there would have been a serious discrepancy, but if you look at the passages you will see that they made no such statement.<a name=327:14></a> It must be borne in mind that the gospels are an inspired selection from an immense amount of material (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:25">John  21:25</a>).<a name=327:15></a> And each evangelist selects by inspiration of the Spirit just those details which were needed to fill out his presentation of Christ.<a name=327:16></a> The wisdom of God enters into every detail of the presentation.<a name=327:17></a> It is allowable, and most profitable, for us to enquire <i>why</i> the Spirit of God has left out this detail or that in one gospel and inserted them in another.<a name=327:18></a> But this is a test, not of the accuracy of Scripture, but of our spiritual discernment of the character of each gospel.<a name=327:19></a> To attempt to bring the accounts into harmony in a way of human accuracy is simply to break down the beautiful carved work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=327:20></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- I know of nothing in principle to hinder the hiring of a hall for a few gospel preachings by brothers spiritually gifted for such service, and in whom brethren generally have confidence, if the rooms used habitually are not conveniently placed to serve the object in view.<a name=329:9></a> A service of this kind is, of course, the personal responsibility of the brother or brothers who take up the service as having faith for it.<a name=329:10></a> But as privileged to walk together in the fellowship, and carrying the interests of the Lord and His service in unity with our brethren, we should not care to move in a matter of this kind without being assured of their confidence and their co-operation.<a name=329:11></a> And it would be our jealous care that nothing should have place in the service that fell below the level of the true character of the glad tidings as we have learned it through God's infinite favour.<a name=329:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our brother having moved with the light which the Lord has given him may now count upon special grace coming in for him with reference to his children.<a name=330:14></a> I trust the Lord will support, even in their hearts, what is in accord with His own mind.<a name=330:15></a> It may be that the subject being brought before them may prove to be a great blessing as leading them to think seriously of how they stand in relation to the Lord.<a name=330:16></a> How happy it would be if they were brought to know and confess Him!<a name=330:17></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- The Lord's supper is ever a matter of deepest interest to those who love Him.<a name=331:1></a> I desire more and more that it may be to me what it was in His mind when He instituted it.<a name=331:2></a> There is not, so far as I see, in the institution, nor in the emblems employed, nor in Paul's references to it, any allusion to the Lord as risen or ascended.<a name=331:3></a> His body and blood, His death, are emphasised.<a name=331:4></a> No doubt this led Mr.<a name=331:5></a> Darby to stress that it was "a dead Christ" who was recalled in the Supper.<a name=331:6></a> Though we do not recall His death merely as a fact; we recall the Person who died; it is "for the calling Me to mind".<a name=331:7></a> He would be remembered in the way that would most deeply affect the hearts of those who love Him.<a name=331:8></a> But the fellowship is of His blood and of His body, and in eating and drinking we announce the Lord's death, and those who do so unworthily are guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord.<a name=331:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remembrance of Him as having been in death for us liberates and unifies us, and brings about that He is the one Object before all our hearts.<a name=331:10></a> If that were truly so He would not leave us orphans; He would come to us.<a name=331:11></a> And it is evident that if He comes to us the thought of remembrance or memorial gives place to His realised presence.<a name=331:12></a> Hence, as we have been learning for many years, the Lord's supper has its place at the beginning of the assembly service.<a name=331:13></a> If He presents Himself to us as living we are clearly not remembering Him; we have entered a new and further phase of the service.<a name=331:14></a> And so with association with Him before His Father and God.<a name=331:15></a> The Person whom we call to mind is living, but is not the whole point of the institution that He should be remembered as having been in death for the saints of the assembly?<a name=331:16></a> That was His point of contact with us, and of ours with Him.<a name=331:17></a> And while here in the place where He died we are in the fellowship of His body and His blood, and give expression to it in eating the bread and drinking the cup together.<a name=331:18></a> And our understanding of this, and affectionate identification with Him in it, is preparatory to our realising what it is to live with Him as out of death.<a name=331:19></a> The steps in assembly service must be taken in their due order; if we are weak in what the Supper presents we shall be weak in all that follows.<a name=331:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord did not institute His Supper as risen or as in heaven.<a name=331:21></a> In the institution He viewed His death anticipatively as already accomplished and set before them in emblems
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=332>[Page 332]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which He selected for the purpose -- emblems which would never suffer them to forget, as assembled, His body and His blood.<a name=332:1></a> These things were the voice of His love as expressed <i>here</i>, never to be heard again in the same way, but perpetuated as the rallying point of the assembly until He come.<a name=332:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that when our apostle refers to this he does not touch on association with Christ in spiritual privilege (I suppose the Corinthians were not at all ready for this).<a name=332:3></a> He dwells on the fellowship and the remembrance in their intensely moral and practical bearing.<a name=332:4></a> If we participate in the fellowship of the Lord's body and blood it must condemn every unholy association here.<a name=332:5></a> If we announce the death of the Lord the very way in which we eat and drink must be in moral keeping with that death.<a name=332:6></a> In principle this would reach out to every detail in our responsible life.<a name=332:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must bear in mind that the Lord's supper is the first thing in the assembly service, though we must admit that we came very slowly to the apprehension of this.<a name=332:8></a> It is what the assembly takes up as in the wilderness position.<a name=332:9></a> As we take up affectionately the remembrance or memorial side, with its far-reaching moral effect, we get liberty for spiritual privilege.<a name=332:10></a> And I think it must be borne in mind that the Lord, in putting His Supper first in the assembly service was thinking of all His own; He would have babes and fathers to start together all unified in calling Him to mind, and first of all in relation to His body and His blood.<a name=332:11></a> There would probably be more liberty if we did not attempt to bring into the service of the Supper what really has its place after the Supper.<a name=332:12></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- I gladly send a line in reply to your enquiry, though in relation to the great and holy matters to which you refer I feel much more inclined to take the place of a learner than a teacher.<a name=333:21></a> But what we have is to be available for others, whatever may be its measure, and in communicating we often get adjustment and enlargement.<a name=333:22></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=338:4></a>.<a name=338:5></a>.<a name=338:6></a> So far as I can see Scripture speaks of the book of life in two different connections.<a name=338:7></a> Certain passages (as <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13:8">Revelation  13:8</a>; 20: 12, 15) speak of it as containing the names of persons marked out by God's election and purpose for eternal blessedness.<a name=338:8></a> We know that there is a registry in heaven of the assembly of the firstborn ones (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>), and that the Lord told His disciples to rejoice because their names were written in the heavens (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:20">Luke  10:20</a>).<a name=338:9></a> Names will never be blotted out that are written there.<a name=338:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is evident that when Paul speaks of certain persons as having their names written in the book of life (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:3">Philippians  4:3</a>) he has some reference to the character of the persons.<a name=338:11></a> And it was in the way of commendation and reward that the Lord said of the overcomer in Sardis that He would not blot his name out of the book of life (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:5">Revelation  3:5</a>).<a name=338:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me to be important to distinguish these two aspects of the book of life, and to give each its due place.<a name=338:13></a> I must not weaken the thought of divine sovereignty in connection with that book, neither must I weaken the thought of moral suitability.<a name=338:14></a> I once had contact with a man who boasted loudly that his name was in the book of life, but he was a notoriously bad man, and therefore nobody believed what he said.<a name=338:15></a>

		In a coming day "he who remaineth in Zion, and he that is left in Jerusalem, shall be called holy -- every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#4:3">Isaiah  4:3</a>.<a name=338:16></a> In that divine census roll everyone gets his place according to the moral conditions which characterise him.<a name=338:17></a> And when we read in the New Testament that certain persons' names are in the book of life we may be sure that their character and service were such as to entitle them to be there.<a name=338:18></a> By the grace and work of God those persons were really living in relation to Him.<a name=338:19></a> The assembly in Sardis could not be said to have this

		character, for the Lord said to it, "Thou halt a name that thou livest, and art dead", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:1">Revelation  3:1</a>.<a name=339:1></a> This gives peculiar force to the Lord's word to the overcomer that He would not blot his name out of the book of life.<a name=339:2></a> The very fact that he was an overcomer showed that the energy of life was in him.<a name=339:3></a> When Paul told the Philippians that the names of certain persons among them were in the book of life, I think he meant them to consider the moral force of the statement that they might get an impression of the kind of persons who were suitable to be enrolled in the book of life.<a name=339:4></a> I think their moral suitability was before him rather than their place by sovereignty.<a name=339:5></a> Both, of course, being true.<a name=339:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To be blotted out of the book of life is one of the most solemn things of which Scripture speaks.<a name=339:7></a> I believe it always has reference to the judgment of apostasy, as set forth in a terrible way in Judas.<a name=339:8></a> The Christian profession will be spued out of Christ's mouth as nauseous to Him.<a name=339:9></a> Christendom is drifting rapidly in the direction of giving up everything that can be regarded as life.<a name=339:10></a> The deadness of Sardis is preparing the way for this, but while this looms in the near future faithful overcomers are encouraged by the Lord's words, "I will not blot his name out of the book of life".<a name=339:11></a> Overcomers will be kept, amidst surrounding death, in the features and qualities which entitled them to a place in the book of life.<a name=339:12></a> They will be held in life by the gracious power of the Lord.<a name=339:13></a>

		In your letter you quote two sentences from page 48 of the "Outline of Revelation".<a name=339:14></a> But you omit the sentence which comes between which states that the working out of divine purpose must be through suitable moral conditions, which really puts the whole matter in its proper setting.<a name=339:15></a> We believe that the saints will be raised in glory according to divine purpose, but we are definitely told by the Lord that it is those who have practised good who will go forth to resurrection of life, <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:29">John  5:29</a>.<a name=339:16></a> The moral conditions which are suitable to God have been secured in them.<a name=339:17></a> In like manner we do not think of anyone having his name in the book of life now without being characterised by the moral conditions of life.<a name=339:18></a>

		DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD, -- .<a name=340:1></a>.<a name=340:2></a>.<a name=340:3></a> The scriptures to which you refer with regard to the Lord's coming have been very fully considered by the brethren for many years past, and much light has been afforded by the Lord on all parts of the subject.<a name=340:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must first ask, Has the Lord given any special revelation to the saints of the assembly as to how His coming will affect them?<a name=340:5></a> The answer is that He has done so by a special revelation to His servant the apostle Paul (see <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:13">1 Thessalonians  4:13</a> - 18).<a name=340:6></a> Let nothing move you away from this; it is "the word of the Lord" to you and to all those who are of the assembly.<a name=340:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you must admit that there is not one word in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>about saints being caught up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=340:8></a> There is no hint of such a thing, and this clearly proves that in uttering the words recorded in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>the Lord had a different company of saints in view from those addressed in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>.<a name=340:9></a> This is confirmed by Judea being specially mentioned in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>as the scene of trial.<a name=340:10></a> The assembly, as I am sure you know, is mainly being called out of the Gentile world.<a name=340:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, upon consideration, you will conclude that it is not at all likely that the Lord would suggest to saints of the assembly that they should pray that their flight should not be on the sabbath.<a name=340:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such warnings as are found in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:23">Matthew  24:23</a> - 26 would not be needed by saints who are expecting, in the light of <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>, to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.<a name=340:13></a> They will be of great value to saints who will be waiting on earth for the appearing of Christ after the saints of the assembly have been caught up.<a name=340:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The confusion in people's minds as to these things nearly all arises from the fact that the distinctive place of the assembly as belonging to heaven, and having its place there, is not understood.<a name=340:15></a> Spiritually, and by the work of God, we are already there (see <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>) and the rapture will put us there actually.<a name=340:16></a> Then the ways of God in relation to prophecy, and the place of Israel in earthly blessing, will begin to unfold.<a name=340:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible to deny that the disciples when the Lord was here were a Jewish remnant.<a name=340:18></a> They became, as we know, the nucleus of the assembly.<a name=340:19></a> But after the assembly is translated there will again be a Jewish remnant who will need the instruction and warnings which the Lord gave in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24">Matthew  24</a>.<a name=340:20></a>

		BELOVED BROTHER, -- God is entitled, on the ground of propitiation, to present His grace to all men in Christ, and all who hear the gospel have the opportunity to receive it.<a name=341:3></a> If they do not receive it it shows that they love darkness rather than light.<a name=341:4></a> The responsibility rests on them.<a name=341:5></a> As Paul said at Antioch, "Since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>.<a name=341:6></a>

		But it is well to bear in mind that if God did not work by effecting new birth not one person would believe the gospel or be saved.<a name=341:7></a> It is of God's mercy that any are made willing to repent and believe the glad tidings; every believer knows it was so in his own case.<a name=341:8></a> Therefore it is always true that "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:44">John  6:44</a>.<a name=341:9></a> God's sovereign mercy is the only hope of lost man.<a name=341:10></a>

		I am sure that you have great comfort in knowing how faithfully he was set to follow and serve the Lord, though in one way this adds to the sorrow of his departure at a comparatively early age.<a name=342:10></a> But it is a very real cause for thanksgiving that he had come to so much spiritual maturity, so as to be a help to others, and one whose example will continue to bear fruit in those who were privileged to come in contact with him.<a name=342:11></a> We can never say of any servant of the Lord that his work is finished, because it goes on, like Abel's, long after he has personally left the scene of service, and it will go on in a most blessed way in the glorious future when "his servants shall serve him".<a name=342:12></a>

		The Lord has said, "Blessed they that mourn, for <i>they</i> shall be comforted", and I am sure He will fulfil His word for each one of those who sorrow over your dear son's departure.<a name=342:13></a> All that He does is in the wisdom of perfect love.<a name=342:14></a> He perfects His work early in some, while some of us who did not expect a long life have to be retained until old age that we may learn what His love would teach us.<a name=342:15></a>

		It is very sweet to experience the activity of love, and it is specially touching when manifested by those to whom one is unknown by face.<a name=344:2></a> For it is then truly "love in the Spirit", as flowing entirely from the link which the grace of God has brought about in the affections of His beloved saints leading them to identify themselves with the work of the Lord in every part of the field of service.<a name=344:3></a> I am sure the Lord sets great value on this, and it strengthens the hands of those who serve, even though the measure of service -- as in my case -- may be very limited.<a name=344:4></a>

		MY DEAR BROTHER, -- .<a name=360:1></a>.<a name=360:2></a>.<a name=360:3></a> It is evident that in each passage where the Lord speaks of speaking injuriously of the Spirit His solemn statements on this subject were called forth by the Pharisees saying that He cast out demons by Beelzebub.<a name=360:4></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:10">Luke  12:10</a> refers to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:15">Luke  11:15</a>.<a name=360:5></a> The Lord's words must be accepted as meaning just what they say; viz.<a name=360:6></a> that this particular sin is not forgiven, neither in this age nor the coming one.<a name=360:7></a>

		Paul speaks further of the saints as being called by God into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>, and that their fellowship is set forth in the cup which we bless and the bread which we break, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>, 17.<a name=363:6></a> He assumes that all believers bless the cup and break the bread, for he says "we".<a name=363:7></a> It is evident that there cannot be two divine fellowships.<a name=363:8></a>

		The apostle, or the Spirit of God by him, gives no hint that the assembly, in a universal sense, was an invisible body.<a name=363:9></a> He regards it as one body on earth, gifts being bestowed with a view to its edifying, that it may work for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=363:10></a> The saints are called in one body to let the peace of Christ preside in their hearts.<a name=363:11></a> There is no thought of an invisible body.<a name=363:12></a>

		1 Corinthians gives us the truth as it is to characterise each local assembly, for it is addressed not only to Corinth, but to "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=363:13></a> The saints universally are set in the light of that epistle, which makes known that all saints are baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body, chapter 12: 12, 13.<a name=363:14></a> "The Christ" is clearly a corporate designation of the saints as one body, which could not be limited to one locality.<a name=363:15></a> The saints at Corinth were "Christ's body and members in particular", but only in virtue of having part in the universal unity of chapter 12: 12, 13.<a name=363:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In that epistle we see that assembly administration is to be carried on locally.<a name=363:17></a> The saints at Corinth were directly responsible to the Lord to exercise discipline upon an evil-doer in their midst.<a name=363:18></a> Such an act was to be done in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>it would be bound in heaven.<a name=363:19></a> If, after the Corinthian assembly had acted thus in discipline by the Lord's commandment, the assembly at Cenchrea had said that the act did not bind them,

		the latter assembly would have been marked by pure lawlessness.<a name=364:1></a> It was binding, if for no other reason, on the ground that there is "one Lord" who had entrusted responsibility to act for Him in such matters to the local assembly, and whose Name was connected with their action.<a name=364:2></a> In apostolic times "the power of our Lord Jesus Christ" was formally associated with His Name when the assembly dealt with evil, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:4">1 Corinthians  5:4</a>.<a name=364:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to pass from the days of the apostles to our own, we find that, in the revival of the truth over a century ago, what was prominent in the minds of the spiritual was the truth of the assembly.<a name=364:4></a> We have been told that the light broke into the soul of Mr.<a name=364:5></a> J.<a name=364:6></a> N.<a name=364:7></a> Darby that there was a Head in heaven.<a name=364:8></a> Then, said he to himself, there must be a body on earth.<a name=364:9></a> If we read his early writings, such as "The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ", written in 1828, we find that it is the assembly which is before him, and its moral and spiritual features.<a name=364:10></a> The coming together of saints was to be in the light of those features which pertain to the assembly universally.<a name=364:11></a> The revival was definitely on the line of Paul's glad tidings, and of Paul's ministry of the assembly.<a name=364:12></a> The brethren who were spiritually instructed had no such thought as that it was the divine intent that the assembly in its universal aspect should be, or should become, invisible.<a name=364:13></a> On the contrary, they felt deeply the fact that it had become so; that "the true church of God had no avowed communion at all" was a grievous evil to be mourned over and confessed.<a name=364:14></a> They felt that the body is here as a substantive reality to be edified, and to increase with the increase of God.<a name=364:15></a> Christ is sanctifying and purifying the assembly, and nourishing and cherishing it.<a name=364:16></a> This is not in heaven, but down here on earth.<a name=364:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But alongside this revival of Paul's doctrine there was developing amongst the brethren an entirely different system of teaching.<a name=364:18></a> There were those who held that the assembly in its universal aspect had become invisible, and that nothing now remained but to set up local assemblies, each being a self-contained body, having no responsibility with reference to other such bodies, and free to receive any individual believer supposed to be personally sound in the faith and consistent in life, without taking any account of the associations in which he may have been previously.<a name=364:19></a> The truth of <i>the</i> assembly in its general unity, calling for recognition in a practical way by
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=365>[Page 365]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		those who have the light of it, thus entirely lost its due place.<a name=365:1></a> According to this system of teaching, each separate meeting is an independent "assembly", even if there are several in one town.<a name=365:2></a> Scripture never speaks of different assemblies in one city.<a name=365:3></a> At Jerusalem, where there were thousands of believers, and where they no doubt met in many different places, it is always "the assembly" -- in the singular.<a name=365:4></a> The idea of independent churches, without any recognition of a universal bond of <i>responsible</i> partnership, is quite foreign to Scripture.<a name=365:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were thus two different conceptions in the minds of brethren.<a name=365:6></a> One was governed by the thought of the unity of the whole assembly as one body, one house, one temple, and by the thought of all the saints everywhere being called to one universal fellowship.<a name=365:7></a> The other was based on the idea of each meeting being an independent "assembly".<a name=365:8></a> The moment was bound to come when these two different principles would be found to be entirely out of keeping with each other.<a name=365:9></a> It was not long before circumstances arose which brought this to light, But it is important to recognise that what happened at Plymouth did not bring about the difference of principles.<a name=365:10></a> It only served to expose what was there before.<a name=365:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=365:12></a> Darby and others separated from the original meeting at Plymouth in 1845 because clericalism was set up there, which they rightly judged was not of God.<a name=365:13></a> But the Lord in His wisdom did not allow this particular matter to become the general test.<a name=365:14></a> In 1847 it was discovered that Mr.<a name=365:15></a> Newton held and taught most serious error as to the Lord's personal relationships.<a name=365:16></a> This false teaching definitely raised the question as to whether <i>fellowship</i> involved a <i>responsible</i> partnership or not.<a name=365:17></a> The extreme gravity of false teaching as to the Lord's relationships ought to have helped the brethren to be very sensitive in their affections, as well as in conscience and intelligence.<a name=365:18></a> They ought all to have weighed well that fellowship (or partnership) with such error was most serious in the sight of God.<a name=365:19></a> The ground was taken eventually at Bethesda that the error was condemned, but that fellowship with it by breaking bread with those who held it was no bar to communion, and that no individual believer was to be held responsible for what he might be walking in partnership with, unless he actually avowed the error himself.<a name=365:20></a>

		The fact that defilement is contracted by touching what is unclean is clearly laid down in the Old Testament, and the New Testament expressly says, "touch not what is unclean", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>.<a name=366:4></a> It is also clear in Scripture that a much less thing than breaking bread with a person may involve one in responsibility for what he does, for John says that the one who gives a friendly greeting to a man who does not bring the doctrine of Christ "partakes (the verbal form of the word fellowship) in his wicked works", <a href="../bible/2John.htm#11">2 John  11</a>.<a name=366:5></a> One is viewed as in fellowship with his wicked works if simply greeting him.<a name=366:6></a> This shows what a very small thing, as men would say, involves responsibility as before God for one's associations.<a name=366:7></a> If to break bread with an evil-doer does not, in the minds of believers, involve any complicity in his evil, neither does breaking bread with faithful saints involve the recognition that we are in the most intimate partnership with them.<a name=366:8></a> The sense of the divine bond is lost; persons break bread as so many individuals without any sense of responsible partnership.<a name=366:9></a> So that, according to these principles, the local assembly takes independent ground in declining to be bound by any assembly action other than its own, and the individual is held free of any responsibility, even in his own assembly, for anything that may have taken place there save his own views and his own conduct.<a name=366:10></a> This principle annuls responsibility in regard of associations, which Scripture so carefully maintains; it entirely sets aside the true thought of fellowship.<a name=366:11></a>

After reading your letter this morning, I opened my Bible on these words: "There was a man sent <i>from God</i> whose name was John.<a name=376:15></a> The same came for a <i>witness</i> to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:6">John  1:6</a>.<a name=376:16></a> This set me thinking of some of the marks of a true servant, as we see them in John -- marks, which I trust, may be more I and more imprinted on our lives and service.<a name=376:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, <i>he comes from God</i>.<a name=376:18></a> In order to do this, we must first be <i>with</i> God.<a name=376:19></a> Alas!<a name=376:20></a> This is the weak point with so many.<a name=376:21></a> The excitement of <i>service</i> has an attraction for the natural tastes which the holy calm of the <i>sanctuary</i> does not possess.<a name=376:22></a> In one way service makes something of us, but in the presence of God we find that we are nothing.<a name=376:23></a> Men are needed who are really <i>with God</i>.<a name=376:24></a> There is no real freshness
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=377>[Page 377]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or power if we are not with God.<a name=377:1></a> Our hearts lose their divine sensibilities, we drop down to the level of things around us, and service becomes more or less formal.<a name=377:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The most glorious and soul-stirring realities are soon held as mere doctrines, and of course are preached as they are held.<a name=377:3></a> Then very soon the servant begins to feel a complacent self-satisfaction as to his service, which is not disturbed even by the lack of any manifest blessing, and this is the mark, I think, of an awfully back-slidden state.<a name=377:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, if we are <i>with God</i>, we are in spiritual reality as to our own experience.<a name=377:5></a> We do not deceive ourselves as to the measure of our progress, gift or faith.<a name=377:6></a> We think "soberly as we ought to think".<a name=377:7></a> Then it is <i>with God</i> that we learn His <i>love</i>, His unmeasured <i>grace</i>, His glorious <i>purposes</i>, His great thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly, the reality of the Spirit's power, and many other things which are accepted in theory by many but known as realities by few.<a name=377:8></a> Then, having been <i>with God</i> in the secret of His presence, we can come <i>from God</i> in the power of what we have learnt within, to serve in a world like this.<a name=377:9></a> We do not then measure the enemy's power against our own weakness, but against God.<a name=377:10></a> We do not put on the armour which others have worn, or follow in the beaten track where other servants have trod.<a name=377:11></a> We do not confer with flesh and blood as to the scope or character of our service.<a name=377:12></a> There is an <i>originality</i> about every servant who comes from God.<a name=377:13></a> God does not fashion two servants in the same mould -- that is man's work -- and just in proportion as we are formed in the sanctuary, each will have his own peculiar fitness for his own service, and such stamp will be upon it that faith will recognise that it comes <i>from God</i>.<a name=377:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second mark of a true servant is that he is <i>consciously nothing</i>.<a name=377:15></a> John could speak of himself as only a "voice", and a greater than John was consciously "less than the least of all saints".<a name=377:16></a> The moment we think ourselves to be anything, we are out of the servant's true position and spirit.<a name=377:17></a> There is a beautiful contrast between John's account of himself, and the Lord's description of him (compare <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:22">John  1:22</a> - 27, with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:26">Luke  7:26</a> - 28).<a name=377:18></a> The more worthy we are of the Lord's commendation, the less do we think of ourselves.<a name=377:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third mark of a true servant is that he is a "<i>witness</i>".<a name=377:20></a> He speaks of that which he has seen and known for himself.<a name=377:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=378>[Page 378]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was said to Paul that he was to be "a witness of these things which <i>thou hast seen</i>, and of those things in the which <i>I will appear unto thee</i>".<a name=378:1></a> We may <i>minister</i> things which we have never entered into ourselves, but we cannot be <i>witnesses</i> of them.<a name=378:2></a> Hence the deep importance of cultivating communion with God, and increased intimacy with Christ.<a name=378:3></a> Instead of this weakening our gospel testimony, I believe it would make it fuller, richer, and more simple.<a name=378:4></a> We would be in touch with the grace that can stoop to the lowest point to win a sinner's heart.<a name=378:5></a> Our preaching often lacks weight because we have so little realised the things of which we speak.<a name=378:6></a> Whether it be the terror of the Lord, the love of God, the value of Christ's work, or the blessings which faith enjoys, we must ourselves have entered into that which we press upon others or we become <i>lecturers</i> rather than <i>witnesses</i>.<a name=378:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another mark of the true servant is <i>self-forgetful devotedness to Christ</i>.<a name=378:8></a> John was ready to <i>decrease</i> if so be that Christ might <i>increase</i>.<a name=378:9></a> He was willing to be displaced, to pass into the shade, to be forsaken even by his own disciples.<a name=378:10></a> The effect of his witnessing was the proof of its divine reality -- men left John and followed Jesus.<a name=378:11></a> This gave him real joy (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:29">John  3:29</a>), for morally he had <i>left himself</i> and found his Object in that blessed Lamb of God.<a name=378:12></a> The result of his testimony was to accomplish in others what had first been effected in himself, and this is the end of true service.<a name=378:13></a> We may, through grace, bring others to where we are ourselves, we cannot lift them above our own level.<a name=378:14></a> How deeply important it is, then, that we should be vigilant, prayerful, sober, and that we should habitually walk in the Spirit!<a name=378:15></a> Christ will then be the Object and Motive of our whole life and service, and it may be ours to say, in some feeble sense of the greatness and blessedness of it, "To me to live is Christ".<a name=378:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the reality of these different characteristics is sure to be tested.<a name=378:17></a> Satan will not miss an opportunity of sifting the servant of Christ, and on the other hand, God allows the sifting in order to humble us by the discovery that we are not so spiritual or so devoted as we thought we were; while, in result, the reality of what grace has wrought in us comes out more plainly than ever.<a name=378:18></a> The servant must not always expect to be in one set of circumstances.<a name=378:19></a> The Baptist was, for a time, the most popular man of the day.<a name=378:20></a> Tens of thousands attended his ministry, and honoured him as a prophet of God.<a name=378:21></a>

		For a time he was unopposed by the religious leaders and even heard by the king with respect and attention.<a name=379:1></a> He was the lion of the hour -- the dictator of morals to every rank in the nation.<a name=379:2></a> How many servants have been lifted up with pride in circumstances similar to this in kind, if not in degree?<a name=379:3></a> A crowded audience, the approbation of the world, or of the brethren, the esteem rightly due, and cheerfully rendered to a servant honoured of God, and even success in spiritual labours, will act upon these wretched hearts of ours, and lift us up with a carnal elation, if we are not, through grace, in the continual exercise of self-judgment.<a name=379:4></a> If John's eye had not been steadily fixed on the glorious Person of whom he was the herald, he might soon have thought himself worthy of some higher station than that of the slave who stoops to loose his master's sandal, but with the divine glory of that One before him, he would not assume to be worthy to render Him even the meanest service.<a name=379:5></a> But John was to be tested, like most other servants, in a different way from that of which I have spoken.<a name=379:6></a> He must know the north-wind of adversity, as well as the south-wind of prosperity.<a name=379:7></a> He must be transferred from the great congregation of the wilderness, to the solitude and apparent uselessness of the prison, and that, too, at a time when it must have seemed more than ever necessary for all true servants to be spreading with divine energy the gospel of the coming kingdom.<a name=379:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fancy him like a caged lion, immured in a lonely castle on the dismal shore of the Dead Sea, and hearing there the glorious things that were being spoken of "throughout all Judea, and throughout all the region round about", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>, 18.<a name=379:9></a> Can you wonder that when such reports were brought to his ears, his spirit chafed at the confinement which hindered him from having a share in all this?<a name=379:10></a> In the day of his prosperity he had said, in effect, that he was <i>nothing</i>, but now he was made to enter into it in an experimental way.<a name=379:11></a> The kingdom was being preached <i>without him</i>: marvellous things were being done in which he had personally no share: God's work was going on <i>without John</i>.<a name=379:12></a> Let every servant who knows his own heart describe the feelings that are natural to us in such an hour!<a name=379:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe every servant of Christ has to pass through this experience sooner or later.<a name=379:14></a> He may have it in a modified form all his life through, or he may pass through it in special

		seasons of deep exercise, or he may learn it on his death-bed, but he <i>must</i> learn that he is <i>nothing but the servant of God's purposes</i> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:5">1 Corinthians  3:5</a> - 7), and that God can dispense with him at any moment and transfer the service to some different vessel of grace.<a name=380:1></a> I am aware that we all accept this in theory, but it is another thing to learn it in one's own experience with God.<a name=380:2></a> It was when learning this that John was "offended" in the One whose shoe latchet he had professed himself unworthy to bear or unloose.<a name=380:3></a> The question which his disciples carried to Jesus (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:19">Luke  7:19</a>) was a scarcely veiled censure of the Master, for allowing the servant to be detained in circumstances which made <i>nothing</i> of him.<a name=380:4></a> It has often been remarked that a saint fails in the very thing by which he is most characterised, and this was the case with John.<a name=380:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is often in the hour when the servant is brought low in his own eyes, and, it may be, in the eyes of others also, that the pride of his heart discovers itself; and it is well, if in such an hour he bows in submission and does not "kick against the pricks" of the Lord's sovereignty.<a name=380:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust that the marks of a true servant may ever characterise you, that you may be proof against the elevation of the day of success; and that in the day of adversity you may not faint, but that you may taste the sweetness of that special beatitude for a tried servant -- "Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me".<a name=380:7></a>

Consequent upon the rejection of Christ by those who were "the sons of the prophets and of the covenant", an entirely new order of things has come about.<a name=394:14></a> Heaven has received Jesus Christ, and the saints of the assembly are blessed in Him as the heavenly One.<a name=394:15></a> They were chosen in Christ before the world's foundation, according to God's eternal purpose, to be blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=394:16></a> They are said in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>to have been quickened with the Christ, and to have been raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.<a name=394:17></a> Their place in the Father's house is a heavenly place with the Son who has gone to prepare it for them.<a name=394:18></a> When He comes again He will receive them to Himself in that place; they will be with Him where He is.<a name=394:19></a> This is the assembly's own heavenly place and portion -- to be where the Son is in the Father's house.<a name=394:20></a> Hence, so long as we are actually here, we are to seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, and we are to have our mind on the things above; our life is hid with the Christ in God.<a name=394:21></a> Now all this was entirely unknown in Old Testament times; it was never spoken of even prophetically.<a name=394:22></a> But these are the things which are, by divine grace, the present portion and joy of the saints.<a name=394:23></a> I advise you to seek the companionship of those who are after them, and who long to have the joy of them in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=394:24></a>

		I cannot conceive any one who has light as to the assembly, the body of Christ, being caught by a system of teaching which mixes the heavenly hopes of the assembly with the earthly hopes of Israel, and makes both come to fruition at the same moment.<a name=397:13></a> For this implies two distinct companies of saints being on earth at the same time, each of them giving a universal testimony, but the two testimonies producing entirely different results in spiritual formation.<a name=397:14></a> This system of teaching throws the whole prophetic truth of Scripture into confusion; but, what is even more serious for saints of the assembly, it blinds the mind to what is distinctive of the assembly, and obscures the manifold wisdom of God which comes out in the distinctive place which the assembly occupies according to His eternal purpose.<a name=397:15></a>
