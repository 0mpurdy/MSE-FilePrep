		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Book of Leviticus has in view a people in covenant relations with God, in whose midst God dwells, and who have movements of heart Godward.<a name=1:1></a> God had said to Moses, "When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3:12">Exodus  3:12</a>).<a name=1:2></a> He had said to Pharaoh, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a>).<a name=1:3></a> Here we see the manner and order of that service -- the service of a free and willing people; and we learn that every outgoing of heart in the service of God is concerning Christ.<a name=1:4></a> Blessed service!<a name=1:5></a> Blessed those whose privilege it is to take it up!<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we get here about the offerings has its place in the forty-nine days during which the cloud rested on the tabernacle (see <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10:11">Numbers  10:11</a>); a time typical of the complete period of tabernacle service in the wilderness.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The instruction in Leviticus is for us; it is doubtful if the children of Israel ever carried it out.<a name=1:8></a> In a coming day when Israel's heart turns to the Lord they will enter into the meaning of these types.<a name=1:9></a> The veil will then be taken away from their heart, and they will read Moses, seeing the Lord as the end of the old

		covenant, and the Spirit of all the Old Testament Scriptures.<a name=2:1></a> In the meantime, saints of the assembly, being in the good of the ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, are able to read the old covenant without a veil, and find their affections quickened in the apprehension of the Lord as the Spirit of it all.<a name=2:2></a> Nor do I doubt that the church's apprehension of these types has a fulness and expansion which goes beyond what Israel will apprehend in the coming day.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God speaks from the "tent of meeting"; the appointed centre to which His people gathered, where He met them, and where they came into contact with one another in relation to His things.<a name=2:4></a> The communication of His mind was found there.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The assembling of ourselves together" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:25">Hebrews  10:25</a>) answers, I think, to the "tent of meeting".<a name=2:6></a> We also get many references to saints coming together in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, 14.<a name=2:7></a> Saints are taught of God to love one another, and if this divine teaching were not neutralized by human influences it would bring all christians together in every city, town, or village where they are found.<a name=2:8></a> The "tent of meeting" would thus have its antitype in every local assembly.<a name=2:9></a> Things are very broken today, but it is still possible, through infinite mercy, for saints to come together as loving one another in relation to God, and as they do so they get instruction and enlargement in the knowledge of God.<a name=2:10></a> He has great pleasure in seeing His saints together in love; it sets Him free to communicate His mind to them.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we think of our own times it is as saints have come together in love to one another as being of God's assembly that there have been communications of God's mind; great light has been given in regard to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ and the assembly.<a name=3:1></a> We ought to recognize that the privilege of the "tent of meeting" has been restored in these last days.<a name=3:2></a> Saints can come together as saints, and in the truth of their relations with God and with one another, and this in the wilderness.<a name=3:3></a> If believers disregard the "tent of meeting" they will not get much increase of divine light, and what they possess of Christ will not be available for the common good, or for God's praise in the assembly of His saints.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "tent of meeting" suggests the coming together of saints according to divine order, not human arrangement or organization.<a name=3:5></a> The word translated "meeting" means what is set or appointed; it is used of the feasts of Jehovah (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>) and other divinely-appointed occasions.<a name=3:6></a> To have the good of the tent of meeting it is not enough that saints should be together in one room.<a name=3:7></a> They must be together in accord with divine principles, and the truth of God's assembly.<a name=3:8></a> Every principle connected with divine order in the assembly is really essential to the safeguarding and development of spiritual affections.<a name=3:9></a> There must be holy conditions if God is to meet His people.<a name=3:10></a> If saints are at variance with one another they must settle their differences before they can really "come together".<a name=3:11></a> We cannot offer at the altar if we remember that our brother has aught against us.<a name=3:12></a> We could not be there in the undistracted appreciation of Christ.<a name=3:13></a> If we speak of being gathered together to the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ it necessitates that ourselves and our associations must be suitable to that Name.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These early chapters of Leviticus have to do with movements of heart towards God on the part of His people.<a name=3:15></a> They suppose that Christ has been received, for if one is not in possession of Christ he

		has nothing to bring.<a name=4:1></a> The morning and evening lamb of the continual burnt-offering (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:38">Exodus  29:38</a> - 46) give us rather the divine side -- the burnt-offering in its abiding and unchanging perfection as the ground on which God meets His people, and speaks to them, and dwells with them.<a name=4:2></a> "A continual burnt-offering throughout your generations".<a name=4:3></a> It is necessary to be established in the grace of that before we contemplate what is before us in these chapters.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But on our side we have been the subjects of divine working, and the result of this is that certain exercises have been produced in our souls to which Christ is the answer.<a name=4:5></a> One exercise is as to acceptance, and Christ as the burnt-offering is the answer to that.<a name=4:6></a> Another is with regard to perfection in an object for the heart, and the meat-offering is Christ as the answer to that exercise.<a name=4:7></a> A third is with reference to fellowship, and the peace-offering is Christ in relation to that.<a name=4:8></a> And, lastly, there are exercises arising from the humbling discovery of what is in ourselves, and the consciousness of our own failure, to which the answer is Christ as the sin-offering.<a name=4:9></a> All God's called ones have these exercises; I believe the germ of them is inherent in that divine teaching which <i>all</i> His people have; though there may be with many saints a lack of spiritual diligence to follow them up, and to gain Christ as the answer to them.<a name=4:10></a> Our acquisition of divine wealth depends on the diligence with which we pursue the exercises which God gives us.<a name=4:11></a> In proportion as they are followed up, and Christ apprehended in relation to them, we have material for offerings, and are able to take part in the service of God according to His pleasure.<a name=4:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The consideration of this will make it apparent that

	<div class="paragraph">
		every acceptable offering has cost the offerer something.<a name=5:1></a> David said, "I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, to offer up a burnt-offering without cost" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21:24">1 Chronicles  21:24</a>).<a name=5:2></a> It is true that, in a very blessed sense, the gospel furnishes us with everything.<a name=5:3></a> It brings Christ to us in all His fulness and perfection, and by the hearing of faith we receive the Spirit.<a name=5:4></a> But there is a history of exercise behind every true acquisition of Christ, so that the soul has a real sense of the value of what it has gained.<a name=5:5></a> See <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#23:23">Proverbs  23:23</a>; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:18">Revelation  3:18</a>.<a name=5:6></a> As to what grace has made available for us, there is no difference and no limitation; it is the infinite fulness and blessedness of Christ.<a name=5:7></a> But as to the actual wealth of souls in the knowledge of Christ many of us are far short of the full measure of grace.<a name=5:8></a> Many of God's people have not had "the fulness of the blessing of Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:29">Romans  15:29</a>) presented to them, and many others who have been more favoured in this respect have only received in their souls a small part of what has been set before them.<a name=5:9></a> Hence there are different measures of apprehension of Christ, and no one can bring more than he has got.<a name=5:10></a> The consideration of this is very exercising, for it raises the question as to how much <i>I</i> can bring to the "tent of meeting" as an offerer?<a name=5:11></a> If my offering is small, is it that my heart has not been prepared for the cost at which a larger one might have been acquired?<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have often thought of the people we read of in the Gospels who came on the scene with appreciation of Christ.<a name=5:13></a> What a volume of spiritual history lies behind the record of each incident!<a name=5:14></a> Would you not like, for instance, to get alongside the woman of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>-- we shall in courts above -- and ask her how she was led to such a blessed appreciation of Christ?<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>

		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And there was a corresponding history in the case of each man and woman who came to light as having an appreciation of Him.<a name=6:1></a> A similar history of divine instruction and spiritual acquisition lies behind each offering that we bring to the tent of meeting.<a name=6:2></a> Of course it is ever true, as David said, "All is of thee, and of that which is from thy hand have we given thee".<a name=6:3></a> It was God's, and through grace it has become ours, and now we bring it back to God for His pleasure and service.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a beautiful word in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#30:21">Jeremiah  30:21</a>, 22.<a name=6:5></a> "Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me?<a name=6:6></a> saith the Lord.<a name=6:7></a> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God".<a name=6:8></a> As the blessedness of the covenant is known we shall surely engage our hearts to approach God.<a name=6:9></a> It is delightful to God to see His people, moved by His known grace and love, thus engaging their hearts.<a name=6:10></a> God has engaged Himself to us in the most blessed way, and the effect of our knowing it is that we engage our hearts to approach Him both as offerers and priests.<a name=6:11></a> May it be ever more so with us, to His glory and praise!<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The burnt-offering comes first, the offering for acceptance.<a name=6:13></a> The sin-offering comes last; it is only as we know Christ as set forth in the previous offerings that we can rightly estimate sin.<a name=6:14></a> It is in the light of the obedient and perfect One that we can alone truly learn the character of the lawless one.<a name=6:15></a> In the light of One wholly devoted to God in obedience and love we discern how hateful lawlessness is, and how intense, searching and all-consuming is the judgment which has come upon sinful flesh.<a name=6:16></a>

		"He shall present it a male without blemish: at the entrance of the tent of meeting shall he present it, for his acceptance before Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#1:3">Leviticus  1:3</a>).<a name=7:7></a> The offerer is possessed of perfection, and brings it to God with holy delight; all his thoughts of acceptance centre in Another in whom is found unblemished personal excellence.<a name=7:8></a> He is entirely on the ground of Christ; he "leans with his hand" on the bullock.<a name=7:9></a> What could be more blessed than to come near to God with one's hand upon Christ!<a name=7:10></a> To be consciously identified with Him, the heart having possessed itself of Him, and having no thought of any other?<a name=7:11></a> Unblemished perfection is there, God's full delight in Man, and this brought into the world in that holy and glorious Person to furnish through His death acceptance of a most blessed nature for men.<a name=7:12></a> So that, as to acceptance, we have but One to consider, and the heart engages itself with Him, and with Him only, in its movements Godward.<a name=7:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we approach God with the appreciation of Christ in our hearts it involves the displacement of self.<a name=9:8></a> We must be prepared to be tested by Christ.<a name=9:9></a> Are <i>we</i> prepared to have all laid bare?<a name=9:10></a> To have thoughts and motives as well as words and acts all judged in the light of what He was?<a name=9:11></a> He could say, "I seek not mine own glory".<a name=9:12></a> It was at all points a giving up of Himself for the glory of God.<a name=9:13></a> As we enter into that it must affect us morally.<a name=9:14></a>

		But saints are privileged to be <i>priests</i> as well as <i>offerers</i>.<a name=9:15></a> These types run one into another; the man in conscious acceptance becomes a priest, for he only has it in nearness to God, and one who is there is a priest.<a name=9:16></a> God's original thought was not a separate priestly family, but that all Israel should be "a kingdom of priests" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:6">Exodus  19:6</a>).<a name=9:17></a> And it is remarkable

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The priest in the early chapters of Leviticus is not Aaron, but one of his sons, so that he is not typical of Christ but of spiritual persons who can take up things with spiritual intelligence for God's pleasure.<a name=10:9></a> It is the privilege of all saints to be priests, but even if all are not in priestly state the gain of the tent of meeting is that <i>all</i>, in a way, get the benefit of the priestly element.<a name=10:10></a> It would hardly be the tent of meeting if there were no priestly element there, and if there, it is there for the good of all, as well as for the pleasure of God.<a name=10:11></a> It has been said that the most spiritual person in a meeting -- whether brother or sister -- gives character to the meeting.<a name=10:12></a> Every spiritual person contributes that which tends to make others spiritual.<a name=10:13></a>

		I suppose we all look to get some good out of our personal exercises and discipline, but it is well to have before us that <i>the saints</i> are to benefit by the fruit of those exercises.<a name=11:2></a> The assembly is the centre to which all the varied lines of private exercise converge.<a name=11:3></a> We may see this even as to the sin-offering exercise which is brought before us in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>.<a name=11:4></a> It leads to what is collective -- the good of Zion, and the building of the walls of Jerusalem.<a name=11:5></a> And it indicates, too, that if one goes through a sin-offering exercise with God it ends with a burnt-offering.<a name=11:6></a> "Then shalt thou have sacrifices of righteousness, burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering; then shall they offer up bullocks upon thine altar".<a name=11:7></a>

		There is priestly ability in spiritual persons to take up every apprehension of Christ and present it to God in praise so that it is fragrant before Him, and at the same time is helped and enlarged in the souls of the saints.<a name=11:8></a> Thus the service ministers to God's pleasure, and at the same time edifies the saints.<a name=11:9></a> The assembly is the place to increase spiritual wealth, for the apprehension of Christ which each has brought there becomes available for all.<a name=11:10></a> So that each time we come together we should become richer in the knowledge of Christ, and thus able to bring larger offerings.<a name=11:11></a> One delights to think of the assembly as a spiritual commonwealth.<a name=11:12></a> The wealth of the assembly is the aggregate of what is known of Christ in every heart.<a name=11:13></a> Spiritual men can bring there a large appreciation of Christ, but as it finds expression it becomes available for the enrichment of all, as well as for the service and pleasure of God.<a name=11:14></a>

		The priest is one with spiritual intelligence, and apprehension of what is <i>for God</i>.<a name=12:1></a> He has spiritual affections and capability, and knows how to handle what is pleasurable to God.<a name=12:2></a> He presents the blood -- the witness of death; he has the sense that Christ has been in death entirely for the will and pleasure of God.<a name=12:3></a> "I come to do thy will, O God".<a name=12:4></a> This does not weaken the sense of acceptance; it intensifies it by connecting it with God's pleasure and glory, and this is a great enlargement.<a name=12:5></a> With what unbounded liberty and delight can we approach God when we realize that our acceptance is according to His pleasure in Christ!<a name=12:6></a>

		This chapter brings before us the saints' apprehension of Christ in His personal perfection.<a name=16:4></a> It is not a question of atonement or acceptance, but the heart delighting in a perfect Object, and engaging itself with that Object in its movements Godward.<a name=16:5></a> Presenting an "oblation" or "gift" supposes that one is consciously in the acceptance of the burnt-offering as seen in chapter 1.<a name=16:6></a> There is entire freedom from every question that might arise as to one's own acceptance.<a name=16:7></a> We are not now thinking of sin, nor of how it has been dealt with, nor even of the way in which God has been glorified as to it.<a name=16:8></a> We are occupied with what is perfect under the eye of God, and under our eye, in a Man here on earth.<a name=16:9></a>

		There is a difference between Christ viewed as the "manna" and Christ as typified in the "oblation".<a name=17:4></a> The manna was given from heaven to sustain men in wilderness conditions.<a name=17:5></a> But in the oblation we see rather what there was in Man viewed as "the fruit of the earth" -- this expression is applied to Christ in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#4:2">Isaiah  4:2</a> -- for the delight of God, and to engage the affections of all who are divinely taught to appreciate it.<a name=17:6></a> It is what can be offered as a sweet odour for the pleasure of God, and what becomes, as such, the food of the holy priesthood.<a name=17:7></a>

		We may trace it in numberless features in the Gospels; the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms are full of presentations in detail of that which is for God's delight in man; and every exhortation which the Epistles contain as to the spirit and walk which are comely in saints is an unfolding of the perfections of Jesus.<a name=18:12></a> I am not speaking, for the moment, of His official dignity or royal glory, but of His moral perfection.<a name=18:13></a> Everything which Scripture presents from Genesis to Revelation as being morally excellent in man, and for God's pleasure, had its place in that unique Manhood of which the "fine flour" is typical.<a name=18:14></a> It can only be brought as an offering by the saint who has apprehended it, and in the measure of his apprehension.<a name=18:15></a> But this should surely be, with each one of us, continually increasing.<a name=18:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The priest that is anointed" is the first case considered.<a name=40:3></a> It is very sad when such a one sins "according to the trespass of the people".<a name=40:4></a> For a saint who has known what it is to be anointed -- to have the Spirit, and to be in priestly relations with God as one possessed of holy knowledge -- to forget, as it were, the anointing, and act wrongly like a common person, is very serious.<a name=40:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noticeable that in connection with the priest it does not speak -- as in the case of the assembly, the prince or one of the people -- of his sin becoming known.<a name=41:4></a> This supposes, in their case, a certain interval between the sin and its becoming known to them as such.<a name=41:5></a> But the omission of this statement when the priest is in question seems to suggest that the anointed priest would realize at once, intuitively, that he had done what he ought not.<a name=41:6></a> This implies a holy sensitiveness in the priest that one would covet.<a name=41:7></a> It implies such habitual nearness to God that if, in an unguarded moment, one has done what ought not to be done, it is felt at once, and the soul immediately turns to God about it.<a name=41:8></a> My impression is that the degree of a believer's holiness -- the degree in which he has truly known what it is to be an anointed priest -- can be measured by his sensitiveness as to sin.<a name=41:9></a>

		When there have been actions or words or feelings that are of the flesh it is often some time before there is any true movement of self-judgment.<a name=41:10></a> This indicates that nearness has not been known or preserved, or the distance that sin produces would be more quickly and keenly felt.<a name=41:11></a> In such a case the believer has got away -- as to the condition of his soul -- from his place with God as an anointed priest, though he may have formerly known that holy and near position and character.<a name=41:12></a> If we are not habitually near to God we may go on a long time with what is

		If a priest sins he cannot go on with the service of God, but to a sensitive priestly heart restoration is not necessarily a long process.<a name=42:5></a> It is indeed a grave fault for such a one to sin "according to the trespass of the people", but the scripture supposes that he is marked by the sensitiveness which properly belongs to the priestly anointing.<a name=42:6></a> It is very sad if this sensitiveness is lacking; such a condition really belies the character of the anointing.<a name=42:7></a>

		Think of the impression that would be made on all Israel as the anointed priest was seen bringing his sin-offering "to the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah"!<a name=44:5></a> It is true that he has sinned, but he has something greater before him than his sin.<a name=44:6></a> He is "before Jehovah", and he is in possession, typically, of a large apprehension of Christ.<a name=44:7></a> His soul is filled with the apprehension of Christ in relation to his sin.<a name=44:8></a> Do you not think that would take away the fleshly reluctance to own the wrong that he had done?<a name=44:9></a> I do not think Peter minded his fault being put on record for the church.<a name=44:10></a> As to Moses and David, it is themselves who have told, in the most public way, the story of their faults.<a name=44:11></a> This shows how completely they were morally apart from the sin by self-judgment, so that they had no thought of preserving their own reputation.<a name=44:12></a>

		In the early part of the last century many godly persons felt deeply the sin of the assembly; not merely their personal failures but that "the whole assembly" had departed from God's thoughts.<a name=51:3></a> Priestly exercise was brought about as to what was suitable to God, and much light was given as to His ways and purposes, and as to Christ and the assembly.<a name=51:4></a> This led to a judgment of things in the light of the death of Christ, and to a movement of separation, and the result has been a revival, in measure, of the true spiritual features of the assembly, and of the service of God, and of the enjoyment of assembly privilege.<a name=51:5></a>

		CHAPTER 5
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noticeable that the section of this book referring to the sin-offering is longer than that referring to the other offerings; it extends from chapter 4: 1 to chapter 5: 13.<a name=57:9></a> Then the trespass-offering is in chapter 5: 14 - 26.<a name=57:10></a> That so much should have to be said on this subject is sad evidence of the existence of much amongst the people of God that calls for it.<a name=57:11></a> In verses 1 - 6 of this chapter we have three specific instances, which would probably cover in principle every kind of sin amongst the people of God.<a name=57:12></a> The first is failure in respect of <i>witness</i>; the second is failure as to the maintenance of <i>separation</i>; and the third is failure as to sobriety or <i>self-control</i>.<a name=57:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first instance of guilt is that of one who refrains from uttering that of which he should bear witness.<a name=58:1></a> It shows that such a thing is likely to occur among the people of God.<a name=58:2></a> One has known instances of persons being in a position to bear witness of evil which should have been made known, who have failed to utter it.<a name=58:3></a> This is a serious matter, for it is said of such, "If he do not give information then he shall bear his iniquity".<a name=58:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another side of things to which this would apply.<a name=58:5></a> We are left here in the place of witness for Christ, and there are times when we are directly challenged -- when we "hear the voice of adjuration" -- and if we fail to bear witness we are guilty.<a name=58:6></a> The Lord heard "the voice of adjuration" when before the High Priest (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:63">Matthew  26:63</a>), and He witnessed a good confession.<a name=58:7></a> We are responsible to be confessors of the truth -- confessors of Christ -- but we often fail to utter what we should witness; we shrink from the reproach which is connected with the Name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=58:8></a> Christ Jesus witnessed the good confession in the presence of the High Priest and of Pontius Pilate (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:13">1 Timothy  6:13</a>), and this would show that "confession" is not amongst believers, but in the presence of the hostile world.<a name=58:9></a> It does not mean telling christians that one believes in Jesus, but owning Him before unbelievers.<a name=58:10></a>

		True confession is in answer to a challenge.<a name=58:11></a> At school, or in the office, or at the works, you are asked to do something, or to go somewhere, and you are obliged to decline because you know that it would not please the Lord Jesus.<a name=58:12></a> Then the challenge comes, Why not?<a name=58:13></a> Now you have to utter what is in your heart!<a name=58:14></a> Sometimes we evade the reproach -- which is

		Our witness is to be of what we have "seen or known" in Christ.<a name=59:6></a> If we have travelled along the moral road mapped out in this book, and learned Christ as the burnt-offering, the oblation, the peace-offering, and the sin-offering, He has acquired a great place in our affections, and we are to witness accordingly.<a name=59:7></a> We have "seen or known" something that is worth confessing.<a name=59:8></a> Then let us confess it!<a name=59:9></a> Many hold back because they feel they will bungle over it.<a name=59:10></a> Perhaps you will bungle, but never mind, get it out!<a name=59:11></a> There is tremendous power in just saying, Jesus is Lord to me.<a name=59:12></a> The man to whom you say it knows, at the bottom, that Jesus ought to be Lord to him, and his conscience will support your confession, whatever he may say with his lips, and the Holy Spirit will support it too.<a name=59:13></a> Some are kept back from witnessing of what they have "seen and known" by the fear that they will not be consistent.<a name=59:14></a> But the witness gets divine support; all the power of the kingdom of God supports a confessor of the Lord Jesus.<a name=59:15></a> Satan would keep us back from being true witnesses so that we might not get the support of the kingdom.<a name=59:16></a> A man, who in a foreign land was ashamed of the British flag, could not expect to be supported by British power if he got into difficulties.<a name=59:17></a> You may depend upon it that in God's kingdom the flag will be

		If souls are not in the light of Christ, and of what has been effected in His death, their exercises in relation to self-discovery will be prolonged and intensely painful.<a name=137:3></a> This is intimated, perhaps, in the much longer period of cleansing for a female child.<a name=137:4></a> There is something wrought of God subjectively -- the female would typify this -- but Christ is not clearly and fully in the soul's view.<a name=137:5></a> This probably sets forth typically the exercises of the remnant of Israel when God begins to work in them.<a name=137:6></a> They will fear God and love His law, and follow after righteousness, without having -- at any rate in the early stages of their exercise -- any clear light as to Christ, or as to what is connected with the eighth day.<a name=137:7></a> Their deep and prolonged exercise appears in many of the Psalms and in the Prophets -- a sense of sin and an earnest looking to God for His salvation, but no clear light, as yet, with regard to Christ.<a name=137:8></a> The latter-day exercises of the remnant will be bitter and prolonged, but they will learn thereby that "all flesh is grass".<a name=137:9></a> They will be humbled by the consideration of their individual and national history -- the law broken, the promises despised, the idolatry, the rejection of their Messiah, the refusal of Him who spoke from heaven.<a name=137:10></a> But the moment will come when they will see that all this, which is the evidence of their state in flesh, has been dealt with and judged in the death of their Messiah.<a name=137:11></a> He has made it all His own in wondrous grace that they

		Something analogous to this is often found in souls today.<a name=138:5></a> They have exercises which are the fruit of mercy and of divine working in them.<a name=138:6></a> They have desires God-ward, and they learn painfully their uncleanness bit by bit, first at one point and then at another, and go on for years without getting clear.<a name=138:7></a> Such prolonged exercises are very common under defective teaching, and where souls have not the ministry of Christ, or, at any rate, not what might be called an "eighth day" ministry.<a name=138:8></a> They are not cleansed from their uncleanness, though learning it, and learning to abhor themselves.<a name=138:9></a> They are not in liberty with God, and are not really in the truth and blessing of Christ.<a name=138:10></a>

		For the cleansing of the leper the priest commands two clean living birds to be taken, and cedar-wood and scarlet and hyssop.<a name=152:11></a> The "two clean living birds" as typical of Christ would suggest what He was as coming down from heaven.<a name=152:12></a> It was characteristic of Him that He came down from heaven not to do His own will but the will of Him who sent Him (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:38">John  6:38</a>).<a name=152:13></a> He was of the things that are above, and the whole principle of His moral being was obedience.<a name=152:14></a> God presents to the healed leper, and to every one of us, a new and heavenly kind of Man in Christ.<a name=152:15></a> As marked by activity of will the leper has manifested that he was "of those things which are beneath" (see note to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "cedar-wood and scarlet and hyssop" would, I think, intimate things which had their anti-type in Christ.<a name=153:3></a> If the cedar speaks of "the loftiness of man", as it does in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#2">Isaiah  2</a>, and the scarlet of anything that would give him distinction, and the hyssop of his low estate, I think these things may be also suggestive of what Christ was in the days of His flesh.<a name=153:4></a> It is said of Him, "His bearing as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:15">Song of Songs  5:15</a>).<a name=153:5></a> Wherever we look at Him -- in the home at Nazareth, in the temple at twelve years of age, at the baptismal water of Jordan, in the temptation, with His disciples, with the multitudes, with His adversaries -- His bearing had at all times the excellency of the cedar.<a name=153:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then "scarlet" is a <i>distinguishing</i> colour, as we may see in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#38:28">Genesis  38:28</a>; <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#2:18">Joshua  2:18</a>; <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#1:24">2 Samuel  1:24</a>.<a name=153:7></a> "A cloth of scarlet" over the dishes, cups, bowls and goblets of the drink-offering and the continual bread on the table (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4:8">Numbers  4:8</a>) seems to speak of the distinction which God will put upon Israel when they have their administrative place as sustained by Christ for God's pleasure, and they become vessels of drink-offering as gladly devoted to Him.<a name=153:8></a> So the "scarlet" would set forth those features in Christ which in a marked way distinguished Him from all others as having the true glory of Man in contrast with every kind of vain-glory.<a name=153:9></a>

		Then one bird is to be killed in an earthen vessel over running (or living) water.<a name=154:9></a> This would seem to suggest the death of Christ as that of which the witness is preserved for application to the soul in the power of the Spirit.<a name=154:10></a> The living bird, the cedar-wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop are all dipped in the blood of the killed bird, and the one who is to be cleansed is sprinkled seven times by the priest, and pronounced clean.<a name=154:11></a> Christ is seen here as the Living One, but as having become dead on account of that state which had characterized the leper.<a name=154:12></a> If all that in Him which was so excellent and distinctive, so morally suitable to God, had to go into death it gives a profound sense of the cost at which cleansing has been made possible for the leper.<a name=154:13></a> If Christ after the flesh, with all His supreme moral excellence, had to go in death, what does it make of man's greatness or glory, or even of his voluntary humility?<a name=154:14></a> It is seen to be vanity, and to be subject to death, but a death into which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the living bird let loose into the open field would suggest that Christ is known as having returned from death to heavenly associations.<a name=155:7></a> He has died to sin, and has done with it, and He now lives to God.<a name=155:8></a> It is good to get an apprehension of Christ as living to God, for if He lives to God it is that we may take account of ourselves as alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=155:9></a> There is something very attractive to an exercised soul in the thought of living to God; that is, for God's pleasure.<a name=155:10></a> There is One blessed Man who does so absolutely, but He lives to God that we also may live to God in Him, no longer on the line of what we are as in the flesh, but in a new order of man -- in Christ Jesus.<a name=155:11></a>

		The leper is not, typically, an unconverted man, but one of the people of God who has got into a wilful state.<a name=156:6></a> The exercises of such, in view of recovery, are deeper and more humbling than those of a convicted sinner, because the believer has known grace, has valued Christ, and has received the Spirit.<a name=156:7></a> And all this adds to the depth of his self-abhorrence when mercy grants him repentance and heals his leprosy.<a name=156:8></a>

		If the "feast of booths" brings us, in type, to the end of God's ways with Israel it remains for us to ask if there is anything that corresponds with it as the end of His ways with the assembly?<a name=260:4></a> I have no doubt there is.<a name=260:5></a> The assembly has her own relation to the time which is prefigured by "the feast of booths".<a name=260:6></a> She has had made known to her "the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him, in whom we have also obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ".<a name=260:7></a> Then addressing Gentiles he adds, "In whom ye also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of his glory" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:9">Ephesians  1:9</a> - 14).<a name=260:8></a>

		"The feast of booths" is typically that side of "the fulness of times" which relates to "the things upon the earth".<a name=260:9></a> To get the side which relates to "the things in the heavens" we must read the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=260:10></a> We see there the assembly's part in Christ, and the inheritance which the saints of the present period have in Him.<a name=260:11></a> And the Holy Spirit of promise is the earnest of our inheritance.<a name=260:12></a> As sealed

	<div class="paragraph">
		In God's "great love wherewith he loved us (we too being dead in offences)", He "has quickened us with the Christ .<a name=261:3></a>.<a name=261:4></a>.<a name=261:5></a> and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus".<a name=261:6></a> The rapture is thus anticipated in spirit; the saints, quickened, elevated, and seated, have reached in spirit the <i>end</i> which divine love has purposed.<a name=261:7></a> And this in order that God "might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus".<a name=261:8></a> We sit down under all the beauty of a heavenly Christ in what may be spoken of as "the eternal tabernacles".<a name=261:9></a> This is the <i>end</i> of God's ways and working with His saints, to which He would bring us in spirit even now.<a name=261:10></a> As the saints reach this by the work of God they are ready for the rapture, for they are already in spirit where the rapture will put them actually.<a name=261:11></a> They have reached God's <i>end</i> spiritually; the rapture will bring them to it in actuality.<a name=261:12></a> They are fully ready, in concert with the Spirit, to say, Come!<a name=261:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is a beautiful hint in the chapter before us of something even beyond the "feast of booths".<a name=261:14></a> That feast lasts seven days, but at the end of it there is an "eighth day".<a name=261:15></a> I believe the joy of the millennium will lead the saints on earth to desire and look for what is eternal, and I have no doubt they will reach "the eighth day" in the new earth, when the tabernacle of God will be with men, and God will be
