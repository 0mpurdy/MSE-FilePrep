		C.A.<a name=3:1></a>C.<a name=3:2></a> It was thought that in considering together the precious subject of the Lord's supper we should first of all get some idea of the kind of persons who can eat the supper.<a name=3:3></a> The thought, therefore, is to see how these people at Corinth came to be the assembly of God, and the features that marked them as the assembly of God.<a name=3:4></a> It is clear that the Lord's supper has its place in the assembly of God, and to understand it we must necessarily be acquainted with the character of the assembly.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:6></a> I was wondering whether the two verses in early Acts would give the thought.<a name=3:7></a> "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.<a name=3:8></a> And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers".<a name=3:9></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a> - 42.<a name=3:10></a> They give the setting of those whom we have in view at the present time.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:12></a>C.<a name=3:13></a> Yes, the same character of things evidently took place at Corinth.<a name=3:14></a> The testimony corresponded with that rendered by Peter at Jerusalem.<a name=3:15></a> His testimony was that God had made "that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ".<a name=3:16></a> That was the announcement which promptly affected them.<a name=3:17></a> Likewise at Corinth (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>) Paul announced to them in the synagogue that Jesus was the Christ.<a name=3:18></a> It is well for us to understand that that is the very essence of the assembly position, it is composed of persons who believe the testimony that Jesus is the Christ.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:20></a> Do you get that in the opening verses in Corinthians?<a name=3:21></a> Paul refers a good many times there to "the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=3:22></a>

		C.A.<a name=4:1></a>C.<a name=4:2></a> Yes, it is important to look at these things from the standpoint of divine testimony.<a name=4:3></a> It is not a question of our personal experience or needs at all, but it is a question of a Person to whom God has given testimony that He is the anointed One; He is the Christ, God's Anointed.<a name=4:4></a> It is the testimony apart from all feeling or experience that I or anybody else may have.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:6></a> "According as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you".<a name=4:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:8></a>C.<a name=4:9></a> He refers to it further on -- "I came to you .<a name=4:10></a>.<a name=4:11></a> .<a name=4:12></a> announcing to you the testimony of God".<a name=4:13></a> It is summed up in "Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=4:14></a> We cannot be too simple in regard to it, yet it is most profound because of its stupendous reality.<a name=4:15></a> We just believe the testimony.<a name=4:16></a> It certainly must come to us as the testimony of God, and if we received that testimony it would result in our identifying ourselves with the Person who is the subject of testimony: and those who do so, form the assembly in a place.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:18></a> Will you say what the testimony of the Christ involves?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:20></a>C.<a name=4:21></a> It is most important to understand that.<a name=4:22></a> The testimony is that there is such a Person as God's Anointed.<a name=4:23></a> There are many prophetic references to Him in the Old Testament, but the testimony now comes to us that Jesus is that Person, that anointed Man of whom the Old Testament spoke.<a name=4:24></a> The thought of being God's Anointed means that He is the Man whom God distinguishes and accredits, and we cannot believe that without being powerfully affected.<a name=4:25></a> It is the first thing we come to when we have to do with God; we must accept that He is God's Anointed.<a name=4:26></a>

		C.A.<a name=5:1></a>C.<a name=5:2></a> That is the whole thing.<a name=5:3></a> Jesus claimed to be the Anointed when He stood up in the synagogue at Nazareth (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a> - 21), and His whole life was the evidence of the fact.<a name=5:4></a> I think Paul gave that evidence at Corinth for he "reasoned" with them.<a name=5:5></a> It was a matter of careful proof that Jesus was the Anointed.<a name=5:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		C.A.<a name=5:9></a>C.<a name=5:10></a> This lies at the very basis of the formation of the assembly; you have no company to take the supper otherwise.<a name=5:11></a> It is all a question of believing God's testimony, and His testimony is Jesus.<a name=5:12></a> It clears the ground at once.<a name=5:13></a> Corinth was full of idols and there were schools of philosophy and a synagogue of Jews, but none of these things had been anointed by God.<a name=5:14></a> He had put no distinction on any of them.<a name=5:15></a> He had put distinction on Jesus.<a name=5:16></a> These things are in a sense simple, but they are immense in moral power and significance.<a name=5:17></a> God is distinguishing one Man, He is testifying that Jesus is the anointed Man.<a name=5:18></a> It is no question of our exercises at all.<a name=5:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:22></a>C.<a name=5:23></a> Yes, I do not want to go on with anything that God has not anointed.<a name=5:24></a> God has shewn me a Man who has been anointed.<a name=5:25></a> He stands alone -- it carries with it a separating power.<a name=5:26></a> This is a thing that can he reasoned out and Paul shews there is unquestionable evidence that Jesus is God's Anointed Man.<a name=5:27></a> If people do not believe it they do not believe God's testimony.<a name=5:28></a> It was all developed in the life and testimony of Jesus, all was an undeniable proof.<a name=5:29></a> "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power; who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him".<a name=5:30></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>).<a name=5:31></a> Now God is still submitting the evidence of it to men, and they are responsible to form their own judgment regarding it.<a name=5:32></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:5></a>C.<a name=6:6></a> Because the princes of this world had crucified the Lord.<a name=6:7></a> The testimony was all there before their eyes.<a name=6:8></a> They did not call the blind man of <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>or Mary Magdalene as witnesses.<a name=6:9></a> They did not call any worth hearing.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:11></a> It says, "None of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory".<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:13></a>C.<a name=6:14></a> It shews their blindness.<a name=6:15></a> It is just to bring out the utter incapacity of men to receive the testimony of God.<a name=6:16></a> So there must he certain persons who are called, and to them Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, but He is to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness.<a name=6:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:20></a>C.<a name=6:21></a> That is the whole thing, so the belief that Christ is God's Anointed Man really delivers the soul from every other kind of man.<a name=6:22></a> That is the kind of man God distinguishes and accredits.<a name=6:23></a> A distinct issue was raised that none of us can avoid.<a name=6:24></a> The mass of men do not believe that He is the Christ, and the fact that some do makes a sharp line of demarcation and every believer feels that he must be baptised and take his stand with Christ or with the world that crucified Him.<a name=6:25></a> It is a clear-cut issue.<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Anointing brings out the moral character attaching to Jesus.<a name=6:27></a> There was not a single thing about Him that God was not pleased to distinguish; He loved to put distinction on <i>that</i> Man.<a name=6:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:29></a> I was wondering whether it went back to the breakdown in Eden.<a name=6:30></a> It is a necessity that One who pleases God should come into evidence, and that is the One to whom God is looking.<a name=6:31></a>

		After the preaching that God had made Jesus "both Lord and Christ" they recognised what an awful state the world was in and said, We must get clear of it!<a name=7:22></a> If I have really believed the testimony of God's Anointed, I have finished with the world.<a name=7:23></a> The world is after money and gain and pleasure.<a name=7:24></a> There is not a single thing that God has anointed in it.<a name=7:25></a> If there is one divine spark in my soul I am attracted to Jesus.<a name=7:26></a> Then I accept the truth of baptism, I have finished with the world -- that is what baptism means.<a name=7:27></a>
