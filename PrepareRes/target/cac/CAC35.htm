		When Paul is writing to the Romans he begins, "God's glad tidings .<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a>.<a name=5:4></a> concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power .<a name=5:5></a>.<a name=5:6></a>.<a name=5:7></a> )".<a name=5:8></a> Well, he can build the whole epistle, the whole gospel and counsel of God upon that; the moment we have Christ, we have everything!<a name=5:9></a>

		C.A.<a name=5:12></a>C.<a name=5:13></a> God can do anything in a soul where Christ has a footing.<a name=5:14></a> Our progress and our knowledge of the mystery all hang on Christ being in our affections.<a name=5:15></a> And what we get in chapter 3 is that His genealogy is traced right down long after the captivity, i.<a name=5:16></a>e.<a name=5:17></a> the royal line is undisturbed by the captivity, and all the public failure of the assembly has not touched what is in Christ.<a name=5:18></a> He is Head in spite of failure on our side.<a name=5:19></a> It does not touch that line, does it?<a name=5:20></a>

		C.A.<a name=5:24></a>C.<a name=5:25></a> Hebron was built before Zoan; it seems connected with divine purpose which is before the world.<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought chapter 4 gives us more how spiritual things are maintained in the saints.<a name=5:27></a> The introduction of Christ typically involves everything -- the whole counsel of God; but things have to be reached and maintained through the exercises of the saints; that is the subject of chapter 4.<a name=5:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:1></a>C.<a name=6:2></a> Yes, we have been noticing in reading the books of recovery how much hangs on prayer.<a name=6:3></a> The whole movement of recovery is brought about by the intercession of Christ, also by the intercession of saints, and Jabez is one of the outstanding men of prayer in Scripture.<a name=6:4></a> He emphasises to us that things can only be received from God.<a name=6:5></a> We very often think that we can get things some other way, through ministry, reading the Bible or thinking about things; but we can only get things from God.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:7></a> I am sure of that.<a name=6:8></a> Would you say that discipline runs along with it so that God can bring about what we request?<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:10></a>C.<a name=6:11></a> There was a painful exercise.<a name=6:12></a> Jabez was the product of painful travail on the part of his mother, and he took up the exercise of getting things for himself from God.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:14></a> The Corinthians were reminded of it, for it is "God the giver of the increase".<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=6:16></a>C.<a name=6:17></a> Yes, we have delight in ministry, for ministry tells us what there is to be secured, but it never gives us anything.<a name=6:18></a> Is that going too far?<a name=6:19></a> That is why we are so interested, because it tells us what treasures there are.<a name=6:20></a> But if we want it, we must get it from God, we must pray; there is no other way.<a name=6:21></a> "Request", an emphatic word, you really want it.<a name=6:22></a> Sometimes I have heard a brother pray a long and wordy prayer, and at the end I have wondered whatever he wanted!<a name=6:23></a> I think the Lord would say, What is it you want?<a name=6:24></a> Jabez was a definite man and could state definitely to God what he wanted.<a name=6:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:6></a> Does Jabez's prayer contain the germ of Paul's two prayers in Ephesians -- the God of resurrection, and the great scope of God in Christ -- that is where there is enlargement, is it not?<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=7:8></a>C.<a name=7:9></a> It seems to me that Jabez represents a young soul on whom is dawning the blessing there is in Christ, and who wants it for himself.<a name=7:10></a> We must begin with what is individual.<a name=7:11></a> He wants to be blessed and rightly enlarged.<a name=7:12></a> Well, I think the blessing he desired is opened out in this book of Chronicles.<a name=7:13></a> It is all available, but if we want it we must go in for it in the Jabez way.<a name=7:14></a> Sometimes we have to wait a long time for the answers to our prayers, because we are not at all ready for them.<a name=7:15></a> I may ask for spiritual things for which I am not ready.<a name=7:16></a> God may answer now a prayer I made forty years ago.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=7:18></a> A prayer to be blessed is precious to God; it honours Him.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>

		Rem.<a name=7:20></a> He goes on, "And that thou wouldest keep me from evil".<a name=7:21></a> Would that be as a safeguard from inflation?<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=7:23></a>C.<a name=7:24></a> Yes, he wants God's hand with him for preservation.<a name=7:25></a> When we get enlargement and a bit of joy we get careless and the enemy takes advantage.<a name=7:26></a> After Paul had been in the third heaven he had the thorn.<a name=7:27></a> We need that mighty hand to preserve us from all the subtle snares of the enemy in connection with blessing.<a name=7:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:29></a> What answers to the mother today?<a name=7:30></a> It looks as if Jabez was the product of a mother's exercise, watched over by prayer.<a name=7:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=7:32></a>C.<a name=7:33></a> Would she represent the assembly in any way?<a name=7:34></a> It is one service of the assembly.<a name=7:35></a> The maternal exercise is the yearning for some product for God.<a name=7:36></a> We see it in Hannah, she wanted a man for Jehovah.<a name=7:37></a>

		C.A.<a name=9:1></a>C.<a name=9:2></a> We were considering last week that, the Spirit of God having introduced David, who is typical of Christ, we get in chapter 4 certain features marking the saints as indicating the line on which things are maintained on the side of the people of God.<a name=9:3></a> The first great principle is Jabez, the thought of prayer, and then the next special feature called attention to is the thought of craftsmen.<a name=9:4></a> "The father of the valley of craftsmen; for they were craftsmen".<a name=9:5></a> This introduces the thought of skilful labour, which, I suppose, is very essential.<a name=9:6></a> We should not be edified by prayer alone.<a name=9:7></a> I thought there was a moral order in the exercises suggested.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is that the Spirit of God would lead us to be enriched and enlarged in our own portion in Christ, and then the thought of being serviceable in connection with the work of the Lord.<a name=9:9></a> "Craftsmen" means skilful labour in connection with the work of the Lord.<a name=9:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=68:1></a> Is there any special significance in the sacrifices of the seven bullocks and seven rams in chapter 15: 26?<a name=68:2></a> Thousands of bullocks were offered by David, and when the ark is brought to the temple they are without number.<a name=68:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=68:4></a>C.<a name=68:5></a> I think it is to make known to us that as a place is secured for Christ, and the Levites' service that would bring Him in is helped of God, there is a spontaneous sacrifice to God in the matter -- a spontaneous movement in the affections of the people, encouraging us to see that if we are helped to secure a place for the ark, God will have a portion; which is indeed developed in the chapter we are reading this evening.<a name=68:6></a> The result of the ark getting its place is this wonderful psalm of praise to God as linked to the service of God in the assembly today.<a name=68:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		C.A.<a name=68:10></a>C.<a name=68:11></a> David represents believers who honour Christ, but need to be instructed to give place to what is priestly and levitical, so it answers very much to the position of many saints today.<a name=68:12></a> They desire by grace to honour Christ and find a place for Him, but there is the need of the priestly and levitical elements to be brought in; we need spirituality; devotedness to Christ is not sufficient.<a name=68:13></a> There are thousands more devoted than we are in this room, but they entirely miss the mind of God because they do not cultivate spirituality, and so are devoted according to their own idea.<a name=68:14></a> It is solemnly true

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=77:6></a>C.<a name=77:7></a> Well, I think we see the sovereign work of God in Ornan in its completeness without any complications incurred by his own experiences, for he is an unknown man.<a name=77:8></a>

		C.A.<a name=77:11></a>C.<a name=77:12></a> I think the whole principle on which the house of God stands is brought out by Ornan, that is, the sovereign mercy of God.<a name=77:13></a> David judged his self-importance as sin and we know well we have to come to that point, and as soon as he reaches that point he has a seer -- Gad is particularly called David's seer (verse 9).<a name=77:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I doubt whether we come to the truth of the house without this.<a name=77:15></a> It is reached by the sovereign mercy of God, and we might all come into the thoughts of Christ by sovereign mercy.<a name=77:16></a> It is a point that brings us to all the thoughts of God at one stroke, is it not?<a name=77:17></a> So Ornan says, "I give it all".<a name=77:18></a> But David has to go through experience that brings him to it experimentally.<a name=77:19></a> He learns that everything he prided himself in is sin.<a name=77:20></a> And then we get the seer -- capacity to see things as God sees them.<a name=77:21></a> Gad -- what a lot of spiritual endowment we have which we have never utilised!<a name=77:22></a> It is a great thing when we appropriate to ourselves the power of seeing as God sees.<a name=77:23></a> He

		The seer comes in when the conscience has been touched.<a name=78:5></a> David came to it: "I have sinned greatly".<a name=78:6></a> The seer gave him light as to the mind of God so as to understand this wonderful new place and position in which the blessed God is to be served.<a name=78:7></a> Have we the seer for this?<a name=78:8></a> We get insight into the way in which God would be served, it is a new principle with which we want to be well acquainted.<a name=78:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=78:12></a>C.<a name=78:13></a> David identified the altar with the house; if you have the altar you have the house in principle; one simple divine element involves all the rest.<a name=78:14></a> It is wonderful!<a name=78:15></a> So Jacob had the same, but he saw the house of God in it.<a name=78:16></a> Though there is nothing to see yet, we can have the whole truth about the house in our soul.<a name=78:17></a>

		When we have judged ourselves we get ability to see how God is approached and to think of others and see value in them and so be prepared to suffer for them.<a name=78:23></a> David had a deep sense of the divine value of this way of approach to God as we see in the six hundred shekels.<a name=78:24></a> Do we value the wonderful way of approach to God that has been opened up to us?<a name=78:25></a> Ornan valued the exercises of David but we are not told how he arrived at this.<a name=78:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=79:1></a>C.<a name=79:2></a> We have to take account of both.<a name=79:3></a> In sovereign mercy we have redemption; we have been transferred from Adam to Christ in new creation, all on the ground of God's sovereign mercy.<a name=79:4></a> We have to take account of saints in that way.<a name=79:5></a> I am poor, I have few shekels, but we take account of the saints as "in Christ Jesus".<a name=79:6></a> You find the two lines coalesce.<a name=79:7></a> The experimental line is always humiliating; you never had an experience with God in your life that was not humiliating, while sovereign mercy brings you into things at a stroke.<a name=79:8></a> Ornan saw all that David saw.<a name=79:9></a> Ornan hides himself when he sees the angel, he disappears.<a name=79:10></a> He gets ability to contribute to the divine way.<a name=79:11></a> It was a great contribution, "the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges for wood, and the wheat for the oblation", and he says, "I give it all".<a name=79:12></a> David had come to the divine measure of the thing, six hundred shekels of gold, and the weight of it is given.<a name=79:13></a> It represents a saint breaking bread, one who has come to the sense of a divine way of approach to God.<a name=79:14></a> He values the new movement throwing the old dispensation entirely into the shade.<a name=79:15></a> It was the most important moment in the history of Israel; God was giving light as to a new approach to Him all on the footing of sovereign mercy.<a name=79:16></a> Ornan shows you the gentile distinguished; it is really the mystery.<a name=79:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		C.A.<a name=79:20></a>C.<a name=79:21></a> I think that is interesting.<a name=79:22></a> It is new.<a name=79:23></a> That is what gives such exuberance to the morning meeting, because we are brought into it purely in mercy.<a name=79:24></a> So the threshing-floor of Ornan represents the great principle of sovereign mercy.<a name=79:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=80:16></a>C.<a name=80:17></a> It is suggestive that they have come to the same point morally as David had; they went out of sight in the presence of the destroying angel.<a name=80:18></a> But they come into sight again; the oxen are given.<a name=80:19></a>

		C.A.<a name=80:23></a>C.<a name=80:24></a> We ought to be afraid of the old system of things -- afraid to enquire at Gibeon, knowing what it is to be in the acceptance of the burnt-offering in the threshing-floor.<a name=80:25></a> And there is no linking on with the old system; it is discarded and David will not go back to it.<a name=80:26></a> We do not want a system that recognises man in the flesh, and the whole system of the religious world does.<a name=80:27></a> David represents the believer entirely delivered from the old system, and he is afraid of it.<a name=80:28></a> Solomon answers more to Hebron; the old system is brought spiritually into the

		C.A.<a name=81:6></a>C.<a name=81:7></a> I think it shows how completely David has come over to the divine side.<a name=81:8></a> He has finished with the old and he sees a new system all of God and all subsisting in the value of the burnt-offering.<a name=81:9></a> We realise our spiritual unity when we come together, a brother says what is making you supremely happy, what is welling up in your own heart.<a name=81:10></a> He had no right after the old system, but there is no restriction whatever in the house; there is no silent brother in the house.<a name=81:11></a>

		The Levites "under the direction of their fathers, Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, for song in the house of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#25:6">1 Chronicles  25:6</a>) were also appointed to serve in twenty-four "charges".<a name=123:2></a> This character of service is not altogether Godward for it is largely marked by prophesying (see <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#25:1">1 Chronicles  25:1</a>, 2, 3), and this indicates that it is for the comfort and enlargement of saints with reference to the service of God.<a name=123:3></a> This feature is to be continuously present.<a name=123:4></a> It is not prophesying to exercise consciences, or to make men fall down as convicted (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:24">1 Corinthians  14:24</a>, 25), but prophesying which brings the blessedness of God into the hearts of His saints in a very happy way.<a name=123:5></a> It is "with harps and lutes and cymbals", and it is said of some that they "prophesied with the harp, to give thanks and to praise Jehovah".<a name=123:6></a> This accords with the words, "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:19">Ephesians  5:19</a>, and see also <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:16">Colossians  3:16</a>).<a name=123:7></a> Whatever is addressed to divine Persons in the assembly has a prophetic bearing on the saints who may be present.<a name=123:8></a> It forms and stimulates their affections Godward.<a name=123:9></a> The apostle Paul often introduces in his epistles prayers and ascriptions of praise to God, but it is evident that he does so with a prophetic purpose.<a name=123:10></a> That is, he has in mind to affect the saints in <i>their</i> relations to God by the expression of his own.<a name=123:11></a> And this feature enters into all the service of God in His house.<a name=123:12></a> It ministers to God, but it also promotes happy and worshipful feelings in His saints.<a name=123:13></a> This is the prophetic side of it, which is never to be absent.<a name=123:14></a>

		But what is prominent in the scripture before us is that the service goes round the whole levitical family.<a name=124:5></a> There are twenty-four courses with twelve Levites in each course, representing in a typical way the whole praising company, each one having to take up his service as it fell to him by lot.<a name=124:6></a> "The small as well as the great, the teacher with the scholar" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#25:8">1 Chronicles  25:8</a>).<a name=124:7></a> So that none can excuse himself on the ground that he is "small" or that he is only as yet a "scholar".<a name=124:8></a> Most of us, perhaps, come under these heads, and yet grace permits us a part in the great service of song and in its prophetic aspect.<a name=124:9></a> The fact that in verse 7 they are all said to be "instructed in the songs of Jehovah, all of them skilful" would intimate that all saints, viewed as divinely taught, are competent for this holy service.<a name=124:10></a> All have in their hearts the knowledge of God as revealed in His Son, all have the Spirit of sonship.<a name=124:11></a> Why should they be unable to express what is in their hearts?<a name=124:12></a> Why should any human order or any self-imposed restraint hinder the "harps and lutes and cymbals" from sounding forth, not only for God's praise directly but also to stimulate others in a prophetic way?<a name=124:13></a> God would have each brother in the assembly to be ready for his turn in the service.<a name=124:14></a> The time and manner of it is a matter of spiritual "direction" -- a word which

		We pass in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#27">1 Chronicles  27</a>to another kind of service in which there were twelve divisions, each division serving for one month "throughout the months of the year".<a name=126:6></a> The same service in maintaining what was due to the king had to be carried out in successive divisions all the year round.<a name=126:7></a> Whichever division might be actually serving, the rights of the king were to be maintained with equal faithfulness.<a name=126:8></a> Every one in the whole company of those who serve the Lord is under responsibility to maintain what is due to Him.<a name=126:9></a> Twelve and twenty-four are universal numbers, but all the saints are not exactly in active service all the time.<a name=126:10></a> But each division has to be in readiness to serve as its turn comes round.<a name=126:11></a> I think this applies to the maintenance of principles which involve what is due to the Lord.<a name=126:12></a> The principles of the fellowship have to be maintained in faithfulness; righteousness and holiness in respect of the truth have to be equally maintained by all.<a name=126:13></a> The division in charge at any particular time would represent those who are called upon to act in any matter for the honour of the Lord's name.<a name=126:14></a>

		Then, in addition to the service by courses, in which all take part in the same service, there is also another kind of service in which each individual has his own particular office.<a name=127:8></a> This is seen, typically, in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#27:25">1 Chronicles  27:25</a> - 34.<a name=127:9></a> We may be quite sure that each one mentioned in this section had some "particular ability" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:15">Matthew  25:15</a>) for the post to which he was appointed.<a name=127:10></a> We need to understand how to serve in "courses" first -- how to take our part in the service of the assembly and in the maintenance of the fellowship collectively -- so that what we do in our own department may fit in spiritually with what every other servant is doing.<a name=127:11></a> This is not recognised where a human order prevails, and hence the individual services do not co-ordinate.<a name=127:12></a> There may be a measure of faithful service individually, but it is carried on in a detached way.<a name=127:13></a> But, for us, the departmental service is that of members of one body.<a name=127:14></a> And, according to the truth, we all say, 'Abba, Father', together as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>

		C.A.<a name=173:1></a>C.<a name=173:2></a> I think we should look in these scriptures for the great principles of divine acting, which would help us in the understanding of matters connected with the house of God today.<a name=173:3></a> They are not recorded as history, but as giving us the mind of God according to the Spirit for present application; always bearing in mind, of course, that the house was not built until Christ was glorified, Solomon being a type of Christ as glorified.<a name=173:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=173:7></a>C.<a name=173:8></a> Yes, it seems that Solomon was not acting in the light that had been given to David his father when he went to Gibeon, so that what he does in chapter 1 falls short of what was really pleasing to God.<a name=173:9></a> Solomon was hardly up to it but I think he came to it in this chapter.<a name=173:10></a> He does not say anything in chapter 1 about building the house which was really the great matter before God.<a name=173:11></a> Gibeon was not the place where spiritual light was shining as to the present mind of God, the ark not being there; but now Solomon comes to the thought of God, and I think we can perceive that there is instruction in the kind of labourers that he employs.<a name=173:12></a>

		the most unlikely and refractory persons can become serviceable in building the house.<a name=174:1></a> We find from chapter 8: 7, 8 that these most unlikely persons, who had been under the expressed judgment of God in Joshua, are now brought under the control of Solomon and become tributary to the house, setting forth the kind of persons used today in connection with the building of God's house.<a name=174:2></a>

		C.A.<a name=174:11></a>C.<a name=174:12></a> You mean as a distinction between the two houses?<a name=174:13></a> There is a house for Jehovah where service would be carried on Godward whereas the house of the kingdom would be where kingly authority would be exercised manward, so that both sides would be secured, namely, God's service for His pleasure, and the rights of His throne secured.<a name=174:14></a> We read of the throne, a wonderful throne, further on.<a name=174:15></a>

		C.A.<a name=175:16></a>C.<a name=175:17></a> David is the type of Christ as one who completes the will of God, a man after God's heart, and in a sense he provides all the material; it is the fruit of the incarnation and death and resurrection of Christ; but the building is connected with Him as Solomon, as Christ glorified.<a name=175:18></a> As the glorified One He builds the assembly: "I will build", He says in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>.<a name=175:19></a> I think the thought of skill comes out very prominently, the need for skill, which it is well for us to note.<a name=175:20></a> There is great need of spiritual skill, skilled workmanship; and the teaching we get here is not had by descending into details but by getting principles.<a name=175:21></a> You get here that there is no building of the house without the gentile.<a name=175:22></a> The sovereignty of God comes in as to the place chosen for the house, the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#21:15">1 Chronicles  21:15</a>).<a name=175:23></a> But the calling in of Huram shows a kind of necessity that the gentile should be brought in to get the true thought of the house of God.<a name=175:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=176:14></a>C.<a name=176:15></a> I think it is a term that covers the present acting of God: first it is bringing Jew and gentile together as joint heirs, and a joint body and joint partakers of His promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings, and then it takes the form of God's work among the gentiles, as Paul says, "the mystery" summed up as Christ being in the gentiles, "which is Christ in you the hope of glory" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a>); in a great company of gentile saints, while individual Jews that are added come in on the same ground.<a name=176:16></a> The truth of the mystery is far greater than the ways of God with Israel, than all the promises in the Old Testament.<a name=176:17></a> It was a hidden thing, not said to be hidden in the Scriptures but hidden in God.<a name=176:18></a> But there are intimations in the Old Testament, and I think that this is one of them, the fact that a gentile king is brought in to furnish for the house along with Solomon.<a name=176:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's service on earth prepared the material, in the days of His flesh, but He put it all together by sending down His Spirit after He was glorified, and consequent on that Paul was appointed a special minister of the mystery to show how the gentile was called in, which is our part in it.<a name=177:8></a> It is all right material, there is no thought of a mixed multitude in the mystery.<a name=177:9></a> Paul was not one of the twelve; he was called in love with a special ministry which the twelve did not have.<a name=177:10></a> They had the ministry of the kingdom; Paul had the ministry of the assembly.<a name=177:11></a> We need to consider very carefully and closely the ministry of Paul if we want to be in the thoughts of God at the present time.<a name=177:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of all this is that if we do not know how God is moving we cannot serve Him intelligently.<a name=177:13></a> Solomon was very pious in going to Gibeon, but he was not intelligent in God's mind and did not give Him pleasure.<a name=177:14></a> The great thought in the house is that everything is according to the mind of God, so that He can come in and take possession and be delighted with it.<a name=177:15></a> It is a great conception and we come to understand what a vessel of divine pleasure the assembly is.<a name=177:16></a> Solomon in writing to Huram speaks of the service that would be rendered Godward.<a name=177:17></a> In verse 4 he speaks of the incense, the continual shewbread and the burnt-offerings.<a name=177:18></a>
