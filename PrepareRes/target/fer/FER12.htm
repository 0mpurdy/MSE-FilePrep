		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of the great interest felt, not only in the United States and Canada, but also in England and elsewhere, as to the meetings of which notes are now published, it has been thought well to give a brief sketch of the order in which they took place, and to call attention to some of the most important subjects which came under consideration.<a name=1:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having regard to the fact that not more than five weeks were available for them, and that the distances to be travelled were in some cases very considerable, it had been decided to select a few places which were fairly central, and to hold at each of these places meetings lasting two or three days.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meetings began at Quebec on Saturday evening, October 1st, and continued till Tuesday evening, October 4th, when the brethren from England, joined by several who had come to Quebec to meet them, proceeded to Toronto, arriving there on Wednesday evening.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The readings at Quebec on Monday and Tuesday were on <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>to 8, and were both interesting and helpful, but as much of the ground was gone over more fully at other places, it has been decided not to print them.<a name=1:4></a> The two evening addresses are published.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meetings at Toronto occupied Thursday and Friday, and were very well attended.<a name=1:6></a> As this was the real beginning of the subjects which occupied most of the readings at other places, some general remarks are made further on which may be helpful as indicating the main features of the ministry.<a name=1:7></a> They are, however, in no sense exhaustive, and do not pretend to do more than direct attention to certain points of importance, the details of which will be found in the readings themselves.<a name=1:8></a> On Saturday, October 8th, the visitors, with still further additions, continued their journey to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rochester and remained there until the afternoon of Wednesday, the 12th, Here also there was a large attendance and much interest.<a name=2:1></a> Quite a number came in from various parts of the continent, including places so far distant as California and the Northwest Territory, and as this involved considerable expenditure of both time and money it is a fair indication of the interest felt in the meetings.<a name=2:2></a> Amongst the printed notes will be found a gospel address given on Lord's day evening, and a lecture on Monday evening.<a name=2:3></a> The subject of Tuesday evening's lecture was 'The New Covenant', but as the publication of all the addresses would require too much space, a selection of those thought most suitable for printing was made at the conclusion of the meetings.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A much reduced number left Rochester for Minneapolis, but finding there was special interest at Chicago, it was arranged to have meetings there on Thursday and Friday, and the result quite justified this departure from the original plan.<a name=2:5></a> The meetings were small, being attended only by those living in the city, and as no general notes were taken on this occasion, only one evening's address is printed.<a name=2:6></a> Leaving Chicago after the evening meeting, Minneapolis was reached on Saturday afternoon.<a name=2:7></a> Here a number had assembled from scattered gatherings in the Northwest, including several from Winnipeg, and all seemed to enjoy greatly the opportunity of coming together and the fellowship of their brethren.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meetings continued till Tuesday evening, the 18th.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the following day the visitors returned to Chicago en route to Indianapolis, reaching their destination on Thursday morning, October 20th.<a name=2:10></a> On Saturday, brethren arrived from various places, and when the meetings began there was again a representative company.<a name=2:11></a> On the evening of Tuesday the regular meetings ended, though by special request there was an additional

		reading on John's epistle, but as notes were not taken on this occasion, it does not appear in the book.<a name=3:1></a> Those who were going eastward left the same afternoon for Baltimore, where meetings were held on Thursday evening and Friday, but as these (like those at Chicago) were more local in character, the notes are not published.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On Saturday afternoon, October 29th, there was again a representative gathering at Plainfield (in the vicinity of New York), and meetings were continued until Tuesday evening, November 1st, after which the general gatherings came to an end.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who were free went on Wednesday to Cambridgeport (Boston), where there were meetings during Thursday.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On Friday those returning to England came back to New York, where a farewell reading was held that night, the visitors sailing for Liverpool on Saturday morning, November 5th, arriving in safety the following Saturday.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has not been thought necessary to publish any notes of the readings which were held each Lord's day afternoon.<a name=3:6></a> They were special in character, and the subjects were: QUEBEC, <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>; ROCHESTER, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>; MINNEAPOLIS, <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>; INDIANAPOLIS, <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>; PLAINFIELD, <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In each case what was taken up bore upon 'the assembly', either directly, or as indicating the needed preparation morally for those who are to enter into and enjoy its privileges.<a name=3:8></a> The pleasure the Lord finds in the company of His own, and all that He has done and still does to lead them to appreciate this, was frequently touched upon, as the understanding of it is really necessary if we are to enter in spirit into what the assembly is.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For reasons easily understood the gospel addresses, with the one exception already named, have not been published.<a name=3:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Returning now to the reading meetings, it may be said that the real start of the general subjects was at Toronto, when the truth of the <i>Kingdom</i> was taken up from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, and the remarks that follow arise out of that and the subsequent readings at other places.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom is, so to speak, a moral necessity, man being what he is, if God is to have to say to him, Until a soul has come under the moral sway of God -- having learnt Him as a Saviour God -- so that it is established in grace, it is difficult if not impossible for one to enter into the calling and purpose of God for him.<a name=4:2></a> The kingdom was here in a sense when Christ was on earth, but it was really established when He took His place at the right hand of God and all things were put under Him.<a name=4:3></a> He that owns Jesus as Lord comes under the moral sway of grace.<a name=4:4></a> He learns not only that there is a kingdom that cannot be moved, but that the power and security which belong to it are on his behalf.<a name=4:5></a> The Holy Spirit is here to maintain that kingdom, and does so now in spiritual power in the souls of believers.<a name=4:6></a> In a coming day the kingdom will be displayed publicly and everything that offends will be cast out of it.<a name=4:7></a> When a soul has received this kingdom as a little child, so that one is morally in it, he is in a condition to learn God's disposition towards him, as well as what He has done to meet his need.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This disposition comes out in the <i>new covenant</i>, and it might almost be <i>summed up in one word</i>, '<i>Love</i>', <i>which is the nature of God</i>.<a name=4:9></a> The blood sets it forth, and as we read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us".<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus far we are speaking of what is for man, but when we come to <i>reconciliation</i>, we come to <i>what God has wrought for Himself</i>, <i>and that brings in what is new</i>.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peace being made by the blood of His (Christ's) cross, in which the old man was entirely set aside, all
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that is suited to God can now be found in the new man, and only there.<a name=5:1></a> There is a new creation, and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=5:2></a> Where distance was before, there is now perfect complacency.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When this has been apprehended by the soul it learns that God's purpose for the believer is association with Christ.<a name=5:4></a> He is not merely seen as "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God", but is made to live (quickened) together with Christ, and this really brings us to <i>eternal life</i> -- life in association with Christ outside of and beyond the reach of death.<a name=5:5></a> It will be actually made good in "the world to come".<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such is the order in which these truths are presented to the believer, and in which sooner or later they have to be learned, but, whilst the light of them is for all, their experimental apprehension involves a surrender which all are not prepared to make.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards 'eternal life', difficulties have been caused in some minds by the assumption that because the word 'eternal' is used therefore the expression 'eternal life' is intended to describe a condition of existence before time began, and also a condition of existence when time has ceased to be.<a name=5:8></a> It has been applied to the life of divine Persons before revelation and incarnation, and almost universally to the life of believers in the Father's house and in the eternal state.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the Old Testament, as well as in many passages of the New Testament, it is quite clear that it refers to a condition of life on earth and not in heaven, and it is believed that it will be found on examination that the usual presentation of it in Scripture is in contrast with death, "the world to come" being the sphere of its display.<a name=5:10></a> One great feature of that world is that the power of death is set aside, either by resurrection or by the great change which will take place when "death is swallowed up in victory".<a name=5:11></a> It must not be forgotten that the heavenly saints of that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		day will enjoy their calling in its heavenly character, whilst earthly saints will enjoy eternal life in the place where death has been; christians now get it morally in the knowledge of the only true God (the Father) and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite a mistake to suppose that a believer loses anything by correcting any defective or erroneous use of terms.<a name=6:2></a> What the believer actually has now is the Spirit in him as a well of water springing up to eternal life.<a name=6:3></a> In "the world to come" he will be even as to his body in the scene of life eternal, but he loses the true meaning and present good of what God has been pleased to make known if he uses the term simply to mean eternal security or future existence in heaven.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was also pointed out that the presence of the Holy Spirit to maintain the kingdom here in power involves certain important consequences.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If God is here He must have a dwelling, and this introduces the house of God; but the presence of the Holy Spirit also involves the body, for "by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body"; and when we have learned spiritually to apprehend these truths we are prepared to understand and appreciate what Christ's assembly is.<a name=6:6></a> That it is and must be outside of the world system is quite clear, and therefore to enter into it in our souls as a practical reality it is necessary to have overcome the world.<a name=6:7></a> As this overcoming is presented in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>in such a way as to indicate its necessity if we are to enter upon eternal life, it is not difficult to understand the close connection between eternal life and the assembly.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Old Testament we find three great thoughts as to God: blessing, dwelling, and ruling.<a name=6:9></a> These thoughts are made good in christianity, but we get them in the inverse order.<a name=6:10></a> We come under His moral sway in the kingdom, we form His house, and then in the assembly we taste the blessing, "eternal life".<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another side of the truth was brought out at the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Indianapolis meeting in connection with '<i>the world to come</i>', <i>viz</i>, that God has a completely new system or order of things, and one which is wholly according to His own mind, established in connection with Christ risen from the dead and seated at His own right hand.<a name=7:1></a> Amongst the leading features of this new system we find a mercy-seat from which God can speak, a throne of grace, the rule of man over all God's works, God's house, God's rest, the priest, the forerunner gone in, the better hope by which we draw nigh to God, the new covenant, perfect purgation and a sanctified company.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In "the world to come" all this will be displayed, but we have the light of it now, and if we walk in it we shall prove its practical effect in separating us from "this present evil world".<a name=7:3></a> The attractive power of the love of Him who is the centre of everything in it is that which draws the heart out of things here.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be well to add, in reference to the thought of 'salvation', an expression of frequent occurrence, that it does not appear to be ordinarily used in Scripture as meaning forgiveness of sins, or escape from God as a Judge, but rather in the sense of liberation from the power of the enemy, the setting free now from the power of sin and Satan those who had hitherto been led captive by him.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Deliverance', as we use it, would seem to apply more to the practical working out of this salvation in the details of life.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In concluding these remarks, it may be added that on looking back at what came out at the different meetings there is evidence of a gradual progress which was hardly noticed as they went on, and the spirit of liberty and hearty fellowship which characterised them was a cause of great thankfulness.<a name=7:7></a><p>J.<a name=7:8></a>S.<a name=7:9></a>A.<a name=7:10></a>

		I have read this passage because it is a turning point in the truth of this particular gospel.<a name=8:4></a> The passage indicates what was at that moment extremely important; <i>viz</i>.<a name=8:5></a>, the transition from law to grace.<a name=8:6></a> The change which was coming in was from Judaism to christianity.<a name=8:7></a> It is in that sense that the name of the Father is brought in.<a name=8:8></a> The Lord speaks of all things being delivered to Him of His Father and that no man knoweth who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him, and that is an indication of the great change which was coming in.<a name=8:9></a>

		The law was inefficacious to help man and it did not content God because it was inefficient.<a name=8:10></a> The priest and the Levite passed by on the other side.<a name=8:11></a> Though the law might be perfect in itself, it did not suit God because it did not benefit man.<a name=8:12></a> The law had to give way for the kingdom.<a name=8:13></a> The kingdom was coming in in connection with the Lord Jesus, who was the expression of the grace of God.<a name=8:14></a> We read elsewhere the law was given by Moses; grace and truth are come to pass by Jesus Christ.<a name=8:15></a> He was the blessed expression of the grace of God.<a name=8:16></a> The rule of grace was on the point of coming in; it is that transition to which I refer; and I desire to take up two or three points in connection with the parable of the good Samaritan, and then to pass on to the incidents by which it is followed.<a name=8:17></a> If you take the whole passage, it shows how Christ has been pleased to become the servant of man.<a name=8:18></a> He is the neighbour, and afterwards the revealer; and

		then in the beginning of chapter 11 He is the teacher.<a name=9:1></a> I think all that comes out in a striking way.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I call your attention to a verse or two that precede the parable -- chapter 10, verses 22 and 24.<a name=9:3></a> It is certain that the moment was remarkable, and this is indicated by the Lord in saying, "many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them".<a name=9:4></a> I think He refers to the kingdom.<a name=9:5></a> Prophets and kings had looked forward to the kingdom; they were taught to; it was the burden of the Old Testament.<a name=9:6></a> What I understand by the kingdom is a power here for man, that can subjugate all the power of evil.<a name=9:7></a> That is what came to light in the Person of the Lord Jesus.<a name=9:8></a> There was a power acting in grace in man's favour that was superior to all the evil that was here.<a name=9:9></a> There was no expression of evil upon earth that could stand before the presence of Christ.<a name=9:10></a> He began by binding the strong man, and set to work to spoil his goods.<a name=9:11></a> That is what Christ was doing here on earth.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is beautifully put by the apostle Peter in the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles: "who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him".<a name=9:13></a> There was a power here superior to the power of evil, and acting in grace for man.<a name=9:14></a> That was the beginning of the kingdom.<a name=9:15></a> It has come out now in a much greater way by the Lord Jesus having gone to the right hand of God, and the Holy Spirit being here; but there was the beginning of the kingdom.<a name=9:16></a> The Pharisees came to the Lord and asked Him when the kingdom of God should come; and He replied the kingdom of God does not come with observation, but is among you.<a name=9:17></a> It was there in their midst.<a name=9:18></a> He was the expression of it in power and grace.<a name=9:19></a> The Lord referred to that in what He spoke here to the disciples.<a name=9:20></a> I do not suppose that the eyes of many were opened to understand

	<div class="paragraph">
		the character of the moment, and yet He said to them, "Blessed are your eyes".<a name=10:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there follows the parable of the good Samaritan.<a name=10:2></a> I will say one word about parables which it is important to remember.<a name=10:3></a> A parable serves often to hide the truth from the uninstructed.<a name=10:4></a> I think you have to bear that in mind, and you could not understand a parable if you have not someone to explain it.<a name=10:5></a> The Lord says, "Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand".<a name=10:6></a> He did not speak parables to make the truth plain, but in a sense to hide it.<a name=10:7></a> But then He explains the parables to His disciples.<a name=10:8></a> If there were any who had ears to hear, or eyes to see, the Lord became the expounder.<a name=10:9></a> Now we have the Holy Spirit to expound to us the parables of the Lord.<a name=10:10></a> I ask you, do you think you would be able to understand the parable of the good Samaritan without an expositor?<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will bring before you one point in the parable which illustrates the service of the Lord Jesus.<a name=10:12></a> The parable is spoken in answer to a question as to man's neighbour.<a name=10:13></a> The questioner was a lawyer who stood up to tempt Christ.<a name=10:14></a> It was not the case of a person genuinely inquiring after the truth, and the Lord answered him in a parable.<a name=10:15></a> The truth was there, but the truth was veiled.<a name=10:16></a> If the Lord was questioned as to who was man's neighbour, there was but one answer for Christ to give, for He Himself was man's neighbour.<a name=10:17></a> He might hide this truth in a parable, but there was no other answer possible when He was present here on earth.<a name=10:18></a> The priests and Levites were not men's neighbour.<a name=10:19></a> They could not benefit man.<a name=10:20></a> Priest and Levite passed by on the other side.<a name=10:21></a> They could not act the neighbour in relieving the man that needed.<a name=10:22></a> That is what made me say at the beginning that the passage teaches the transition from law to grace.<a name=10:23></a> Man here on earth cannot be helped but by the ministry
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of grace.<a name=11:1></a> The ministry of law is no power to raise up man.<a name=11:2></a> The priests and Levites were ineffective, and God was not content with them because they were ineffective.<a name=11:3></a> What marks this moment is "the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men".<a name=11:4></a> The truth comes out here in connection with man's neighbour.<a name=11:5></a> I have no doubt that in the parable of the good Samaritan we have the presentation of the grace of God in Christ.<a name=11:6></a> He was the expression and exponent of the grace of God, and hence is man's true neighbour.<a name=11:7></a> He is exactly what man needs; He came close to man, not in the way of judgment, but for man's deliverance, in order that he might be set free from that which oppressed him.<a name=11:8></a> Man was oppressed by the power of evil, the world and the devil, and grace has come to him to deliver him from the oppression.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up two or three points in connection with the neighbour.<a name=11:10></a> There were three things which he did for the man that fell among thieves; first he relieved him, he came to him pouring in oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast, he provided support for him; and finally brought him to an inn and took care of him.<a name=11:11></a> He cared for him all the time the man needed care.<a name=11:12></a> The thought of an inn is connected with journeying; an inn is not a place where people live, where a man is at home, but where he sojourns on a journey.<a name=11:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dwell on these things because we have in them a beautiful expression of the grace of God.<a name=11:14></a> It is wonderful to see how complete the grace of God is in regard to man; God relieves, and carries and cares for those who are relieved.<a name=11:15></a> The great relief that God gives to man is salvation; not only is man relieved from the fear of judgment, but God delivers him from the bondage in which he is held.<a name=11:16></a> If I were to picture the condition of man, he has certainly fallen among thieves, he is stripped of his innocence, of that which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		he had at the hand of God, and left half dead, at all events in regard of God.<a name=12:1></a> On the other hand, God has come in to emancipate man from the power of evil.<a name=12:2></a> The grace of God takes account of man as in bondage, and has come in to give deliverance to the soul of man, that he may be like a bird delivered out of the snare of the fowler.<a name=12:3></a> It is the grace of God that brings salvation to men that has appeared.<a name=12:4></a> Go wherever you will on the face of the earth, you will find men's souls in bondage; they are in bondage to lust and Satan, and are kept away by them from God.<a name=12:5></a> It was true of the Jew and of the heathen.<a name=12:6></a> When the Lord came into the world the Jew was in bondage; they were the servants of sin; the poor heathen were in idolatry; and the grace of God came in to deliver them.<a name=12:7></a> If I look at professing christians today, they are in bondage to formality and sacramentalism, to the prince of this world; and the grace of God has come in to give them salvation, that they may have to say to God; that there may be in them the well of water springing up to everlasting life.<a name=12:8></a> Would to God that everybody here was set free.<a name=12:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But supposing a person is set free; grace does another thing; it carries him; provides support.<a name=12:10></a> The believer is not under law, but under grace.<a name=12:11></a> Support is found.<a name=12:12></a> I have no doubt the power is the Holy Spirit.<a name=12:13></a> The soul is emancipated, and the Holy Spirit is given that the one who has been relieved may be carried by the power of God.<a name=12:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he is taken care of; Christ has provided for that; there is care for the saints down here; fellowship and support and encouragement.<a name=12:15></a> The soul is taken care of all the time it is here.<a name=12:16></a>

		The fact is that most of us are unwilling to have our own props knocked away.<a name=13:2></a> Many lean on society and formalism and other things, and God comes in in His blessed grace to knock away these props.<a name=13:3></a> It is a great moment when you come to this -- I have Christ to care for me, and I want no other care.<a name=13:4></a> "He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them".<a name=13:5></a> It is a joy to be cared for by Christ; He is not too great to care for me.<a name=13:6></a> Christ has put Himself, as it were, at the service of man, come where he was to furnish him with everything so long as he needs care.<a name=13:7></a> The apostle Paul proved the care of Christ; there were many critical moments in his path, and at every critical moment the Lord appeared to him; and at the end of his career, he can say, "the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion", He had to say all forsook him, but the Lord stood by him.<a name=13:8></a> In what I have said so far, we have only had the beginning of christianity; the service of the high priest is the beginning of christianity, not the end.<a name=13:9></a> "We have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=13:10></a> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need", That is the beginning of our christianity.<a name=13:11></a> If you study the epistle to the Hebrews, you will find that the point is, so far, that you may hold fast the profession.<a name=13:12></a>

		Now there is one point more, which comes out in the beginning of the next chapter: Christ is not revealing here; He is teaching, "Lord, teach us to pray".<a name=15:4></a> You could not be taught how to pray unless He had revealed the Father.<a name=15:5></a> It is because the Father has been made known to you that you pray to the Father.<a name=15:6></a> He teaches you to pray to the Father.<a name=15:7></a> How do you cry Abba Father but by the Spirit of God's Son?<a name=15:8></a> It is the same One who has made known the Father's love and counsel that teaches you to pray "Abba, Father".<a name=15:9></a> Christ leads us by the Spirit to address ourselves to the Father, in all confidence that the Father is good, and that we will be heard, and that we will have the petitions that we desire.<a name=15:10></a> "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him".<a name=15:11></a> Of course the Spirit has been given now, but my point is that in regard to prayer Christ is the teacher; "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father".<a name=15:12></a> The Lord Jesus taught the disciples that the Father Himself loved them because they had loved Him and had believed that He came out from God.<a name=15:13></a> The great point of the Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>was to encourage the disciples to address themselves in His name to the Father, and they would surely be heard.<a name=15:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The impression I want to leave upon you is of the complete service of Christ.<a name=15:15></a> Christ has touched us and He does not cease to touch us.<a name=15:16></a> It is that He may gain our attention, and having done that, He teaches us how to demean ourselves in regard to the Father.<a name=15:17></a> May God grant we may know Him a little better as neighbour, revealer, and teacher.<a name=15:18></a>

		The children of Israel walked in the wilderness forty years, and in the book of Deuteronomy you see the Spirit of God moralising upon it.<a name=17:3></a> He proved them, to know all that was in their heart, that He might do them good in their latter end.<a name=17:4></a> The contrariety of the flesh comes out.<a name=17:5></a> In the first sixteen chapters of the book of Numbers you find the different ways in which the perverseness of the flesh manifested itself.<a name=17:6></a> The very character of the book shows the divine nature of Scripture.<a name=17:7></a> God had a people in the wilderness; they had God's care, daily provision for their need, manna from heaven, water from the rock; but in spite of that the terrible perverseness of the flesh came out, and I think God intended it should come out.<a name=17:8></a> The answer to it on the part of God was the brazen serpent, in chapter 21.<a name=17:9></a> The flesh was proved incorrigible, and there was nothing except for it to be condemned, which took place typically in the brazen serpent, in order that God might give the Spirit.<a name=17:10></a> The man that trusts his own heart is a fool.<a name=17:11></a> They that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=17:12></a> There is nothing for us now but the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit lusts against the flesh.<a name=17:13></a> They are irreconcilable.<a name=17:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things which God has provided for His people in the wilderness.<a name=17:15></a> I do not speak now of the manna, and the water from the smitten rock, but of the help which God has been pleased to provide for His people in the wilderness, that we may be carried through it.<a name=17:16></a> The object of God's provision is that we may hold fast our profession, or, in other words, as the Lord said to Peter, "that thy faith fail not".<a name=17:17></a> The two things to which I refer are priesthood and the water of purification.<a name=17:18></a> Priesthood comes out in chapter 17, and the water of purification in chapter 19, and God has provided both.<a name=17:19></a> Israel had them in type, for they had Aaron, who was the type of

	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been pleased in His grace to provide for us priesthood; He is able to save unto the uttermost those who come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.<a name=18:2></a> And not only priesthood, but the water of purification, that we may be maintained in separation from the influences of sin and the world.<a name=18:3></a> The object of God is to keep us in consistency with the death of Christ, and the water of purification comes in to that end.<a name=18:4></a> To start with, we are baptised to the death of Christ, and in the wilderness we have to be maintained in the truth of that death.<a name=18:5></a> We never ought to be inconsistent with His death.<a name=18:6></a> The Lord's supper is the fellowship of His death, and I think we are maintained by the water of separation in consistency with the death of Christ.<a name=18:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a word in regard to priests.<a name=18:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16:47">Numbers  16:47</a>, 48 it says, "And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation, and behold the plague was begun among the people, and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people; and he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stayed".<a name=18:9></a> I read that passage for the statement, "he stood between the dead and the living".<a name=18:10></a> Before referring to that, I want to say a little as to the distinction between the priest and the mediator.<a name=18:11></a> Moses in the economy of Israel was mediator, and Aaron was priest; that is, the two offices were distinct.<a name=18:12></a> Moses was mediator, because he made known to Israel all the mind of God.<a name=18:13></a> Aaron was priest, for he represented the people before God; that is a simple distinction to apprehend.<a name=18:14></a> You will find that distinction maintained through the early books of the Old Testament.<a name=18:15></a> God spoke to Moses from off the mercy-seat for the children of Israel, and, on the other hand, Aaron was the representative of the people in the presence of God; hence
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=19>[Page 19]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Aaron had to stand between the dead and the living.<a name=19:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in christianity, which is the anti-type, you have a contrast to this; for the mediator and the priest are combined in the one Person.<a name=19:2></a> Christ is mediator and priest.<a name=19:3></a> Still the same fundamental difference remains.<a name=19:4></a> The mediator is the one in whom God has been pleased to communicate His mind.<a name=19:5></a> The priest, on the other hand, is on behalf of the people that are in relation with God.<a name=19:6></a> You have to keep that distinction in view, or you cannot understand the distinction.<a name=19:7></a> The living and the dead are distinguished by the priest.<a name=19:8></a> On the other hand, there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all.<a name=19:9></a> When Christ died the mind of God was expressed toward all.<a name=19:10></a> His death took place in the presence of men, both gentile and Jew; every kind of man was there, and the expression of God's mind in the mediator is that God would have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.<a name=19:11></a> The most wonderful testimony ever given was the death of Christ.<a name=19:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christ is also priest, and though we can speak of Him on the cross as mediator, we can never speak of His being priest until resurrection.<a name=19:13></a> Until resurrection death lay before Him.<a name=19:14></a> He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that He by the grace of God should taste death for everything.<a name=19:15></a> He could not take priesthood therefore until resurrection, for He is priest after the power of an endless life, and that came to pass in resurrection.<a name=19:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that will show you the difference between the mediator and the priest, and how it is that the priest stands between the dead and the living.<a name=19:17></a> Christ did not become priest until He went to the right hand of God.<a name=19:18></a> You see that in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>.<a name=19:19></a> It is said, "Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool", and then it is added, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=19:20></a> On

		the cross He was victim, but He is now exalted to God's right hand, and there it is He is spoken of as priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=20:1></a> The type of resurrection, of life out of death, is found in chapter 17, in the budding of Aaron's rod.<a name=20:2></a> The token of priesthood was in the rod that budded; that man whose rod budded was chosen priest.<a name=20:3></a> Aaron's rod budded, brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds.<a name=20:4></a> It was the manifestation of the power of life in a dry rod.<a name=20:5></a> It is remarkable to see the truth of that coming out so early.<a name=20:6></a> Redemption had to be accomplished before you could get priesthood, for priesthood is established on the basis of righteousness.<a name=20:7></a> Priesthood belongs to a people which stand in relationship with God.<a name=20:8></a> We could have no place before God except on the ground of righteousness; we must be justified or there would be no place for us except judgment.<a name=20:9></a> We are justified freely by God's grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; redemption must come in before priesthood, hence priesthood must of necessity be in resurrection.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will turn to a passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:15">Hebrews  7:15</a>-17, which will confirm this.<a name=20:11></a> The endless life in man was to come out in resurrection.<a name=20:12></a> "Thou gavest him length of days for ever".<a name=20:13></a> In verse 24, it says, "this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood".<a name=20:14></a> That is proof that He could not be priest before He died.<a name=20:15></a> There is no break in the continuity of the priest.<a name=20:16></a> The work of offering being done, He is made priest.<a name=20:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He stands now between the living and the dead.<a name=20:18></a> The priest, not the mediator, is the test of men; the appropriation of the priest is the test of life.<a name=20:19></a> If you could find out the people in the world who appropriate the priest, then you have got the living.<a name=20:20></a> "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=20:21></a> Eating is the sign as well as the support of life.<a name=20:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord said to Peter (not that He was priest then), "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not", I think that in principle priesthood was coming out.<a name=21:13></a> Not in a formal way, but the idea was there.<a name=21:14></a> When Peter had denied Christ the danger was that he should give up faith.<a name=21:15></a> Now intercession had come in that his faith should not fail.<a name=21:16></a> After his fall he weeps bitterly, and that was the fruit of the intercession of Christ.<a name=21:17></a> I think the service of Christ goes on a point still further with regard to Peter, namely, to his complete restoration.<a name=21:18></a> It has been said that Peter was restored in conscience before he was restored in heart.<a name=21:19></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>the Lord deals with Peter until he is restored completely, that is, until the bottom of the matter had been reached with him, The Lord challenged Peter as often as Peter had denied Him.<a name=21:20></a> I

		As I have said, the priest stands between the living and the dead; and the proof of life is the appropriation and appreciation of Christ.<a name=22:7></a> And if you fail of that, there is very little sign of life in you.<a name=22:8></a> Professing christians do not trouble about the priest; they are sufficient in themselves without the priest.<a name=22:9></a> They think perhaps that they can support themselves in difficult circumstances.<a name=22:10></a> It is a mistake.<a name=22:11></a> In coming to the priest you get sympathy and succour.<a name=22:12></a> The practical effect is that you come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=22:13></a> The priest is, I judge, connected with the kingdom; the kingdom is maintained for us effectively by the priest, in that the throne of grace is ever available for the saints; that is the truth as to the priest.<a name=22:14></a>

		F.E.<a name=27:27></a>R.<a name=27:28></a> The kingdom is that sway of God which has to be established in the soul of every man; if God is to have to say to man otherwise than in judgment, the kingdom of God must be established in man.<a name=27:29></a> Every christian must know the kingdom in himself.<a name=27:30></a>

		I want to bring before you what I judge was hidden in the mind of the Spirit; it is that which is important to get at in these scriptural expressions.<a name=78:7></a> I do not judge the Spirit of God was taken up simply with the material heavens.<a name=78:8></a> The <i>psalmist</i> surveyed the heavens, and saw a testimony there to the glory of God; for wherever he looked upon earth there was confusion through sin; but in the heavens the work of God was above all confusion; and there was another thing, that God had set in them a tabernacle for the sun, and the sun never varied or swerved from its appointed course; at the same time there was nothing hid from the heat of it.<a name=78:9></a> But the material things which the psalmist observed were not the limit of what was in the mind of the Spirit; the Spirit had other thoughts not yet revealed, and we can tell now without much difficulty what the Spirit of God had in view.<a name=78:10></a>

		The first thing in detail is that you yield your body a living sacrifice.<a name=82:5></a> It is the one thing recognised as in the disposal of the christian.<a name=82:6></a> In the mind of God the old man is crucified with Christ.<a name=82:7></a> All that a man is morally, as a man, is gone for God in the death of Christ.<a name=82:8></a> The thing of which God yet takes account is the body, and for the reason that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, it is that which you have to present to God, and it is presented a living sacrifice; you recognise that the time past has sufficed for the doing of your own will, and now you are to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<a name=82:9></a> It is a comfort to know that that will has been perfectly set forth here upon earth.<a name=82:10></a> We are not called to walk in an untrodden path; the will of God has been perfectly set forth in Christ; He could say 'I have glorified Thee on the earth, I have finished the work that Thou gavest Me to do'.<a name=82:11></a> In the path of Christ the christian is called to walk.<a name=82:12></a> The first thing is that your own will is set aside; it is will that distinguishes each one of us.<a name=82:13></a> Your will is not mine, and mine is not yours.<a name=82:14></a> but every christian's will is gone.<a name=82:15></a> Our old man is crucified with Christ, so that we are to have no will.<a name=82:16></a> The body is to be yielded up as a sacrifice to God.<a name=82:17></a> Hence you have to consider what you do with your body.<a name=82:18></a> If you had the sense that your body was devoted to Christ, you would be careful how you used it.<a name=82:19></a> You would not care to adorn it on the one hand, nor would you be careless about it on the other.<a name=82:20></a> If you neglect

		I have no doubt that your true measure is the light of God in you; whatever may be the measure of your faith, that is your power for God.<a name=83:7></a> The measure of Abraham was his faith, so too I might go on to speak of Moses and many another.<a name=83:8></a> It is of little moment to God whether a man is great in the world or a beggar.<a name=83:9></a> The fact is that the poor in this world are rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom; on the other hand, a man rich in this world may be poor in faith.<a name=83:10></a> The true measure of every one will come to light some day; those who are rich in faith will then be vindicated.<a name=83:11></a> It is a great thing to take account of this.<a name=83:12></a> According to the measure of faith you have to walk soberly down here, giving up all high thoughts of yourself, if you want to be at all useful for God.<a name=83:13></a> I do not care to think of myself above the light which God has been pleased to give me.<a name=83:14></a> Practically nothing can be more important than to maintain that the walk of a christian is to be governed by his faith, that is, that he should not go beyond his faith.<a name=83:15></a> You will never do anything easily except as the fruit of faith.<a name=83:16></a> Many have gone on, as it were, goaded by conscience, but that is not faith.<a name=83:17></a> A man is truly great as he enters into the will of God.<a name=83:18></a> He appreciates the law of God.<a name=83:19></a> The revelation of His

		Now the first thing that we have to recognise in connection with faith is that we are members of one body; though many, we are members one of another; and in connection with the one body each one has an appointed function; that must be the case with every member of the body.<a name=84:4></a> My hand has not the least doubt of its function in regard to the body.<a name=84:5></a> So, too, I might speak of any member of the body; if a member of the body is unable to fulfil its function, that member is paralysed, but in a healthy condition every member of the body naturally fulfils its own proper function in the body, and does not in any way interfere with any other member.<a name=84:6></a> Every member subserves the body.<a name=84:7></a> We have to recognise that we are all one body in Christ, members one of another.<a name=84:8></a> Hence your first obligation is not to father, mother, husband, or wife, but as in the body of Christ.<a name=84:9></a> Your first obligation is the will of God, and has reference to the place that He has given to you in the body of Christ.<a name=84:10></a> Saints sometimes put the natural obligations before the spiritual, and it does not answer.<a name=84:11></a> If you put the spiritual obligation first, God will help you in regard to the natural.<a name=84:12></a> It is not God's will for the christian to go on in a path of isolation; that is a point to be recognised, and the exhortations here are to this end, that you shall carry out your obligation in the body in the best way possible.<a name=84:13></a> So he that ministereth is to wait on his ministry; he that teacheth, on teaching; he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth, with simplicity.<a name=84:14></a> It often happens that while christians do a right thing they spoil it in the doing of it.<a name=84:15></a> The point is to do the right thing in the best way; and I venture to urge that each one of us has an obligation to one another.<a name=84:16></a> We are not all teachers or exhorters, but each one may give with simplicity, or perhaps show

		Whatever function has been assigned to you in the body, be content to carry it out in simplicity, in the best way possible by the Spirit of God.<a name=85:4></a> That is what it is to be here for the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<a name=85:5></a> We may try and do great things when perhaps God has intended us to do small things.<a name=85:6></a> To be here for the will of God, and do small things in the best way is far safer and happier than trying to do great things so as to be conspicuous.<a name=85:7></a> No member of the human body claims supremacy; every member of the body fulfils its own function, and the same things should mark the saints.<a name=85:8></a>

		Now there is just a word more in regard to the latter part of the chapter.<a name=85:9></a> A mere moralist could hardly fail to admit the perfectness of the passage; I mean as a rule of life for men down here; you get guides and guards.<a name=85:10></a> It involves that you have your senses in measure exercised to discern between good and evil; and that is what God intends to have in the christian.<a name=85:11></a> We are brought under the influence of Christ, and to the knowledge of God, in order that we may get a right conception of good and evil, so as to abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.<a name=85:12></a> In the world there is a great mixing up of good and evil; there are traces of good which is of God; on the other hand, there is a fearful power of evil.<a name=85:13></a> God has set to work to disentangle, and that work has been done in degree in the christian.<a name=85:14></a> His senses are exercised to discern between good and evil.<a name=85:15></a> We have a sense of what is good because the light of God is in the heart; on the other hand, we get a perception of what is evil, and have to refuse the evil and cleave to the good.<a name=85:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=86>[Page 86]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One point more is that we are not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.<a name=86:1></a> We get a perception of good and evil, and power is there, so that instead of being overcome of evil we overcome evil with good.<a name=86:2></a> There never was a person in the world who had not pleasure in being an overcomer, the trial is in being overcome.<a name=86:3></a> When your soul is so acquainted with good that instead of being overcome, you overcome, there is really happiness and satisfaction; and that is the effect of walking in the light of the sun.<a name=86:4></a> We have our sun in heaven; Christ, who presents to us all the goodness of God.<a name=86:5></a> I could not say I am good, but I can say that my soul has become acquainted with good.<a name=86:6></a> I have seen the superiority of good to evil in the cross; all was disentangled there.<a name=86:7></a> Now the soul of the christian is instructed in the goodness of God, and in the presence of goodness he learns what evil is.<a name=86:8></a> And we find power to overcome evil.<a name=86:9></a> So that if one has to do with an enemy he heaps coals of fire on his head.<a name=86:10></a> I do not try to avenge myself; the path is to break a man down by overcoming evil with good.<a name=86:11></a> if vengeance has to be exercised, that is the Lord's part, and not mine.<a name=86:12></a> I can only say that if you walk thus in the light of divine goodness down here, you may depend upon it, your path will be greatly simplified.<a name=86:13></a> It is a great thing to be able to walk in that light, to be able to look up to heaven and say, "The heavens declare the glory of God" and "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun".<a name=86:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I repeat what I observed at the outset, that grace is commensurate with glory, for both grace and glory have their foundation in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, so that we are not at all afraid of glory because conscious that grace is commensurate with it.<a name=86:15></a> Now we are to walk in the power of grace down here; in self-judgment; and in dealing with others to seek to carry out our function in the body, and, as a general principle, to overcome evil with good.<a name=86:16></a>

		There is an interest attaching to the four gospels which belongs to no other part of the Scriptures.<a name=88:4></a> It has been pointed out that there is a character about what is recorded in them which you cannot find elsewhere, and the reason is that you are brought in them into the presence of perfection.<a name=88:5></a> There is no other part of scripture that has quite that character.<a name=88:6></a> The greater part of scripture is occupied with the conduct of men, and God's consequent dealings, at the same time with the unfolding of the thought of God in regard to men; all that is taken account of more or less in the Old Testament; and when you come to the writings of the apostles you get the exercises of imperfect men; for after all the greatest apostles were imperfect men, and they make no secret of their own weakness.<a name=88:7></a> But in the gospels you are brought into the presence of divine perfectness, and that gives a character to the gospels which no other part of scripture can have.<a name=88:8></a>

		Now I desire to point out the contrast between what comes out in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>and in this chapter.<a name=90:5></a> The point in this chapter is evidently of God's approach to man; in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>God was bringing home to the people how impossible it was for them to approach Him.<a name=90:6></a> The two things are a striking contrast.<a name=90:7></a> That is, in Exodus we find God giving the strongest injunctions to Moses to prevent the people breaking through, showing how impossible it was for the people to approach God.<a name=90:8></a> I have no doubt that to approach God under those circumstances would have been death; death lay upon man as God's judgment, and God would not have man to approach Him when it was a question of man as such.<a name=90:9></a> It was not there a question of God and of His grace to man; it was God having to deal with man with the judgment of death still upon him, and therefore it was impossible for man to approach God, and yet God was going to speak in man's hearing.<a name=90:10></a>

		I desire to explain in a few words the reason of the contrast between the two passages before us; it is not one God speaking in one passage, and another in another; the same God who spoke on Sinai, spoke in Luke.<a name=91:11></a> The difference is this, that in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>He spoke on earth, and in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>He was, I think, speaking from heaven.<a name=91:12></a> He spoke in man's hearing in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>; He spoke as to what man ought to be, but He hardly spoke to man.<a name=91:13></a> But in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>it pleased God to speak to man as to what was in His mind towards man.<a name=91:14></a> It is the beginning of God's approach to man, God coming out of His place to make known His thought and mind toward man.<a name=91:15></a> You have a description of it doctrinally in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>, "there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all"; and the thought in connection with that is that God would have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.<a name=91:16></a>

		The fact is that it meant the approach of God to man in grace; God was approaching man in the Mediator, and as we have seen, every detail that comes out in the chapter points to the truth that Christ must die; that is, that in touching humanity He must give Himself a ransom for all.<a name=93:5></a> Nothing can be more solemn than for the Son of God to have become man, because having thus touched humanity it involved the deliverance of man; and to deliver man there was nothing for it but for Him to go into the death which rested upon man.<a name=93:6></a> All men were under death when Christ came into the world, and He was to give Himself a ransom for all.<a name=93:7></a> If the goodness of God toward man was to take effect, all depended on the Son of God tasting death for everything.<a name=93:8></a> He "was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, .<a name=93:9></a>.<a name=93:10></a>.<a name=93:11></a> that, he by the grace of God should taste death for every man".<a name=93:12></a> What could be the meaning of circumcision but the cutting off of Christ?<a name=93:13></a> Sin was to be condemned in the flesh in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, that God might impart to man the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=93:14></a> All that was involved in the birth of this Child to Mary.<a name=93:15></a> He was not born into the world that He might adorn the flesh, though flesh was adorned -- God was perfectly glorified in man on the earth.<a name=93:16></a> The Lord could say, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do".<a name=93:17></a> But the fact is He came into this scene that in death He might remove man sacrificially from

		Now I do not pursue the history of Abram further.<a name=104:4></a> It has often been noticed that he went down to Egypt and lost in a sense his usual pious life; he had neither tent nor altar in Egypt.<a name=104:5></a> I doubt if he was divinely guided to Egypt; he went there as a matter of prudence, for sustenance.<a name=104:6></a> His profession, to that extent, was obscured during his sojourn in Egypt.<a name=104:7></a>

		I come now to the call of God in regard to ourselves; and I ask you to turn to <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>, 16; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a> - 29, and <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a> - 7.<a name=104:8></a> The apostle is seeking, as I understand it, to save the Galatians from the bondage into which they were in danger of falling, bondage to legalism and the flesh, and he recalls them by bringing before them the call of God.<a name=104:9></a> He does not bring before them the first principles of the gospel, but shows them the way in which gentiles are brought into the line of Abraham; for, as we have seen, Abraham was the first of the line of the call of God, and the object of the apostle is to show them that the call of God was intended to bring them into the line of Abraham.<a name=104:10></a> He does not bring before them the establishment of the kingdom, the Lord Jesus at the right hand of God, the grace of God and forgiveness of sins, and salvation; he does not go back to the elements.<a name=104:11></a> I suppose they had received the elements of the gospel.<a name=104:12></a> There had been given to them, no doubt, a full testimony of the grace of God, and they had received further the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=104:13></a> Now the strange thing was that, having received the gift of the Holy Spirit, they were desiring to go to law

		and circumcision, and the apostle seeks to recover them by presenting to them the call of God.<a name=105:1></a> The important feature of the gospel is that in it is hid the call of God; God's part is to call, our part is to answer to His call.<a name=105:2></a> God is content with nothing short of that; that we should hear and respond to His call.<a name=105:3></a> God is not content with our being saved from the fear of judgment to come; that is not exactly the call of God.<a name=105:4></a> God presents the glad tidings of forgiveness of sins to all, but that is not God's purpose; it is in the line of His grace, but it is hardly His call, or the purpose of it.<a name=105:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the beginning of this epistle, the apostle comes at once to the call of God.<a name=105:6></a> "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen" -- that indicates the call of God.<a name=105:7></a> It was God expressing His love in His Son in order that souls might be brought into sonship.<a name=105:8></a> It is not the glad tidings of the grace of God or the kingdom, but what lies at the back of all, the presentation of God's love, in order that we might be brought in the sense of God's love to the reality of sonship.<a name=105:9></a> It is of all moment to apprehend the call of God in that light.<a name=105:10></a> You get the thought of it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=105:11></a> The call of God comes out especially by the apostle Paul, God revealed His Son in him to that end.<a name=105:12></a> And the apostle, in chapter 3, says, "ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=105:13></a> He speaks of that into which the call of God had brought them.<a name=105:14></a> And in the next chapter the same truth is brought out.<a name=105:15></a> "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons" -- that is the call of God.<a name=105:16></a> Not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the tendency to defection and departure on the part of the Galatians, it is striking to see how the Spirit of God set to work to recall them.<a name=106:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It might have been argued to them by false teachers that if circumcised they would come into connection with Abraham; but that was not the divine way; this is, that, being affected by the love presented in the sending forth of God's Son, they came into sonship, and if so they were Christ's, and thus Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.<a name=106:4></a> Gentiles could not be the seed of Abraham after the flesh, circumcision would not make them that; they are the seed of Abraham by being Christ's.<a name=106:5></a> If you are Christ's, you are inseparable from Christ, and so Abraham's seed.<a name=106:6></a> To be Christ's is to be united to Him, and he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<a name=106:7></a> The apostle's object was to show the Galatians that God had His own way of bringing the gentiles into the line of Abraham, and this was by their answering to the call of God.<a name=106:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Tendency to defection proves that saints are not affected by the love of God.<a name=106:9></a> If they were, there would not be defection.<a name=106:10></a> The love of God is better than anything you can get in this world.<a name=106:11></a> I would rather be the subject of the love of God than have all that the world can offer.<a name=106:12></a> God's love can do far better for me than all the wealth of the world, for if I had this I am still under death, and must leave all when I leave the world.<a name=106:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Galatians were in fact allowing a great deal that was contrary to the Spirit of God, biting and devouring one another.<a name=106:14></a> They were giving licence to the flesh, and hence the apostle had to say to them that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as we have seen, in entering into the call of God you come into the line of promise.<a name=107:3></a> The grace of God brings us into the wilderness; the love of God brought Israel into the land.<a name=107:4></a> It does the same for us, that is, into sonship.<a name=107:5></a> Sonship belongs to the land of promise; things are complex with the christian, for while actually in the wilderness he is in spirit in the land of promise.<a name=107:6></a> The call of God refers to the land of God's promise, that is, of His purpose.<a name=107:7></a> As a matter of fact, we are in the wilderness during the whole of our sojourn in this world.<a name=107:8></a> The wilderness is where God disciplines us, and it is there we have a tent and an altar.<a name=107:9></a> But we are in the land of promise, and the Canaanite is not in power.<a name=107:10></a> And further, there is no famine there; that is as true to us as it was to the children of Israel; it was not true to Abraham.<a name=107:11></a> When he came into the land the Canaanite was there.<a name=107:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a> - 13, the point is that Christ has led captivity captive; He has ascended far above all heavens to fill all things; and having gone there we have a pledge of the overthrow of all evil power.<a name=107:13></a> He is the Head of all principality and power.<a name=107:14></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, "But now we see not yet all things put under him.<a name=107:15></a> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man".<a name=107:16></a> The power is taken out of the hand of the enemy, Christ is ascended that He might fill all things; that is the meaning of His ascension.<a name=107:17></a> The Canaanite is no longer in power.<a name=107:18></a> The Lord said as to Satan, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven".<a name=107:19></a> Christ is superior to Satan; He will bruise Satan under our feet shortly.<a name=107:20></a> There is nothing that can compare with

		There is a great deal contained in the passage I have read; more than is perhaps seen at first glance.<a name=139:4></a> It takes up many thoughts, and in what I understand to be the line of the teaching of the Spirit of God.<a name=139:5></a> I do not know anything of much more importance than to apprehend that the Spirit of God has a line of teaching, and is never deflected from that line.<a name=139:6></a> He keeps to it; we do not keep to it.<a name=139:7></a> We learn in a very disjointed and miscellaneous fashion.<a name=139:8></a> We get a little bit here and there in divine things, but that is not the line of the Spirit of God; and, sooner or later, we have to be brought into the line of the Spirit's teaching.<a name=139:9></a> I do not think you will ever be intelligent in divine things until you are directed into the line of the teaching of the Spirit; and that line is invariable, the Spirit of God never departs from it.<a name=139:10></a> The reason of that is that it is a line that is morally necessary.<a name=139:11></a> Everything with God, or of God, is moral, and there is a certain line which is morally necessary, and the Spirit of God is certain to carry you in mind along that line.<a name=139:12></a>

		Now there are three or four things that I want to touch on, which follow each other successively, which you apprehend in the path of the Spirit.<a name=139:13></a> This is illustrated in the history of the children of Israel; God's dealings with them become a lesson book to us.<a name=139:14></a> It illustrates the truth, and we very often learn truth simply by means of illustration.<a name=139:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third, I take it, follows upon the covenant, and that is <i>reconciliation</i>.<a name=140:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And the final point that comes out is <i>eternal life</i> -- unto which grace reigns.<a name=140:4></a>

		The establishment of the kingdom of God has everlasting life as the end in view.<a name=140:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to make one point plain before I pass on, <i>viz</i>.<a name=140:7></a>, that almost every thought in the chapter has reference not to this world, but to the world to come.<a name=140:8></a> For faith the world to come is already in view.<a name=140:9></a> I understand how it is brought in.<a name=140:10></a> It is in the fact that Christ is seated at the right hand of God; and if faith apprehends the place which Christ has at the right hand of God, it gets an insight into the world to come.<a name=140:11></a>

		The world to come is not brought into manifestation, but for faith that world has already come in, in the exaltation of Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=140:12></a> I will point out in a moment how the passage I read refers to the world to come; but I want you to bear in mind that when I speak about the world to come, I do not speak exclusively of the future; I quite admit that the present world is going on, and that the world to come has not yet come into display; but in the exaltation of the Lord Jesus to the right hand of God, the world to come has already come to pass for faith.<a name=140:13></a> It is the argument in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=140:14></a> He says that God has not put the world to come under angels; and the world to come "of which we speak" was the subject of his testimony.<a name=140:15></a> But we do not yet see all things put under Jesus; that is what properly marks the world

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will tell you what marks the world to come.<a name=141:2></a> If you look at <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>for a moment; or perhaps I might refer to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, to make it more complete.<a name=141:3></a> In verses 6 - 9 It says, "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.<a name=141:4></a> I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.<a name=141:5></a> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<a name=141:6></a> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel".<a name=141:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you look at <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, we read, "O Lord (Jehovah) our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!<a name=141:8></a> who hast set thy glory above the heavens".<a name=141:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those passages give you a pretty clear conception of the world to come.<a name=141:10></a> The first thing that marks the world to come is, "Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion".<a name=141:11></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>begins with, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<a name=141:12></a> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us".<a name=141:13></a> And then it says, "Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion".<a name=141:14></a> That is, in spite of the raging of the powers of the world, God has accomplished His mind; He has set His King upon His holy hill of Zion.<a name=141:15></a> That is the first feature of the world to come.<a name=141:16></a>

		There are two orders of things running through Scripture, one connected with Jerusalem, and the other with Babylon.<a name=141:17></a> When Jerusalem has its place, then Babylon is broken to pieces.<a name=141:18></a> On the other hand, when Babylon is in the ascendant, Jerusalem is trodden under foot.<a name=141:19></a> When Jerusalem became captive, Babylon was in the ascendant.<a name=141:20></a> In the time to come, when God

		revives Jerusalem, then Babylon is broken to pieces.<a name=142:1></a> I dare say some would say, where is Babylon today?<a name=142:2></a> I have no doubt Babylon passed on in succession to Rome.<a name=142:3></a> First in the vision of Daniel is the Babylonian kingdom, then the Medo-Persian, then the Greek, and after that the Roman.<a name=142:4></a> The Roman exists today; the book of Revelation gives us much light on the book of Daniel.<a name=142:5></a> In the Revelation is brought out that in the time to come the Roman power will be revived; it will come to light under a new form, in a federation of the kingdoms of the Western world.<a name=142:6></a> Thus you get the last phase of Babylon -- and that will be broken to pieces at the coming of the Lord.<a name=142:7></a> That is, when God sees fit, in due time, to re-establish Jerusalem upon its own foundations, Babylon, which really means the glory of man, will be broken to pieces.<a name=142:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a great help to the understanding of Scripture.<a name=142:9></a> It has been said (pardon me for touching on prophecy for a moment) that Assyria is the enemy of Israel when Israel is owned, Babylon is the enemy of Israel when Israel is not owned; hence, when Babylon is in the ascendant, Jerusalem is trodden under foot, and when Jerusalem is in the ascendant, Babylon is trodden under foot.<a name=142:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, what we find is that in spite of the raging of the kings, "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion", Jerusalem is restored, and this in spite of the contrariety and rebelliousness of man.<a name=142:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find a further thought, "I will declare the decree".<a name=142:12></a> The King in Zion is declared to be the Son of God, and He asks of God, and God gives Him the heathen for His inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession.<a name=142:13></a> "Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel".<a name=142:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:26">Revelation  2:26</a>, 27, you read, "And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

		and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father".<a name=143:1></a> Now in that promise to the overcomer, it is certain that Christ takes up the language of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, and gives to the overcomer the authority which has been given to Him; for in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is a similar expression, "He shall break them with a rod of iron", and Christ adds, "even as I received of my Father".<a name=143:2></a> The authority is given to Christ in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, and He gives it to the overcomer in this verse in the Revelation.<a name=143:3></a> Further, in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:11">Revelation  19:11</a> - 15, it is said, "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him, .<a name=143:4></a>.<a name=143:5></a>.<a name=143:6></a> he shall rule them with a rod of iron".<a name=143:7></a> There again is a quotation from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, "He shall rule them with a rod of iron", that is, the nations.<a name=143:8></a> "And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS".<a name=143:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have referred to those two passages because they make perfectly evident that what we get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is prophetic, and refers to the kingdom; it does not refer to anything which has yet taken place, but to things which God will accomplish; that is, He will set His King upon His holy hill of Zion, and that King is declared to be the Son of God, who will rule the nations with a rod of iron and break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=143:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The application to the time to come is made evident by the passages I quoted from the Revelation.<a name=143:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>we get first an allusion to man as God created him; then an allusion to "the son of man".<a name=143:12></a> Man and the son of man are distinct individualities.<a name=143:13></a> Man was what God created at the beginning; the "son of man" cannot be that, because he is the <i>son</i> of man.<a name=143:14></a> The expression 'son of man' is, beyond all doubt, a reference to Christ, and the passage is applied to Christ in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=143:15></a> The Spirit of God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that Psalm has been fulfilled partially, but not completely; Jesus has been made a little lower than the angels; that part has been accomplished, and He is "crowned with glory and honour"; but, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>we read, "we see not yet all things put under him"; that has not yet come to pass.<a name=144:3></a> The psalm, like <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, looks on to the world to come.<a name=144:4></a> Therefore in regard to the world to come, you get three things.<a name=144:5></a> The first is, God's King set upon His holy hill of Zion; the second, He is declared to be the Son of God, who has the heathen for His inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession, and who will rule the nations with a rod of iron, and break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=144:6></a> Then the third, that He is the "Son of man", crowned with glory and honour, set over all the works of God's hands, and all things put under His feet.<a name=144:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I meant when I spoke about the world to come.<a name=144:8></a> I would like to make the point plain, because it is so important to apprehend the features of the world to come.<a name=144:9></a> We see Jerusalem revived and restored, God's King set upon His holy hill of Zion; Jerusalem become the centre and the light of the whole earth; the nations shepherded with a rod of iron, and their powers broken to pieces like a potter's vessel.<a name=144:10></a> That is what becomes of the nations, and, at the same time, the Son of man is crowned with glory and honour, and set over the works of God's hands.<a name=144:11></a> That is, instead of Satan having power and being the god and prince of this world, he is cast out, and all power and authority is centred in the Son of man, whom God has now set in heaven.<a name=144:12></a> Man, as God made him at first, was never set in heaven; he was set upon the earth; the Son of man has been set in heaven.<a name=144:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=145>[Page 145]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see Jesus crowned with glory and honour; He is set in heaven, and Satan and his hosts are to be cast out.<a name=145:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord foresaw this in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>, when He said, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven".<a name=145:2></a> That is prophetic.<a name=145:3></a> In the Revelation a conflict takes place between Satan and his angels, and Michael and his angels.<a name=145:4></a> The result of the conflict is that the devil and his angels are cast out, and we have a significant statement in regard to them, that "neither was their place found any more in heaven".<a name=145:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not want you to think, when I speak about the world to come, that I defer it to the future; I do not; I take it up in the light of the Hebrews, and there we are told that, though we do not yet see all things put under the Son of man, we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, and set over all the works of God's hands.<a name=145:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Faith has ever anticipated the world to come; but, in times gone by, before Christ was exalted and set at the right hand of God, you could not see the world to come.<a name=145:7></a> But faith ever had reference to the world to come, though it could not be seen until Jesus was, in the value of redemption, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=145:8></a> Now the apostle says we speak about the world to come.<a name=145:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My point is this: that every thought in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>and 5 has reference to the world to come.<a name=145:10></a> Look at chapter 4: 13: "For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith"; and verses 16 and 17: "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=146:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I put those two thoughts together; the promise that Abraham should be the heir of the world is connected in verse 17 with God, as "him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=146:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the time has not yet fully come for that; God has not come out yet as quickening the dead; quickening the dead does not mean simply to quicken souls; it means quickening of bodies, and this has not come to pass yet, save in Christ.<a name=146:3></a> The promise to Abraham is connected with God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were, and this has reference to the world to come.<a name=146:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To illustrate this for a moment: the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar was not connected with God who quickens the dead; it was connected with the Most High God who rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to the basest of men.<a name=146:5></a> God can allow a scourge of mankind like Napoleon to be raised up, the basest of men; He rules in the kingdom of men; and He gives the kingdom to whom He will.<a name=146:6></a> But the promise of Abraham that he should be the heir of the world, is not connected with God as ruling in the kingdoms of men, but with God as the One who quickens the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.<a name=146:7></a> Thus it is the world to come of which Abraham was the heir; he was not heir of this world; he never got a foot of inheritance in this world; God brought him to the promised land, but he possessed nothing but a burying place in it.<a name=146:8></a> He embraced the promises, as we are told, but he never received them; and therefore the promise that he should be the heir of the world must refer to the world to come.<a name=146:9></a> When God acts as quickener of the dead, Abraham will get his inheritance; he is the heir of the world.<a name=146:10></a> Hence it is plain that the whole passage refers, not to this world,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=147>[Page 147]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		but to the world of which Abraham is the heir, before God whom he believed, who quickens the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were.<a name=147:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to chapter 5: 2: We "rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=147:2></a> That is not connected with this world; there has been no display yet of God's glory; God has been glorified, but there has been no display of His glory yet.<a name=147:3></a> The glory of God will cover the earth; the display of His glory is connected with the world to come.<a name=147:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of the present world is Babylonish, and Babylon means the glory of man; it does not mean the glory of God at all.<a name=147:5></a> Everything in Babylon is for the glory of man.<a name=147:6></a> The world to come brings in the glory of God, and we rejoice in hope of that glory.<a name=147:7></a> Abraham rejoiced in hope of his inheritance; we rejoice in hope of the glory of God, when every promise of God will be brought to pass in Christ.<a name=147:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you will look at verse 9, we have: "Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<a name=147:9></a> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life".<a name=147:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that the wrath of God is not yet; it refers to what will usher in the world to come.<a name=147:11></a> Then in the next verse you have, being reconciled to God by the death of His Son, we shall be saved by His life.<a name=147:12></a> There is a long gap, in a sense, between the death of Christ and the life of Christ.<a name=147:13></a> The world was cognisant of the death of Christ; He suffered here; they were witnesses of His death, but His life has not come out yet.<a name=147:14></a> We shall be saved by His life; when that is manifest, then we shall be saved, but it has reference to that which is yet to come to light.<a name=147:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, take up the last verse: "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lord".<a name=148:1></a> What thoughtful person could say that grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life now?<a name=148:2></a> I do not think it does yet; I do not think that grace is manifestly set in the ascendant.<a name=148:3></a> It is "unto eternal life"; this is a divine thought and has reference to the world to come.<a name=148:4></a> I do not doubt that these thoughts depend for full effect upon the coming of the Lord.<a name=148:5></a> When the time appointed arrives, and the Lord comes, effect will be given to every one of the thoughts that you get brought out in this chapter.<a name=148:6></a> Abraham will get his inheritance in the world to come, the glory of God will be displayed, and there will have been wrath; but, at the same time, the love and grace of God will be brought into this world, and then grace will reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=148:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine thoughts that are presented to us in the word of God depend for their literal and actual fulfilment upon the coming of the Lord.<a name=148:8></a> Then God sets His king upon His holy hill of Zion; then He breaks the nations to pieces as a potter's vessel.<a name=148:9></a> It is then that all things are put under the feet of the Son of man, according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>; everything is fulfilled then.<a name=148:10></a> Then the kingdom is Jehovah's.<a name=148:11></a> You get not only David's kingdom, but Jehovah's kingdom.<a name=148:12></a> The kingdom will be Jehovah's; we read in the Revelation, "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever".<a name=148:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have brought out this to show that if you fail to read this chapter in the light of the world to come, you cannot get the force of these thoughts, or understand the application of the truth.<a name=148:14></a> The fact is that in christianity we anticipate the world to come.<a name=148:15></a> We see the world to come for one very simple reason, and that is that we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour.<a name=148:16></a> The condition of salvation is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved".<a name=148:17></a> "If

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have gone so far in order to show how the truth of this chapter is connected with the world to come and the kingdom.<a name=149:7></a> I want now to take up those various thoughts in their application to us, in order to show the good of the kingdom.<a name=149:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by the kingdom is something very simple; that is, the moral sway of God, and the moral sway of God must of necessity be in grace.<a name=149:9></a> It is grace acting in power.<a name=149:10></a> That is, supposing you allow that man is a sinner and sinful, the moral sway of God must, of necessity, be in grace; hence it is the reign of grace, not yet manifested, but apprehended by faith.<a name=149:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look at the kingdom of God in the present day, as to what it has become in the hands of man, it is a mustard tree, something conspicuous in the world.<a name=149:12></a> I am an Englishman, and live in England, and if I look at the kingdom of God I have to look to the Queen, who is not only Queen of the country, but head of the church; the kingdom of God as man has made it, is represented to me in the Queen of

		England, who professes to rule by the grace of God.<a name=150:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look at the kingdom of God from a moral point of view, it is represented to me in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God, who has introduced the sway of grace.<a name=150:2></a> "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved".<a name=150:3></a> I will tell you why it is the sway of grace; it is because there is forgiveness of sins in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=150:4></a> What is connected with the Lord Jesus is that God has been pleased to remit His claim upon man; repentance and forgiveness of sins are preached in the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=150:5></a> God has remitted His claim upon man that man may be delivered from the power of Satan.<a name=150:6></a> He has "delivered us from the authority of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:13">Colossians  1:13</a>, 14.<a name=150:7></a> You can readily understand that the moral sway of God must be in grace.<a name=150:8></a> There are only two ways in which God can approach man, man being sinful; one is in grace, and the other in judgment.<a name=150:9></a> If God came in the way of judgment, there would be no moral sway, that is certain; but if He comes in the way of the kingdom, which is moral sway, then He must come in grace, for there is no other principle on which the sway of God could be established in regard to man.<a name=150:10></a> Hence, the first principle of the kingdom is peace; the preaching of peace in the name of the Lord Jesus brings in the moral sway of God.<a name=150:11></a> "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ", and then we have the establishment of the rule of grace in regard to us, so that instead of being overcome by evil, we are able to overcome evil with good.<a name=150:12></a> That is the practical result to us of the throne of grace.<a name=150:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to identify two things; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God, and the throne of grace.<a name=150:14></a> I said a few moments ago that the

		You have read the history of the children of Israel.<a name=151:3></a> You remember what took place on the night of the passover; the blood of the lamb was sprinkled on the lintel and door-posts, that they might be preserved from the destroying angel.<a name=151:4></a> It was the indication that God had remitted His claim upon the people, for practically the children of Israel were just as obnoxious to God as the Egyptians; but He remitted His claim upon the people in order that He might deliver them from the power of the Egyptian.<a name=151:5></a> And so it is in regard to the christian.<a name=151:6></a> God remits His claim in order to establish the sway of grace over man's soul, with the object that man may be delivered from the power of the enemy; that is, from the power of Satan.<a name=151:7></a> "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=151:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel how poorly I can present these things, but a very great point will be gained if you apprehend something of the world to come, and of the fact that God has established the kingdom in the exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ to the right hand of God.<a name=152:3></a> The moral basis of God's kingdom is righteousness; righteousness accomplished and declared in the death of Christ.<a name=152:4></a> The expression of God's kingdom is the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God; the principle of the kingdom is peace; and the rule, or law of the kingdom, is grace; the soul of the christian is brought under the law of the kingdom.<a name=152:5></a> That is, that being sensible of the grace of God toward me, I am enabled to walk in grace down here; for the principle that governs my conduct is not how other people act towards me, but how God has acted towards me, and I walk in grace because I am sensible of the grace of God.<a name=152:6></a>

		You get a beautiful expression in Titus of what I have been trying to bring before you; <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:9">Titus  2:9</a> - 14.<a name=152:7></a> It exhorts servants, the word really is slaves, "to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.<a name=152:8></a> For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish all might get an apprehension of the kingdom having been established in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=153:4></a> The effect of it upon us down here is that "we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=153:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now supposing that you have entered the kingdom; the next thing is this, God teaches; He teaches you what His disposition towards you is.<a name=153:6></a> God has, in grace, remitted His claim, and for the purpose that you might be delivered from the authority of darkness but He has something to teach you, and what He teaches are the terms of the covenant, and I understand the covenant to mean His disposition towards you.<a name=153:7></a> If I make a will I express in that will my disposition towards the persons to whom I dispose of my property.<a name=153:8></a> It is not simply that I have property to leave, and I leave that property, but the way in which I dispose of it indicates my disposition to those to whom I leave it, and that is the character of God's covenant.<a name=153:9></a> A covenant on the part of God indicates the disposition of God towards those who come under the covenant, and we are brought into the kingdom of God in accepting the testimony of the Lord Jesus, in order that we may learn the disposition of God towards us; that is what I understand to be the value and meaning to us of the covenant.<a name=153:10></a>

		Now let me read <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:6">Hebrews  8:6</a>, "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises".<a name=153:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		with the house of Israel and the house of Judah; it makes clear what the disposition of God will be towards them; it is different from what His disposition was in the past.<a name=154:1></a> In the past He dealt with them as in the flesh; in the future He will deal with them in grace, and hence the change; the covenant indicates His disposition towards them, and when the covenant is established, then it is they will learn by divine teaching.<a name=154:2></a> God will write His laws in their hearts, and give them into their minds, and remember no more their sins, and every man will know God, from the least to the greatest, in His mercy.<a name=154:3></a> "I will be merciful to their unrighteousness".<a name=154:4></a> All that will be established hereafter in regard to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.<a name=154:5></a> It is God's testimony as to them.<a name=154:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is not exactly that with us, and I want to indicate what it is to us.<a name=154:7></a> If you will look at a verse in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, you will find it says, "And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=154:8></a> .<a name=154:9></a>.<a name=154:10></a>.<a name=154:11></a> Again, "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=154:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we get an indication of God's covenant; that is, His disposition towards us.<a name=154:13></a> Only one thing God has to teach you, and that is His love.<a name=154:14></a> His love is shed abroad in the heart, and the commendation of that love is the death of Christ.<a name=154:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not get the law written in the heart, like Israel in the future, but we get something infinitely greater in the teaching of the Spirit, that sheds the love of God abroad in the heart.<a name=154:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the simple principle in the new covenant in regard to us is the love of God shed abroad in the heart; and, on the other hand, sins and iniquities are remembered no more.<a name=154:17></a> By one offering the christian is perfected for ever.<a name=154:18></a> God has nothing to say to him in regard to sins, and is free to shed abroad in the

		heart His love by the Holy Spirit.<a name=155:1></a> That is divine teaching; there is no more.<a name=155:2></a> The fact is, the more you become acquainted with the love of God, the more you will apprehend everything of God.<a name=155:3></a> People are slow to learn because they know so little of the love of God.<a name=155:4></a> In the light of love everything of God is simple and plain.<a name=155:5></a> You get the same thing in human things.<a name=155:6></a> A child that is conscious of the love of its parents has no very great difficulty in entering into their mind; and so a soul acquainted with the love of God becomes readily acquainted with the details of God's mind.<a name=155:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the point of divine teaching, the one great principle of God's disposition; it is the term of the new covenant; the love of God shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=155:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The covenant is the second point, it follows the kingdom.<a name=155:9></a> So it was with Israel in the past; God brought them into the wilderness; He Himself was their King; He reigned; then it was that He established His covenant with them.<a name=155:10></a> In the future, Christ will come; He will be hailed with joy in the very place where He was rejected, in Zion, they will say, "Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord", and then the new covenant will be established with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.<a name=155:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to us, what you argue from the love of God is this: God will do, for His own satisfaction, the very best that He can for us.<a name=155:12></a> It is a wonderful thing to be the subject of the love of God, for you may be sure, from the very fact of what God is, that He must necessarily do the best for us.<a name=155:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what love means; grace does not quite mean that.<a name=155:14></a> You cannot measure love, but, in a sense, you can measure grace.<a name=155:15></a> You cannot measure the love of God, and love will work for its own satisfaction, and will do for the subjects of it the best that love can do.<a name=155:16></a> Scripture itself asks that, if God freely delivered up His Son for us all, shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?<a name=155:17></a> If He has given already that great

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third point is reconciliation, "By whom we have now received the reconciliation".<a name=156:2></a> I understand by reconciliation that in it everything is agreeable to God.<a name=156:3></a> That will come to pass throughout the universe; all will be made suitable to God, so that God may be complacent in everything which He has created.<a name=156:4></a> I understand that to be reconciliation.<a name=156:5></a> Now we have received the reconciliation, and I think I can make plain the application of reconciliation to us.<a name=156:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Believers are now before God, for His pleasure, in the life of Christ, apart from all that Adam left behind him in the world.<a name=156:7></a> Adam sinned; Adam died, but, when he himself passed off the scene, he left a good deal behind him; he left the old man, and sin and death in the world.<a name=156:8></a> Christ has come in to remove sin and death; He has removed the old man, and that is what Adam left behind him.<a name=156:9></a> Christ has come in to remove all from before God, so that we might be before God, no longer in the trail of Adam, but in the life of Christ.<a name=156:10></a> I do not say that you are practically apart from it yet, but in the eye of God you are, and before God in the life of Christ.<a name=156:11></a>

		Look at verse 18: "Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life".<a name=156:12></a> What a wonderful thought that is.<a name=156:13></a> You are in the life of Christ, and thus have justification of life; that is, in the eye of God you are apart from the trail of Adam.<a name=156:14></a> That is what reconciliation means to us.<a name=156:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have seen that God has set up a kingdom, has established the reign of grace, not yet manifested, but established in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God, and it has this in view, that grace might reign through righteousness; grace being the rule of the kingdom, it rules through righteousness.<a name=157:6></a> That is, as regards us, through self-judgment, and it brings you to the end, not hereafter, but now, "unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=157:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sin and death appear to be the rule in the world; sin has reigned by death, and in a certain sense still does; but, in the eye of God, sin and death have gone by the cross.<a name=157:8></a> Christ was made sin to put sin away; He appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin; and, if sin has not been put away from before God, it never will be; but Christ has appeared to do it, and He has done it.<a name=157:9></a> More than that, He has annulled death; He is not going to annul it.<a name=157:10></a> He has annulled death, and brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel.<a name=157:11></a> So there is such a thing as the believer being apart from all the consequences of Adam's sin, as before God; apart from sin and death in the life of Christ.<a name=157:12></a> That is where the christian is, and in that sense has received the reconciliation for God's pleasure, and God has complacency in the christian, as reconciled, so "we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement [reconciliation]".<a name=157:13></a> What a blessed privilege

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the summing up, it says that "as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=158:4></a> God has established the kingdom, not simply to salvation, but <i>unto eternal life</i>.<a name=158:5></a> That is God's end and purpose.<a name=158:6></a> God had in view, despite death, that grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=158:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great chapter, and I do not doubt at all that what I have indicated to you is the line of divine teaching.<a name=158:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is working out His ways, and the great end before Him is the disentanglement of good and evil, so that each will find its own place.<a name=158:9></a> That will be the final result.<a name=158:10></a> Good will find its place with God; and all evil, I do not say will be done away, but will find its place with the source of it -- Satan.<a name=158:11></a> It is a most wonderful thing to think that we can be before God for His pleasure, apart, in His eye, from sin and death, and in the life of the One who came here to put aside all the consequences of Adam's transgression.<a name=158:12></a> Adam passed off the scene and left the terrible results of his transgression behind him.<a name=158:13></a> Christ came that He might remove them all, that we might be before God in His life.<a name=158:14></a>

		It is a great thing for us to get an apprehension of those things which God has before Him.<a name=214:4></a> There are many things in this world before men, politics and many other things; but the great point is to apprehend what is before God.<a name=214:5></a> You get the thought of these things foreshadowed in the Old Testament when God gave Moses directions concerning the making of the tabernacle.<a name=214:6></a> God brought before him, in type, what He had before Him.<a name=214:7></a> I do not suppose that Moses understood very much the meaning of it all, or anybody at that time, but there it was set forth in type and shadow in the tabernacle.<a name=214:8></a> All was typical of what has in large measure now come to pass, and it is presented to us in a very definite way.<a name=214:9></a> The most explicit instructions were given to Moses concerning the tabernacle, and Moses could not deviate, from the directions a hair's breadth.<a name=214:10></a> We are told he was faithful as a servant in all God's house; he set up all according to God's mind.<a name=214:11></a> In the directions in Exodus given to Moses, the first thing that God spoke of was the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat; and these represent what God had before Him.<a name=214:12></a> I say what was before Him, because when the tabernacle was set up they were hid from man, and no one dare go into the holiest except Moses, for God communicated to him from the mercy-seat.<a name=214:13></a> To go into the holiest would have been death except according to God's order.<a name=214:14></a> Now all that is gone by, I refer to it because there was the figure and type of things to come.<a name=214:15></a> Now we have the realities and God has been pleased to make known to us what is before Him, the reality

		of things.<a name=215:1></a> No longer the shadow, no longer an ark with the tables of the covenant inside it, but the truth of that which is before God in Christ, and that is what I want to dwell upon at this time.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the privilege of faith to apprehend what is before God, and you may be confident that what is before God will stand.<a name=215:3></a> I will not answer that that which is before man will stand.<a name=215:4></a> No one can foretell the disruptions which may occur in this world; but we know that what is before God will stand, because it all rests on moral foundations.<a name=215:5></a> Whatever is based on moral foundations will stand.<a name=215:6></a> God is ever occupied with the moral, and in His ways and dealings the material is subordinate to the moral, and in a sense follows the moral; material changes depend largely on moral causes, because being what He is, the first thing with Him must be the moral.<a name=215:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the chapter before us we have the true ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat.<a name=215:8></a> Christ is both.<a name=215:9></a> Both types are fulfilled perfectly in Him; and I think I can make that point plain by the grace of God; and further, the establishment of the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat means salvation to man.<a name=215:10></a> The voice of it is salvation, and hence you get the admonition in the beginning of the second chapter, "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him", that is, the apostles.<a name=215:11></a> You will bear in mind that this is an admonition addressed, not to unbelievers, but to those who were professedly christians.<a name=215:12></a> "How shall we escape?<a name=215:13></a>" I would not preach that to unbelievers, but to those who are in profession christians; I would ask them, "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?<a name=215:14></a>" The Hebrews were in danger of letting slip, and the apostle puts this to them.<a name=215:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		as I understand it, is where God addresses Himself to man.<a name=216:1></a> People often have a notion that they come to the mercy-seat.<a name=216:2></a> I do not think that is the idea of it in Scripture.<a name=216:3></a> God spoke to Moses from off the mercy-seat.<a name=216:4></a> It is where God speaks to or for man.<a name=216:5></a> And we have Christ as the mercy-seat, and connected with it Christ in another character, as the ark of the covenant.<a name=216:6></a> It is these two points I desire to present to you.<a name=216:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To put it in another manner, there are two things before God in Christ at the present time; He is apostle, and He is Lord, that is, there is the throne.<a name=216:8></a> There is communication to man by Christ, and there is a throne established; it is that that is before God in Christ.<a name=216:9></a> The way of God's communication to man at the present time is no longer prophets or angels; angels had been employed in connection with the law.<a name=216:10></a> But it is not now angels or prophets, but the Son; He is the One <i>in</i> whom and <i>by</i> whom God communicates to man, and hence, as I understand it, He is the mercy-seat.<a name=216:11></a> You get the thought in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>, "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood".<a name=216:12></a> It is the death of Christ that speaks to us as from God at the present time; that is, the voice of God in the Son comes to us in the death of Christ, and declares the love of God.<a name=216:13></a> That is God speaking to us by the Son.<a name=216:14></a> God spoke to Israel by law, and law meant the assertion of the claims of God on man.<a name=216:15></a> Then He spoke by prophets to recall the people to allegiance; they had forsaken God, and God sought to recall them to Himself.<a name=216:16></a> A striking instance of that is Elijah; he sought to recall the people to allegiance, and thought he had done it at mount Carmel, but they did not return to God, and Elijah was grievously disappointed.<a name=216:17></a> The result is that God comes to him and he is superseded, and Elisha made prophet in his stead.<a name=216:18></a> I do not think Elijah was quite in the secret of God; he had thought that by

	<div class="paragraph">
		some striking act of judgment on the part of God the people were to be recalled to God.<a name=217:1></a> Yet I doubt if he knew the hardness of the heart of the people, though he thought himself the only one who was true to God; but God says to him.<a name=217:2></a> "I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal".<a name=217:3></a> I refer to that to show what was the spirit of a prophet; he sought to recall the people to allegiance to Jehovah.<a name=217:4></a> But when God speaks to men by the Son, it is not law or prophets, it is not demand on man, but God making known to man His love; that was the voice of the Son when He was here upon the earth.<a name=217:5></a> "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life".<a name=217:6></a> It was that which the Son presented.<a name=217:7></a> He said "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live".<a name=217:8></a> The Son had His own distinctive voice, and it was the declaration of the love of God, whatever it may be hereafter.<a name=217:9></a> That is what the apostle begins with here.<a name=217:10></a> God "hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son".<a name=217:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very interesting point; the epistle to the Hebrews does not mention any human apostle, no name is given, and for the simple reason that the Lord is the apostle.<a name=217:12></a> The apostle was the speaker, like as in the old covenant Moses was apostle.<a name=217:13></a> Aaron was priest and Moses apostle.<a name=217:14></a> The Son is now the speaker and hence it is you have the voice of the Son.<a name=217:15></a> It is a great thing to get a sense of whose voice you hear, of who the speaker is.<a name=217:16></a> What comes to saints now is the voice of the Son of God; Christ has gone up on high, and led captivity captive and given gifts unto men; the voice that is heard by the Holy Spirit at the present time is that of the Son of God.<a name=217:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		on the name which Christ has inherited.<a name=218:1></a> We first get the greatness of the speaker in contrast with angels, then the name which He has inherited.<a name=218:2></a> The name is what was prophetically predicated.<a name=218:3></a> There are different quotations here now that the name is taken up.<a name=218:4></a> What I understand by name is renown, that is a sufficiently good interpretation of it.<a name=218:5></a> Christ has obtained a renown greater than angels, and that is gone into, so I will dwell on it a little in detail.<a name=218:6></a> It brings in the thought of the throne, that is, the rule of grace.<a name=218:7></a> The point of time is marked by "when he had by himself purged our sins".<a name=218:8></a> No prophet could purge our sins, and in that is made known to us the love of God.<a name=218:9></a> The Son came to purge our sins, that we might be brought into the presence of divine love without our sins, but that was not all He came for; it was to make God known.<a name=218:10></a> The light of God has come to us in the death of Christ; that same blood which purged the sins is the expression to us of the love of God.<a name=218:11></a> The Son came to make God known, and at the same time He is for God.<a name=218:12></a> These two things are true of Christ.<a name=218:13></a> He is of God and for God.<a name=218:14></a> "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee".<a name=218:15></a> This quotation refers to Christ being born into the world, and is followed by, "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son".<a name=218:16></a> This word in the Old Testament strictly refers to Solomon, but the thought never had its fulfilment until Christ came, and then God could say, "I will be to him a Father".<a name=218:17></a> Thus we have the first element of the kingdom, that is, it is established in One who is both of God and for God.<a name=218:18></a> It is the kingdom of the Son of His love.<a name=218:19></a> That came out on the mount of transfiguration; there came a voice out of the cloud which said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=218:20></a> The Son is of God, declaring God's love, and Himself the object of it.<a name=218:21></a> So it is, "I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son".<a name=218:22></a> When Christ sits, as He will sit, on

		We get a very interesting point in verses 13, 14, and it is this, that all the things of which I have spoken are hidden for the moment at the right hand of God, they are not manifest.<a name=222:5></a> We have the testimony of them by the Holy Spirit, but the kingdom is yet mystery, the King is at the right hand of God.<a name=222:6></a> God has said to Him, "Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool", as it was in the case of Abraham, he could not inherit the land because the iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full.<a name=222:7></a> So Christ sits at the right hand of God because things have to ripen on the earth, and when the harvest and the vintage are ripe, then it is He takes things in hand.<a name=222:8></a> Men who are interested in politics are occupied only with what is transpiring on earth, but before anything momentous can happen on earth there must be a movement at the right hand of God.<a name=222:9></a> When I see a movement there I know there will be a movement on earth.<a name=222:10></a> Christ sits at the right hand of God until the time appointed for His foes to be made His footstool.<a name=222:11></a> We get the thought in Timothy as to the coming, "Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords".<a name=222:12></a> You have to wait for His times; the present time is the time appointed for the gospel, but there is a time appointed for the coming of the Lord, and God will show it in its own time.<a name=222:13></a> Meanwhile Christ is hid at the right hand of God.<a name=222:14></a> The ark of the covenant is there at the present time.<a name=222:15></a> But God has made known to us by the Spirit all that is established in Christ.<a name=222:16></a> The ark of the covenant and the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things presented in this passage which I have read: one is the things to which we are said to have come (it says, first, "Ye are not come", and then, "Ye are come"), and the other, the voice which speaks -- that is, the One who speaks from heaven.<a name=308:4></a> It is the same Person who has spoken throughout, the same voice, only there was a time when He spoke on earth, and now He speaks from heaven, and our responsibility is much greater on account of His speaking from heaven.<a name=308:5></a> Those who did not obey when He spoke on earth incurred responsibility, and we incur greater responsibility if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven.<a name=308:6></a> I want to mark this distinction.<a name=308:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I refer to the things to which we have come; it is a great thing to apprehend them, for the fact of any having come to them proves that the things are there.<a name=308:8></a> If they were not there, you could not have come to them.<a name=308:9></a> They are things which you do not apprehend by sight and sense, for they are not tangible in that way, but they nonetheless exist.<a name=308:10></a> There are many things existing which are not seen.<a name=308:11></a> Seen things are what the mind and eye of man can take in; but there are many things unseen, which are eternal, though not apprehended by natural senses.<a name=308:12></a> It is of the eternal things that I want to speak now.<a name=308:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is referred to by way of contrast is the children of Israel coming to mount Sinai; they were brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, and then to Sinai, that they might hear the voice of God.<a name=308:14></a> This made them unlike any other nation, for no other
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=309>[Page 309]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		nation on the face of the earth had heard the voice of God.<a name=309:1></a> We, too, are brought in a sense to hear the voice of God.<a name=309:2></a> But the first point of contrast is between the mount to which they came and the mount to which we have come.<a name=309:3></a> They came to mount Sinai and we have come to mount Zion.<a name=309:4></a> I want to make plain the distinction between the principles identified with these mounts.<a name=309:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And first it is important to remember that we have not come to things that affect man's sensibilities and imagination.<a name=309:6></a> Many people conceive of christianity as though it were intended to affect man's sensibilities and imagination; christianity has that character to a very large extent in the world.<a name=309:7></a> We see that in its extreme form in popery; every arrangement in popery is calculated to affect sensibilities and imagination; it is a system of sensuous worship intended for that purpose.<a name=309:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another element common in christianity, <i>viz</i>.<a name=309:9></a>, that which tends to appeal to the mind of man.<a name=309:10></a> Now there was all that at mount Sinai.<a name=309:11></a> Everything seen and heard there was calculated to affect the sensibilities of man and to strike him with awe.<a name=309:12></a> "And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake".<a name=309:13></a> And why?<a name=309:14></a> For the reason that God was dealing with man after the flesh, and therefore there was all that which was calculated to strike flesh with awe.<a name=309:15></a> Man was made to feel that although God spoke to him yet God kept him at a distance.<a name=309:16></a> There was no getting near God, but man was made to feel that there was what separated him from God.<a name=309:17></a> He heard the voice of God's requirements, but what really came out was the ministration of death and condemnation, and God accordingly allowed the circumstances into which the children of Israel came, to be of an awe-inspiring character.<a name=309:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in contrast to that "Ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly

		Jerusalem".<a name=310:1></a> There are eight different items here to which we have come, being separated by the word 'and' in verses 22 - 24.<a name=310:2></a> Then at the close is the admonition in verse 25, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.<a name=310:3></a> For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven".<a name=310:4></a> Thus for an apostate from christianity there is no escape.<a name=310:5></a> For a man who broke the law of Moses there might be hope, but for an apostate from christianity none, for the reason that there remains nothing further to recover him.<a name=310:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is mount Zion, and I want to bring before you what it expresses on the part of God.<a name=310:7></a> It was that which led me to read the close of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:59">Psalm  78:59</a> - 72.<a name=310:8></a> The allusion is to the ark having been taken captive by the Philistines in the time of Eli.<a name=310:9></a> He "delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand".<a name=310:10></a> It was a dark moment -- but God came in against the Philistines.<a name=310:11></a> What I understand as the force of the passage is the coming in of God in the sovereignty of mercy; but at the same time entirely refusing the first order which had been connected with Israel.<a name=310:12></a> When Israel came into the land the tabernacle was pitched at Shiloh, and the tribe of Ephraim was prominent, but when God came in after Israel had lost everything, in losing the ark, He "chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved", etc.<a name=310:13></a> God set aside and refused the first order established when Israel came into the land, and chose mount Zion and David.<a name=310:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that stands good forever.<a name=310:15></a> Shiloh and Ephraim had to go, but mount Zion and the tribe of Judah and David remain.<a name=310:16></a> What this expresses is the sovereign mercy of God, which is identified with mount Zion.<a name=310:17></a> And it means that when man has forfeited everything by perverseness, then in the sovereignty of mercy God

		comes in, and that mercy is identified with mount Zion.<a name=311:1></a> They had brought the ark to mount Zion when they sang the psalm in which is continually repeated "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=311:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt but that psalm will be found in the mouth of Israel in the future, when God brings them back from captivity and restores them in the land.<a name=311:3></a> Their song will be, "Give thanks unto Jehovah, for his mercy endureth for ever".<a name=311:4></a> What <i>we</i> have come to is the sovereignty of mercy.<a name=311:5></a> Ye are not come to mount Sinai, which is representative of responsibility, but to mount Zion, and we have to accept this.<a name=311:6></a> I do not think there is the idea of sovereignty in grace so much as in mercy.<a name=311:7></a> We read that "God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=311:8></a> Scripture seems to connect with mercy the thought of God's sovereignty.<a name=311:9></a> It is a great thing for the soul to learn that there is mercy with God, identified with mount Zion, but we have to accept the sovereignty of that mercy.<a name=311:10></a> God said to Moses, "I will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy".<a name=311:11></a> That was said after the sin of the golden calf.<a name=311:12></a> On the other hand we read, "whom he will he hardeneth".<a name=311:13></a> We are privileged to know God in the light as One who is rich in mercy.<a name=311:14></a> How is it we are here at this time, and that the mass of the people in this town are not here?<a name=311:15></a> It is a question of the sovereignty of mercy.<a name=311:16></a> The <i>grace</i> of God is alike toward all, "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men".<a name=311:17></a> But we have the knowledge of mercy also; we are come to mount Zion.<a name=311:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next item is, "the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem".<a name=311:19></a> I think the idea presented is of the church according to the work of the twelve, especially according to Peter.<a name=311:20></a> The principle involved
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him".<a name=312:1></a> The heavenly Jerusalem is now in a sense suffering, but there is the privilege connected with it, <i>viz</i>.<a name=312:2></a>, liberty.<a name=312:3></a> "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free".<a name=312:4></a> The effect of the revelation of the heavenly city, when it comes down from God out of heaven, will be liberty even to the creature.<a name=312:5></a> "The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God".<a name=312:6></a> That is connected with the heavenly city; the idea in it is privilege and, in connection with privilege, liberty.<a name=312:7></a> The church is suffering now, but the very fact of suffering prepares it to reign with Christ.<a name=312:8></a> God's education of His people is remarkable.<a name=312:9></a> It is strange that suffering should prepare saints to reign; but that is so in the ways of God.<a name=312:10></a> The heavenly city is the city that is to rule.<a name=312:11></a> The idea of rule is connected with a city in Scripture; but the city now means liberty to us.<a name=312:12></a> The Lord said, "ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free".<a name=312:13></a> "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed".<a name=312:14></a> Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.<a name=312:15></a> It shows the saints with God, conscious of His sovereign mercy, and of liberty with Him.<a name=312:16></a> We go in and out and find pasture.<a name=312:17></a> Grace has brought us into liberty; the Son has made us free, we have the freedom of the house.<a name=312:18></a> We have to stand fast in that liberty, and it is the liberty of access to God; it is a great thing to have liberty in your soul; you could not have it under law, but only in the presence of the sovereign mercy of God.<a name=312:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Most christians are entangled in the yoke of bondage.<a name=312:20></a> Some have the idea of being under law, some are under ceremonialism; but <i>we</i> have to stand fast in the liberty of the Spirit.<a name=312:21></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=312:22></a> If you see a christian in bondage you may be certain that the Spirit has not His place in him.<a name=312:23></a> When the flesh is practically set

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is "to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly".<a name=313:3></a> I should connect that with a passage in the early part of the Hebrews -- chapter 1: 13, 14.<a name=313:4></a> I look upon the angels as being guardians of the city.<a name=313:5></a> They are sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.<a name=313:6></a> God employs the angels in that way.<a name=313:7></a> "Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire".<a name=313:8></a> The saints here, the children of the heavenly city, are guarded and ministered to.<a name=313:9></a> God can minister for His people providentially in ways we do not understand.<a name=313:10></a> There are angels who protect the people of God.<a name=313:11></a> You may think sometimes that you are exposed to satanic agency, but there are God's angels sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.<a name=313:12></a> It is well to remember that every agency that God employs is employed now on behalf of His people.<a name=313:13></a> God's providence may in a way appear to be against His people; but angels are not the providence of God, but agents employed for His people.<a name=313:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next item is "church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven".<a name=313:15></a> The heavenly city is one aspect of the church, and the church of the firstborn another aspect.<a name=313:16></a> One is connected with the ministry of the twelve and the other with the work of Paul.<a name=313:17></a> It is interesting if, as is probable, Paul was the writer of this epistle, that he gives place here to the work and ministry of the twelve.<a name=313:18></a> They built the heavenly city; their names are in the foundations; they were building the church while Paul was persecuting.<a name=313:19></a> Their testimony was of Christ exalted, and it is that testimony that brings in the heavenly city.<a name=313:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have also the work of Paul, "church of the firstborn".<a name=313:21></a> It is, I suppose, an allusion to the firstborn of the children of Israel.<a name=313:22></a> God claimed the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to give God His place and to allow Him to have what He claims, the saints for Himself.<a name=314:6></a> He has preserved us from judgment and saved us, and made known to us His calling; and it is that He might have His place with us, and that we might be for Him, the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven.<a name=314:7></a> What can be the value of the firstborn to God except as a worshipping company?<a name=314:8></a> It is of great moment to enter into our calling and to apprehend that in the eye of God we are risen together with Christ.<a name=314:9></a> I used to think that this was a question of realisation; I do not think so now.<a name=314:10></a> It lies in the apprehension of the resurrection of Christ and in it we are risen with Him.<a name=314:11></a> It is not through realisation, but through faith, you are risen with Him.<a name=314:12></a> It is the expression of God's mind in the resurrection of Christ and hence is the place of saints, that they may be in touch with heaven; they compose the worshipping company, the church of the firstborn.<a name=314:13></a> That is the place of the church.<a name=314:14></a> You are risen with Him and quickened together with Him, brought thus into association with Christ, and so it says, "Set your affection on things above".<a name=314:15></a> It is a company in touch with heaven, who will hereafter come out from heaven as the heavenly city; but in the meantime on earth they

		And we are come to "Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant".<a name=315:17></a> We read in chapter 8, "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also as he is the mediator of a better covenant".<a name=315:18></a> Moses was mediator of the first covenant, Jesus of the new covenant.<a name=315:19></a> The first covenant spoke of God's claim and right as regards man, the new covenant of God's disposition toward man.<a name=315:20></a> So the Lord says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood", Jesus is the Mediator.<a name=315:21></a> The thought and disposition of God is expressed in Him; we learn in Jesus not that God is Judge of all, but the disposition of God toward His people.<a name=315:22></a> I believe it is set forth in the death of Christ, and so it is that He speaks of the new covenant

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come finally "to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel".<a name=316:5></a> The blood of sprinkling speaks of the righteousness and grace of God in which sin has been removed.<a name=316:6></a> The blood of Abel called to God for vengeance, but the blood of Jesus speaks of righteousness established for God in the death of Christ, so that His claim upon man is remitted to the believer.<a name=316:7></a> The blood of Abel was terrible, witnessing the first act of violence that ever came into the world.<a name=316:8></a> It is remarkable that though man came under sentence of death by sin, he precipitated death in the first instance by his own violence.<a name=316:9></a> Sin came out in two forms, first in transgression against God, then in sin against a man's neighbour; Cain killed Abel.<a name=316:10></a> This was sin against God, of course, but the sin was immediately directed against man's neighbour.<a name=316:11></a> Cain sinned against his brother and brought death in by violence before man had <i>actually</i> come under death by the sentence of God.<a name=316:12></a> Now the blood of Christ speaks better things than that of Abel.<a name=316:13></a> The grace of God has that character; it brings salvation to all men.<a name=316:14></a>

		The apostle unfolds in the passage in the Corinthians, in a remarkable way, the process by which his mind had arrived at a certain result.<a name=319:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He had said, "For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart; for whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for your cause".<a name=319:5></a> I should suppose that those who had detracted from the apostle had probably brought two charges against him; on the one hand that he was beside himself, and on the other that he was sober, that is, he was turning things to his own profit.<a name=319:6></a> Now the apostle takes up the challenge and says, "Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God".<a name=319:7></a> He admits and justifies the insinuation, and again, "Whether we be sober, it is for your cause; for the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead: and that He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again.<a name=319:8></a> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.<a name=319:9></a> Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature".<a name=319:10></a>

		I want to call your attention specially to the point at which the mind of the apostle had arrived, and the process by which he arrived at it.<a name=319:11></a> He says, "the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead".<a name=319:12></a> That is

		a statement of the last moment, and one which I suppose man, as man, would be extremely unwilling to admit.<a name=320:1></a> I am sure the natural mind of man could not take it in, and I am afraid a great many christians do not fully accept it.<a name=320:2></a> It was not that the death of Christ made man dead, but it witnessed that men were dead.<a name=320:3></a> When Christ died every man lay under sentence of death, and even Christ died.<a name=320:4></a> There was nothing under the eye of God on the earth morally living when Christ died.<a name=320:5></a> He was here and life was in Him, but He died, and His death was the proof that all were dead.<a name=320:6></a> Well, what then?<a name=320:7></a> He rose again, and the apostle argues that "He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again".<a name=320:8></a> There is only one Man out of the ruin, and that is Christ.<a name=320:9></a> All else are under death; and it is most important to see that death is God's judgment upon man; in the eye of God all men have died.<a name=320:10></a> God may prolong man's actual existence in flesh in His wisdom, so that man may have grace presented to him, but in the eye of God all are dead and that is what the death of Christ proved; and hence it is that the apostle argues that there is but One risen actually out of the scene of death, One whom God has raised from the dead, and they which live morally should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them and rose again.<a name=320:11></a> Properly speaking, we are "become dead to the law by the body of Christ" that we "should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God".<a name=320:12></a> Christ has a full claim upon all those who take the ground of living; they have no title to live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again.<a name=320:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I make these remarks as introductory.<a name=321:10></a> I read the passage because I wanted to speak a little about reconciliation, and, in connection with that, the closing clause of the chapter, "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=321:11></a>

		Reconciliation is a truth which, as far as I know, is little apprehended by christians; and I would be extremely thankful if the Lord would enable me to make it a little more plain to the simplest.<a name=321:12></a> The thought is simple, but at the same time it is extremely important.<a name=321:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know if you have noticed that reconciliation is not presented in the Old Testament; and, on the other hand, I believe the original word 'atonement' is not found in the New.<a name=321:14></a> I do not mean to say but what you find the thought and reality of atonement in the New Testament, but I am speaking of the doctrine.<a name=321:15></a> It is not remarkable if you cannot find reconciliation

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The beginning of it was the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=322:8></a> The apostle says, "God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation".<a name=322:9></a> You will find two expressions used here.<a name=322:10></a> In verse 18 we have the <i>ministry</i> of reconciliation, and, in the end of verse 19, the <i>word</i> of reconciliation.<a name=322:11></a> I think there is a difference between the two expressions.<a name=322:12></a> The <i>ministry</i> of reconciliation is a wider thought than the <i>word</i> of reconciliation.<a name=322:13></a> The word of reconciliation I understand to be the testimony of reconciliation; it implies that reconciliation has been effected, hence we get now the testimony of it.<a name=322:14></a> But the first word is the 'ministry' of reconciliation, and I want to bring that before you.<a name=322:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I understand that the beginning of the ministry of reconciliation was the presence of God here in Christ.<a name=322:16></a> God brought Himself near to the world in Christ in view of redemption, and at the same time He found in Christ as Man entire complacency.<a name=322:17></a> That was the position of things when Christ was here in the world.<a name=322:18></a>

		I think that for the moment things were presented to God on an entirely different footing.<a name=323:1></a> God was not dealing with men by law and prophets, but "was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them".<a name=323:2></a> In the presence of Christ there was that which was entirely to the satisfaction of God.<a name=323:3></a> That was the peculiarity of the moment when Christ was upon earth, and all that God had to say to the world as such was "not imputing their trespasses unto them".<a name=323:4></a> It meant the complete supersession of the first man because God had approached man in the second.<a name=323:5></a> There was no other man under the eye of God; Christ was the Man out of heaven, He was the Man in whom God was presented.<a name=323:6></a> You cannot put Christ morally in the line of the first man.<a name=323:7></a> "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second Man is the Lord from heaven" and in the second Man it pleased God to approach man down here.<a name=323:8></a> Now you must take that in if you are to understand anything about reconciliation.<a name=323:9></a> It meant the introduction of another man in whom everything was to be taken up and that man entirely suitable to God.<a name=323:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know if you remember the song of the heavenly host when Christ was born.<a name=323:11></a> It was "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=323:12></a> When Christ entered Jerusalem to suffer, the multitude sang, "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=323:13></a> All this came out in that Man; His presence on earth meant, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=323:14></a> Now, by the very presence of Christ here, the first man was superseded.<a name=323:15></a> God was no longer dealing with the first man, that system of probation came to an end in the presence of Christ here, but God presented Himself to man in the Person of the second Man.<a name=323:16></a> The second Man was such an one as that God could present Himself to the world in that Man.<a name=323:17></a> And you can understand that if the second Man comes

		But there is another thing; the old man was here.<a name=324:2></a> I do not confound the first man and the old man; the first man is superseded, the old man is removed.<a name=324:3></a> The reason is that the first man is not strictly a moral term; it is a question of an order of creation; but the old man presents a moral idea, and the old man is not superseded but removed.<a name=324:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I understand by the 'word' of reconciliation that the old man has been removed in the death of Christ.<a name=324:5></a> "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=324:6></a> You get an idea of this in the sin-offering burnt outside the camp.<a name=324:7></a> The blood was sprinkled before the mercy-seat and on the mercy-seat, but the carcass of the offering was burnt outside the camp.<a name=324:8></a> That is, the old man was removed; sin was condemned in the flesh, and the old man crucified under the eye of God in the offering of Christ.<a name=324:9></a> He was made sin; He was put in the place of the curse, and in His death the old man was removed.<a name=324:10></a> So that for God two things have come to pass; one, the first man superseded, and the other, the old man removed, and God takes up all His ways in connection with the universe, not in the first man, but in the second.<a name=324:11></a> All the ways of God in blessing, and the accomplishment of His purposes, are brought to pass in the second Man, and the old man (it is the truth in Jesus) has been removed, and when the old man was removed, all that was connected with the old man was removed.<a name=324:12></a> Sin and death were removed as before God; they apply to the old man.<a name=324:13></a> The old man was the man of sin in a sense, and sin brought in death upon man, but sin, and the curse, and death were removed from under the eye of God in the removal of the old man, and hence the apostle could say, "And hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=324:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth for the christian is this, that in the acceptance of reconciliation he has put off the individuality connected with sin, but at the same time he has put on the new man which after God is new created.<a name=325:6></a> The apostle could speak of himself in that way.<a name=325:7></a> "I, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God".<a name=325:8></a> He says, "I am crucified with Christ"; that was the old man, the old individuality; nevertheless I live, that is the new individuality, "Yet not I", that is the old individuality, "but Christ liveth in me"; there is a new man created after God.<a name=325:9></a> The same thing is accepted by saints.<a name=325:10></a> The ministry of reconciliation unfolds to us the mind of God in regard to us and it was that which the apostle was bringing before the Corinthians.<a name=325:11></a> I hardly think that they had accepted the truth, for there was among them a good deal that savoured of the old man, and hence it is that the apostle brings before them the ministry of reconciliation; that is, the first man superseded by the second.<a name=325:12></a> Christ is to fill the scene and the old man has been removed, so that it can be true of christians that they have put off the old and put on the new.<a name=325:13></a>

		Now there is a further point which I want to dwell upon in connection with this, which will bring us to the passage in the <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:9">Revelation  21:9</a> - 27.<a name=325:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only read the passage in the Revelation, but will try to show you how it is an illustration of the passage in Corinthians.<a name=325:15></a> We read there, God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=325:16></a> There was an end to serve for God, that we might become the

		righteousness of God in Him.<a name=326:1></a> It is the church which is spoken of there, that in it might be set forth the righteousness of God.<a name=326:2></a> God condemned sin in Christ, so that the church in Him might answer every demand of divine righteousness.<a name=326:3></a> And it means that the church is before God, under His eye, apart from all that came in in connection with sin -- from the old man, from sin, death, and the curse.<a name=326:4></a> It was to be for the perfect satisfaction of God and for the expression of His righteousness -- that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=326:5></a> I think this is the answer which God has given to the cross.<a name=326:6></a> Christ was made sin, who knew no sin, but that the church in Him might answer every demand of righteousness.<a name=326:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you turn for a moment to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:10">Revelation  21:10</a>, 11, you get there the bride, the holy Jerusalem, which is no doubt a picture of the church, coming down from God out of heaven; not going to heaven.<a name=326:8></a> The ministry of Paul had carried the church to heaven and John brings the church out of heaven.<a name=326:9></a> Paul carries it to heaven as the church of the firstborn and John brings it out of heaven as the holy city, the new Jerusalem, to take a place in relation to earth.<a name=326:10></a> That is the great idea in its coming out of heaven.<a name=326:11></a> It is not that it comes to earth, but it comes from God, out of heaven, as a testimony on the part of God; for we find that the nations of the earth walk in the light of it.<a name=326:12></a>

		Now just a word about the construction of the city.<a name=327:12></a> You first get the walls, which are of jasper, and then the foundations, and these are garnished with all manner of precious stones; and in the precious stones you get the idea of variety.<a name=327:13></a> They are not all alike, but I rather cherish the thought of variety.<a name=327:14></a> I think anyone can understand the significance of a precious stone; it is not a source of light; it gives off light, but it is refracted light, and there is all variety of precious stones in the foundations of the city.<a name=327:15></a> I think all indicates the presence, morally, of Christ in all there; they are in all the variety of Christ.<a name=327:16></a> When you break light up you get a variety of colours; you do not see that variety in Christ Himself, for in Himself is perfect combination, and Christ is simply light;

		but in saints you get the light broken up, and see all the detail coming out in variety.<a name=328:1></a> I do not think that saints are all alike, one characteristic of Christ is seen conspicuous in one, and another in another.<a name=328:2></a> John is not exactly like Peter, nor Peter like Paul; what comes out in each is some particular trait of Christ.<a name=328:3></a> But in Christ there is no trait, for in Him every quality is so blended that there is only light.<a name=328:4></a> The detail comes out beautifully in the men and women who are presented to us in Scripture; but all are traits of Christ; hence saints shine not by their own light, but they reflect the light of Christ in the same way as the moon reflects the light of the sun.<a name=328:5></a> The source of light is in the sun, and the moon shines by reflected light; and so it is in the church; and that may account for the variety which you find in the foundations of the city.<a name=328:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another truth comes out, and it is that the city is perfect from the foundations to the gates.<a name=328:7></a> The foundations are the beginning, and the gates the completion of a city; and when you come to the gates you find no diminution in perfectness, but each gate is one several pearl.<a name=328:8></a> It indicates that all is the work of God and all divinely perfect; and the gates in a sense are looked upon as unique; God does not make the city splendid in the foundation, with inferiority in the gates, but the whole is perfect from beginning to end, from foundation to gates.<a name=328:9></a> The gold, the precious stones, the pearls, are all new.<a name=328:10></a> They never were in the first man.<a name=328:11></a> The first man did not reflect light from Christ.<a name=328:12></a> That is reserved for the heavenly city; hence Christ comes out in the heavenly city.<a name=328:13></a> Perhaps otherwise the light of Christ would be too bright for earth.<a name=328:14></a> Christ comes to be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe; the light is modified and comes to men on earth in the heavenly city; and it is in the heavenly city that the connection is maintained between heaven and earth, and I suppose

		It is remarkable that the first time you get the description of the city it is in connection with the eternal state; and then afterwards the angel who had shown the evangelist the seven last plagues takes him to a great and high mountain and shows him the same city, but as connected with the millennium.<a name=329:15></a> Hence you find here certain features in the city which are not found in its connection with the eternal state.<a name=329:16></a> In the eternal state you do not find a throne, but you do find this in connection with the millennium, for the millennium is a time of government.<a name=329:17></a> But in the eternal state the kingdom is given up, and God is all

	<div class="paragraph">
		But my thought in referring to it was in connection with the righteousness of God, as you get this in 2 Corinthians.<a name=330:2></a> God made Christ sin for us in the presence of the universe, and God means to give the answer to it to the universe in the church, being apart from everything that came in by the first man.<a name=330:3></a> All that came in by the first man has been removed for God in the death of Christ.<a name=330:4></a> The city meets every demand of divine righteousness; and it is true in principle now; what comes out in the heavenly city in the future comes out in the saints now.<a name=330:5></a> God made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be entirely for God's satisfaction, apart from everything that came in by sin.<a name=330:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I could enlarge upon this, and show you a beautiful picture in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, where the apostle prays that the saints might be strengthened with might by God's Spirit in the inner man; "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God".<a name=330:7></a>

		different stages of spiritual experience which must always exist, just as fellowship, as in the first chapter, must always exist.<a name=379:1></a> It may be limited, but it must always exist; and there is always a basis for fellowship, since we are in the light as God is in the light; so too there must always be different measures of spiritual progress, and that comes out in the second chapter.<a name=379:2></a> And there are dangers which are peculiar to different stages; the danger to the babes is hardly the danger to the young men.<a name=379:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The babes were exposed to danger from bad doctrine, but the young men are strong and the word of God abides in them.<a name=379:4></a> It is not bad doctrine but the world that is the danger to them, and so the apostle says, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.<a name=379:5></a> If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<a name=379:6></a> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world".<a name=379:7></a> If you look for vigour and stability in regard to the doctrine, you will find it in the young men, but even to the young men the world may be a snare.<a name=379:8></a> A time may come when by the grace of God we judge the whole world system, but that does not always come very quickly.<a name=379:9></a> Many christians are sound enough, like the two and a half tribes, in regard to doctrine, but are liable to be snared by the world or by association.<a name=379:10></a> That is a common snare to the people of God and keeps them from entering into the promised land.<a name=379:11></a> The thought of God is that we should enter into the land of His purpose and anything that keeps us out of the land is a snare.<a name=379:12></a> Like the subtlety of Balaam in regard to the children of Israel, through the daughters of Moab, which tended to hinder their going into the land of God's purpose.<a name=379:13></a>

		What marks the fathers is that they had judged the world system in the light of the death of Christ, according to the word of the Lord, "Now is the judgement

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third chapter the Spirit of God brings in the place of saints as children before God.<a name=380:11></a> "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God".<a name=380:12></a> This accords with what, in the first chapter of John's gospel, is noted consequent on the rejection of Christ.<a name=380:13></a> "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<a name=380:14></a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<a name=380:15></a> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God".<a name=380:16></a> Christ gave them title to take that place.<a name=380:17></a> In the epistle the place is viewed as of the Father's love.<a name=380:18></a> "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not".<a name=380:19></a> God has brought to pass that there should be a generation here according to Him.<a name=380:20></a> That is what one may call the

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fourth chapter the point is not the place which God has given, but rather the disposition of God toward us down here.<a name=381:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not exactly the mind of God toward the church, nor the attitude of God toward the world, but the disposition of God toward the saints till the close of the whole chapter of their responsibility.<a name=381:6></a> It is a lesson of the last moment for every one of us to learn; and then you are prepared to accept, in the next chapter, the witness which cuts you off from the wicked one and the world on the one hand, and introduces you into the heart of God on the other.<a name=381:7></a> Then it is you learn that you "are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ; he is the true God and eternal life".<a name=381:8></a> You have come to the consciousness of eternal life, because you have reached the point where it has pleased God to place it in regard to the saints, that is, in His Son.<a name=381:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is outside of the wicked one and the world, and it depends on an understanding that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him that is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=381:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The previous chapters show the steps by which we are led up to this.<a name=381:11></a> What I dwell upon now is the disposition of God toward us; it is what the apostle Paul expresses by the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=381:12></a> The apostle speaks of himself as being made competent as minister of the new covenant; in principle you get

		the ministration of the new covenant in the fourth chapter, verses 9 - 17.<a name=382:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to notice that the passage begins with this, "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<a name=382:2></a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins".<a name=382:3></a> That was the starting point of God's ways with us.<a name=382:4></a> Now the closing point is found in verse 17: "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=382:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I call attention to these two passages because they show the love of God in connection with the christian all through his responsible history, from the time that he was a sinner till the day of judgment.<a name=382:6></a> As I said before, it is not exactly the presentation of the love of God toward the church in Christ.<a name=382:7></a> It is the presentation of the love of God toward saints, taking them up in regard to their responsibility.<a name=382:8></a> The two points indicated evidently include the whole of our responsible history.<a name=382:9></a> We began as sinners and morally dead, and end that chapter at the day of judgment; we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of Christ.<a name=382:10></a> Now the passage unfolds the mind of God toward us all through this history, and that is in principle the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=382:11></a> Whenever you get the thought of covenant, it is the expression of disposition.<a name=382:12></a> If you refer to God's dealings with Abraham, what He said to and gave him was His covenant; it was the expression of His disposition towards him; there were two things, blessing and inheritance, God would bless him and give him an inheritance.<a name=382:13></a> If you pass on to the children of Israel, God brought them into the wilderness, to Sinai, then His covenant was the expression of His disposition toward them.<a name=382:14></a> Their blessing was conditional on
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=383>[Page 383]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		obedience, and this was the expression, so far, of God's disposition toward man in the flesh.<a name=383:1></a> It was not grace coming out, but the disposition of God toward man in the flesh; they would be blessed and maintained in blessing on the condition of obedience.<a name=383:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The new covenant in the future expresses what the disposition of God will be toward Israel and Judah.<a name=383:3></a> God was displeased with the first covenant.<a name=383:4></a> The people did not continue in it, and God makes a new covenant, and this is the expression of His disposition toward them in the future.<a name=383:5></a> That is, He will put His laws in their minds, and write them in their hearts, and will be to them a God, and they shall be to Him a people.<a name=383:6></a> "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:34">Jeremiah  31:34</a>.<a name=383:7></a> That is His disposition toward Israel in the future.<a name=383:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in principle the new covenant is the expression of God's disposition toward christians.<a name=383:9></a> A man in making a will makes a disposition of his property; but his will exhibits his disposition toward those whom he leaves behind him.<a name=383:10></a> That is much the idea of a covenant, and it is valid by the death of the testator, that is of Christ; the covenant exhibits the thought of God toward His people.<a name=383:11></a> The terms of the covenant are righteousness and love.<a name=383:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the covenant there is the ministry of righteousness, but the main feature of it with christians is the confirmation to them of God's love.<a name=383:13></a> I think the disposition of God toward His people is included in the one simple term 'love'.<a name=383:14></a> "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=383:15></a> I regard a covenant as an expression of divine teaching.<a name=383:16></a> God will hereafter teach Israel.<a name=383:17></a> Now He teaches us, and He does that effectually,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust you will understand the order of divine dealings.<a name=384:2></a> God gives us a certain place before Him and there makes known His disposition toward us.<a name=384:3></a> To know this is a matter of exercise to saints.<a name=384:4></a> Nothing can be more profoundly important than to understand the mind of God toward us; and it is brought out in a wonderful way in the passage I have read.<a name=384:5></a> We knew nothing of the love of God at the outset of our history as christians.<a name=384:6></a> Our first apprehension of God was in His grace; and you must not confound grace and love; I could not say that grace is God's nature, but love is.<a name=384:7></a> When we were converted we had a sense of the grace of God, and of the suitability of that grace to our state, for the gospel is the glad tidings of the grace of God, that is, God presents Himself in it to man in regard to man's responsibility.<a name=384:8></a> He in grace remits His claim in order that man be delivered from the power of evil.<a name=384:9></a> That is what the gospel presents.<a name=384:10></a> There is remission of sins, so that man may not come into judgment, but may be delivered from the power of the enemy of souls.<a name=384:11></a> We are delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.<a name=384:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Holy Spirit is received then it is that He becomes the teacher, and the subject of His teaching is, as we have seen, the disposition of God toward us.<a name=384:13></a> I cannot conceive of anything of more profound moment than that.<a name=384:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get it in principle in the Lord's supper.<a name=384:15></a> In the death of Christ is set forth the love of God; the blood is the witness of it.<a name=384:16></a> "This cup is the new covenant in my blood".<a name=384:17></a> It is the expression of God's disposition toward us.<a name=384:18></a> Hence when Christ died the veil was rent, and that is the way by which we go in.<a name=384:19></a>

		see the love of God was before any movement in us.<a name=385:1></a> God first met us in grace and then communicated to us the gift of the Holy Spirit, and thus we came to find that, after all, God was first, and that all that had taken place was the fruit of His love.<a name=385:2></a> God sent His Son into the world that we might live by Him and to be the propitiation for our sins.<a name=385:3></a> You get those two thoughts in connection with the Son of God.<a name=385:4></a> He was given that we might live through Him.<a name=385:5></a> He has become to us a quickening Spirit, giving us the well of water that springs up in us into everlasting life; and at the same time He is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=385:6></a> From the beginning, before we knew anything at all about God, such was the disposition of God toward us.<a name=385:7></a> He took account of us, as we were, in death and sins and met it in the sending of His Son.<a name=385:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to verses 11 - 17, and it is noticeable in verse 12 that the expression of God's love is in christians.<a name=385:9></a> You get the thought introduced by the same formula as in the gospel, "No man hath seen God at any time".<a name=385:10></a> There it is, "The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him"; here "His love is perfected in us".<a name=385:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says here, "we have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=385:12></a> If God loved us at the outset His love cannot diminish.<a name=385:13></a> Love is abiding.<a name=385:14></a> It is possible for a saint to lose in measure the sense of grace, but not the sense of love.<a name=385:15></a> Grace brought salvation to us at the outset, but a christian might grow old on that line and the sense of grace get dim.<a name=385:16></a> But the Holy Spirit is the abiding witness of love; He has shed abroad the love of God in our hearts.<a name=385:17></a> Now we can say we know not simply the love of God at the outset; we get a point further, and can say, "we have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=385:18></a> There is no diminution.<a name=385:19></a> We may get a larger sense of it, but after all the love of God is unchanging and unchangeable.<a name=385:20></a> What the love of

		God was at the beginning, it is to us now, and what it is to us now, it was at the beginning; and in our christian course in all its extent we can say, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=386:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a blessed thing to be the objects of the love of God, and we have a divine witness of it in the Holy Spirit.<a name=386:2></a> I may say one word about love which is simple; love works to satisfy itself; it must have its objects, but it will satisfy itself, if it has power to do so; and God has power for this.<a name=386:3></a> "He will rest in his love", when that love has satisfied itself in regard to those who are the objects of it.<a name=386:4></a> Hence we get to heaven by the love of God.<a name=386:5></a> Because He loves His people God will have them in His own place.<a name=386:6></a> Christ loves those given Him by the Father, and will come and receive them to Himself that they may be with Him in the Father's house.<a name=386:7></a> God loved Israel and would have them in His land; and the same principle applies now.<a name=386:8></a> "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, .<a name=386:9></a>.<a name=386:10></a>.<a name=386:11></a> and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=386:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a comfort to know that our lack of apprehension cannot alter the disposition of God toward us; and it is a great thing when we have come to this point, "we have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=386:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark how love works.<a name=386:14></a> If you have a bit of love to a fellow christian, it is a proof that God loves you, for if God did not love you, you never would love a christian.<a name=386:15></a> The fact is that you have had some little apprehension of the love of God, and hence you love what is of God; and if you find a person begotten of God, you love that person because he is begotten of God, and you have thus proof that you are loved of God.<a name=386:16></a> We have thus seen the bearing of love to us in

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one point more, and that is, "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment".<a name=387:3></a> And it is made perfect in this way, that "as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=387:4></a> I think you get in this the fulfilment of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>"I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them".<a name=387:5></a>

		My thought is to say a few words in regard of Enoch.<a name=433:4></a> One may, without any great stretch of imagination, speak of Enoch as typical of the church.<a name=433:5></a> The prominent point that comes out in connection with Enoch is translation; and that is a truth which properly belongs to the church.<a name=433:6></a> It is not a truth in connection with Israel.<a name=433:7></a> The truth in connection with Israel is that death will be swallowed up in victory; but the church, like Enoch, is waiting for translation.<a name=433:8></a> The first intimation of translation is in Enoch.<a name=433:9></a> "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death".<a name=433:10></a> He was not to pass through death.<a name=433:11></a> It was to be shown how completely God would triumph over death; so the church as waiting for Christ does not pass through death.<a name=433:12></a> The Lord refers, I think, to this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>; He says, "As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will".<a name=433:13></a> He does not, as to Himself, speak there of raising, but of quickening.<a name=433:14></a> The same thought comes out in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>"As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive"; the apostle does not say raised.<a name=433:15></a> "Every man in his own order; Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming".<a name=433:16></a> They will be quickened.<a name=433:17></a> I might quote other passages to the same effect; what is peculiar to the church is the expectation of translation at the coming of the Lord.<a name=433:18></a>

		It is remarkable that before the flood you get the first principles of the world to come.<a name=433:19></a> They came out by faith.<a name=433:20></a> Men accepted light from God; that is what faith always means.<a name=433:21></a> The principle came out in Abel of acceptance through sacrifice, and that is, so

		In Enoch we get, as we have seen, the principle of translation, which makes him typical of the church, which has its place in connection with the world to come.<a name=434:8></a> The church is the heavenly city; the city of heavenly rule.<a name=434:9></a> It comes down "out of heaven from God, having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious"; and the nations of the earth walk in the light of it.<a name=434:10></a> Of course while the Lord tarries His people die; that is true in general, but the expectation of the church is properly the rapture.<a name=434:11></a>

		I think Enoch had faith as to his translation.<a name=435:2></a> What I mean is that God gave him light about it.<a name=435:3></a> Man could not have faith if God did not give him light, man cannot originate faith: if a man believes, he believes because God has given him light as to things.<a name=435:4></a> It is stated in commenting on Enoch, "Without faith it is impossible to please him".<a name=435:5></a> If you do not accept light from God it is impossible to please Him.<a name=435:6></a> Light may be presented to people and not accepted, but they cannot please God without it.<a name=435:7></a> Faith is the first principle as to pleasing God; we <i>believe</i> "that he is", we do not arrive at it by reasoning.<a name=435:8></a> God has been pleased to make Himself known, and therefore it is by faith we reach the result that God "is"; that is, He exists, and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.<a name=435:9></a> Those are the first principles of faith.<a name=435:10></a> I might say one word further, and that is, God's reward is not connected with this world; He brings in His reward outside of the world.<a name=435:11></a> Enoch was translated, and so it is in regard to the church.<a name=435:12></a> I do not expect any reward from God in connection with this course of the world.<a name=435:13></a> Moses got no reward in connection with this world.<a name=435:14></a> He died without entering the promised land, but "he had respect unto the recompense of the reward".<a name=435:15></a> God's reward comes in outside of the world.<a name=435:16></a> God does not come in to make a man distinguished in this world, but He has a reward for the man that seeks Him.<a name=435:17></a> I think that is our position; we believe that God is; and that God is the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.<a name=435:18></a> God has pleasure in being sought of man, and will reward those that seek Him.<a name=435:19></a> That is a first principle of God's dealings in grace with men.<a name=435:20></a>

		Now Enoch walked with God.<a name=435:21></a> That is a simple thing and you can understand what it means; his

		mind was in accord with God.<a name=436:1></a> Scripture raises the question, "Can two walk together except they be agreed?<a name=436:2></a>" He was agreed with God.<a name=436:3></a> I have read the prophecy of Enoch, which is recorded in Jude, and I think you will see the point of agreement with God.<a name=436:4></a> It was in this that Enoch felt the world would not do for God, and therefore he prophesied of the coming of the Lord to execute judgment.<a name=436:5></a> He felt what soon was evidenced in the flood, that the world would not do for God.<a name=436:6></a> The world was obnoxious to God and hence it was that God interfered in judgment.<a name=436:7></a> But Enoch prophesied not of the flood, but of the coming of the Lord with ten thousands of His saints to execute judgment upon the ungodly.<a name=436:8></a> That prophecy has never been fulfilled.<a name=436:9></a> But it was felt in that early day that the world was obnoxious to God.<a name=436:10></a> If we are agreed in mind with God we feel that the world is contrary to God.<a name=436:11></a> Then you must walk with God or you cannot expect God to walk with you.<a name=436:12></a> The path of many people down here is a tortuous one; a tortuous path will not suit God at all.<a name=436:13></a> God does not vary, He goes on and we must walk with Him; we cannot expect God to put any sanction upon our crooked ways, if you walk with God your ways must be straight, because God's ways are always straight.<a name=436:14></a> He always goes straight before Him; there is nothing crooked or deviating in His ways.<a name=436:15></a> His ways are righteous ways, and you must walk with God according to them.<a name=436:16></a> "Enoch walked with God".<a name=436:17></a> He walked with God in righteousness, and the effect of it was that he prophesied of the coming of the Lord.<a name=436:18></a> Now that is the path of the church.<a name=436:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have become the servants of righteousness and God has indicated the path to us.<a name=436:20></a> God has not only in grace declared His righteousness in the gospel, but also has declared His path for us; and that is set forth, in a sense, in baptism.<a name=436:21></a> Baptism has great importance in the significance of it.<a name=436:22></a> I think God indicates in it

		His path for the saints, and we have to come to it.<a name=437:1></a> We are buried with Christ by baptism unto death, that we might be hid from the world and sin.<a name=437:2></a> Hence if you find a christian seeking to be conspicuous in the world, he is not walking with God, he has not come back to the truth of his baptism; I think people have to take that into account.<a name=437:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been said in regard to the Lord Jesus that His path in this world was a path of activity in obscurity, and that is very much the path in which the christian is called to walk with God.<a name=437:4></a> It was in measure fulfilled in Enoch, and I think our testimony is the testimony of Enoch.<a name=437:5></a> The more faithful we are, the more we shall be disposed to bear testimony that the Lord is coming with ten thousands of His saints.<a name=437:6></a> Christ is at the right hand of God, crowned with glory and honour, but is not always to continue there; He is coming again.<a name=437:7></a> There is grace for man in the meantime through the gospel, but the church bears testimony to the coming of the Lord in judgment, because it is in accord with God's mind.<a name=437:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to another point in regard to Enoch, and that is "before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God".<a name=437:9></a> The same is in principle true as to the church, it is for His pleasure.<a name=437:10></a> If you refer to <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a> - 16, you will see that God effects what is for His pleasure.<a name=437:11></a> Enoch before his translation pleased God, and the fact is that God translates what pleases Him; Enoch pleased God, and God translated him.<a name=437:12></a> So, too, the church is here for God's pleasure and hence God translates it.<a name=437:13></a> In the meantime He works in us to will and to do of His good pleasure.<a name=437:14></a> It is a wonderful thought that God should have pleasure in anything in the midst of a sinful world; but God has wrought that there may be that which is for His pleasure.<a name=437:15></a> Enoch was not, as a man, more for God's pleasure than anybody else, but God wrought in Enoch that he might be for God's pleasure

	<div class="paragraph">
		and hence God translated him.<a name=438:1></a> It is virtually God saying, 'I will dispense altogether with the judgment of death, and will take that man'.<a name=438:2></a> God foresaw that death would be annulled in Christ's death, and therefore translated Enoch.<a name=438:3></a> Now death has been annulled -- He "death by dying slew", and God says, I will produce that upon earth that shall be for My pleasure, and will translate what pleases Me.<a name=438:4></a> That is the course which God has taken in regard to the church: "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure".<a name=438:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an extraordinary thing that we can be here for God's pleasure.<a name=438:6></a> You see the idea of it coming out in the passage I referred to: "Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation".<a name=438:7></a> A generation blameless, and harmless, here in the world, not doing great things, but "sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation"; like Enoch and Noah, "among whom ye shine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life".<a name=438:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I understand it to indicate entire separation from the spirit of things around us, that in the midst of it we may be shining as lights in the light of God, at the same time holding forth the word of life.<a name=438:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is like what Christ was in the world; He was of God, God's Son, and God's servant, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, shining as light in the world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=438:10></a> That is the true place for the church.<a name=438:11></a> God has wrought that there may be a generation of Him, and according to Him, which pleases Him, and has given us the marks of that generation, and we ought to be exercised to answer to it.<a name=438:12></a> It is God that worketh in you that you may be in accord with Him, to do of His good pleasure.<a name=438:13></a>

		A point is that the apostle might have his joy in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the saints.<a name=439:1></a> I think the apostle ought to have his joy in us.<a name=439:2></a> The apostle has passed away long ago, but I think that he is to have joy in us.<a name=439:3></a> If we are answering to the mind of God at all, it is in a sense through the work of the apostle, for he has, through suffering, given us the mind of God about the saints, and if we answer to that mind it will be for rejoicing to the apostle in the day of Christ, that he had not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.<a name=439:4></a> I can scarcely bring anything more important before you than the thought that God will have here when Christ comes that which is blameless and harmless, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.<a name=439:5></a> He will have that here for His pleasure.<a name=439:6></a> All that He works is for His pleasure, and nothing else is.<a name=439:7></a> The truth of Enoch has come to pass in the church; that is, we walk with God, and please God, for God worketh in us to will and to do of His good pleasure.<a name=439:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Philippians in measure answered to the mind of the apostle.<a name=439:9></a> It is noticeable that they were an obscure company.<a name=439:10></a> They were not like the Corinthians who were of some account in the world.<a name=439:11></a> Most here would remember the circumstances under which the apostle went to Philippi.<a name=439:12></a> He was called there by the vision of the man of Macedonia, who said, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us", and when he went there it resulted only in the conversion of the Philippian jailor and the enlightenment of a few women.<a name=439:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is that they were a poor company, but a liberal company.<a name=439:14></a> It is remarkable that these two things should go together.<a name=439:15></a> On the other hand, the Corinthians were more or less a wealthy company, but not a liberal company.<a name=439:16></a> The apostle speaks of the great poverty of the Philippians and of the riches of their liberality; the fact was it was the result of Christ's work in them.<a name=439:17></a> It was God working in them both to will and to do of His good pleasure.<a name=439:18></a> There

		were little differences among individuals and an object of the apostle's writing was to soothe these that they might complete his joy.<a name=440:1></a> They had communicated to him and thus made manifest their fellowship with him in the gospel.<a name=440:2></a> The apostle appeals to them, "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love,, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy", and to fulfil his joy was to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure, and then he tells them what was according to the pleasure of God so that they might be ready for translation.<a name=440:3></a> It is a great thing that the church should be here practically in suitability for presentation.<a name=440:4></a> Scripture does not talk exactly of death and resurrection as the christian's expectation, but gives the idea of presentation.<a name=440:5></a> Christ "loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing".<a name=440:6></a> We take the thought of that in, and believe what Christ is going to do; we should desire to be without spot or wrinkle; we should be anxious to answer to the mind of Christ, to be suitable for presentation when Christ comes.<a name=440:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the apostle speaks of another class and he speaks in strong terms; he refers to many who were enemies of the cross of Christ.<a name=440:8></a> They minded earthly things, "Whose end is destruction", because there was nothing of divine life in them, "who mind earthly things".<a name=440:9></a> What I understand by this is the working of unsubdued flesh, hence it is they were the enemies of the cross of Christ.<a name=440:10></a> If a christian allows the flesh to rule, it is evident that so far that man is an enemy of the cross of Christ.<a name=440:11></a> "They that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts"; unsubdued flesh puts you in the position of an enemy

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says to the Colossians, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=441:5></a> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth, for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=441:6></a> I think, in the presence of that, you can understand that our interests are in heaven, and the bearing of that on me here is that I am a stranger and pilgrim on earth, not in accord with the course of things down here, from the fact that my associations are in heaven.<a name=441:7></a> I am in accord with God, and seeking here to be for His pleasure, conscious that my associations are where He is, and when I get to heaven I shall not be a stranger there.<a name=441:8></a> In one sense I shall, but in another not, because I shall find a welcome there; it is wonderful that when we get to heaven we shall be welcomed.<a name=441:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of our citizenship being in heaven is that "we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=441:10></a> That is as Saviour of the body.<a name=441:11></a> He is sitting now at the right hand of God, and that is the proof and evidence that His offering work is done; there is no more to be done, therefore Christ, as Priest, sits, but the moment He rises it is to exercise His great power by which He is able to subdue all things unto Himself.<a name=441:12></a> All power is in the hand of Christ; the first movement of that power is toward the saints who are here; that is, the church.<a name=441:13></a> He will change these bodies of humiliation that they may be fashioned like unto His body of

		It has been a comfort to me to think that when I set eyes on Christ I shall be like Him to see Him.<a name=442:2></a> It is not that I see Him to be like Him, but I am made like Him, in order that I might see Him.<a name=442:3></a> In the meantime it is our expectation and faith.<a name=442:4></a> God has given us that faith.<a name=442:5></a> We are not looking to die.<a name=442:6></a> We are looking for translation, for the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven as Saviour, not as Judge, but as Saviour, for "as he is so are we in this world".<a name=442:7></a> The saints are here for the pleasure of God; if they answer to the work of God in them, they are practically for His pleasure; and because they are for His pleasure, God will translate them when the moment comes.<a name=442:8></a>

		I have sometimes thought that one cannot rightly understand the assembly if one does not apprehend what the Lord was in the midst of His disciples when here upon earth.<a name=444:1></a> I suppose that is the key to the truth of the assembly.<a name=444:2></a> The idea which I would express is found in a verse which occurs in the early part of this chapter, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us .<a name=444:3></a>.<a name=444:4></a>.<a name=444:5></a> full of grace and truth".<a name=444:6></a> That is, the moment you get the thought of the Word become flesh, of a divine Person having come into the estate of man, another truth comes out, He "dwelt among us .<a name=444:7></a>.<a name=444:8></a>.<a name=444:9></a> full of grace and truth".<a name=444:10></a> Here we have, in principle, the beginning of the assembly, for it teaches this great and important lesson, that the pleasure of a divine Person was to dwell among men.<a name=444:11></a> He was among them full of grace and truth, and if <i>full</i> there was nothing else there.<a name=444:12></a> If you do not see this you will hardly understand the truth of the assembly.<a name=444:13></a>

		The beginning of all this was when Christ came here to earth, and it was that thought which led me to take up this passage.<a name=445:4></a> My first point is to call your attention to the contrast between John the baptist and his disciples.<a name=445:5></a> I judge that John the baptist represented the old, and the disciples of John the new, and it is very important to observe the distinction; each is perfect in its place.<a name=445:6></a> The new has its character and so has the old, but the character of the new is much more blessed than that of the old.<a name=445:7></a> You get this indicated in an expression of the Lord Himself.<a name=445:8></a> He speaks of the law and the prophets having been until John, and of there being none greater than John, but adds, the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.<a name=445:9></a> Those that went before were not to be made perfect without us; God had provided some better thing for us, as we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=445:10></a> That chapter brings before us the different testimonies to faith, but we have come into better things; we have come into the new, while at the same time we have the good of the old.<a name=445:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to the subject before us, I said that John the baptist represented the old, and the disciples who followed Jesus the new.<a name=445:12></a> This is seen in that John, in a sense, stands in the distance; he never dwells with Jesus, although he is in relation to Him.<a name=445:13></a> John had his place, and that was that he pointed to Jesus.<a name=445:14></a> He was the termination of the prophetic line; he was the greatest and last of the prophets, and all that line pointed to Jesus.<a name=445:15></a> John testifies, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=445:16></a> He came on that line pointing to Jesus, and announcing the kingdom as at hand.<a name=445:17></a>

		Had there been in that day souls who were really instructed in the prophetic testimony they would have recognised Christ when He came.<a name=446:1></a> Jesus came according to the testimony of prophecy.<a name=446:2></a> Now, though John the baptist was a voice preparing for Christ, we do not read of John being in the intimate company of Christ.<a name=446:3></a> You get a beautiful witness of John a little later on in chapter 3: 25 - 32.<a name=446:4></a> I refer to that passage because it is a pretty clear intimation on the part of John himself as to the place which he had.<a name=446:5></a> He is not the bridegroom.<a name=446:6></a> This is equivalent to saying that he had no title to the bride.<a name=446:7></a> But he is a friend of the Bridegroom, which standeth and heareth His voice.<a name=446:8></a> He had been sent in the way of testimony, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord".<a name=446:9></a> Subsequently he is cast into prison and sends disciples to Jesus to ask the question, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?<a name=446:10></a>" His faith was in a measure obscured in prison, but the Lord vindicates John and challenges the people in regard to him.<a name=446:11></a> John was a child of wisdom.<a name=446:12></a> Others, too, were children of wisdom, but he was one.<a name=446:13></a> He came in the way of mourning, and the people did not lament; Christ came in the way of piping, and they did not dance.<a name=446:14></a> People were not responsive to the one or the other.<a name=446:15></a> I want now to speak on the contrast to all that.<a name=446:16></a>

		I have said that when a divine Person comes down here He finds His pleasure in dwelling among men.<a name=446:17></a> The disciples of John the baptist leave John for Christ, and rightly so, too, because it proved that they were affected by the witness of John.<a name=446:18></a> They were not going to set John the baptist against Christ, and anyone who is affected by the testimony of Scripture will surely give to Christ His true place.<a name=446:19></a> He will recognise that Christ must have the one place, and that there cannot be any competitor, neither husband nor wife, nor children nor parents, nor anything.<a name=446:20></a> Christ is to

		In the case of the two disciples who left John, his testimony had done its work, and now they get a word from the Lord, who says, "What seek ye?<a name=447:2></a>" They say, "Where dwellest thou?<a name=447:3></a>" and He answers, "Come and see".<a name=447:4></a> Jesus thus encourages them.<a name=447:5></a> You never really know a person until you see him at home.<a name=447:6></a> They came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day.<a name=447:7></a> This brings out the pleasure of a divine Person in the company of men.<a name=447:8></a> It was the beginning of what is said in the earlier part of the chapter, He dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.<a name=447:9></a> It is not a question here of what He taught them, but rather of His attitude toward them.<a name=447:10></a> The disciples got support from Him, for they had to encounter opposition on the part of all around; but, at the same time, they had also all the light that was in Christ; He was full of truth.<a name=447:11></a> He was the perfect expression of God among them; all that could be known of God was seen and heard in Him.<a name=447:12></a> He was the fulfilment of law and prophets, and His presence had the most profound effect upon those around Him.<a name=447:13></a> They had the consciousness at least of what His attitude was toward them.<a name=447:14></a>

		There would not be much difficulty in dwelling in the company of a person full of grace and truth.<a name=447:15></a> No doubt it made the disciples often ashamed of themselves, and the same thing would be true as to us, for we find so little grace in ourselves.<a name=447:16></a> There was not simply grace, but also fulness of truth.<a name=447:17></a> I understand by truth all that may be known of God.<a name=447:18></a>

		Now I want to bring before you that what is spoken of here in regard to the Jews is equally true of all christians; it is spoken to Jews for the reason that Peter was the apostle of the circumcision.<a name=455:10></a> The Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>gave Peter a special charge in regard to His sheep and lambs.<a name=455:11></a> That belonged to Peter; no one else had the same commission.<a name=455:12></a> The apostle to the gentiles was Paul; Peter never was exactly, but he writes to believing Jews as christians, and what is true of christian Jews is true of christian gentiles.<a name=455:13></a> As believing in Christ you come into exactly the same privileges as the Jews came into; no difference can be made in that respect.<a name=455:14></a> There is no difference between Jew and gentile when they are christians.<a name=455:15></a> The middle wall of partition is broken down and the privileges are common.<a name=455:16></a> So that the spiritual house and the holy priesthood belong to both.<a name=455:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of the first chapter you will see there are three points spoken of as true of saints (verses 15, 18, 23), and another in chapter 2 (verses 2, 3), and in these believers are referred to individually.<a name=455:18></a> After that they

	<div class="paragraph">
		The three things spoken of in the end of the first chapter are that they were called, they were redeemed, and they were born again; that, of course, applies to every christian individually.<a name=456:3></a> They had been called of God and were to be holy; they were not exactly volunteers as christians, but they had been called of God.<a name=456:4></a> The gospel is the call of God; it is God calling souls out of the world to Himself.<a name=456:5></a> Christ gave Himself for us that He might deliver us out of this present evil world, and the call of the gospel is to that end, for the reason that God is going to judge the world.<a name=456:6></a> God called Abraham out of country, kindred, and father's house, and now God is calling souls by the gospel out of the world.<a name=456:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The three thoughts to which I have referred must apply to every one of us individually.<a name=456:8></a> We should not be christians if these three things were not true of us; it is the foundation on which the apostle addresses the saints.<a name=456:9></a> He could not have taken up what comes out in the beginning of the second chapter apart from that foundation.<a name=456:10></a> Every christian is called and redeemed, and he is born again of incorruptible seed; that is, he has derived his moral being direct from God Himself; that is the idea of being born again.<a name=456:11></a> Naturally I derive a moral being from my parents, but the christian has derived it from God.<a name=456:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 2 we have the exhortation, "As newborn babes, desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is good".<a name=456:13></a> That is what individually we are to be set upon, that we grow up to salvation.<a name=456:14></a> Salvation in its realisation and practical bearing is a question of growth, and to this end we desire the sincere milk of the word, having tasted that the Lord is gracious.<a name=456:15></a> The object of the gospel is

		Now I will speak of what is more collective as seen in verses 4 - 9.<a name=457:4></a> You get a remarkable expression in verse 4, "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious".<a name=457:5></a> I understand that verse to indicate the soul's apprehension of the Lord in a new light.<a name=457:6></a> It had been said, "If so be ye have tasted that <i>the Lord</i> is gracious", but there is another light in which you can apprehend Christ, and that is not simply as Lord, but as the living Stone; and the living stone indicates the place which He has seen fit to take in connection with man.<a name=457:7></a> If I look at Him as Lord, He is on the behalf of God, fulfilling what we find in Scripture, "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him".<a name=457:8></a> He is administrator in the ways of God.<a name=457:9></a> He is Lord, to subdue everything for the glory of God the Father.<a name=457:10></a> Every tongue, of things in heaven and on earth and things under the earth, is to confess that He is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<a name=457:11></a> But the living stone indicates the place which Christ takes in regard to man.<a name=457:12></a> He is the foundation stone of a structure built up of men, and we apprehend Him in that light.<a name=457:13></a> Coming to Him indicates, so far as I can understand, a sense in the soul of the grace of Christ seen in the place taken in connection with man.<a name=457:14></a> And we, too, are stones and a building of which He is the foundation.<a name=457:15></a> You will never understand the grace of Christ if you do not see that.<a name=457:16></a> Very many who own Christ as Lord

		The living Stone was disallowed indeed of men.<a name=458:5></a> The Jews disallowed Him.<a name=458:6></a> He was rejected on the one hand, but on the other hand chosen of God and precious.<a name=458:7></a> The greatest act of disallowance on the part of men was death, and God raised Him, proving that He was chosen of God and precious.<a name=458:8></a> I have no doubt the passage brings Christ before us as risen, and in resurrection He takes a place in identification with His people down here.<a name=458:9></a> You get the same idea elsewhere.<a name=458:10></a> "In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=458:11></a> Christ is Himself spoken of as the living Stone, then it is that you get the recognition of those who come to Him as living stones.<a name=458:12></a> They are looked at as living stones.<a name=458:13></a> They have come away from man and from man's order -- Judaism, or christianised Judaism now in the world -- and they have come to the living Stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious, for that is what Christ is.<a name=458:14></a> It is the soul leaving the world for Christ, and apprehending Him as the foundation of an edifice which God is building.<a name=458:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not understand spiritual sacrifices to describe worship in the highest sense: sacrifices (except the blood on the day of atonement) were not carried into the house.<a name=460:7></a> What I understand by sacrifices are rather the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to God, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name; and there is another character of sacrifices, that is, doing good and communicating, and with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<a name=460:8></a> God is no longer approached with material sacrifices such as were offered by the priesthood in Israel; the time for that is past; it is spiritual sacrifices, because the house is spiritual and the priesthood is holy, sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<a name=460:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to say a few words further as to what there is before men (verses 7 - 10): "A chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people", is what christians are before men.<a name=461:7></a> It is what they are as God's testimony; in a certain sense it is what Israel should have been.<a name=461:8></a> Christians are here to show forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into His marvellous light.<a name=461:9></a> Our witness in the presence of man is the fruit of being in God's marvellous light.<a name=461:10></a> God has seen fit to reveal Himself, and has called us out of darkness into the light of His love.<a name=461:11></a> God has given to us the Holy Spirit in order that we may know Him, and our testimony is that we are in His light here in the world.<a name=461:12></a> The testimony of christians is not simply in what they say, but in what they are; nothing in a christian should be inconsistent with the light of God.<a name=461:13></a> If I am conscious of the light of God it has its effect on all my ways in detail in this world.<a name=461:14></a> If I were to resort to crooked or underhand ways it would only prove that I am not in the light of God.<a name=461:15></a> Your ways must be according to the light into which it has pleased God to bring you.<a name=461:16></a> Nothing can

		Being in the light of God, we grow in the knowledge of God, at the same time bearing fruit, showing forth His virtues who has called us out of darkness into His marvellous light; able to witness of the grace, the righteousness, the faithfulness, and the love of God.<a name=462:5></a> I want to be so impressed with the virtues and goodness of God that I may myself be out of sight, and that nothing should be seen in me but the reflection of what is of God.<a name=462:6></a>

		That will be the case in the heavenly city when it comes down from God out of heaven.<a name=462:7></a> It has the glory of God and her light is as of a stone most precious, it is all reflected light; so with christians, they are a holy nation, a peculiar people, to show forth the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvellous light.<a name=462:8></a>

		Now, these are divine thoughts; the thoughts of God with regard to His people.<a name=462:9></a> He has called us and redeemed us, and we are born again, and have tasted that the Lord is gracious, and I trust have come to the living Stone.<a name=462:10></a> It is a great thing to have come to the living Stone; man has refused the living Stone, and you have then come away from man.<a name=462:11></a> You have come to Him who is not ashamed to be identified with man, not ashamed to call us brethren.<a name=462:12></a> When you have come to Him as the living Stone then it is you begin to realise what the privileges of the christian really are.<a name=462:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another point.<a name=465:4></a> When God has written, then He proposes to dwell, and in connection with dwelling He makes known His covenant; that was the order of things in regard to the children of Israel.<a name=465:5></a> The injunction after the writing on the tables of stone was to prepare Him a dwelling-place.<a name=465:6></a> He brings them to Himself and then He makes known to them in detail the terms on which they were to be with Him.<a name=465:7></a>

		Everyone knows what the letter of Scripture is, but if you were to ask what the spirit of Scripture is, I would say the love of God toward man, that which comes to light in the new covenant.<a name=468:4></a> If you look at things in detail, Christ came here in the love of God.<a name=468:5></a> He came in to accomplish redemption, to put away what had come in by man.<a name=468:6></a> God loved man.<a name=468:7></a> I do not think the idea is exactly that God loved the sinner, but that God loved man.<a name=468:8></a> "After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared".<a name=468:9></a> Man had departed from God and fallen into sin, and death had come into the world.<a name=468:10></a> In due time the Son of God came forth, made of a woman, made under the law, in order that He might remove what had come in by the man that God had created, and at the same time as the expression of the love of God towards man.<a name=468:11></a> Christ came into the world to save sinners, but also that in Him God might express His love toward man.<a name=468:12></a> He came here with an object, and that was that He might taste death for everything.<a name=468:13></a> He came, too, to put sin away.<a name=468:14></a> "Once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself".<a name=468:15></a> Sin and death had come in by man, and by man sin and death were to be put away.<a name=468:16></a> That is what in principle Christ effected in the work of the cross, and now God has declared in the presence of the universe that the One who accomplished that work is none other than the Son of God.<a name=468:17></a> The glory of Christ is the witness which God has been pleased to give of this, and the Holy Spirit has come down

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is only in Christ that you can learn the terms of the new covenant.<a name=470:3></a> If you take in the blessed truth that the One who died on the cross, but who is now at the right hand of God, is the Son of God, you will understand God's disposition to man.<a name=470:4></a> It can only be made good in those who believe; those who do not believe do not come into it.<a name=470:5></a> If man does not believe the gospel, you can very well understand he does not come into the grace of God -- that being the subject of grace, he comes into the light of divine love as expressed in the Son of God at the right hand of God, and the covenant is the ministration of righteousness, because Christ is at the right hand of God without our sins.<a name=470:6></a> He has gone back to God.<a name=470:7></a> The sins are put away, but the love abides, and we get the gain of the covenant in the presence of the Holy Spirit in the believer.<a name=470:8></a> "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us".<a name=470:9></a> He instructs the christian in the teaching of the glory of the Lord.<a name=470:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical result to us is that there is no condemnation, there are no sins.<a name=470:11></a> We have redemption by His blood, the forgiveness of sins, because the One in whom the covenant is established is in the glory of God without our sins, and the perfect expression of love toward us, so that the more you come into the light of the glory of Christ the more you are instructed in the love of God, and the love of God is no new thing.<a name=470:12></a> God loved the world, and His kindness and love were toward man.<a name=470:13></a> But they could not come out until what man had brought in had been removed, and, that having been removed, the love of God has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before all this came out, God's wisdom was seen in testing man to see if there was any element of good in him, but this point has been demonstrated, and in the truth of the gospel we get the light of the love of God toward man.<a name=471:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thought sometimes that the fall of man was a grief to God, because God had set His love on man.<a name=471:4></a> Why should He not do so, for He is sovereign?<a name=471:5></a> But God had resources, for it is impossible that God should be baffled.<a name=471:6></a> Christ was ever the wisdom of God.<a name=471:7></a> In due time He came forth as man to undo the work of the enemy.<a name=471:8></a> He bore our sins on the cross, then He goes to the right hand of God, and is there the expression of God's love toward us; and if it were possible for you and me to get up to heaven to where Christ is, we should only become more sensible of the love of God toward us.<a name=471:9></a> Hence, love and glory go together.<a name=471:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think anyone can see what an exceedingly simple thing the new covenant is; it is really that God's disposition toward those who believe is that love which was in His heart toward man from the outset, only it was hindered from coming out; but when the fulness of the time was come, that love comes out in the Son of God, and we are brought into the good of that love by the Holy Spirit given to us.<a name=471:11></a> That is what I understand to be the spirit of the new covenant.<a name=471:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt the kingdom will be established in the light of God's love towards man, and the eternal state in which righteousness dwells is the full expression of the same.<a name=471:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another word in connection with this, that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty,

		<a name=472>[Page 472]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for the nearer you are to glory the more sure you are of love.<a name=472:1></a> Hence, where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.<a name=472:2></a> You have never known liberty except in the presence of love; even grace will not give liberty.<a name=472:3></a> I have had acts of grace shown me in my lifetime, but I think I should not be tempted to approach a man freely who had shown me grace; but on the other hand, if I knew that act of grace was the fruit of love that lay behind it, I think I would have liberty with that person.<a name=472:4></a> If you are in the light of love, there is liberty.<a name=472:5></a> You have boldness with God now, because you are acquainted with His love.<a name=472:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And we go a point further, "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory".<a name=472:7></a> The thought is that being in the light of God's love we are continually stepping up.<a name=472:8></a> We are changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=472:9></a> There is moral elevation.<a name=472:10></a> We are more at liberty from everything which once detained us, because the love of God is the best thing we can have, and in having it we are independent of things down here.<a name=472:11></a> If you are resting on props here, it is a proof that you are but poorly acquainted with the love of God, and God would have you to become more in accord with the scene of love where Christ is in glory.<a name=472:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not want to go further, because, after all, if one simple point comes to us it is great gain, and I think God teaches us in that way; and the one point for every one of us is acquaintance with the love of God, for no good thing could God withhold from those whom He loves: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him".<a name=472:13></a> And why do you love God?<a name=472:14></a> Because you have learned that He loved you.<a name=472:15></a> There is a bright future, but there is a bright present association with Christ now.<a name=472:16></a> The bright future is to be in God's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to say a few words in connection with the four titles or designations by which the Lord speaks of Himself in the passage I read.<a name=474:1></a> You continually find in the Lord's discourses, recorded in John's writings, a gradual progress, very often interrupted by man; but for all this the Lord does not turn aside.<a name=474:2></a> He does not stop to occupy Himself with what man presented, but steadily pursues His point, and hence the progress in the unfolding of the truth.<a name=474:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the early part of this chapter, the Lord speaks of Himself in four ways in relation to the sheep.<a name=474:4></a> First, He is the Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=474:5></a> Secondly, He is the door of the sheep.<a name=474:6></a> Thirdly, He is the good Shepherd.<a name=474:7></a> Lastly, He is the one Shepherd.<a name=474:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I purpose to take up the four ways in which the Lord thus speaks of Himself, and to bring before you what is connected with each, and you will see without difficulty that there is progress, till you are brought to the point that there is one flock and one shepherd.<a name=474:9></a> And then, further, Christ says, "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand".<a name=474:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point is that He is the Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=474:11></a> Christ stood thus in relation to the sheep that were in the midst of God's earthly people.<a name=474:12></a> It has been said very often in connection with this gospel that the Jew is looked upon from the outset as reprobate.<a name=474:13></a> In the first chapter it says, "He came unto his own, and his own received him not".<a name=474:14></a> The Jew was virtually apostate.<a name=474:15></a> The feasts are not spoken of as the feasts of Jehovah, but of the Jews; and the Jew is in this gospel commonly designated as "the world".<a name=474:16></a> In chapter 16 we have an instance of this; and indeed

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of this chapter 10 Christ designates Himself as the Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=475:4></a> In the midst of the apostasy there were those who were sheep in the counsel and purpose of God, and Christ stood in relation to such.<a name=475:5></a> They were in the fold.<a name=475:6></a> I take the fold to indicate an enclosure, and the enclosure had been divinely appointed.<a name=475:7></a> It was the place where the sheep were, and hence Christ came into the enclosure.<a name=475:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He came into the fold that He might lead the sheep out.<a name=475:9></a> He did not come into the fold to abide there, but in leading out the sheep He went before them.<a name=475:10></a> No one could leave the fold till Christ left it, and when He left the fold then the sheep followed.<a name=475:11></a> He opened the way out.<a name=475:12></a> You get a figure of this in the previous chapter, in the case of the blind man who got his eyes opened.<a name=475:13></a> He was put out of the fold, but Christ had gone, in a sense, before him.<a name=475:14></a> Literally Christ left the fold in death, and by that the way was open for the sheep to follow Him out of the fold.<a name=475:15></a> The idea of an enclosure came to an end in the death of Christ.<a name=475:16></a> The middle wall of partition that separated the Jew was broken down.<a name=475:17></a> The fold was the system of ordinances under which the people of God had been kept guarded.<a name=475:18></a> "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.<a name=475:19></a> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.<a name=475:20></a> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=475:21></a> It was a system that existed till the faith came in.<a name=475:22></a> When the faith came in, based on the death and resurrection of Christ, then the sheep were led out of the fold.<a name=475:23></a>

		We come now to the second point (verses 7 - 10).<a name=477:3></a> In this passage we get no longer the idea of a fold, but that Christ is the door of the sheep.<a name=477:4></a> In that sense He is a test to which the sheep answer.<a name=477:5></a> The word is, "If any man hear my voice".<a name=477:6></a> It is a question of the discernment of Christ as the light of God.<a name=477:7></a> The point raised is, "What think ye of Christ?<a name=477:8></a>" whether He has brought to us the light of God.<a name=477:9></a> In that sense He is the door of the sheep.<a name=477:10></a> The Jews were subjected to that test.<a name=477:11></a> Christ was the door of the sheep, and the question was raised whether they would enter in by Him.<a name=477:12></a> The Jew was tested, and in that sense men are tested still by the voice of Christ.<a name=477:13></a> The point is, "If any man hear my voice".<a name=477:14></a> Did Christ bring into the world the light of God, or are people content to remain in darkness, without light?<a name=477:15></a> Alas!<a name=477:16></a> many are content to remain in darkness, because their deeds are evil; on the other hand, the grace of God works, and the voice of Christ is heard, and they who enter in by Him are saved, and go in and out and find pasture.<a name=477:17></a>

		Now it is in its moral effects in the way of life that we recognise what is of Christ.<a name=477:18></a> "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly".<a name=477:19></a> Adam brought in death by sin.<a name=477:20></a> Christ brings in life both through righteousness and in view of righteousness.<a name=477:21></a> Life does not come in apart from righteousness, but by righteousness, and it comes in <i>for</i> righteousness.<a name=477:22></a> There is that which is morally right in connection with Christ, and if a man did truth he would recognise that Christ has come into the world to bring in the light of God.<a name=477:23></a> The Lord says, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world".<a name=477:24></a> Christ has brought life in through righteousness.<a name=477:25></a> Death lay upon man as the sentence of God, and till death was annulled there was no

	<div class="paragraph">
		A reference to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:13">Revelation  22:13</a> - 17 will serve to explain this.<a name=478:4></a> We should read in verse 14, "Blessed are they that <i>wash their robes</i> that they may have right to the tree of life", etc.<a name=478:5></a> The washing of their robes is that they may have right to the tree of life; then at the close of the book we have the appeal, "Let him that is athirst come.<a name=478:6></a> And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=478:7></a> How do they get the water of life freely?<a name=478:8></a> Never a person got the water of life except by coming to Christ.<a name=478:9></a> Christ alone gives the water of life.<a name=478:10></a> It brings to mind the words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=478:11></a> What has come to pass is this: that Christ has communicated the water of life, and we have drunk of it, have received the Spirit of life, and that water springs up in us to eternal life.<a name=478:12></a> Life has come to us through righteousness, that is, through the abolition of death, and has come in view of righteousness.<a name=478:13></a> That is, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit".<a name=478:14></a>

		It is a great thing to be delivered from the fold, to be no longer afraid of the wolf; that is, the fear of death, and of the power of the devil; for Christ has come that you might be saved, and there is the savour of life about the christian, he does not walk hateful and hating others.<a name=479:14></a> Righteousness is the proof and test of life.<a name=479:15></a> "He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous".<a name=479:16></a> It is the proof of a man being born of God.<a name=479:17></a> You are then a testimony to Christ.<a name=479:18></a> If you want an illustration of this you have it in the impotent man whom the Lord raised up at the pool of Bethesda.<a name=479:19></a> It was a testimony to the Jews that Christ came to raise up man.<a name=479:20></a>

		Now I pass on to the next point, and that is the good Shepherd.<a name=479:21></a> So far we have had that which applies to us individually, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23">Psalm  23</a>"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want".<a name=479:22></a> Now there are two points in this passage in connection with the good Shepherd.<a name=479:23></a> First, the proof to which the Lord

		appeals of His being the good Shepherd is that He lays down His life for the sheep, and then there is the statement, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep".<a name=480:1></a> Now this brings us, in a sense, to what is collective, and as an illustration of this I should refer to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=480:2></a> You get what the Lord speaks of in this passage completely verified there.<a name=480:3></a> He first makes Himself known to Mary, and after that He presents Himself to the disciples as the good Shepherd who had given His life for the sheep.<a name=480:4></a> He says in the midst of them, "Peace be unto you".<a name=480:5></a> They could not fail to recognise Him as entitled to the appellation of the good Shepherd.<a name=480:6></a> The word of peace was the fruit of His death.<a name=480:7></a> Redemption was accomplished, and the Lord comes into the company with the announcement of peace.<a name=480:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable that the Lord does not allow in the chapter (10) that His death is at the hand of man.<a name=480:9></a> His death is His own part according to the will of the Father.<a name=480:10></a> He says of His life, "No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<a name=480:11></a> I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.<a name=480:12></a> This commandment have I received of my Father".<a name=480:13></a> I would not say that His laying down His life was voluntary, because it was according to the will of the Father, but at the same time the hand of man is not allowed in it.<a name=480:14></a> It was the evidence that He was the good Shepherd.<a name=480:15></a> The place He takes as Head of the body is in the pre-eminence of love.<a name=480:16></a> If we recognise Christ as Head we think of Him as the One who laid down His life for us.<a name=480:17></a> We were all in the power of the enemy.<a name=480:18></a> Christ came in to make known to us the grace of God, to establish peace, that we might be delivered out of the hand of the enemy, and when all was effected the Lord came into the company of the sheep,

		who were outside the fold, gathered in an upper room, with doors closed for fear of the Jews, and He brought to them the tidings of peace; there was no one in that company but would have been free to give Christ His title as the good Shepherd.<a name=481:1></a>

		But further, the Lord says, "I .<a name=481:2></a>.<a name=481:3></a>.<a name=481:4></a> know my sheep and am known of mine.<a name=481:5></a> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father".<a name=481:6></a> We get the Father presented to us mediately through the Son.<a name=481:7></a> You know nothing about the Father except in the Son.<a name=481:8></a> The Son reveals the Father.<a name=481:9></a> The Lord Jesus says, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?<a name=481:10></a> he that hath seen me hath seen the Father".<a name=481:11></a> There is no difference morally between the Father and the Son.<a name=481:12></a> What the Father is in affection the Son is also.<a name=481:13></a> So the Son brings us into His own affection, and in doing so He brings us into the Father's affection.<a name=481:14></a> It is His pleasure to bring us into the circle of His own joy and affection, and in that way He separates us completely from the world.<a name=481:15></a> It is not simply that He has the claim of His death to be the good Shepherd, but He has a second title.<a name=481:16></a> He makes known to us the best thing He can make known.<a name=481:17></a> There is nothing to compare with the knowledge of the Father.<a name=481:18></a> That is what the Lord came to make known.<a name=481:19></a> He was here to declare His name and bring the disciples into the presence of the Father, and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>He says, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself", that is, to the Father's house.<a name=481:20></a> What He does as the good Shepherd is to bring us now to the Father's heart, but He comes again to bring us to the Father's house.<a name=481:21></a>

		If you understand anything about this, you can see how completely you are separated from the world by the light which Christ has brought in, and which is made effective in us.<a name=481:22></a> We know Him after the same order in the reciprocity of affection in which He knows the Father and the Father knows Him.<a name=481:23></a> It is heavenly

		One point more (verses 16 - 18, 27, 28).<a name=482:6></a> You see in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>the flock was there, but the flock had not attained the extent which God intended.<a name=482:7></a> There was not the gentile.<a name=482:8></a> I believe the truth here comes in to confirm the teaching of Paul.<a name=482:9></a> Each writer presents things in his own particular way.<a name=482:10></a> Of course each is led by the Spirit of God, but one confirms the teaching of another.<a name=482:11></a> Hence you get the thought of the gentile brought in by the Lord here.<a name=482:12></a> Hitherto He had been speaking in regard to the Jew, and this was made good in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>; but there was no gentile; but Christ had other sheep which were not of that fold, and He had to bring them, and there would be one flock, one Shepherd.<a name=482:13></a> Not two flocks, which was not according to the mind of God.<a name=482:14></a> The effort at division came in early, but was frustrated for the time in the grace of God; and the divine purpose was realised, there was to be one flock, one Shepherd.<a name=482:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more.<a name=482:16></a> Christ says further, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand".<a name=482:17></a> I believe that means, on the part of Christ, that He puts the sheep morally outside of death.<a name=482:18></a> It is substantially what you get in the writings of Paul in our being risen and quickened together with Christ.<a name=482:19></a> It is the thought of God to put His saints outside the realm of death, and there it is they have eternal life,

		and in regard of this Christ says, "I and my Father are one".<a name=483:1></a> They were perfectly one in counsel and thought.<a name=483:2></a> The Father gave the sheep to Christ, and following Him they leave the fold; they discern Him as the door of the sheep.<a name=483:3></a> He is to them the good Shepherd, and the Lord says now, "I give unto them eternal life".<a name=483:4></a> It is His own gift, indicating the place in which the assembly is set according to the will of God outside of death, and the workings of flesh, quickened together with Him in the divine nature, so that "I know my sheep, and am known of mine", is practically true.<a name=483:5></a> It is the reciprocity of affection between Christ and the sheep, as between the Father and the Son.<a name=483:6></a>

		I think you will see the passage is one of the deepest interest, and that in it there is a remarkable progress in the unfolding of the truth.<a name=483:7></a> The Lord began by speaking of what was applicable to the moment.<a name=483:8></a> The porter had opened the door, and He had come into the fold, but the Shepherd was not to be detained there.<a name=483:9></a> The law was not the purpose of God for the sheep, but sonship, and so it is said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly".<a name=483:10></a> If you prove that, you will go in and out, and find pasture in the midst of this dreary wilderness.<a name=483:11></a>

		It is a great thing to enter into the divine thought.<a name=483:12></a> We are in the midst of confusion, and if you go back to what was from the beginning you will refuse anything that is not of God.<a name=483:13></a> And you get help and grace from God to enable you in a path of comparative isolation to stand in that which was from the beginning, and there can be nothing more important than to go to the word and find what was the divine thought in the mission of Christ in coming into the world.<a name=483:14></a> And He has given effect to it in ascending up on high and giving the Holy Spirit.<a name=483:15></a> The living water is here, and

		May God give us to recognise what is due on our part to Christ, that He may have His own proper place in the saints, and our hearts be bowed in affection for the good Shepherd.<a name=484:2></a> That is what I would desire as the effect of all that has been said.<a name=484:3></a>
