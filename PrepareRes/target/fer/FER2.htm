		PREFATORY NOTE (to pages 3 - 104)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		IT has been thought well to preface these lectures with a few words of explanation.<a name=2:1></a> They include two series of lectures, the first delivered at Greenwich at the close of last year; and the second at Park Street, Islington, in the beginning of the present year.<a name=2:2></a> The connection between the two will be readily perceived; in a sense the second series precedes the first, though they are printed in order of delivery.<a name=2:3></a> The subject of the second series is the testimony of "The Christ", as pervading all the word of God.<a name=2:4></a> The first seeks to set forth that which in Christians is appropriate to their part in the testimony, for it must be remembered that the testimony is living, and bound up with the power of the Spirit of God in believers.<a name=2:5></a> In view of the coming of the Lord, may God be pleased to awaken in all a deeper interest in the testimony, as being the witness of that which He will shortly display.<a name=2:6></a>

		Everybody should be prepared to admit that it is extremely important that we should understand <i>where</i> we are, and <i>why</i> we are there.<a name=3:1></a> These are two serious considerations.<a name=3:2></a> It is a poor thing to be in any position religiously and not to know why you are there.<a name=3:3></a> Every one ought to be concerned to know where he is, and further, why he is there.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to touch a little on these two points; and to give you an idea of the position which I individually occupy, and a great many more also, and to make it plain to you why I am there.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything in such matters depends on what is according to God; and the question is whether Christendom all round is, or is not, according to the mind of God.<a name=3:6></a> If I look round at the religious bodies in the world, they all maintain that their existence is of God.<a name=3:7></a> They might not defend every detail, but they would maintain that, in the main, things in the world are according to what God intended.<a name=3:8></a> But things in the world are <i>not</i> what God intended.<a name=3:9></a> If they were, we might very well be content to be identified with these great bodies; but they are not.<a name=3:10></a> Thus, everything depends on whether Christendom, as it exists, answers to the mind of God.<a name=3:11></a> There is one thing we must remember, that when the church was set up God had not given the New Testament scriptures; but now He has been pleased to give us these, and the scriptures are the law and testimony.<a name=3:12></a> Every one of us is justified in testing things around us by the scriptures; and not only so, but we are under the <i>obligation</i> of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		testing all that maintains any kind of profession by the scriptures, and to refuse it if it speaks not according to the law and the testimony.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that we see around us, the great religious bodies, maintain, as I have said, more or less, that the institutions which exist are according to God's mind.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Popery may be generally condemned, but people imagine that other institutions are right, and that Christianity has had developments which God intended.<a name=4:3></a> It is the common idea, and in that point of view, the divisions in Christendom are not abnormal but normal.<a name=4:4></a> Such have not in their thoughts any idea that ruin has come in.<a name=4:5></a> They do not look upon Christendom as being a ruin, that is, something which God's mind never intended.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when we subject things to the test of scripture, we find that the inspired writers, without exception, contemplate what we may call the ruin of the professing church.<a name=4:7></a> The Apostle Paul, in the epistle which we have read, uses the figure of a great house in which were all sorts of vessels, some to honour and some to dishonour, and presses upon Timothy the obligation to purge himself from vessels to dishonour.<a name=4:8></a> He foresaw the ruin of the professing body, and that a moment would come of which it could be said, "The Lord knoweth them that are his.<a name=4:9></a> And, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a>).<a name=4:10></a> Peter also foresees ruin; he speaks of false teachers coming in, but never contemplates any amendment.<a name=4:11></a> All the writers contemplate the ruin which would come in, but never give the idea of any possibility of restoration or amendment.<a name=4:12></a> John speaks of the "last times", and of there being already many antichrists.<a name=4:13></a> He gives us a striking picture in the Revelation, a kind of account of the church from the beginning to the end, from Ephesus to Laodicea.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He shows what would come in, with regard to the professing body, but never holds out any idea of amendment.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is striking, but it is not accepted in Christendom.<a name=5:2></a> If it were, and the real condition of things were acknowledged, the great bodies around us which justify their existence, and consider it to be according to the mind of God, would melt away.<a name=5:3></a> Thus, when all that is around is tested by Scripture, we find that the apostles contemplated the ruin of the great professing body, through the working of influences and principles which they saw would come in, and which would bring in confusion on every hand.<a name=5:4></a> And we see that in the midst of all this the Spirit of God has been pleased to mark out a path for us; and one can, as an individual, take a place outside of things which falsify Scripture and are not according to God.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the reason why I am where I am.<a name=5:6></a> I stand as an individual, and a great many of us have taken up that position, outside of these great systems which exist.<a name=5:7></a> The reason that I stand apart from them is that it is evident to me that they do not answer to what the Spirit of God has been pleased to present to us with regard to the church.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will come now closer home, and speak of that which is the special bond in the present state of things.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I draw your attention to a passage in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:14">1 Timothy  3:14</a>, 15, "These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how though oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God".<a name=5:10></a> Now read <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:8">2 Timothy  1:8</a> There is a great difference in the language of the two epistles.<a name=5:11></a> In the first epistle the point is that a man should know how to behave himself in the house of God, and in the second that he might "not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord".<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is extremely important to get an idea of the house of God in order that you may be able to measure the general departure from the truth of it.<a name=6:1></a> If you have not the standard you cannot measure the departure.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you refer to the second chapter of the first epistle (verses 1 - 11), you will find some details of the order of the house.<a name=6:3></a> I want to dwell on these details for a moment, for they give us an idea of the character of the house of God.<a name=6:4></a> It was not a material building, but a building composed of living stones.<a name=6:5></a> We see in verse 1 that it was a place of thanksgiving and prayer, where there was intercession for all men, then for kings and for all in authority.<a name=6:6></a> That is a first principle.<a name=6:7></a> Then in verse 8 the men prayed everywhere, for the house was composed of people.<a name=6:8></a> What marked the house was that the men prayed everywhere, not ministers and clergy, but men universally were marked by prayer; wherever they were, the men were to pray.<a name=6:9></a> Then, on the other hand, the women were not to be conspicuous, but were to adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety.<a name=6:10></a> But there were other marks; all in the house were cared for in soul and body.<a name=6:11></a> There were overseers for looking after their souls, and deacons for looking after bodily wants; and whether soul or body, everything was carried out in the early days in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=6:12></a> These things were brought under Timothy's notice, that he might know how one ought to behave himself in the house of God.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it to be of great importance to have some definite understanding of the true character of the house of God, in order that we may judge of all that is around us at the present time.<a name=6:14></a> I do not see anything around that answers to what is presented to us in this epistle.<a name=6:15></a> I do not see men praying everywhere, nor women generally adorned with
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		shamefacedness.<a name=7:1></a> I do not see overseers looking after people's souls and deacons looking after their bodies.<a name=7:2></a> The systems around do not answer to the test, hence I judge myself to be right in standing apart from them.<a name=7:3></a> They do not leave room for the application of Scripture injunctions.<a name=7:4></a> Men could not pray everywhere, for it would cause disturbance; the systems leave no room for the Spirit of God; every Christian ought to feel under the obligation of bringing these things to the test of the law and the testimony.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now supposing some of us through grace have separated from these things, are we to form another system?<a name=7:6></a> Do you think that would be according to God?<a name=7:7></a> I think that is the thing which we have to avoid most strenuously.<a name=7:8></a> If the Spirit of God has given us any true perception of the character of what is around, that it does not answer to the test of Scripture, and if we have been enabled in faith to stand apart, we must most carefully maintain the sense of individuality.<a name=7:9></a> We may have the privilege of walking together, if we are agreed in mind, but we have diligently to avoid the formation of any system whatever: if we do not, we simply drop back again into the error of all that is around.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing a few are agreed in that way, it is a wonderful thing to stand in obedience to the Lord.<a name=7:11></a> We have all known what it is to be dependent on props, but we ought not to want the support of others.<a name=7:12></a> We ought to look to the Lord to be supported, and if we are supported by the Lord we shall be a support to one another.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now is there between such any special bond?<a name=7:14></a> I have not a doubt that there is, and I want that bond to be much more real to us, and that we should have a more definite idea of it than we have had.<a name=7:15></a> If it please the Lord to give us any intelligence in regard to the bond, we shall see that it is one which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		really holds us together.<a name=8:1></a> I believe the testimony to be the bond, and I want to give you an idea of what the testimony is.<a name=8:2></a> I think the Spirit of God desired that the mind of Timothy should be imbued with the principles of the house of God, and the same Spirit shows what would be the bond in the time of departure.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "testimony" is an expression which we very commonly use, but I doubt if many have a very definite idea of it.<a name=8:4></a> I will tell you the idea which it conveys to my mind.<a name=8:5></a> Testimony is that which God gives of what He is going to establish before He establishes it publicly.<a name=8:6></a> God does not give testimony of anything that He is not going to make public.<a name=8:7></a> The Spirit of God has come down to testify of Christ, but the point is that God is going to make Christ manifest.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to two passages.<a name=8:9></a> Look at <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:6">1 Timothy  2:6</a> and <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:14">1 Timothy  6:14</a>, 15.<a name=8:10></a> The one shows that a time is appointed for the preaching, and the other that a time is appointed for the appearing.<a name=8:11></a> I want to make plain that testimony refers to something which is going to appear.<a name=8:12></a> Testimony loses its force and character if you do not connect it with that which God is going to display.<a name=8:13></a> What God is going to display is comprehended in one word, and that is CHRIST, His purpose in Christ.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus Christ is going to put down every evil power, that is, to subdue all things that are contrary to God, and to bring to light His grace and His righteousness.<a name=8:15></a> God intends to have a universe which will be under the power and influence of His grace.<a name=8:16></a> It is His purpose to display Christ, and there will be a universe controlled in every part by the grace of God.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before Christ is displayed God gives testimony, so that we may be now in the light of that which is to be displayed.<a name=8:18></a> The effect of this upon
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		us will be to deliver us from the influence of all that is existing.<a name=9:1></a> What is existing is not according to God.<a name=9:2></a> Sin reigns by death; but God is going to make evident His purpose and grace in Christ Jesus before the world began.<a name=9:3></a> God will fill the universe with blessing.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another point in.<a name=9:5></a> connection with this: we get the annulling of death and the bringing to light of life and incorruptibility.<a name=9:6></a> If God is to have a universe according to His purpose, the power of death must be annulled.<a name=9:7></a> Death has to be swallowed up in victory, and when the Lord appears life and incorruptibility will be evident.<a name=9:8></a> Christ will be the fountain and source of life.<a name=9:9></a> As the sun is the fountain and source of light and life to this earth, so Christ will be as the Sun of righteousness.<a name=9:10></a> Creation will be delivered from the bondage of corruption, life and incorruptibility will come to pass, and death will be annulled.<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to carry you back for a moment to what came to light in Christ when the Lord came into the presence of death on earth; death lost its hold.<a name=9:12></a> The Lord called Lazarus out of the grave; so too in other cases He dispossessed death.<a name=9:13></a> Thus we get the beginning of the annulling of death when Christ was here, and at the same time life and incorruptibility came to light in Him; speaking of Himself He says, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it again".<a name=9:14></a> "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption".<a name=9:15></a> Instead of being subject to death He dispossessed death, while He went into it, bearing the judgment that lay on man.<a name=9:16></a> Life and incorruptibility were found in Him; but it was necessary that death should be annulled, on behalf of us, in Christ.<a name=9:17></a> All this will come out in result when Christ is displayed.<a name=9:18></a> It will be manifest then that death is annulled.<a name=9:19></a> Death could not have
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		been annulled unless redemption had been accomplished.<a name=10:1></a> It was by entering into death that Christ acquired the right to abolish it.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to be here in the testimony; and for this you must have an understanding by the Spirit of God of that which God is going to display in Christ, His purpose and grace in Christ Jesus.<a name=10:3></a> That forms a special bond at the present time.<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a mercy to have been delivered from the entanglements around, to have had grace to stand apart from them.<a name=10:5></a> May God preserve us from other entanglements.<a name=10:6></a> If we want to be kept clear from these, I am sure that we must have an interest of surpassing importance to keep us walking together.<a name=10:7></a> I believe the interest which will hold us together is the testimony of the Christ.<a name=10:8></a> The testimony does not belong to any particular class, not merely to teachers and preachers, it is common property, and a bond which holds us together in the present state of things.<a name=10:9></a> If you want any clear or definite idea of the testimony you must apprehend that which God is going to display according to His purpose.<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Looking at the world at the present time in its lawlessness and in the corruption which is the effect of lust, I see around moral confusion, and that continually increasing, but God is going to make manifest another order of things in Christ.<a name=10:11></a> He will have a scene where lust will not prevail, but grace will reign and Christ will be the centre.<a name=10:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great witness and expression of Christ will be found in the church, as she will be seen in perfection by-and-by; and every family in the universe, according to God's purpose in Christ Jesus, will be affected by it.<a name=10:13></a> Israel will have their light through the church, and the nations will walk in the light of the heavenly city.<a name=10:14></a> In that day death will be

	<div class="paragraph">
		swallowed up in victory, life and incorruptibility will be brought into effect.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it is a great thing to be in the light of Christ, and what we want is to be faithful to Christ.<a name=11:2></a> It is the moment when we are being put to the test.<a name=11:3></a> The test of the moment is to maintain fidelity to Christ, and not to run in the course of the world, nor to be influenced by the lawless principles here.<a name=11:4></a> Now is the moment of testimony.<a name=11:5></a> Is it your supreme interest?<a name=11:6></a> Depend upon it, if it is, it will tend to bind us together.<a name=11:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God give us intelligence as to the testimony, that we may see its reference to what is going to be displayed.<a name=11:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Now</i> the question is, How far are we at <i>this moment</i> in fidelity to the testimony?<a name=11:9></a> We are left here in the moment of testimony, and the word for us is "Occupy till I come", and our desire ought to be, to be found faithful till He comes.<a name=11:10></a> God grant it may be so.<a name=11:11></a>

		HOW ONE CAN BE IN THE TESTIMONY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We had before us last time the thought of the testimony as being a rallying point in a day like this.<a name=12:1></a> The object of the admonitions in the first epistle to Timothy is that a man might know how to behave himself in the house of God, and in the second that he should not be ashamed of the testimony.<a name=12:2></a> The second epistle contemplates an evil day, when confusion has come in and Christianity is really in the rule of man.<a name=12:3></a> When Christianity began, everything was in the rule of the Spirit of God.<a name=12:4></a> It is impossible to read the account in the Acts without seeing this.<a name=12:5></a> There was no preaching except in the Spirit.<a name=12:6></a> All the detail connected with the saints was carried out in the power of the Spirit.<a name=12:7></a> The rule of the Spirit characterised everything.<a name=12:8></a> Then the rule of man came in, and brought with it all kinds of confusion.<a name=12:9></a> This is contemplated in the second epistle to Timothy.<a name=12:10></a> When that state of things came in, the rallying point was the testimony, and so at the present day.<a name=12:11></a> The testimony is a simple and a very great thing.<a name=12:12></a> Nobody can exaggerate its greatness.<a name=12:13></a> It refers to that which is going to be displayed.<a name=12:14></a> It is exceedingly important to keep that in view, because it brings in the thought that we have to reckon with it.<a name=12:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to touch upon now is what qualifies us morally to be in the testimony.<a name=12:16></a> The expression "being in the testimony" is often in people's minds indefinite.<a name=12:17></a> Very few understand what the testimony is; and if you do not understand what the testimony is you cannot very well be in it.<a name=12:18></a> But if you understand it, then you see the importance of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		being in it.<a name=13:1></a> I mean being in it morally.<a name=13:2></a> I want to speak of what I regard as the first principle of being in the testimony: it is found in what we get in this chapter, that is, abiding in Christ.<a name=13:3></a> I will give you, if I can, an idea of what is meant by the expression.<a name=13:4></a> Just refer to verses 5 and 6, "And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.<a name=13:5></a> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him".<a name=13:6></a> That is what I want to dwell upon now.<a name=13:7></a> "Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not".<a name=13:8></a> Now refer to <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:7">John  15:7</a>, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you".<a name=13:9></a> You get very much the same thought in this chapter in verse 22, "And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight".<a name=13:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point which I want to make plain is the thought of abiding in Christ.<a name=13:11></a> It is not easy to make it clear, but it is extremely important.<a name=13:12></a> Two things are certain.<a name=13:13></a> "He that abideth in him sinneth not".<a name=13:14></a> That is a great point.<a name=13:15></a> The other is that "if we abide in him, and his words abide in us, we shall ask what we will" -- that is, there is communication between us and God, and what we ask we receive.<a name=13:16></a> That is the confidence that we have in Him.<a name=13:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you look abroad in the world, all is more or less lawless, while men are trying very hard to deal with what one may call the possibilities of good and evil.<a name=13:18></a> I have no doubt people think that a great deal may he arrived at by legislation.<a name=13:19></a> Then other things come in, education and cultivation.<a name=13:20></a> A great many things are entered upon, and I think it is with the idea of realising possibilities that are supposed to exist.<a name=13:21></a> But we find, steadily increasing, the disintegration of society.<a name=13:22></a> It has greatly increased

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in my recollection, and it is going on.<a name=14:1></a> The old bonds which held together different classes of people are being dissolved, and disintegration is steadily going on, which is an evidence to my mind of the increase of lawlessness.<a name=14:2></a> The more prevalent lawlessness is, the greater the disintegration.<a name=14:3></a> If there were lawlessness in a school, there would be undoubtedly disintegration.<a name=14:4></a> So, too, in a family, if the spirit of lawlessness prevails, disintegration will follow.<a name=14:5></a> You cannot conceive that people will long hold together if they are lawless in regard to One whom God has appointed to be Head.<a name=14:6></a> If we go back to the beginning we find that "By one man sin came into the world", and sin is lawlessness.<a name=14:7></a> What came in almost at once was disintegration.<a name=14:8></a> Instead of Cain and Abel being together in brotherly love, hatred came in.<a name=14:9></a> This confirms what I have been saying.<a name=14:10></a> Disintegration is bound to follow upon lawlessness.<a name=14:11></a> So long as lawlessness exists there cannot but be moral confusion in the world.<a name=14:12></a>

		Now I want to touch for a moment on the way in which God has come in to meet this lawlessness.<a name=14:15></a> God has been pleased to reveal Himself in righteousness, and to assert Himself in a centre.<a name=14:16></a> Lawlessness came in through man breaking away from God; and lawlessness can only be met by man being brought back to God.<a name=14:17></a> The only corrective to lawlessness must be by man being brought back under divine rule and influence.<a name=14:18></a> It is that which God has taken in hand to bring about.<a name=14:19></a> It appears to me that the way God has taken to bring it about is proof of divine wisdom.<a name=14:20></a> As I said, God has come out to reveal Himself in righteousness, but in such a way as to gain man.<a name=14:21></a> Righteousness as

		presented to us in the New Testament is not like righteousness in the Old Testament.<a name=15:1></a> In the Old Testament we have "Thou shalt" and "Thou shalt not".<a name=15:2></a> The righteousness of the New Testament is this -- "When they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both".<a name=15:3></a> That is, the righteousness of the New Testament exceeds the righteousness of the Old, because it is the assertion of the rights of God in mercy, and those rights are asserted in a Man.<a name=15:4></a> Now that is the first step in the course which God has taken to bring man back to Himself.<a name=15:5></a> God has been pleased to assert His rights in mercy in a Man, so that a Man may be a centre and point of attraction to men.<a name=15:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The scheme of grace depends entirely upon Christ being divine; apart from that it falls to the ground, because the point is this, that Christ Himself is God come out in the rights of mercy: if God comes out in the rights of mercy He must come out in the Son.<a name=15:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What do you think invited the mercy of God?<a name=15:8></a> We learn this in the parable which the Lord spoke in the house of Simon.<a name=15:9></a> "A certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty, but <i>when they had nothing to pay</i>".<a name=15:10></a> It was not simply the debts, but the fact that they had nothing to pay which set the mercy of God in activity.<a name=15:11></a> God looked down upon man, not simply as having debts, but in his perfect helplessness, and what lies behind mercy on the part of God is wisdom.<a name=15:12></a> (See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:31">Romans  11:31</a> - 33.<a name=15:13></a>) The coming out of God in mercy really means the recovery of the universe.<a name=15:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, God has come out in that way, and the effect of it is that Christ has become a point of attraction to men.<a name=15:15></a> There was no point of attraction presented to men in the Old Testament.<a name=15:16></a> That is why the righteousness of the New Testament exceeds the righteousness of the Old Testament.<a name=15:17></a>

		Now a word or two in regard to Christ.<a name=16:4></a> Christ is the righteousness of God, for He is the expression of God's rights in mercy, and the point of attraction to men.<a name=16:5></a> He has taken up the liabilities under which men were and from which they could not disentangle themselves.<a name=16:6></a> Men had nothing to pay, but Christ took up the debts, and in virtue of having discharged the liabilities, He gives living water to men: hence He is a point of attraction to men.<a name=16:7></a> The Lord Jesus said, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=16:8></a> It is not simply that He has paid our debts, but having paid our debts He gives us living water.<a name=16:9></a> I am sure nobody can measure the value of living water.<a name=16:10></a> We can in a way measure the riches of men, although very often that is almost beyond our power, but who can measure the value of living water?<a name=16:11></a> That is what Christ gives.<a name=16:12></a> He came here, the expression of divine mercy, to bear the liabilities under which men were, in order that He might impart to man the gift of God; so the Lord Jesus says, "Let him that is athirst come.<a name=16:13></a> And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=16:14></a> The greatest gift which even God can give is living water.<a name=16:15></a> We know the value of it here, and we shall know it hereafter.<a name=16:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have tried in previous lectures to give some idea of the testimony.<a name=21:1></a> It is a great point not to be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, but, then, we need to understand what that testimony is.<a name=21:2></a> I have no doubt the word "testimony" is an indefinite expression in the ears of a great many.<a name=21:3></a> The fact is we need to be intelligent in divine things.<a name=21:4></a> Christianity is not dogmatism, though dogmatism has come into Christianity a great deal.<a name=21:5></a> One great principle of Christianity is intelligence, what the apostle expresses as "the full assurance of understanding".<a name=21:6></a> We get a similar thought in John's first epistle, "He has given us an understanding that we may know him that is true".<a name=21:7></a> Therefore it is not the divine thought that we should be unintelligent.<a name=21:8></a> Then, again, I do not think that we want other people to understand for us.<a name=21:9></a> We want to understand for ourselves.<a name=21:10></a> In times gone by people used to be largely content for others to understand for them.<a name=21:11></a> No one can understand the things of God by mere natural power nor otherwise than by the Spirit of God; but then the youngest believer, as well as the most advanced, has the Spirit of God, and therefore there is the possibility of the youngest believer understanding.<a name=21:12></a> Now I think you get the idea of the testimony in what the apostle Paul calls "the mystery of the gospel".<a name=21:13></a> Two or three times he employs that expression.<a name=21:14></a> His desire was that he might make manifest the mystery of the gospel; not in a public way, but to the intelligence of believers.<a name=21:15></a> The gospel had been committed to him, he himself had been made intelligent in the mystery

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we all have an idea of the glad tidings in their suitability to man's condition, but what I have been referring to goes further, being spoken of as the "mystery of the gospel".<a name=22:2></a> I think the mystery of the gospel is "the Christ".<a name=22:3></a> If you turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a> - 27, evidently it lies in "the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery".<a name=22:4></a> The mystery has now come out in the way of testimony, and is apprehended in the simple expression "the Christ".<a name=22:5></a> "The Christ" really covers a great deal of ground; it covers the length and depth and breadth and height of what we may call the promised land.<a name=22:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in speaking about the testimony I have laid stress on one point, namely, that the testimony is of that which will be displayed in its own time.<a name=22:7></a> God has appointed a time for display just as He has appointed the present time for testimony.<a name=22:8></a> God displays nothing till He has set it forth in the way of testimony.<a name=22:9></a> The time of testimony is very important, and where the testimony is accepted it brings us into the light of God and God's purpose.<a name=22:10></a> One is no longer unintelligent or dogmatic, but living in the light of God and in the knowledge of His purpose in Christ; because it is that which is made known in the testimony, and we are prepared for what He is going to display.<a name=22:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I took up another point, and that was, our qualification to be in the testimony, and the first principle is abiding in Christ.<a name=22:12></a> In that way we are no longer lawless, for we have come into attachment to Christ by the Spirit of God.<a name=22:13></a> We come under divinely ordered rule, and move in the orbit which God has appointed for us.<a name=22:14></a> "He that abideth in him does not sin".<a name=22:15></a> He is no longer lawless but righteous, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to have escaped lawlessness, and to be here subject to Christ, no longer carried about by your own will and fancy.<a name=23:4></a> I do not think man's will is a safe guide, it is impossible to know where it will lead him.<a name=23:5></a> The only safe way is to abide in Christ.<a name=23:6></a> The disciples were continually abiding in Christ.<a name=23:7></a> They were fruitful in good works while they were with Christ.<a name=23:8></a> So too after Christ was risen and ascended we see the same thing in them.<a name=23:9></a> The Spirit of God had attached them to Christ.<a name=23:10></a> They were no longer lawless, but moving in the divinely appointed orbit; and as the Lord Jesus said, "That ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain", their fruit has remained to the present day, because they continued in Christ and His words continued with them.<a name=23:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to another point.<a name=23:12></a> I have spoken of our qualification for the testimony, I want to speak of two things which go with the testimony and mark those who are in it, that is, those who are in God's will, in the secret of His purpose.<a name=23:13></a> It is a great thing to be in accord morally with that which God is going to display.<a name=23:14></a> If you are not in such accord, you may depend upon it you are all wrong.<a name=23:15></a> The two marks which will, I think, characterise those who are in the testimony of Christ come out in this chapter.<a name=23:16></a> They are two very simple things -- the one is <i>feasting</i> and the other <i>fasting</i>.<a name=23:17></a> Feasting takes place inside, and fasting takes place outside.<a name=23:18></a> We have to do with both the inside and the outside, in a sense, by the life of Christ, and in the Spirit we are inside, that is, in the house, and we have feasting in the house; but then as a matter of fact we have still to do with the outside, for we have the outward

	<div class="paragraph">
		I just call your attention to verses 15 - 24.<a name=24:3></a> The supper gives you the idea of a feast.<a name=24:4></a> You get the same thing in the next chapter, verse 22.<a name=24:5></a> I want to point out that the feast is inside a certain domain, and the domain is God's domain.<a name=24:6></a> It is not a domain of this world, it is God's domain and His supper.<a name=24:7></a> So, too, in the next chapter, the feasting takes place in the domain of the Father.<a name=24:8></a> Now I would make plain to you where the Christian can live and feast.<a name=24:9></a> There is a moral domain, true to faith, which is apprehended in Christ.<a name=24:10></a> I believe the thought of the mystery of the Christ brings before us a domain.<a name=24:11></a> It is a moral idea which has to be apprehended by the soul, but it is to be apprehended; the Spirit gives us the apprehension of a moral domain in Christ.<a name=24:12></a> I do not think it will always be simply a moral domain; we anticipate the time when everything will be put under Christ, and what is now a moral domain will become an actual domain.<a name=24:13></a> Christ will fill all things.<a name=24:14></a> "All things" is not only a moral domain, but an actual domain; but now it is a moral domain which is apprehended in Christ.<a name=24:15></a> It is the "within" which is brought before us in this chapter under the figure of a house.<a name=24:16></a> Unquestionably that is a moral idea, but then there is "my supper".<a name=24:17></a> I will tell you what I understand by "my supper".<a name=24:18></a> It is the celebration of grace.<a name=24:19></a> Grace has come to pass in Christ.<a name=24:20></a> I understand the kingdom of God to signify the reign of grace.<a name=24:21></a> The reign of grace has come to pass, and what goes on in the house is the celebration of grace.<a name=24:22></a> There was a very different kind of reign until grace came in -- "sin reigned by death".<a name=24:23></a> Everybody was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wonderful to think that the reign of grace is established.<a name=25:12></a> It is not appreciated by the natural mind of man.<a name=25:13></a> It is true to faith, and it is a very great thing to apprehend it; if you do apprehend it you are at the supper, you have part in the celebration.<a name=25:14></a> It will be a wonderful day when all the results of grace come out.<a name=25:15></a> Grace reigns now morally, but it will reign publicly and manifestly, as the sun reigns.<a name=25:16></a> In the meantime we are in the house and have part in the celebration.<a name=25:17></a> I think everybody ought to delight in the thought that grace is on the throne.<a name=25:18></a>

		My thought is to continue on the line of the testimony, and the armour as we have it given in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>is essential in the maintenance of it.<a name=30:1></a> We have had the testimony before us, as a rallying-point for the saints in the ruin of the church.<a name=30:2></a> No one can gainsay the ruin of the church.<a name=30:3></a> No person with any intelligence in Scripture could maintain that Christianity, as it is in the world, is according to the mind of God.<a name=30:4></a> If you could dissect it and find out the elements of which it is composed, they would be very various.<a name=30:5></a> No doubt there are certain elements of truth in the creeds, but then we find in practice a large infusion of heathenism and Judaism.<a name=30:6></a> As Christianity advanced in the world, and spirituality declined, other elements were admitted.<a name=30:7></a>

		I pointed out in connection with the first epistle to Timothy that we find nothing that answers to the features of the house of God, as set forth in that epistle, in what is abroad now.<a name=30:8></a> My point was, there are two things essential to the individual, and especially so to the servant of the Lord.<a name=30:9></a> Still I do not want to talk to servants, but to believers.<a name=30:10></a> I do not care to limit what I say to servants.<a name=30:11></a> One is to know how to behave himself in the house of God.<a name=30:12></a> This is very important.<a name=30:13></a> I cannot think that anything absolves us from our responsibility as to that while the Spirit of God is still here, for if the Spirit of God is here, the house of God is here.<a name=30:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the point is that in the general confusion the testimony of the Lord is a rallying-point of saints, and I believe this to be of great moment.<a name=31:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I judge that of late years a great many people have run rather into the idea that they might construct some sort of representation of the church.<a name=31:2></a> I think it has been in the mind of a good many to construct a sort of ecclesiastical system but it has always broken down, and to my mind it is useless to go on that line.<a name=31:3></a> I do not think that is the thought of the Spirit of God; my impression is that in an evil day the Spirit of God has provided a rallying-point, and that rallying-point is the testimony.<a name=31:4></a> The second epistle to Timothy is perhaps the last epistle that Paul wrote.<a name=31:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was another point -- that the testimony is always a witness of what God is going to display.<a name=31:6></a> This gives the testimony a very definite character.<a name=31:7></a> To testify beforehand of that which is to be displayed is an unvarying principle in the ways of God.<a name=31:8></a> In regard to the first coming of the Lord, God gave testimony of that.<a name=31:9></a> So too in the Old Testament -- in the recovery of the Jews from Babylon, God first gave testimony.<a name=31:10></a> But now testimony goes a great deal farther.<a name=31:11></a> Testimony is of all that which God has bound up in Christ, of which Christ is the beginning, centre and head.<a name=31:12></a> It is a witness to Christ as in relation to "all things" (or rather the witness of all things in relation to Christ).<a name=31:13></a> A great many of us have had limited ideas in regard to Christ, and so too in regard to the return of Christ.<a name=31:14></a> We have talked of the coming of Christ in connection with the kingdom.<a name=31:15></a> The point is that Christ is not simply King, but He is very much like the sun in our solar universe.<a name=31:16></a> He is the head and centre, the beginning of a moral system which is to be displayed in connection with Him.<a name=31:17></a> Scripture is full of it.<a name=31:18></a> Even when God brought Israel out of Egypt into

		the wilderness, He gave them in the tabernacle a figurative representation of the "all things" -- things in heaven and things on earth.<a name=32:1></a> The "all things" are not yet come to pass; but what has come to pass is that Christ, as the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat, has come in, and thus all things are grouped around Him.<a name=32:2></a> The Lord Himself spoke very much about "all things".<a name=32:3></a> He spoke of all things in connection with the coming of the Comforter -- "All things that the Father hath are mine", and taught that the Spirit would make known to the disciples all things.<a name=32:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say that much in connection with the principle which I put forward, that is, that God displays nothing until He has previously given witness of it.<a name=32:5></a> We are waiting for the blessed hope and appearing of the Lord Jesus, not simply for the appearing, but for the display of all that God has established in Him, and in the meantime I think our rallying-point is the testimony.<a name=32:6></a> I do not think anything but that will bind us together according to God.<a name=32:7></a> I do not think zeal for ecclesiastical order will do it.<a name=32:8></a> If you ask what the testimony of our Lord is, it is comprised in one word, and that is, the Christ.<a name=32:9></a> The thought of the Christ covers a great deal, it not only refers to Christ personally, but covers all that of which the Christ is the head and centre, and that is an immense field for consideration.<a name=32:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I was speaking last time of what should characterise those to whom the testimony is dear.<a name=32:11></a> I referred to the appropriateness of fasting and feasting.<a name=32:12></a> Fasting is not always abstaining from food, but denial of self in legitimate things within your reach, which are inappropriate in the absence of the Bridegroom.<a name=32:13></a> Then feasting is in the house, in the power of the Holy Ghost -- all the joys connected with Christ at God's right hand.<a name=32:14></a>

		Now I want to give you an idea with regard to the armour, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:10">Ephesians  6:10</a> - 18.<a name=34:4></a> The idea is that the seat of wickedness is the heavenly places.<a name=34:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#59:17">Isaiah  59:17</a> - 20 we read, "For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.<a name=34:6></a> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.<a name=34:7></a> So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun.<a name=34:8></a> When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.<a name=34:9></a> And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord".<a name=34:10></a> I refer to this to show that the armour is that which is characteristic of Christ in His coming again, and really characteristic of Him as Jehovah.<a name=34:11></a> I want you to notice this, because as it is a principle that the testimony refers to that which God is going to display, so the armour anticipates the coming of Christ in power.<a name=34:12></a> The passage that I referred to speaks of the coming in of the Redeemer to Zion; then it is that He puts on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon His head, so that evidently righteousness and salvation are characteristic of Jehovah.<a name=34:13></a> Everlasting righteousness and salvation will characterise Christ when He comes out in blessing.<a name=34:14></a> You cannot understand the bearing of the armour if you do not apprehend that.<a name=34:15></a> In contrast to this look at <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:8">2 Thessalonians  2:8</a> - 10, which also refers to the coming of the Lord in connection with the revelation of the wicked one.<a name=34:16></a> The state of things which the

		Now a word or two with regard to the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=35:10></a> The first thing which you get brought out is a very important point -- the mystery of God's will.<a name=35:11></a> God has made known to us His will to head up all things in Christ.<a name=35:12></a> We have read that passage often enough, but have we ever realised the greatness of it?<a name=35:13></a> It means a universe centred in Christ.<a name=35:14></a> The next thing in the epistle is the place of the church in relation to that universe, that is, a place in heaven.<a name=35:15></a> The saints are raised up together and made to sit together in the heavenly places in Christ.<a name=35:16></a> You cannot understand that except in relation to the universe of which I spoke.<a name=35:17></a> The next thing in the epistle is the state which is correspondent to that, because if the church is set in another place, then there must be a state corresponding to it.<a name=35:18></a> Supposing such a thing were possible as that a beggar in this world were to be put in the position

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to bring before you the thought of the testimony of God in the Scriptures.<a name=41:1></a> The ground upon which I go is found in the last chapter of the Gospel of Luke.<a name=41:2></a> Christ expounded to the disciples in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<a name=41:3></a> He was the great testimony of God, so that He could do this.<a name=41:4></a> He marks the three great divisions of scripture, that is, Moses and the Psalms and the prophets, with the same object, as containing the things concerning Himself.<a name=41:5></a> He gave a comprehensive view of the testimony of God in all the Scriptures.<a name=41:6></a> Now it is with that idea that I want to bring the Scriptures under your attention.<a name=41:7></a> I take up the books of Moses at this time, and, if I have another opportunity, I will take up the Psalms, then too the prophets.<a name=41:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object in each is different; but whatever may be prominent in each, the whole is covered by that one word "Christ".<a name=41:9></a> That is what we want to see in Scripture.<a name=41:10></a> We are told that "the word of God" is "the mystery", and the mystery of the Christ is the testimony.<a name=41:11></a> The word of God and the testimony are perhaps equivalent, and the testimony of God refers to that which God is going to display.<a name=41:12></a> It seems to be the way with God that He displays nothing without having first given testimony; and for a very long time, now extending over some six thousand years, God has been giving testimony of that which He intends to display.<a name=41:13></a> If I do not misunderstand the Scriptures entirely, God's testimony is the one thread running all through, whether it be in Moses, in what we are accustomed to call the

		Pentateuch, or in the Psalms, which are largely celebrations, or in the prophetic part of scripture.<a name=42:1></a> The testimony of God, as I have said, is the word of God.<a name=42:2></a> In the highest sense Christ is the word of God, that is, in the sense of being the revelation of God.<a name=42:3></a> When He comes into the world He comes as the word of God, that is, as the testimony of God.<a name=42:4></a> All that God has fore-ordained, all His counsel, is not only established in Christ, but will be displayed in Him.<a name=42:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more: that it is Christ personally that gives character to everything under Him we can well understand, but the thought of God's testimony is not simply of Christ personally, but of Christ officially, that is, Christ in relation to "all things".<a name=42:6></a> "All things that the Father hath are mine".<a name=42:7></a> "All things are delivered to me of my Father".<a name=42:8></a> You get that thought continually in the teaching of the Lord, and I want to make plain the idea of Christ in relation to "all things".<a name=42:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking about the testimony of Christ we must bring "all things" in.<a name=42:10></a> "All things" is an expression commonly used in the New Testament as denoting all that is put under the Headship of Christ.<a name=42:11></a> "And hath put 'all things' under his feet, and gave him to be head over 'all things' to the church".<a name=42:12></a> Hence we have Christ in relation to "all things", and "all things" in relation to Christ.<a name=42:13></a>

		All the detail that God gave in the early part of scripture, and afterwards (a great deal comes out in the succeeding books, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) refers to what is found in this chapter.<a name=43:16></a> God here gave directions for His testimony to be set up among the people; therefore I am justified in saying that this chapter is the most important chapter in the books of Moses.<a name=43:17></a> If this chapter were rightly understood, no one would attempt to

		assail any of the detail that precedes or that follows it.<a name=44:1></a> The detail was all leading up to the fact of God taking up a people, and was a type of redemption coming in; then it was that God set up His testimony in the midst of that people.<a name=44:2></a> Once the testimony was established, as we get it here and in the early part of Leviticus, everything had relation to that testimony.<a name=44:3></a> The children of Israel had to pitch their tents in reference to the tabernacle; and when they went through the wilderness, the ark of the covenant went before them, and God marked out a way for the people; they had to follow the ark of the covenant through Jordan, and the ark preceded them into the land.<a name=44:4></a> So too, the ark of the covenant had to be carried round Jericho; everything centred in the ark.<a name=44:5></a> I want to touch now upon what God set forth in the tabernacle, not in detail -- I am no great hand at detail -- but in the general features of it.<a name=44:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to show you how in the tabernacle God set forth a figurative representation of that which was before Him.<a name=44:7></a> What is presented to us in the books of Moses is to a large extent figurative.<a name=44:8></a> In the Psalms we have not a figurative representation -- for the Psalms are rather prophetic in their character, they are in the nature of celebrations.<a name=44:9></a> I would say in passing that in the Psalms we get the thought of a Man capable of going up on high: One who first came down, and was capable of going up, so as to fill all things.<a name=44:10></a> In the prophets, again, it is not a question of figurative representation, but of prophetic testimony, all pointing on to the same thing.<a name=44:11></a> We see in the prophets the thought of God Himself assuming all the kingdoms of the world.<a name=44:12></a> It is no longer safe that they should be entrusted into the hands of man, and God Himself becomes King of the whole earth in the midst of His people at Jerusalem.<a name=44:13></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>, "The kingdoms of

		I have previously made one remark in regard to the testimony, that it is of that which God is going to display.<a name=56:1></a> I believe that to be the principle that prevails through Scripture.<a name=56:2></a> "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets".<a name=56:3></a> A very important principle too, for it connects itself with the responsibility of man.<a name=56:4></a> Man is bound to listen to that which God has to say, and before God interferes in a public way He gives testimony.<a name=56:5></a> The responsibility of man at the present time is intimately bound up with the gospel.<a name=56:6></a> God makes Christ known in the way of glad tidings, in that which may be believed, and the glad tidings are a very important element indeed in the responsibility of man.<a name=56:7></a> The great question at the present time is not of detail.<a name=56:8></a> In the day of judgment the detail of people's conduct will come out, but at the present time the question is not of detail, but of what men think of Christ.<a name=56:9></a> Christ is the great question in which man's responsibility is involved.<a name=56:10></a> God has set Christ in relation to man, and therefore every man is responsible in regard to Christ.<a name=56:11></a>

		I spoke last time of the three great divisions of scripture, that is, Moses and the Psalms and the prophets.<a name=57:3></a> There are subsidiary parts, but the three main divisions of scripture are these.<a name=57:4></a> My point in taking up each part (of course, it can only be done rapidly and cursorily) was and is to show how in all the testimony of Christ is evident.<a name=57:5></a> We had before us last time that which I ventured to speak of as the most important chapter in the whole of the Pentateuch, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, giving the description in detail of the furniture of the tabernacle, and for the reason that that which the tabernacle contained was a figurative representation of Christ in relation to "all things".<a name=57:6></a> It brings before us the great thought that the moment is coming when God intends to fill the universe.<a name=57:7></a> But not only does it give that general idea, but the more particular idea of that by which God will fill the universe.<a name=57:8></a> Hence I took up some detail, that is, the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat, and then the candlestick, and the golden table and the altar of burnt offering.<a name=57:9></a> I touched on these as showing us the means by which God will fill the universe.<a name=57:10></a> We are waiting here, "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=57:11></a> Christ has been set "far above all principality and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come".<a name=57:12></a> There is a universe which God purposes shall be filled not with confusion like the present world, but with order and blessing and light.<a name=57:13></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=58>[Page 58]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the testimony of Christ is presented.<a name=58:1></a> You cannot have anything clearer than what we have already had, that is, the presentation of the testimony of the Christ in the tabernacle, when we understand the typical meaning of it; but we have not in the Psalms figurative representation; we come to what is more precise, and speaks more definitely of Christ.<a name=58:2></a> There are many things which I shall pass over, because in the course of an hour it is entirely impossible, even if one had the ability, to go into all that is presented to us in the Psalms.<a name=58:3></a> One can only touch on a few points to convey a general idea.<a name=58:4></a> Many here are aware that the Psalms consist of five books.<a name=58:5></a> This is rather important, for each book has its own distinctive character, and the Psalms are not really understood unless you see the division.<a name=58:6></a> But I do not want to try to give you understanding of the Psalms; my point is to attempt to show the very distinct way in which the Psalms give to us the testimony of the Christ.<a name=58:7></a> There is a great deal in the Psalms beside that, for many of them furnish detail of experience and exercise on the part of saints; but evidently the main point in the Psalms are the things concerning Christ, in that which Christ will be when He is set forth in glory.<a name=58:8></a> That is the subject of the testimony.<a name=58:9></a> You see this in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a>, 8 and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118:25">Psalm  118:25</a> - 27.<a name=58:10></a> The Psalms, properly speaking, close with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>, which, in a way, corresponds to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>.<a name=58:11></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>describes and looks for the godly man, and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>the godly man is found.<a name=58:12></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>corresponds to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=58:13></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>celebrates the coming of the Son of God into the world, "I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee".<a name=58:14></a> That clearly refers to the incarnation of Christ, His coming into the world.<a name=58:15></a> He was immediately claimed by Jehovah as His Son.<a name=58:16></a> That comes out

		to God.<a name=61:1></a> As regards the law no one but One who is love could command love; the fact of God commanding man to love his neighbour as himself proved that God was love.<a name=61:2></a> God is love, and therefore has the right to demand love.<a name=61:3></a> His righteousness is that He has the right to demand it.<a name=61:4></a> But to demand love is one thing, to secure it another.<a name=61:5></a> The mind of God is that He is to be loved, and that man shall love his neighbour as himself, and God intends to have that mind effectuated; He has taken His own means to bring it about, and His means is seen in the ark of the covenant.<a name=61:6></a> Christ has come in to meet the transgressions under the first covenant, but also to make the law of God to be the law of the moral universe: that is, that men may love God with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves.<a name=61:7></a> This is verified in Christians at the present time.<a name=61:8></a> The righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in them "who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit".<a name=61:9></a> One word as to how that is carried into effect.<a name=61:10></a> I should speak of a covenant as an expression of disposition, very much like a man's will.<a name=61:11></a> In a will a man makes known his disposition; if he be a man of property he does this in the disposition of his property.<a name=61:12></a> But if a man has property to leave he should have those to whom to leave it; therefore, in a sense, you get two parties to the covenant -- the heirs and the testator.<a name=61:13></a> Christ is testator.<a name=61:14></a> Another point comes in: suppose a man to be possessed of large property, with many people to come into it, what would be wanted in human things would be a capable lawyer who should have everything in his hands, and possess the confidence of those who should inherit the property; that gives me the idea of the mediator -- one perfectly conversant with the property and the mind of the testator, and at the same time knowing those who are to come into the property so that he

		I feel that I need to make an apology for what I am now about to bring before you, because it will be on prophetic ground, and that is in itself hardly a part of Christian ministry; but the point with me is not to open up prophecy, but to take it up as one great part of the testimony of the Lord.<a name=67:1></a> That must be my justification.<a name=67:2></a> I shall have to pass over the ground very rapidly because prophecy is a large subject.<a name=67:3></a> I only seek to give a general idea.<a name=67:4></a> My point is to show what is stated in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:10">Revelation  19:10</a> that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy".<a name=67:5></a> You will never understand prophecy if you do not take that into account.<a name=67:6></a> It is a saying of the Spirit of God, not of man.<a name=67:7></a> All that I have taken up hitherto has been in connection with the testimony of our Lord.<a name=67:8></a> I have sought to show that the testimony of the Christ is that which prevails through the entire Scriptures: not simply of Christ personally, or of what He is in relation to us, but in relation to "all things".<a name=67:9></a> "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=67:10></a> I have taken up this thought in connection with the books of Moses, and with the Psalms, now I want to show the same thing in the prophets.<a name=67:11></a> I hang all on the expression, "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy".<a name=67:12></a> I would offer a remark in regard to the meaning and power of the name Jesus.<a name=67:13></a> The angel, in announcing His birth, told Joseph "his name shall be called Jesus"; and the reason given for it was "for he shall save his people from their sins".<a name=67:14></a> The meaning of the name

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three great principles which appear in the Old Testament.<a name=68:3></a> The first definite thought on the part of God is that of blessing.<a name=68:4></a> It came out at the beginning, and much more definitely with Abraham.<a name=68:5></a> The character of the promises to Abraham was blessing.<a name=68:6></a> The way by which God would accomplish the blessing came out only dimly, but God made known His purpose.<a name=68:7></a> Then in connection with Israel we get two great thoughts, first that God would dwell; we have had that before us previously, in connection with the tabernacle of the testimony and the ark of the covenant.<a name=68:8></a> There must be some mediatorial means by which God could dwell, and the tabernacle set forth what that would be.<a name=68:9></a> Then the third great thought, in connection with David, is the throne of God.<a name=68:10></a> You will see that these three thoughts are taken up pretty much in the prophets.<a name=68:11></a> It is curious that in the prophets there is as much or more about God dwelling than about God reigning.<a name=68:12></a> The general idea in the prophets is that God is going to assume the kingdoms for Himself, but in view of God dwelling.<a name=68:13></a> The way in which God comes in to bless is really by dwelling.<a name=68:14></a> If God dwells, it cannot be otherwise than that there should be blessing.<a name=68:15></a> So, at the present time, if we know anything about the house of God, it is a place of blessing, and a man ought to know how to behave himself in it.<a name=68:16></a> God does not dwell really in the universe until the curse is removed.<a name=68:17></a> When the curse and death are removed then God takes up His abode to bless.<a name=68:18></a> At the present time Jew and Gentile are built together for a habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=68:19></a> If we realised the true character of the house of God in the present time, if there were a full recognition of the presence of the Spirit, we should be very conscious of the

		blessing of God.<a name=69:1></a> God dwells in order that He may make us conscious of the reality of His favour.<a name=69:2></a> Blessing means God bringing Himself near to man that His favour may be known.<a name=69:3></a> There will be what is spoken of in the Psalms -- a night in God's anger, but a lifetime in His favour.<a name=69:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I just refer for a moment to what has already come before us, that is, that the great central point in the books of Moses is <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, where God gave directions in regard to the construction of the tabernacle, that God might dwell among Israel.<a name=69:5></a> I think it is the first time that you really get a complete idea of the testimony.<a name=69:6></a> You get many things leading up to that.<a name=69:7></a> It has been said that Genesis is a book of roots, of which you get the full-blown fruits in the Revelation, Scripture begins with the roots, but it brings before us the fruits.<a name=69:8></a> We get detail in Genesis, parts of God's purpose, but no complete setting forth of the testimony of God until the ark of the covenant, then we have an idea of the testimony of God in its completeness, and a very wonderful thing it is.<a name=69:9></a> That there should be a universe in which God will dwell, and which God will fill with blessing, is a wonderful conception.<a name=69:10></a> The means by which God will do it are seen in the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat.<a name=69:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Psalms I touched on two main points: the one, Christ coming down, and the other Christ going up; each has its own particular significance.<a name=69:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>we have the thought of Christ coming down: "I come to do thy will".<a name=69:13></a> "A body hast thou prepared me".<a name=69:14></a> "Thy law is within my heart".<a name=69:15></a> The law which Israel broke was in the heart of Christ that He might make that law, on the ground of mercy, to be the law of the universe.<a name=69:16></a> The covenant is made good in Christ.<a name=69:17></a> The ark of the covenant really becomes the new covenant.<a name=69:18></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>we get another thought, and that

		is, "Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts in man".<a name=70:1></a> It is not Christ coming down or out, but going up on high.<a name=70:2></a> So too in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, "Sit thou at my right hand".<a name=70:3></a> The two things are brought together in Christ, the Ark of the Covenant and the Priest.<a name=70:4></a> Hence we have the pledge of blessing, not only revelation but approach, and the approach is equal to the revelation.<a name=70:5></a> Christ has come out to reveal God to us in the purpose of His love, and now through Jesus "by one Spirit we have access to the Father".<a name=70:6></a> All that is foreshadowed in the Psalms.<a name=70:7></a> It is on the lines of the tabernacle of the testimony.<a name=70:8></a> I come now to the prophets, and I am obliged to take up so much detail that I feel in a sense ashamed.<a name=70:9></a> I want to give you two or three main thoughts in connection with the prophets.<a name=70:10></a> The first I speak of is the destruction of the Babylonish world system.<a name=70:11></a> That is one thought which prevails through the prophets, "The Lord shall punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth".<a name=70:12></a> This takes in not only the world system in its ramifications, but that by which it is governed.<a name=70:13></a> There cannot be a doubt that the present world system is maintained by the power of evil which exists in heaven.<a name=70:14></a> We are told who is the god and prince of the world, but God intends to break to pieces the whole system from top to bottom; that is one thing in prophecy.<a name=70:15></a> But I speak of another point: God intends to reconstitute the world according to Himself.<a name=70:16></a> He intends to make Jerusalem the centre and joy of the earth.<a name=70:17></a> He intends to establish Mount Zion, and to make Judah and Israel the vessel of blessing in the midst of the earth; that is another great point.<a name=70:18></a> Jehovah is coming in to reign Himself, to assume the kingdom, not only the kingdom in regard to Israel, but as King of the whole earth.<a name=70:19></a> In connection

		with that there is another important point, and that is, that God will dwell; and as I said before, that is a thought almost more prevalent in the prophets than even that of God reigning.<a name=71:1></a> If God did not reign you can understand that He could not dwell.<a name=71:2></a> Everything on earth must be subject to divine rule if God is to dwell, that is evident; but if God dwells then He commands blessing.<a name=71:3></a> His dwelling will command universal blessing.<a name=71:4></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>, "There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=71:5></a> I call your attention to these three main points in the prophets.<a name=71:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I touch for a moment on the three great prophets -- Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel.<a name=71:7></a> The great thought in Isaiah is that God in His faithfulness reverts, after her warfare, to Jerusalem.<a name=71:8></a> Then in Jeremiah the thought is that God establishes the new covenant.<a name=71:9></a> That brings in Christ, as the expression of His mercy.<a name=71:10></a> Israel will come in, as we are told in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, on the ground of mercy, through redemption.<a name=71:11></a> Ezekiel shows the quickening power of God.<a name=71:12></a> This must come in in regard of Israel, as it has come in in regard to us.<a name=71:13></a> Where would we have been except for the quickening power of God.<a name=71:14></a> And the same will be true in regard of Israel.<a name=71:15></a> They must live by the quickening power of God.<a name=71:16></a> These three points I take up, and refer to a scripture or two in the three prophets.<a name=71:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#24:21">Isaiah  24:21</a> - 23, we read, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.<a name=71:18></a> And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.<a name=71:19></a> Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before

		I have just touched on the three great prophets, now we may turn to <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:27">Daniel  7:27</a>, "And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him".<a name=75:2></a> I refer also to verses 13 and 14; "I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<a name=75:3></a> And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed".<a name=75:4></a> Verse 27 would seem to indicate that Israel will have a dominion in connection with Christ.<a name=75:5></a> Israel are probably the people of the saints of the most High.<a name=75:6></a> The kingdom <i>under the whole heaven</i> is in view, not the kingdom of Israel.<a name=75:7></a> There is a passage in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11:15">Revelation  11:15</a> which refers to the same thing.<a name=75:8></a> It says, "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come".<a name=75:9></a> It is a peculiar expression.<a name=75:10></a> There is a world of our Lord and the kingdom of it, and the dominion under the heaven is given to the people of the saints of the most High.<a name=75:11></a> The saints in heaven will reign with Christ above.<a name=75:12></a> We get the idea of that in the heavenly city.<a name=75:13></a> But there is the people of the saints of the most High who will take their dominion from Christ, but previous to that there is the smashing from top to bottom of the whole Babylonish system.<a name=75:14></a> In the vision that God gave to Nebuchadnezzar the whole image from top to bottom was in the end broken to powder.<a name=75:15></a> God is going to punish the host of high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the

		I pass on to Joel.<a name=76:6></a> The heathen are judged, and, according to what we get in Matthew, the goats are separated from the sheep.<a name=76:7></a> But there is the idea that Jehovah will dwell.<a name=76:8></a> "I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion".<a name=76:9></a> The practical result is that living waters go out from Jerusalem.<a name=76:10></a> You get the same thought in the prophet Ezekiel.<a name=76:11></a> Now if you look at <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#9:11">Amos  9:11</a>: "In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old".<a name=76:12></a> I refer to Amos because it brings in again the thought of the heathen -- there are the heathen who are called by Jehovah's name, they are to be possessed by Israel.<a name=76:13></a> Israel is to have the kingdom, as we read in Daniel.<a name=76:14></a> The passage is quoted by James, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>.<a name=76:15></a> In Micah the nations, instead of being marked by self-assertion, are brought into their true place in relation to Jehovah.<a name=76:16></a> Then in regard to Israel, "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<a name=76:17></a> Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old".<a name=76:18></a> Then in Zephaniah prominence is given to the thought of Jehovah dwelling.<a name=76:19></a> "Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is mighty".<a name=76:20></a>

		I have read this passage as introductory to what I want to speak of now.<a name=79:1></a> My object is to continue the thought of the testimony, taking it up in connection with the New Testament.<a name=79:2></a> Hitherto we have been occupied with the Old Testament, that is, with the aspects in which the testimony of God comes out there.<a name=79:3></a> It is very important that we should apprehend what comes out in the New Testament, for this reason, that while in times gone by the testimony was figurative or prophetic, the foundation of everything has now been laid.<a name=79:4></a> Christ has come, and has accomplished redemption; He has been exalted to the right hand of God to fill all things, and now the Holy Ghost has come.<a name=79:5></a> Well, that is an immense advance on the Old Testament, so that things are not spoken of figuratively or prophetically now, but as established.<a name=79:6></a> They are not yet displayed, though the moment is appointed for the appearing; but they are established.<a name=79:7></a> There is a remarkable passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a> - 24.<a name=79:8></a> It says, "But ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel".<a name=79:9></a> This presents the contrast between what is true now in believers and what was true in Israel.<a name=79:10></a> Israel came to Mount Sinai, the mount that might be touched; we are said to have come to Mount Zion and to a great

		What we have seen hitherto has been the testimony of God set forth figuratively, or spoken of prophetically, then secured in the Person of Christ Himself.<a name=91:1></a> We have now to look at the testimony as secured in the vessel of testimony.<a name=91:2></a> Everything for God has begun now.<a name=91:3></a> Nothing had really begun in the Old Testament times; Christ came in as the crown of promises, and the Jews were put to the test by Him and failed to answer to it, and all that order of things after the flesh was broken up; but Christ was the beginning.<a name=91:4></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, "Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence".<a name=91:5></a> We have come to the beginning, and in that sense to the church, and the church has a very important place as connected with the beginning.<a name=91:6></a> It is the vessel of testimony, for every part of the testimony is in some sense deposited in the church.<a name=91:7></a> It is our privilege, properly speaking, to know Christ effectively by the Spirit in every light.<a name=91:8></a> It is in that point of view that I read the passages before us.<a name=91:9></a> The witness to God's Son is that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.<a name=91:10></a> The saints, or the church, are looked upon as an efficient witness.<a name=91:11></a> The witness is there.<a name=91:12></a> It is the witness which God has witnessed concerning His Son.<a name=91:13></a> That is the value of it; it is not concerning us -- God gives no witness concerning us -- but concerning His Son.<a name=91:14></a> So in the passage I read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>.<a name=91:15></a> The prayer has reference to what is very vast, that is, every family in heaven and upon earth.<a name=91:16></a> It presents a vast scene; but the point of the prayer is that the Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith, that the

		Now I touch shortly on what has been before us.<a name=93:10></a> In regard to the tabernacle of testimony, I pointed out that before the detail of the tabernacle is given we get the detail of the furniture.<a name=93:11></a> Where the furniture was to be deposited, that is, the tent of testimony, was important; but what was of primary importance was the furniture of the tabernacle.<a name=93:12></a> The habitation of that furniture might be changed and was changed, for eventually the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat found their place in the temple that Solomon built; they found a different location, but for the moment they were placed in the tabernacle.<a name=93:13></a> That is what I look upon as being the central point in the communications

		to Moses; it indicated what was before God, that is, that God had before Him a way by which He would dwell in the universe, in order that He might fill it with light and life and blessing.<a name=94:1></a> The central point in the historical books is the history of David.<a name=94:2></a> He was God's anointed, God's king, and in a sense God's testimony; I only just touch on that in order to complete the review.<a name=94:3></a> David was imperfect, like a man after the flesh, and he came into a great position, where he was almost -- except for the word of God -- an absolute king.<a name=94:4></a> The consequence is that very often, in David, we find the testimony obscured; but still, the testimony shone out in David, and there is no moment more important than that when David brought the ark to the city of David.<a name=94:5></a> God's testimony is the spirit of the historical books.<a name=94:6></a> In speaking of the Psalms, which are largely by the sweet Psalmist of Israel, David, I sought to make plain that we get a complete testimony of Christ as having in the first instance come out from God to reveal God, and to accomplish the will of God, then going to the right hand of God, and eventually returning to be received here upon earth; that is found in the Psalms.<a name=94:7></a> Then one word in regard to the prophets, that is, the statement in the Revelation, that the testimony of Jesus (that is, "Jehovah saving") is the Spirit of prophecy.<a name=94:8></a> The prophets look on to Jehovah coming in for the salvation of His people, and not only that, but that the dwelling of God may be established in Zion.<a name=94:9></a> "Jehovah in the midst of thee is mighty".<a name=94:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Last time I touched on the gospels.<a name=94:11></a> We looked at the Gospel of John as the presentation, so to speak, of Christ as the true ark of the covenant and the mercy seat.<a name=94:12></a> In Matthew we have the King in a sense, according to the prophet Isaiah, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the epistles.<a name=95:7></a> I do not need to dwell very much on the Acts of the Apostles, because it is a book of transition beginning with the receiving up of Christ and closing with the testimony of God at Rome.<a name=95:8></a> It gives us what one may call the movement of the testimony, as the ark of the covenant was carried about from place to place.<a name=95:9></a> We get some account of what was preached; the testimony began at Jerusalem, then it went down to Antioch, then it was carried out to the Gentiles, and eventually reached Rome.<a name=95:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust I may be helped now in giving you an idea of what comes out in the epistles.<a name=95:11></a> I go back for a moment to the thought of the tabernacle.<a name=95:12></a> A tabernacle is not an abiding thing.<a name=95:13></a> A tabernacle can be taken down.<a name=95:14></a> Whenever the children of Israel had to journey, the tabernacle of the testimony had to be taken down and carefully carried; but a change was to come; the tabernacle was

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I touch for a moment very shortly on the light in which Christ is presented to us in the epistles.<a name=98:7></a> The Holy Ghost has come down to report the glory of Christ, and the apostles present to us what Christ is now as at the right hand of God.<a name=98:8></a> But the light in which Christ is presented in every epistle has reference to things which are to be displayed, and not simply reference to the present time.<a name=98:9></a> Thus we know Christ in every light, and are affected by every light in which Christ is presented.<a name=98:10></a> There is no light in which Christ is presented in any epistle which is not intended to have its moral effect on us.<a name=98:11></a> It is part of our education, so that we may be growing in the testimony, that the testimony may not be obscured.<a name=98:12></a> I do not doubt that in a sense David was God's testimony, but in him the testimony was often obscured.<a name=98:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up the epistles a little in detail.<a name=98:14></a> They may be divided into two parts.<a name=98:15></a> There are those which present Christ in regard to existing things, and there are others which present Christ in relation to all that is coming.<a name=98:16></a> It is an important division.<a name=98:17></a> The epistles which I touch on first are those to the Thessalonians; they present Christ in relation to existing things.<a name=98:18></a> They are elementary.<a name=98:19></a> They were written to Christians who had recently been converted.<a name=98:20></a> On the one hand Christ appears as Saviour,

		and on the other in glory, executing judgment.<a name=99:1></a> As we find in other parts of scripture He will appear a second time to those who look for Him without sin unto salvation, He gathers up the harvest in the first epistle.<a name=99:2></a> In the second He appears in order to execute judgment, to tread the winepress.<a name=99:3></a> That has hardly to do with the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat, with the system of things which God intends to establish; you can easily see the difference that exists between Christ viewed in relation to the existing state of things upon earth, and to the "all things" that are in the purpose of God.<a name=99:4></a> Christ will come in power and glory to deal with everything here, God will not entrust that to anybody else: but to view Christ in that light is one thing, to view Him in relation to the "all things" which God is going to display is another thing.<a name=99:5></a> But in regard to what I have said, the truth has its bearing as to us.<a name=99:6></a> We are waiting for God's Son from heaven to deliver us from the coming wrath.<a name=99:7></a> The coming of the Lord means heaven to those who are now waiting for Him.<a name=99:8></a> So too in regard to His appearing in glory, we have our part in that too, He is going to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all those that believe.<a name=99:9></a> But Christ is presented in these epistles either as Saviour to reap the harvest, or, on the other hand, to tread "the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God".<a name=99:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I touch for a moment on the Epistles of Corinthians.<a name=99:11></a> There we get an advance.<a name=99:12></a> In the first epistle Christ is seen as the wisdom and the power of God, on the one hand to bring to naught every spiritual influence by which man was dominated, and on the other to establish that which is of God.<a name=99:13></a> Therefore the first Epistle to the Corinthians is an immensely important epistle, for in it we see the establishment of the temple of God,

		I take up three other epistles for a moment, Colossians, Ephesians and Philippians.<a name=102:5></a> I was saying on one occasion that in connection with the tent of testimony there were two great thoughts.<a name=102:6></a> In the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat we get the idea of God's approach to man.<a name=102:7></a> Until redemption was accomplished God could not fully approach man, but the idea of approaching man was hid in the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat.<a name=102:8></a> But in connection with the tabernacle was another important point, there was the idea of man approaching God.<a name=102:9></a> The way into the holiest was not yet manifest, but at all events there was the idea of man approaching God.<a name=102:10></a> Once a year the high priest went into the holiest of all, and the sons of Aaron had their part in the ministry of the tabernacle.<a name=102:11></a> That presents the idea of man going in.<a name=102:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Colossians Christ has gone in as Head, is seated at the right hand of God.<a name=102:13></a> We are risen with Him and are to set our minds on things above.<a name=102:14></a> Romans carries Him to the right hand of God, but Colossians sees Him sitting at the right hand of God.<a name=102:15></a> The great High Priest has gone in, and we are associated with Him as Aaron's sons were with Aaron.<a name=102:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Philippians we get a kindred thought, Christ descended to the shame and reproach of the cross here, but He is highly exalted.<a name=102:17></a> The thought of the apostle was to reach Christ where He was.<a name=102:18></a> "I press toward the mark for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".<a name=102:19></a>

		THE TESTIMONY AS OUR BOND
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me a matter of importance that we should understand where we are in relation to all that is around us in Christendom, and why we are there.<a name=105:1></a> Many and different causes have operated to bring us where we are, some in the providence of God; but it is only poor work to be there without being able to give a reason for our continuing there.<a name=105:2></a> I hope to be able to throw a little light on this matter.<a name=105:3></a> The two epistles of Paul to Timothy have been often referred to as justification for our having taken a position outside of the great churches and systems which go to make up Christendom as a whole.<a name=105:4></a> And indeed it is a great mercy that these epistles have been given to us.<a name=105:5></a> Before touching on them I would refer to the position in which many of us are found, and to the reasons that have tended to bring us there.<a name=105:6></a> These may be summed up in one consideration, that is that the form which things have assumed on every hand is a practical falsification of all that the words of the Lord and of the apostles lead us to expect.<a name=105:7></a> I am of course aware that I am assuming the right of every Christian to judge all that he finds by Scripture.<a name=105:8></a> I might have said the responsibility.<a name=105:9></a> If the Spirit of God said "to the law and to the testimony, if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them", surely we are entitled to bring all things to the same test, and, if need be, to arrive at the same conclusion.<a name=105:10></a> I admit the gravity of this, and it ought not to be undertaken in any light spirit, for it may result in the disallowance of many things that are in a sense venerable, and that have held a great place in the minds of many children of God.<a name=105:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I observe in all around is that the forms into which Christianity has been moulded are not at all

	<div class="paragraph">
		according to the mind of God as far as that mind has been made known to us; and more, that Scripture gives us a very different estimate from that entertained by men of what Christianity would eventuate in.<a name=106:1></a> That which in the eyes of men may appear fair and suitable, may in the eye of God be confusion.<a name=106:2></a> The main justification for the forms around is that they are suited to the world as it is now.<a name=106:3></a> It can hardly be contended that these forms existed at the outset, but things in the world have greatly changed, and hence the order that existed at the beginning is said to be hardly suited to the changed world.<a name=106:4></a> It will be seen that this line of argument assumes that Christianity was intended as a religion for the world, and hence has to be adapted to the changes that take place in the constitution of the world.<a name=106:5></a> Now all the scripture writers give us the idea that what was established by apostolic care at the beginning would in the hands of men be corrupted, and they hold out no hope of reparation.<a name=106:6></a> The apostle Paul gives us the figure of a great house with vessels in it of every kind, and puts on a man the obligation to purge himself from vessels to dishonour if he would be a vessel meet for the Master's use.<a name=106:7></a> So too in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, he shows what had already come in within the limits of professing Christianity, and in what it would eventuate.<a name=106:8></a> The apostasy is brought into view.<a name=106:9></a> John speaks of its being the last time, and that already there were many antichrists.<a name=106:10></a> In the beginning of the Revelation, under the addresses to the seven churches in Asia, he pictures the defection of the church, and so far from there being any hope of amendment, all is succeeded by the judgments that precede the kingdom.<a name=106:11></a> Peter in his second epistle pictures the unrighteousness that would be brought in by heretical teachers, and how false principles would work; he too holds out no hope of amendment; there

		remains nothing but the certainty of the kingdom.<a name=107:1></a> Jude shows us the working of apostasy, and sees nothing in view but the coming of the Lord with ten thousands of His saints.<a name=107:2></a> The testimony of all the writers is concurrent.<a name=107:3></a> It will be evident that this view is diametrically opposed to that entertained by the apologists and ministers of the great systems around.<a name=107:4></a> They see not ruin or decay, but would rejoice in the place which Christianity has gained in the estimation of men.<a name=107:5></a> And yet this is very unreal.<a name=107:6></a> Disguised underneath a respect for what has had a great place in the world, and is still useful in a worldly sense, is a profound scepticism as to all that is propounded in Scripture.<a name=107:7></a> And this is intelligible, for the mind of man cannot compass the manner of the intervention of God to overthrow all that held in bondage the conscience and mind of man.<a name=107:8></a> But the point at which I arrive is this, that if there is this divergence of view, I am entitled to accept the view presented in Scripture, and to come to the conclusion that things around do not answer to the mind of God, and therefore have no claim upon me.<a name=107:9></a> Hence I am justified in standing apart from them.<a name=107:10></a> At the same time I would do this in all humility, aware that many Christians are still to be found in these associations.<a name=107:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to the epistles to Timothy, to see the light which they afford as to the course which the Christian should take.<a name=107:12></a> The point in the two epistles is evidently different.<a name=107:13></a> In the first the object of the apostle in writing is that the servant may know how a man should behave himself in the house of God.<a name=107:14></a> In the second the point is that the servant should not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord.<a name=107:15></a> I gather from this the great importance of our being in the first place imbued with a true view of the house of God, so that we may have a standard by which to judge of all around; and having and applying this,

		and feeling our obligation to a place of separation, that we should find the special bond that can hold us together under such circumstances.<a name=108:1></a> I believe that this is to be found in the testimony of our Lord.<a name=108:2></a> If we take our idea of the house of God from the first epistle we shall be bound to confess our inability to find anything that answers to it around.<a name=108:3></a> We see in it the saints in their priestly place making prayer and supplication with thanksgiving for all men, for kings and all that are in authority.<a name=108:4></a> To do this they must be in a place of moral superiority to all for which they supplicate, whatever this may take in.<a name=108:5></a> Then we see men and women relatively in their proper place, the men marked by praying, lifting up holy hands, and the women unnoticeable in modest adornment.<a name=108:6></a> It all speaks of moral comeliness.<a name=108:7></a> Then there is the care by elders and deacons for the souls and bodies of the believers; and amid such a state of things the voice of the Spirit is heard.<a name=108:8></a> Where can this be found in the din and confusion of Christendom.<a name=108:9></a> We are compelled to acknowledge that all is ruin.<a name=108:10></a> Hence it is that we are confirmed in the place of separation that we have taken.<a name=108:11></a> But nothing can be more important than that in that place we should have our minds permeated with true thoughts of what God intended to be the character of His house.<a name=108:12></a> And it is to be remembered that the Spirit of God abides here.<a name=108:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But having taken the place of separation, it is important to see that in the darkest and most difficult time there is a bond of surpassing interest that will hold us together, not leading us to form a sect, but holding us in agreement of mind so that we can walk together.<a name=108:14></a> For certainly two cannot walk together except they be agreed.<a name=108:15></a> I believe that this agreement is to be found in the testimony; we have been accustomed to use this word <i>testimony</i> with more or less of vagueness.<a name=108:16></a> I would desire to give

		which came in first.<a name=114:1></a> Then came in sin against a man's neighbour, Cain slew Abel.<a name=114:2></a> Of course it was sin against God; but there is such a thing as sin against one's neighbour, or there may be direct sin against God, like Adam's.<a name=114:3></a> Law came in to express in definite form what man's duty was toward God and toward his neighbour.<a name=114:4></a> I only refer to law for a moment in order to set off grace, for we learn things to a very large extent by contrast; and I doubt if people will have any very clear idea of grace if they do not understand the principle of law.<a name=114:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first principle of grace is relief.<a name=114:6></a> For instance, if a man were rightly my debtor, it makes all the difference whether I stand on my rights and exact my debt, or whether in grace I relieve my debtor; that is the difference in the main between law and grace.<a name=114:7></a> It has been said that there is no pleasure so great as the relief from pain or pressure and any one can understand the pleasure which must be derived from grace, from the fact of grace being relief.<a name=114:8></a> But there is another great pleasure allied to it, and that is to know the one who has been pleased to relieve you.<a name=114:9></a> Those are the two great pleasures connected with grace.<a name=114:10></a> Just let me give one example in the case of the woman who touched the hem of the Lord's garment, and immediately her issue of blood was staunched.<a name=114:11></a> The first thing was the relief she received, she knew in herself that she was healed of that plague; her plague was the pressure upon her, and she was relieved of the pressure.<a name=114:12></a> But she was also led to know the One who had ministered to her the relief.<a name=114:13></a>

		Now if you bear in mind what I have observed, that the first principle of grace is relief, I think it will help you to understand what I have to say to you.<a name=114:14></a> I want now to trace the character of grace as it is presented to us in Christ in the Gospel of Luke.<a name=114:15></a> I shall take up passages in the seventh and

		tenth and last chapters, merely as giving to us the character of grace as presented in the One who is the blessed vessel of grace.<a name=115:1></a> I must first say a word on this point lest some should not understand what I mean by vessel.<a name=115:2></a> What suggests the idea to me is the anointing of the Lord; there must be a vessel to be anointed.<a name=115:3></a> It was not possible for the Son of God to come here in grace among men except as man; but in becoming man He was the vessel of grace, that is, the blessed vessel in which the grace of God was set forth to man here upon earth.<a name=115:4></a> God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses; that is, the Son of God had become man in order that in Him as a vessel God might be set forth to men.<a name=115:5></a> It has often been said that the spirit or character of Luke's gospel is grace to men in a man.<a name=115:6></a> The Spirit of God was there in order that grace might be set forth to men but it was to be set forth in a man, and to that end the Son of God had become man.<a name=115:7></a> If I speak of Him simply and purely as a divine Person, you could not have such a thought as being anointed; it was only in becoming man that He could be anointed; He must be a vessel in order to be anointed.<a name=115:8></a> It is a beautiful thought that God could be pleased to take account of the pressure under which man was, in consequence of sin and Satan's power, and to relieve man from that pressure.<a name=115:9></a> You have a type of it in the case of the children of Israel.<a name=115:10></a> God saw the people oppressed under the burden of the Egyptians; and it was the pleasure of God to come down and relieve them from the pressure under which they laboured.<a name=115:11></a> We see the same thought in a very much wider sense in the Gospel of Luke, that is, it was the pleasure of God to draw near to man in order to relieve him from the pressure under which he lay, and to that end the Son of God became man.<a name=115:12></a>

		One word more about the vessel.<a name=116:1></a> The vessel is the seed of the woman; the seed of the woman was to bruise the head of the serpent.<a name=116:2></a> And how?<a name=116:3></a> By Himself bearing sin's judgment that He might administer God's grace to men.<a name=116:4></a> What do you think delivers a man from the power of Satan?<a name=116:5></a> One thing and one thing only -- the grace of God.<a name=116:6></a> Until the grace of God is known in the soul a man does not get deliverance from the kingdom of Satan.<a name=116:7></a> The Father has delivered us out of the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love; but the way by which it is done is by making known the grace of God to the soul, and when that is known, then there is deliverance from the power of the enemy.<a name=116:8></a> The vessel of grace is the seed of the woman.<a name=116:9></a> Remember that, because I can also speak of the vessel of grace in another light according to the glory of His Person, for He is the Son of God.<a name=116:10></a> But I speak of Him as the seed of the woman, the appointed vessel of God's grace towards man down here.<a name=116:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One point on which I would lay stress is this, that if man was to be relieved of the pressure, it must be in the scene of the pressure; many people fail to apprehend this.<a name=116:12></a> The same principle comes out in the resurrection; the resurrection has to come to pass in the scene of death; it is not simply that saints are raised to go to heaven, but resurrection refers to the earth, where the death took place.<a name=116:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord was raised again here upon earth, and He was forty days upon the earth before He went to heaven; God brings about the triumph of His glory in the scene of the ruin.<a name=116:14></a> And that is always the principle on which God acts.<a name=116:15></a> And therefore the relief takes place in the very scene of man's pressure; and that is where grace has come in.<a name=116:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now you have the vessel here, the seed of the woman, the babe that was born into the world; and

		when the babe was born, the angels celebrated the event and sang: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in man" -- that is, there was to be a man here under the eye of God for God's good pleasure.<a name=117:1></a> That is what the birth of the babe signified, He was the vessel of grace.<a name=117:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we come to the fact that He is anointed, and for this reason, that in the vessel God might be set forth in grace.<a name=117:3></a> It was not only a question of what Christ was personally, but that He was the vessel in which God was to be set forth in grace to man, and to that end the Spirit of God came upon Him.<a name=117:4></a> In the Gospel of John oneness with the Father is very much more prominently stated; for instance, "The Father which dwelleth in me, he doeth the works".<a name=117:5></a> But in the Gospel of Luke it is, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me", because in that gospel prominence is not given to the person, as such, but to what He had become, in order that in Him God might be set forth to man.<a name=117:6></a> Hence you will find in Luke's gospel that, when the Lord performed miracles, He spoke of what great things God had done.<a name=117:7></a> When the devils were cast out of the man that had the legion, he was to go and tell his friends what great things God had done for him; for, to use an expression we get elsewhere, it was "God manifest in flesh", it was "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses".<a name=117:8></a> I could not conceive anything more blessed than the presence of a vessel here in whom God had drawn close to men, for Christ was the anointed vessel to preach the gospel to the poor.<a name=117:9></a> That is how the Lord enters upon His ministry.<a name=117:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to speak of the character of grace as we have it in these passages in Luke.<a name=117:11></a> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach

		deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=118:1></a> One thing is evident, if man were to be relieved of the pressure he must first he sensible of the pressure.<a name=118:2></a> Many a man of the world would not care for the relief, because he is not sensible of the pressure.<a name=118:3></a> In a certain sense the pressure is upon all men; but if a man does not feel it, it is of little use to talk to him about relief from it, for grace is not simply a question of taking people to heaven, but of relieving man of the pressure in the place where he is under the pressure; and in order that he may be relieved of it he must be made to feel it.<a name=118:4></a> If the children of Israel had been perfectly at home and comfortable in Egypt, it would have been useless to talk to them of deliverance from the Egyptians.<a name=118:5></a> They were allowed to come under the pressure of the Egyptians, under the hard bondage of Pharaoh, and to feel the pressure, so that they might be consciously relieved of the pressure.<a name=118:6></a> And so it is when God begins to work in grace in a soul, He first makes that soul conscious of the pressure that it is under, and then it is that grace is experienced; but grace can never be experienced until a soul is made conscious of the pressure under which it is.<a name=118:7></a> When I realize that I am sinful with death upon me, and with eternity before me, then I realize the pressure.<a name=118:8></a> You may depend upon it, people would be not very easy in the easiest circumstances in this world if they were conscious that death was upon them as the judgment of God; but when the sense of that is brought home to a soul by the Spirit of God, then it is that relief can be appreciated from the pressure.<a name=118:9></a> And the relief is this, that I get forgiveness of sins, so as never to come into judgment, and that death, instead of being to me a terror, is that by which I go to be with the Lord; I am relieved of the pressure

		under which I was.<a name=119:1></a> And thus the Lord speaks here of having been "anointed to preach the gospel to the poor"; that was the beginning of it, God was there presenting to men good tidings.<a name=119:2></a> The angels brought to the shepherds good tidings of great joy, a Saviour was born; and here we have "the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor", and so on.<a name=119:3></a> It was grace come in to give man relief from the pressure under which man was, in the very scene in which he was under pressure.<a name=119:4></a> In this chapter 4, in the presence of the blessed vessel of grace, what a contrast we have to every previous dealing of God.<a name=119:5></a> The law came in to enforce the rights of God; and prophets were sent to call the people back to their allegiance to God.<a name=119:6></a> I quite admit that the prophets spoke of what was to come; but the object and point of prophecy was, in the first instance, to recall the people to their allegiance to God.<a name=119:7></a> Grace does not come in on that ground at all; but it recognizes the terrible pressure under which man is by reason of sin, and gives him relief in the very place where he was under the pressure.<a name=119:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And there is the other point of which I also spoke; grace comes in, not simply that man may gain relief, but that he may have the pleasure of knowing the One who has been pleased to minister to him the relief, he is to know God.<a name=119:9></a> I have said very often, in speaking of the gospel, that the great end of the gospel is that God may be known in the heart of man; and I think the work of the gospel is not done till God is known in man's heart as He has been pleased to reveal Himself.<a name=119:10></a> I do not think you will ever get free from the bondage of sin and of the world till you know God; when you can rest in the love of God, then you are free from the power of all else.<a name=119:11></a> Nothing is so great and blessed as to know God; there is nothing in the universe that can

		equal the joy of knowing that God is love, and that He loves me.<a name=120:1></a> It is a great thing in this world to know that I am an object of love, but how much greater to know that I am an object of the love of God!<a name=120:2></a> "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us".<a name=120:3></a> I say the love of God is the greatest thing I can ever know, and when once that is known in the heart, I am freed from the bondage under which I lay by the power of the new wine which has come in.<a name=120:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point is, that grace in its application to man must be in the way of relief.<a name=120:5></a> But now I want to enlarge a little on the character of grace.<a name=120:6></a> Just turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:41">Luke  7:41</a> - 50.<a name=120:7></a> "There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<a name=120:8></a> And when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both.<a name=120:9></a> Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?<a name=120:10></a> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.<a name=120:11></a> And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<a name=120:12></a> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?<a name=120:13></a> I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.<a name=120:14></a> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.<a name=120:15></a> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.<a name=120:16></a> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.<a name=120:17></a> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.<a name=120:18></a> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?<a name=120:19></a> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace".<a name=120:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we get another principle of grace, and that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=121>[Page 121]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is its freeness and sovereignty.<a name=121:1></a> A difference between people is recognised in the parable in regard to their obligation; one person may owe five hundred pence and another fifty.<a name=121:2></a> In regard to any one now present, you have your particular obligation to God and I have mine; your responsibility to God is not mine and mine is not yours.<a name=121:3></a> For instance, I may have been a much greater sinner than you, and I may have sinned with much more light; we are all different in respect of our obligation.<a name=121:4></a> Therefore, when it is a question of judgment, every man is judged according to his works.<a name=121:5></a> But grace is sovereign and free.<a name=121:6></a> It is sovereign in the sense that it makes no difference between the obligations of people.<a name=121:7></a> What marked the two debtors was that, while their debts were different, neither had anything to pay.<a name=121:8></a> Then it was that the creditor frankly -- that is, freely -- forgave them both.<a name=121:9></a> I call that the sovereignty of grace.<a name=121:10></a> The principle of grace is this, it does what it will with its own.<a name=121:11></a> "Is thine eye evil because I am good?<a name=121:12></a>" Grace is good, and grace will do what it will with its own; and therefore it says, "When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both".<a name=121:13></a> The creditor says, One owes me five hundred pence and the other fifty, but in both cases I will remit the debt; I am sovereign, I will make no demand whatever; "he frankly forgave them both".<a name=121:14></a> What a picture that was of the grace of the Lord in this world!<a name=121:15></a> He who came here to be the vessel of divine grace, was born into a world where everybody was a sinner and a debtor to God; He came into a world of trespasses, but God was not imputing trespasses, and therefore Jesus says to the woman, "Thy sins are forgiven".<a name=121:16></a> But remember, Simon might have had the same word; it was as near to him as to the woman; the Lord announces it to the woman because she was prepared

		for it, but it was just as free to Simon as it was to her.<a name=122:1></a> The Lord was as near to Simon as He was to the woman, for He had come into Simon's house; the woman had no business there, but she came in and drew near to the Lord; and Simon might have had all that the woman got, for divine grace was present there in Christ when neither had anything to pay.<a name=122:2></a> Simon had no more to pay than the woman when it was a question of God; the position was that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing trespasses.<a name=122:3></a> And so you see those two great principles in grace, sovereignty and freeness.<a name=122:4></a> And mark one thing which came out as the fruit of it: "Which of them will love him most?<a name=122:5></a>" Relief is one great pleasure, but there is a second great pleasure, to know the One who has relieved me; and that is what comes out here, the one who is relieved of most will love most.<a name=122:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I pass on to chapter 10: 30 - 37.<a name=122:7></a> "And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<a name=122:8></a> And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<a name=122:9></a> And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<a name=122:10></a> But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<a name=122:11></a> And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.<a name=122:12></a> Which now of

		these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?<a name=123:1></a> And be said, He that showed mercy on him.<a name=123:2></a> Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise".<a name=123:3></a> Now, no one can doubt for a moment but that, under the figure of the Samaritan, we have a beautiful picture of the Lord Himself in His ministry here upon earth.<a name=123:4></a> Hence I believe the parable represents the transition from law to grace.<a name=123:5></a> The priest and Levite passed by on the other side, they could not help the man who had fallen among thieves; grace is represented in the Samaritan, he came where the man was; and the parable presents not simply the relief accorded, but the care which was to be exercised towards the man until he should no longer be in want of care.<a name=123:6></a> Now we can get further light as to the character of grace, the man is not simply relieved, but carried and cared for.<a name=123:7></a> The wilderness is where the Christian needs care.<a name=123:8></a> He needs to be watched over and cared for so long as he is down here in a scene where everything is adverse, where he is exposed to temptation and to all evil.<a name=123:9></a> There will be a time when care will not be needed; when we get to heaven, that scene of divine serenity where evil cannot intrude, we shall not need succour and sympathy as we need them down here, where we need to be saved to the uttermost!<a name=123:10></a> And this is what you get here; the beautiful point in the parable is that you get man's true neighbour.<a name=123:11></a> The law demanded that man should love his neighbour as himself, but the law never told him who was his neighbour; no one ever understood who was man's neighbour until Christ became man; but when divine grace came in Him close to man, then man learnt who was his neighbour.<a name=123:12></a> And as a true neighbour He never leaves you, but undertakes to care for you all the time you stand in need of care.<a name=123:13></a> See what a wonderful thing grace is!<a name=123:14></a> It ministers relief, it is sovereign and free, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		it cares for its object so long as its object stands in need of care.<a name=124:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish you to connect all these thoughts with the seed of the woman; God brought it to pass that the seed of the woman should be the vessel of grace (Christ was a great deal more than the seed of the woman -- He was the Son of God, but He was the seed of the woman); and the seed of the woman was to be the vessel in which grace was to be set forth for man.<a name=124:2></a> That was the divine thought from the outset, to bring relief to man in the place where the pressure was upon him, and to give him to know the One who relieved him.<a name=124:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take you now to the last chapter of Luke: "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=124:4></a> And ye are witnesses of these things".<a name=124:5></a> Mark that expression, "in his name".<a name=124:6></a> Now that indicates that the Lord is no longer personally here, for Scripture would scarcely speak about His name in that way if He were here.<a name=124:7></a> What was set forth was to be preached "in his name", so that it was no longer a question of the personal service of Christ down here.<a name=124:8></a> In the other passages I referred to, the subject was mainly of the personal service of Christ.<a name=124:9></a> He became man's neighbour, for He came close to man that the grace of God might be set forth to man.<a name=124:10></a> But when I come to this chapter, it is the value of His name, as dead and risen.<a name=124:11></a> I believe "name" in Scripture to indicate that which God is pleased to set forth in any person.<a name=124:12></a> If God gave a name to David or to Abraham, or whoever it might be, the name indicated what God was pleased to set forth in that person.<a name=124:13></a> I believe the same to be true in regard of Christ, His name prophetically indicated what was

		to be set forth in Him.<a name=125:1></a> For instance, His name was to be called Immanuel.<a name=125:2></a> Why?<a name=125:3></a> Because in Him was set forth the great truth of God with His people.<a name=125:4></a> So too here, we have what is to be set forth in Him, namely, a door of repentance and forgiveness of sins.<a name=125:5></a> And why set forth in His name?<a name=125:6></a> Because the righteousness of God is witnessed in Him.<a name=125:7></a> If I want to understand anything about the righteousness of God or how it is that grace reigns through righteousness, it is learnt in Christ dead and risen; that is, that in the setting forth of divine grace God has made no sacrifice of His righteousness, but "grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life".<a name=125:8></a> Hence the Lord says here, "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day", so that repentance and forgiveness of sins might be set forth in Him suitably to the righteousness of God; that there should be no compromise of the righteousness of God, but that it might be maintained in the setting forth of grace in Christ: that is why it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.<a name=125:9></a> The thought of name is in that sense wonderful to me, for if a name is given God intends that the recipient shall be characterized by the name He gives him, so that the name should indicate what God wills to set forth in that man.<a name=125:10></a> That is true in the highest possible sense of Christ.<a name=125:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point here which you could not have got in connection with the Lord's personal ministry is, that grace is without limit.<a name=125:12></a> You get it, I think, in the expression "that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name <i>among all nations</i>, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=125:13></a> When every natural link was broken with Israel down here, then the great thought of grace comes out, repentance and forgiveness of sins for all nations; Jerusalem is owned -- and it is a remarkable fact -- but as

		One word about grace in regard to the Jew.<a name=126:2></a> The Jew had no more claim on the grace of God than the Gentile.<a name=126:3></a> In a sense the Jew had a claim upon God for the fulfilment of promises, because promises had been made to Abraham and to his seed; but in crucifying Christ they lost the promises, and a Jew had no exclusive claim on the grace of God.<a name=126:4></a> Therefore when grace comes out in the fullest sense after the death and resurrection of Christ, it is without limit; it begins at Jerusalem, but it goes out to all nations.<a name=126:5></a> It is the great setting forth and the climax of grace as to the way in which God is to be known by man upon earth.<a name=126:6></a>

		It is to be noted that Matthew and Luke bring before you the way in which Christ is to be known here upon earth; those gospels do not unfold, as John does, the glory of His Person, or the way in which He is to be known in the Father's house.<a name=126:7></a> In Matthew and Luke you get the way in which He is to be known by the Jew and by man.<a name=126:8></a> Luke unfolds to you the way in which Christ is to be known by man down here, repentance and forgiveness of sins are preached in His name.<a name=126:9></a> Repentance and forgiveness refer to earth, not to heaven.<a name=126:10></a> It is a point of the greatest moment, that the grace of God ministers relief to man from the pressure in the scene of that pressure; and the end is that man may know the One who has relieved him.<a name=126:11></a> If you do not get behind grace to know the One from whom grace has come, the grace of God has not done its proper work in your heart; but if the grace of God has touched your heart, you will not be content until you know the One who has ministered the grace of God to you.<a name=126:12></a> The gospel is the glad tidings of the grace of God set forth to men in a man.<a name=126:13></a> Christ became man that He might be the vessel of

		It is a wonderful subject, one has not exhausted the whole field of grace by any manner of means, and I may have more to say about it another time.<a name=127:5></a> But my object was to give you an idea of what grace is, which I have no doubt is familiar to almost everybody present; and the way in which it is presented to us in this gospel.<a name=127:6></a>

		GRACE -- IN ITS TEACHING

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:9">Titus  2:9</a> - 15
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My subject on this occasion is the teaching of grace.<a name=128:1></a> The expression is peculiar to the epistle to Titus "the grace of God .<a name=128:2></a>.<a name=128:3></a>.<a name=128:4></a> teaching us".<a name=128:5></a> The idea is that there is a teaching which is proper to and inherent in the grace of God, and that is what I hope to bring before you.<a name=128:6></a> Last time I dwelt upon the setting forth of grace, and the vessel of it; I drew attention to certain passages in the Gospel of Luke which exemplified it.<a name=128:7></a> I think all will allow, that if we want to be helped to set forth grace we almost invariably turn to the Gospel of Luke; we have an instinctive sense that the Gospel of Luke is the peculiar setting forth of the grace of God to man.<a name=128:8></a> I believe this sense to be just; and the more I become acquainted with the gospels the more I feel with regard to Luke that the Lord is presented to us in it as the vessel of grace; it is the setting forth in a remarkable way of the grace of God to man in the One who, in becoming man, became the vessel of that grace.<a name=128:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things I may speak of in connection with grace; there may be, and doubtless is, a great deal more in it with which I am not acquainted, but I can only bring before you what I know.<a name=128:10></a> I think there are two aspects of grace, one in the way of relief, and the other in that of display.<a name=128:11></a> The latter may be spoken of as the glory of God's grace; what God will display forms the glorious witness of His grace.<a name=128:12></a> As we read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus".<a name=128:13></a> The other aspect of grace, namely, relief,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is that on which I dwelt last time; grace relieves.<a name=129:1></a> I contrasted grace with law.<a name=129:2></a> Law recognised certain obligations which existed before the law was given, and exacted the fulfilment of those obligations.<a name=129:3></a> But the first principle of grace is that it relieves man of the consequences of failure in his obligations; the mission on which Christ came to this world was to relieve man of the pressure which man's failure had brought upon him.<a name=129:4></a> There was no doubt about the failure, or the sin that had brought the ruin; but in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ grace came in to relieve man so as to recover him for God.<a name=129:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So far as I understand the passage we have now before us, I do not think that grace is presented to us in it further than in the sense of relief; it is the grace of God which brings salvation, it has that character.<a name=129:6></a> The display in which grace culminates is scarcely touched here.<a name=129:7></a> The passage does not go beyond what Christians are to be in their responsibility down here; there is no statement of what I should call proper Christian privilege in the passage.<a name=129:8></a> My impression is that when Christian privilege is referred to, it is spoken of not so much in connection with grace as with love; the place of privilege which Christians have in the knowledge of the Father is the gift of God's love.<a name=129:9></a> One passage will substantiate this "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should he called the children of God".<a name=129:10></a> The idea connected with grace is rather, what God will display in us; but <i>our place</i> is the fruit of God's love; the love of God will have us in God's own habitation, in heavenly places.<a name=129:11></a> And when we are in heavenly places as the fruit of God's love, then it is that He will display in us the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.<a name=129:12></a> If you bear in mind this simple distinction between grace coming to us in the way of relief, and grace as the display

	<div class="paragraph">
		of God in the church, I think it will help you to understand the subject.<a name=130:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I now come to the teaching of grace, that is, to the moral effect which grace properly produces in the souls of those who know it.<a name=130:2></a> Evidently it is a very important point, and this passage in Titus is a remarkable one in that sense.<a name=130:3></a> "The grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and piously in this present world [or age]; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=130:4></a> That is one part of the passage; then there is another: "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works".<a name=130:5></a> Evidently there are two thoughts, the first is the teaching of grace, while the second presents the peculiar claim that our Saviour Jesus Christ has upon His people; and those are the two points that will come before us at this time.<a name=130:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the grace of God is referred to here, as I said, on the relief side; the relief which God would be pleased to accord to all men.<a name=130:7></a> All men may not get the benefit of it, for all men do not believe, and if they do not believe they evidently cannot get the benefit; it can only be had by faith.<a name=130:8></a> If a man does not believe the truth of God he cannot get any benefit from God, for there is no other way in which a link can now be formed between the heart of man and God; there is no other way possible in the present time by which man can be brought back to God.<a name=130:9></a> God makes Himself known to man in saving grace, but man can only get the benefit of it by believing God; if he does not, in the very nature of things he stands outside, and is unconscious of grace; therefore it must be by faith.<a name=130:10></a> But still that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=131>[Page 131]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		does not affect the great truth that the grace of God that brings salvation to all men hath appeared; and by salvation, as I understand, is meant the effectual relief which God would accord to man from the pressure under which man is as the fruit of sin.<a name=131:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But before I refer to the salvation, I want to touch on this point, that, if the grace of God reaches me, the purpose of it is that it may make God known to me in grace.<a name=131:2></a> It is a very important truth connected with the gospel, that its purpose is to make God known in the heart of man; and if I am affected and touched by the grace of God, it is that I may know the God of grace: there is nothing that can so affect a man down here as the knowledge of God.<a name=131:3></a> It comes out in the way in which a believer orders his conduct in the world, "Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts", he has to "live soberly, righteously, and piously".<a name=131:4></a> Why?<a name=131:5></a> Because he has the knowledge of the God of grace in his heart, that is the secret of the change.<a name=131:6></a> It is not simply that he knows the grace of God, but he knows the God of grace; the consequence of the grace of God having been brought home to him must be that he is made acquainted with the God of grace.<a name=131:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with reference to the salvation; I think there are two things in it -- a man is relieved by grace in regard of his responsibility to God, and also in regard of the power of the enemy; that is, on the one hand he has forgiveness of sins, and on the other hand he finds an outlet from the fear of death, from what I may call the pressure of death.<a name=131:8></a> It is a wonderful thing that a man should be able to say in this world, I have forgiveness of sins; I shall never come into judgment, for the question of my responsibility to God has been met, and I am relieved of the pressure of death that lay upon me, so that I no longer fear to look it in the face.<a name=131:9></a> The
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=132>[Page 132]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		position of a believer is illustrated by the children of Israel when they had passed through the Red Sea; they had been sheltered by the blood from the judgment which had fallen upon the Egyptians, and they were clear of the power of the enemy by the Red Sea: they stood clear in the presence of God.<a name=132:1></a> That is what I understand by the grace of God that brings salvation.<a name=132:2></a> I do not go further than that, though I might add that it is made effectual by the Holy Ghost that is given to the believer.<a name=132:3></a> How do you get it?<a name=132:4></a> Well, the one simple way is by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, "who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification"; I am free of offences because He was delivered for them, and of death because He has been raised again.<a name=132:5></a> And what takes the place of my former experience?<a name=132:6></a> I have peace with God, and enter by faith into this grace in which we stand.<a name=132:7></a> All is cleared; I stand now in the grace of God.<a name=132:8></a> When the Lord came into the midst of His disciples after He was risen again from the dead His words to them were, "Peace be unto you".<a name=132:9></a> It is all peace; and we stand, as believers, in the grace of God.<a name=132:10></a> Another very important consequence flows out of it, although I do not dwell on that now, and that is, deliverance; I can take the place of death to everything down here, which is marked by distance from God; I can accept death now, which I never could before, and death becomes to me the way of deliverance.<a name=132:11></a> I do not want any longer to live in that which is marked by distance from God, in sin and the world; in the light of the cross I accept the judgment of death which lay upon me, and it becomes my deliverance.<a name=132:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point I want to dwell upon is the intimate connection between grace and glory; if you turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:2">Romans  5:2</a>, you will see it there: "By whom also" -- that is, by the Lord Jesus Christ -- "we

	<div class="paragraph">
		have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=133:1></a> In the passage I read tonight it says, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and piously in this present age; looking for that blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=133:2></a> The teaching of grace leads us to look for the appearing of the glory.<a name=133:3></a> The connection is this, that grace fits you for glory; you are thus fitted for glory at the very outset, but the more you become acquainted with the grace of God, the more perfectly you are at home, as it were, in the thought of the glory of God.<a name=133:4></a> I could not understand what it is to have part in the glory of God if I did not see that I stand in grace, and apprehend the connection of grace with the glory of God.<a name=133:5></a> The glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ is, as I understand it, the full display in their result of the purposes of God's grace; God's purposes of grace are His glory.<a name=133:6></a> The glory of a man is that which he cherishes in his inmost heart; and the glory of God is that in which the heart of God delights and will display itself -- in the purposes of His grace; and everything looks forward to the full display of this.<a name=133:7></a> These purposes dawned very early in Scripture; the first real expression of the purposes of God's grace was in the promises that He made to Abraham: He engaged Himself in blessing to Abraham, and said, "In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed"; it was the beginning of the revelation of God's purposes of grace.<a name=133:8></a> No doubt you get a hint of grace in the judgment on the serpent, that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the serpent.<a name=133:9></a> The seed of the woman was the Son of God, and the Son of God was the vessel of grace,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=134>[Page 134]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and was to bruise the head of the serpent; but the first distinct intimation of God's purposes of grace came out, as I said, in the promise to Abraham.<a name=134:1></a> Now, when all is displayed in its full result, when all these purposes are accomplished in Christ (for all are centred and will be accomplished in Him), the great display of them will be the glory of God, and that is what I understand we rejoice in hope of, and so we can look for it.<a name=134:2></a> And the more I come under the influence of divine grace, the more ready I am for the display of the glory: I look for the glory, for after all the glory is akin to the grace that I know.<a name=134:3></a> It is of immense importance to connect together grace and glory.<a name=134:4></a> Do you remember an expression in the Psalms, "to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary"?<a name=134:5></a> If we know God in the sanctuary, that is, in the blessed secret of His grace, nothing will content us except the hope of God's glory.<a name=134:6></a> The thought is a positive delight to me that the more I am acquainted with the grace of God, the closer I am really brought to the glory.<a name=134:7></a> The same holds good, too, in regard of Christ, that the more I become acquainted with grace the more I am in the light of the glory of the Lord.<a name=134:8></a> That is the connection in which the two things stand here, that where the heart is established in grace, the natural outlook is, "Looking for that blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ".<a name=134:9></a> When all comes to light, when the blessed display of grace comes to pass, then will be the glory of God's grace, and we shall find ourselves perfectly at home in it; the glory comes in to the delight of the soul, because, as I said before, God's glory is the accomplishment and display of all the purposes of His grace, and so of Himself.<a name=134:10></a> In the beginning of Stephen's address before the council in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>he says, "The God of glory appeared to

		<a name=135>[Page 135]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		our father Abraham".<a name=135:1></a> The God of glory refers to His appearing to him in the way of promise ("He gave him none inheritance"); that is, He gave him a blessed revelation of His own purpose, which the promise was.<a name=135:2></a> It was the God of glory; and then at the close of the address Stephen looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; everything was accomplished and pledged in the One who was in the glory of God.<a name=135:3></a> He apprehended the greatness of divine grace, he was deeply conscious of standing in the grace of God, that there was nothing between him and God, that he was free of every bit of pressure in the presence of God, and he "looked up steadfastly into heaven".<a name=135:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The impression which I would like to leave is of the intimate connection between grace and glory, and that the better your acquaintance with grace the more you are prepared for the display of glory.<a name=135:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to say a word about what comes in between.<a name=135:6></a> I remark that the apostle does not in the passage take us out of our responsible position down here, he does not carry us in thought and spirit into the purpose of God about us in its full extent: the passage is not an unfolding of what I should call Christian privilege.<a name=135:7></a> I quite admit that salvation is Christian privilege, but not Christian privilege in the full height of it; the passage looks upon Christians in their position here upon earth as those who are responsible to adorn in all things the doctrine of their Saviour God.<a name=135:8></a> The proof of what I have said is that the apostle takes the saints up in classes; he had brought before Titus what Titus was to press upon various classes: in regard to slaves, they are exhorted to adorn in all things the doctrine of God their Saviour.<a name=135:9></a> He looks upon the saints in their life here in flesh, as the apostle Paul says of himself in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a>,

		"In that I live in flesh" -- that was in his responsible position as here upon earth -- "I live by the faith of the Son of God".<a name=136:1></a> To fail to apprehend our responsible position as Christians here on earth is a great defect.<a name=136:2></a> Do not misunderstand me; I do not mean that you are responsible to keep the law, or that you are going to get to heaven by your responsibility, but I say that responsibility belongs to you so long as you are actually here on earth, and God gives you grace to carry out your responsibility.<a name=136:3></a> You are not left to yourself and to your own resources like a man under law; but power has come in to enable you to carry out your responsibility here upon earth, and to do so is the proper effect of grace upon the heart of man, and will have its answer in the kingdom.<a name=136:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken about the connection of grace and glory, and now dwell for a moment on the natural outcome of grace known in power.<a name=136:5></a> The first thing is "Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts".<a name=136:6></a> If my heart is affected by grace, what comes to me is this, I cannot go on in ungodliness and worldly lusts.<a name=136:7></a> Time was when I lived in them; I suppose the time has been when most of us lived in them; but I see that will not do now.<a name=136:8></a> Why?<a name=136:9></a> Because I know the God of grace.<a name=136:10></a> The knowledge of God produces the greatest moral effect upon a person; I do not think that anything can be compared with it; and from the time that I have got the knowledge of God in grace, I cannot continue in ungodliness and worldly lusts, in what is totally contrary and opposed to God.<a name=136:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we get on the more positive side, that we should live soberly, righteously, and piously in this present age.<a name=136:12></a> The first thing is to live "soberly".<a name=136:13></a> A drunken man has for the moment utterly inflated ideas, for he is outside of his sober senses, by the effect of intoxication.<a name=136:14></a> It is a great thing to be

		Then we come to the point on which I have already touched; "Looking for that blessed hope and appearing of the glory" -- which is the great climax of grace -- "of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=140:2></a> And that brings me to the other part of the passage; "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works".<a name=140:3></a> Now, this verse does not lead us on to the ground of the assembly.<a name=140:4></a> On the contrary, it is perhaps almost the only passage in the writings of Paul which speaks about Christians as being "a people".<a name=140:5></a> Peter speaks of them as a people; they were not a people, but they are a people now.<a name=140:6></a> Here the expression "a peculiar people" is connected with the great fact of our Saviour Jesus Christ having given Himself for us.<a name=140:7></a> The same thought is brought out in two other passages.<a name=140:8></a> One is a verse to which I have already referred, "In that I live in flesh", that is, in his responsible life here on earth, I live by faith, "the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=140:9></a> Another verse is in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, in which the apostle says, "We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again".<a name=140:10></a> I recognize in all these passages the claim which our Saviour Jesus Christ has on those for whom He gave Himself.<a name=140:11></a> The grace of God has its bearing on us, but its aspect is towards all; but as to our Saviour Jesus Christ, He gave Himself for <i>us</i>.<a name=140:12></a> I could not say in the same sense that He gave Himself for all:

	<div class="paragraph">
		He died for all; but when it speaks about His giving Himself, the thought seems more limited in its application; and He gave Himself for us that He might establish upon us an incontestable claim, the claim of love, to which we are bound to respond.<a name=141:1></a> There is no Christian that has the shadow of a title to be in this world to please himself, or to live to himself; Christ died "that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again".<a name=141:2></a> I pity the person who does not recognize the claim which the Lord Jesus Christ has upon him; though I am conscious how poorly I have myself responded to it.<a name=141:3></a> If you think you are entitled to pursue your own ends and to go your own way in this world, you make a fatal mistake.<a name=141:4></a> And you do yourself a grievous wrong if you fail to respond to the claim which the Lord Jesus Christ has upon you in having given Himself for you.<a name=141:5></a> Who has such a claim as that upon you?<a name=141:6></a> Who in this world, the nearest and dearest, ever gave himself for you?<a name=141:7></a> And that is what our Saviour Jesus Christ did, that He might have the supreme claim upon your affections.<a name=141:8></a> But the first point is, "that he might redeem us from all lawlessness".<a name=141:9></a> What marks the world is lawlessness, and He gave Himself to free us from all lawlessness.<a name=141:10></a> And not only that, but "to purify to himself a peculiar people"; not a people taking up the position of a nation upon earth, as Israel could, but a people for Himself.<a name=141:11></a> Christians should recognize that they are not a people who have any position upon earth, but a people engaged in affection to the One who is not here, our Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=141:12></a> A people peculiar to the One who has been rejected from the earth, and who has died to all that is here.<a name=141:13></a> Christians, properly speaking, are a people not only affected by the grace of God, and living, in the light of that grace, soberly,

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point in connection with this peculiar people, "they are zealous of good works".<a name=142:7></a> I have seen many a man in the world who was zealous of bad works; but Christians are zealous of good works.<a name=142:8></a> It does not simply say that they carry out good works, but they are zealous of good works.<a name=142:9></a> I cannot tell you what the good works may be; but whether it be to be obedient to magistrates, or to obey principalities, or whatever it may be, their works have that character, good works.<a name=142:10></a> I wish I could impress you with a due sense of the grace of God, so that your hearts might be fully in the light of that grace; and the God of grace being thus known in your hearts, that you might look up to heaven with the greatest possible delight and joy, knowing that you have a sun in heaven.<a name=142:11></a> The Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in His wings, He will shine out publicly as the sun; but

		When the subject of grace opens out to one it appears so vast that it is difficult to know at what point to take it up.<a name=144:1></a> To begin with, I have been struck by the great difficulty of attempting any definition of grace.<a name=144:2></a> You would hardly arrive at a right idea of grace by looking the word out in the dictionary, or by going to the original; neither will supply you with a satisfactory definition of it.<a name=144:3></a> I think the fact is that no one can get a right idea of it except as he knows God.<a name=144:4></a> It is the case in regard to many terms used in Scripture that you can only rightly construe them from Scripture itself And further, it appears to me that you have to gather the idea of grace not simply from Scripture, but from acquaintance with God.<a name=144:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I need hardly say that grace connects itself most intimately with God Himself; and apart from the knowledge of God I do not think you can understand it.<a name=144:6></a> The first principle of grace is, I think, God's adaptation of Himself to man in man's state of sin and weakness; and that is to me the most wonderful thing in it.<a name=144:7></a> It is not exactly the same thought as love; love will act for its own satisfaction.<a name=144:8></a> And so it is with God; God is infinite and perfect, and labours for the satisfaction of His love, so that all may be happy as blessed in it.<a name=144:9></a> It is not simply that all things are <i>of</i> God, but all things are <i>for</i> God; that is the result of the working out of God's purposes, everything is to be for the satisfaction of His love.<a name=144:10></a> But that entirely depends on the great truth of God being divinely perfect.<a name=144:11></a>

		No one but God could work to such an end.<a name=145:1></a> But that is not quite the idea of grace.<a name=145:2></a> God has seen fit to come out of His own place, if I may use the expression, to reach man in the state of sin and weakness and degradation in which man was sunk, as departed from God, and in which man was very well content to remain.<a name=145:3></a> If God had been pleased to leave man in the degradation of heathenism, man would have been content to remain there.<a name=145:4></a> There might have been philosophers, but the great mass of men would have been unaffected by philosophy.<a name=145:5></a> It is a well known fact that philosophy never reached the masses; philosophers were a limited class who did not affect the mass of men.<a name=145:6></a> I dwelt on a former occasion on grace as relief accorded by God to man, and spoke of the vessel of it, taking up certain passages in the Gospel of Luke which, I thought, brought it out.<a name=145:7></a> Subsequently, I took up the teaching of grace, a very important point in regard to our walk down here.<a name=145:8></a> My point now is somewhat different, though one may call it another development of the same subject; it is the supremacy of grace, or rather, it is grace in its supremacy.<a name=145:9></a> As we had grace in its teaching.<a name=145:10></a> So we have grace in its supremacy, the reign of grace.<a name=145:11></a> I will tell you what helps to explain it to me.<a name=145:12></a> There will come a time when the throne of iniquity will be set up in this world; and also when the throne of righteousness will be established in the coming of the Lord, "a king will reign in righteousness".<a name=145:13></a> But what marks the present moment is the reign or supremacy of grace, for there is no principle in the world which is so mighty as grace.<a name=145:14></a> And there is another thought connected with grace, and that is support, which is the application of grace to us all as believers, and the application of grace specially to the servant of the Lord.<a name=145:15></a> Those are the points I desire to bring out now by the help of God.<a name=145:16></a>

		The different scriptures that I have read will, I think, enable me to present the subject.<a name=146:1></a> In the two passages from the Epistle to the Romans we get the supremacy of grace in its application to us all.<a name=146:2></a> Look at the last two or three verses of chapter 5: "Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.<a name=146:3></a> For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.<a name=146:4></a> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.<a name=146:5></a> But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=146:6></a> Then in chapter 6: "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law but under grace".<a name=146:7></a> Now, the importance of those two passages is, that they reveal to us what is in the mind of God.<a name=146:8></a> It is not in them a question of what is realized in the soul of the Christian, but of what is in the mind of God.<a name=146:9></a> Sin has reigned by death; but that state of things has received a death blow, and now grace is to reign through righteousness unto eternal life; that is the divine thought, and that is what led me to the expression, "the supremacy of grace".<a name=146:10></a> For where sin was the greatest, grace abounded; the apostle in the chapter takes up specially the case of the Jew, those who were under law, for they were the worst of all.<a name=146:11></a> "The law entered that the offence might abound".<a name=146:12></a> There was plenty of offence in the Gentile, but it was in the Jew that the offence abounded.<a name=146:13></a> Here it says that, where sin abounded, grace super-abounded, because grace rose above sin wherever sin was, and hence it rose above the sin of the Jew just as much as above the sin of the Gentile.<a name=146:14></a> In the commission in the last chapter of the
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gospel of Luke, it is said that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in Christ's name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=147:1></a> What was to be made evident was the supremacy of grace, that where sin abounded grace super-abounded; the divine thought was that the moment should be marked by the reign of grace.<a name=147:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thing in particular that I would notice in the passage, namely, that grace was not to be at the expense of righteousness, nor to reach man in such a way as to give man the impression that God was indifferent to sin.<a name=147:3></a> How God brought to pass the reign of grace was by the complete judgment and putting away of sin from before Him, and this was effected by the Lord Jesus Christ; He appeared once in the end of the world to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, that grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=147:4></a> The great end in view is eternal life, not simply that man may know the grace of God in the forgiveness of his sins, but that grace may reign unto eternal life.<a name=147:5></a> No doubt in its full scope and application the passage refers to the future; but it has, I judge, an application to the present.<a name=147:6></a> I think it is a mistake to use all the passages of Paul which refer to eternal life in a too exclusively future sense, for Paul commonly presents a thing in its moral aspect, and thus apart from any question of time; this particular passage is abstract, and shews us what was in the mind and thought of God.<a name=147:7></a> I want everybody here to accept this, that the thought and purpose of God for a Christian is eternal life.<a name=147:8></a> You may say that according to Paul I cannot get it until Christ comes.<a name=147:9></a> I do not think that is really the idea of Paul.<a name=147:10></a> The apostle says, "He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life".<a name=147:11></a> There

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to another point of very great comfort, namely, that sin is not to have dominion over you, because you are not under law but under grace.<a name=148:6></a> Do you accept this, that sin is not to have dominion over you?<a name=148:7></a> You may dread sin; every believer dreads sin and fears lest it should have dominion over him, but sin is not to have dominion over you.<a name=148:8></a> We have not yet come to what I would speak of as the application of grace to the soul; it has so far been the divine thought, that "sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace".<a name=148:9></a> That could not have been the case in times gone by, in which sin did have dominion.<a name=148:10></a> But now the revelation of this thought of God is a great comfort to me.<a name=148:11></a> Knowing what I am, how sin besets me, my liability to be brought under the power of evil, and the temptation of the world, it is a very great comfort to know that sin shall not have dominion over me.<a name=148:12></a> If I were under law, sin might have dominion over me; but I am under grace, and sin does not have dominion over me, God takes care that it shall not.<a name=148:13></a>

		with grace, and I turn to the passage in Hebrews.<a name=149:1></a> "Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<a name=149:2></a> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=149:3></a> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=149:4></a> Now we advance a little further here, for in this passage we do not get simply the divine thought, as in the passages in Romans, but, as it were, the application of it; that is to say, we "come boldly", we act in a certain sense.<a name=149:5></a> The first thing is to get hold of the divine thought; then to avail ourselves of that which has been placed within our reach, and that is the throne of grace.<a name=149:6></a> The throne of grace is accessible to us so that we may "obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=149:7></a> It is not here exactly a question of sin, for the provision connects itself with our infirmities; we are conscious of infirmities (I suppose every Christian is); there is the possibility of falling, but in regard to it the throne of grace is available, God is accessible, and we come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=149:8></a> I think the truth of it hangs on the fact that we have a great high Priest, a representative, who has passed through the heavens, right through to the throne of God.<a name=149:9></a> If I were seeking to get on in the world, I would like to be well represented at court if I could not go to court myself, to have a representative there.<a name=149:10></a> So in regard to Christians, we are not in heaven, but we have a representative in heaven, One who has passed through the heavens and sympathizes with our infirmities.<a name=149:11></a> The practical result is this, we "come boldly to the throne of grace".<a name=149:12></a> Grace is

		we have the application of grace to the servant more particularly, though I think the principle applies generally.<a name=152:1></a> If you have followed what I have said, I think you will observe that this passage verifies the remark I made that if one gets an accession of light he is bound to be tested.<a name=152:2></a> I doubt if any one ever had experience of getting light from God but what he found that something came along to test him, and if possible to baffle him in his course.<a name=152:3></a> We find in the case of the apostle, that he got a great gain of light spiritually, he was caught up into the third heaven and heard words unspeakable which it was not lawful to utter down here; that is to say, he was taken by the power of God into the great reality of the scene of which he testified.<a name=152:4></a> When he comes down here again there is a danger of his being puffed up by the abundance of the revelations; and he gets a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him and apparently to baffle him, because it tended to hinder him in the service of the testimony.<a name=152:5></a> I daresay you have noticed that the apostle urges the saints to pray that he may have utterance: there was something come in which, I judge, tended to hinder him naturally in the utterance of the great things which God had entrusted to him.<a name=152:6></a> He beseeches the Lord three times (he was in earnest about it) that the thorn in the flesh might depart from him; it does not depart from him, but what he learns is this, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness", I do not think anything can be greater gain to a servant of the Lord than to have experience of the strength of the Lord, for it is a great thing to carry out any little service in the strength of Christ.<a name=152:7></a> The apostle says, "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me".<a name=152:8></a> The Lord gives the apostle a most

		reassuring word, to assure him that whatever service he had to carry out he should not be hindered by the messenger of Satan, but that in every circumstance, the grace of Christ was sufficient for him.<a name=153:1></a> The strength of Christ is something that you could not describe; it is as different from natural strength or natural ability as anything can be.<a name=153:2></a> I will tell you how it works; the grace of Christ brings the heart of the servant so blessedly into the reality of things that a man finds ability to speak of them.<a name=153:3></a> If you attempt to speak of such things mentally you will be entirely at fault: you can only speak of divine things with any measure of power in so far as they are really enjoyed in the heart.<a name=153:4></a> That is how Christ works, how He makes His grace effective, in so directing the heart of the servant into the things, that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, and one can find utterance, even though there be an infirmity of the flesh tending to obstruct.<a name=153:5></a> So it was with the apostle, he had remarkable experience of the grace of Christ with him in all his service, even though, I suppose, he never lost the thorn in the flesh.<a name=153:6></a> And the thorn in the flesh was a messenger of Satan, not a messenger of God; God allowed it to come to the apostle, but it was the messenger of Satan to obstruct him in his pathway of service down here.<a name=153:7></a> But then he had the support of the Lord.<a name=153:8></a> It is a great experience to be supported by grace in the difficulties of the pathway here.<a name=153:9></a> And in the case of the servant, it is grace that is his support.<a name=153:10></a> That is one element of grace, it not only relieves but it supports; and I suppose that there is not a Christian but has some experience of what the support of grace is in the difficulties of the pathway, and in the details of service down here.<a name=153:11></a>

		every proper characteristic quality of the Christian is said to be "in Christ Jesus".<a name=155:1></a> But when I speak of what is in this way in Christ Jesus, I understand by it that which is to be realized in the soul of the Christian.<a name=155:2></a> There is nothing for God in Adam or in the flesh: every quality which God can own, faith and love and whatever it may be, in fact, every proper Christian quality is in Christ Jesus.<a name=155:3></a> The apostle had not, nor intended that Timothy should have, the faintest confidence in the flesh, but should realize what was in Christ Jesus.<a name=155:4></a> It is a point which comes out all through the epistle, the Scriptures were able to make him "wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus"; I do not think it means through faith of which Christ Jesus was the object, but a character of faith which was realized in the soul.<a name=155:5></a> Now the apostle urges him in that way, he was to "be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus"; there was a wonderful resource there; and if Christ Jesus be the One that dwells in the heart of the Christian, the glory and delight of the Christian, then everything that is in Christ Jesus is realized.<a name=155:6></a> When I look at the Lord in His pathway upon earth, I see the perfect adaptation of what was properly divine to the circumstances in which He was placed as man down here.<a name=155:7></a> Every moral quality of the Lord was of Himself, He derived nothing in this sense from man, He did not even get learning from man; the Jews said, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<a name=155:8></a>" Whatever moral quality we see in Christ as a man down here upon earth, the perfection of faith or confidence, or allegiance or devotedness, nothing was derived, all was of Himself.<a name=155:9></a> He became man, and in becoming man He beautified and adorned the humanity that He took.<a name=155:10></a> Every real trait of beauty in humanity in His case was of Himself: He took that state and form that He might glorify God in it

		exaltation of Christ, man glorified; Christ is in heaven, the glorified Man, and that Man is to be the glory and delight of the Christian.<a name=158:1></a> If that is the case, then I am strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, and in some little degree I learn how to maintain the truth which God has been pleased to give to us.<a name=158:2></a> Do not mistake your work.<a name=158:3></a> We are not called to go forth as apostles to introduce some new system of truth; our work is the work to which God called Timothy, to maintain the truth which it has pleased God to give to us; and the only possible way to do it is by your own soul being in the blessed reality of it, and the very essence of it is that Christ should be the glory of your heart, the man in whom you delight, your glory.<a name=158:4></a> Then the result will be that every blessed quality which came out in Him as man will be reproduced in the Christian down here, because Christ is the Man of the Christian's heart.<a name=158:5></a>

		My thought is to continue the subject which I have tried on previous occasions to bring before you, namely, grace, passing on today to what I may call its climax.<a name=159:1></a> We have had before us grace from the outset, in its application to us, as set forth in the One who is the vessel of it; we have had, too, the teaching of grace, and the supremacy of grace.<a name=159:2></a> Now my point is to look at the subject on another side, and that is of display.<a name=159:3></a> We have our part in grace; but God will have His part too; and God's part in grace is in its display to His praise.<a name=159:4></a> And you will find that almost every allusion to grace in the Epistle to the Ephesians is in contrast to the way in which it is presented in the Epistle to the Romans.<a name=159:5></a> In the latter you get grace pretty much on the side of our need, but in the Epistle to the Ephesians it is looked at more on God's side, as a display of Himself; and you get an expression which I do not think is found elsewhere, "to the praise of the glory of his grace".<a name=159:6></a> So, too, in chapter 2, "That in the ages to come he might <i>shew</i> the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us in Christ Jesus".<a name=159:7></a> God will be glorified in the display of "the exceeding riches of his grace" and by that expression I understand the public witness in ages to come to the riches of His grace, and that witness will be in the church.<a name=159:8></a> You will find in the Revelation that God intends to have in eternity a witness to His righteousness, and the same thing is seen in principle in Isaiah, namely, that in the millennium God will have a witness to His righteousness.<a name=159:9></a> But if God has a witness to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=160>[Page 160]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His righteousness, He will have also a witness to His grace, and it is that which is brought out here.<a name=160:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what I shall come to presently, and it will involve pointing out the difference between grace in its application to us and in its display; and that will necessitate reference to another point, namely, the distinguishing a little more definitely between grace and love.<a name=160:2></a> I do not know that we have been quite accustomed to make the distinction, but the distinction is to me plain enough.<a name=160:3></a> You would not say that God is grace; but God is love; and God did not love man on account of man's condition.<a name=160:4></a> It was in the sovereignty of love that God loved man; God is love, and never was any other than love; it is the one word which is employed in Scripture to describe the nature of God.<a name=160:5></a> Every activity of God originated in love, and the result of every activity will be for the satisfaction of His love.<a name=160:6></a> But I understand grace to be the fruit of God's taking account of man in his condition of weakness and need down here.<a name=160:7></a> There was no necessity, I imagine, for grace in eternity, when there was no weakness to be dealt with; but it is a wonderful thing that the blessed God should have come out in that way, and that He should have seen fit to adapt Himself in a sense to man's condition.<a name=160:8></a> He might have stood at a distance; the common philosophic idea of God was that He was at far too great a distance from matter to have anything to say to man, or for man to have anything to say to Him.<a name=160:9></a> The truth is, that when the light of Christianity came in, it brought out the blessed truth that God, without in any way sacrificing the integrity of His Being, could adapt Himself to man in man's condition of sin and ruin down here.<a name=160:10></a> God takes care of righteousness, He will not sacrifice righteousness for the sake of grace; but He makes grace to reign through righteousness, and the great

		end of it is "eternal life".<a name=161:1></a> These are the three links in the chain, it begins with grace, grace reigns "through righteousness", and it is "unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=161:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see three distinct elements in grace in its application to us; the first is light, the second is support, and the third is favour.<a name=161:3></a> It is remarkable that though you get the idea of grace in the gospels you get no statement in them about grace.<a name=161:4></a> I do not know whether others have observed it, but it is curious that the word "grace" never occurs, so far as I know, in two of the gospels, namely, Matthew and Mark, and it is never used in the sense in which I am speaking of it in the gospel of Luke, although that is the great grace gospel.<a name=161:5></a> The only gospel in which the word does occur in the sense I refer to is that of John, and there grace is put in contrast to law; Christ came "full of grace and truth" for He was making God known, and then it adds, "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth have come to pass by Jesus Christ".<a name=161:6></a> I think that is the only connection in which the word "grace" occurs in John's gospel.<a name=161:7></a> When you come to the epistles, they are full of grace, they make known the glad tidings of the grace of God.<a name=161:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will speak for a moment about the three points I have just referred to, and first, that the grace of God comes to us in the way of light, making God known to us and making known what the pleasure of God is in regard to man.<a name=161:9></a> That is the very first idea I ever get of grace, I get an insight in my soul by the gospel into the pleasure of God about me, and I could not get anything more blessed down here.<a name=161:10></a> The extraordinary part of it is that people are so slow to receive grace; it is so often mixed up in their minds with the idea that they must do or feel something; but the grace of God which comes out in the gospel makes known what God has done,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=162>[Page 162]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and His pleasure in regard to us down here.<a name=162:1></a> It is all worked out in the Epistle to the Romans; God has provided everything; He has set forth His pleasure in regard to man in the Lord Jesus Christ; His pleasure as to what I am to enjoy as the effect of faith is all made known; you cannot add to it, and you cannot take from it.<a name=162:2></a> You may be very foggy about it; but you cannot alter it, and when you get clear about it you come to this, that you might have been clear a long while before, had it not been for mists in you.<a name=162:3></a> The grace of God is often clouded by mists in us, but it is simple enough in itself.<a name=162:4></a> God has been pleased to set forth in the Lord Jesus Christ that instead of man being under the pressure of judgment and death, His pleasure in regard to man is that he may be in peace and favour.<a name=162:5></a> And when the gospel is accepted, it comes to the soul as light, and the soul begins to realize what the thought and pleasure of God is in regard to man.<a name=162:6></a> Christ is "the Head of every man", and in Christ as the Head of every man, God has set forth His pleasure; and when the truth of what God has secured and established in the Lord Jesus Christ comes home to me, the grace of God becomes my light.<a name=162:7></a> I can rest in the pleasure of God, and if I do not, I am unbelieving.<a name=162:8></a> I cannot conceive a greater slight on God than the refusal to rest in His pleasure when He has been pleased to make it known, and yet thousands and thousands of souls are practically refusing to rest there.<a name=162:9></a> They want to add to it; but it cannot be added to, because everything is perfectly secured in Christ, and God will not have it added to.<a name=162:10></a> The only thing is to accept the light of the pleasure of God, receiving everything in it, forgiveness of sins, peace and favour.<a name=162:11></a> There is no question outstanding or unsettled.<a name=162:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I come to speak of the saint, then I

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=163>[Page 163]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		get grace in another aspect, namely, support.<a name=163:1></a> I learn that grace is the pre-eminent and governing principle.<a name=163:2></a> Whatever can be brought against man, grace will carry him superior to it.<a name=163:3></a> If all the powers of earth and hell were arrayed against the saint, grace can enable him to overcome them, grace reigns through righteousness -- 'ye are not under law, but under grace', -- we are supported by grace, and the very sense in the soul of the grace of God becomes the support of the soul.<a name=163:4></a> We "come boldly to the throne of grace"; it is the consciousness in the soul that grace is enthroned; and the sense of that is the practical support of the soul here in this world.<a name=163:5></a> It is blessed to think of what is in God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and that it is available for us, and we are to have the joy of it in our hearts.<a name=163:6></a> That is the support of every saint down here; grace is support.<a name=163:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this is found in Romans.<a name=163:8></a> In that epistle the apostle says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth"; and then the first expression of God's grace is that we are "justified freely"; it is the light coming to us and making known to us that which God has secured in Christ.<a name=163:9></a> Then "grace reigns through righteousness", that is the principle of the moment; it is no longer the reign of sin by death, but grace reigning through righteousness unto the blessed result of eternal life; that is, that grace will effect its own result; it will not fail, and eternal life will be the issue of it.<a name=163:10></a> And then there is another thing, that "we are not under law but under grace", we are in God's favour.<a name=163:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the last part of my subject, namely, grace in its display.<a name=163:12></a> I do not touch now on what we have had before us on a former occasion, the teaching of grace, what the effect of grace is in the soul; but I think I may just say that if grace

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=164>[Page 164]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		can be viewed as light and support, this necessitates another principle, namely, administration.<a name=164:1></a> And this is apparent in the gospel; the gospel is the glad tidings of the grace of God, and administration is necessarily connected with it; power has come down from on high to carry out the ministry of the gospel, and thus the thought of administration evidently is allied with grace.<a name=164:2></a> If it were not so, grace would not be available to man; God might have gracious thoughts in regard to man, but if God were not pleased to make those gracious thoughts known in the ministry of the gospel, the grace would not be effective for man.<a name=164:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I doubt if <i>love</i> as a principle admits of the idea of administration.<a name=164:4></a> I think I can tell you what the principle of love is as contrasted with grace -- love is attraction, love draws everything toward it.<a name=164:5></a> Grace works outward from God; the grace of God brings salvation to all men; but love draws inward to God.<a name=164:6></a> I suppose most here are acquainted with the simplest elements of astronomy; and if so, you know that the whole system of heavenly bodies is held together by the principle of attraction.<a name=164:7></a> If you take a limited part, what is called the solar system, every planet in that system is held in its place by the principle of attraction centred in the sun: no planet can move out of its own orbit, because of that influence.<a name=164:8></a> Now I think you could hardly have a better illustration of the principle of love; and I believe that great principle of attraction will prove itself to the very widest extent in the vast universe of bliss, and that every family in heaven and upon earth will be held in its own proper place by the influence of attraction; and the source and centre of the attraction is in God.<a name=164:9></a> That is what love is to me, that blessed principle in God, the divine nature, by which every family which God intends to bless will be held in its own place, and disorder will be

		The second mark is, "We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord".<a name=186:1></a> When a servant has a true idea of "Christ Jesus Lord", he does not preach himself.<a name=186:2></a> When he is marked by assumption and self-importance, he is out of the place of a servant.<a name=186:3></a> A servant in my house is not to assume a place of prominence.<a name=186:4></a> Apostleship only made a man a Levite; a believer is a priest.<a name=186:5></a> The competition among saints should be as to who will go the lowest.<a name=186:6></a> The one who has the greatest grace goes lowest; he does not lord it over saints but serves them.<a name=186:7></a> The Lord at the right hand of God was the One whom the apostle preached, because He is the One vested with power to remove all that stands in the way of the accomplishment of God's purpose.<a name=186:8></a> So we get in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>, "Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might".<a name=186:9></a> He has might to subdue all to Himself, and all that stands in the way He will remove.<a name=186:10></a> The apostle evidently had a great sense of who the Lord was: the One at the right hand of God, with unlimited power from God to give effect to the purposes of God.<a name=186:11></a> So he preached Christ Jesus the Lord, and "ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake", He had naturally parts and energy to be a leader among men, but as Christ's apostle he competed to take the lowest place.<a name=186:12></a> It is a great thing if you give saints the impression that you are their servant.<a name=186:13></a> If you have a true sense of the glory of the Lord, this is the place that you seek to take.<a name=186:14></a>

		It is clear that in this epistle we get the thought of the Christian running a race.<a name=206:1></a> The fact that Christ has entered in "within the veil" as Forerunner indicates that there are people running a race in regard to whom He is the "Forerunner".<a name=206:2></a> If there were not others following, the expression would not have any force.<a name=206:3></a> When we come to chapter 12 we get the admonition to "lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith".<a name=206:4></a> Running with patience the race set before us is that which is to mark the Christian.<a name=206:5></a> We know that the Apostle Paul himself had the idea of running a race (we see that in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>) he was running a race, and properly every Christian is doing so, and in order to run a race it is necessary to "lay aside every weight".<a name=206:6></a> If a man is running a race, he will keep his eye upon the goal or he will not run steadily.<a name=206:7></a> We want to be unencumbered on the one hand, and to keep our eye steadily on the goal on the other; the latter is the admonition in chapter 12.<a name=206:8></a>

		In this epistle we have Christ presented to us in the early part in two lights, that is, as Apostle and High Priest.<a name=207:2></a> In the beginning of chapter 3 we are admonished to "consider" the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.<a name=207:3></a> It is a great point to "consider".<a name=207:4></a> You will never get understanding if you do not "consider".<a name=207:5></a> The Lord gives understanding, but His giving understanding follows on our considering.<a name=207:6></a> Paul said to Timothy: "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things".<a name=207:7></a> The thing which is lacking in most of us is the habit of considering; and this is so as regards the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.<a name=207:8></a> We believe in Him, but now we have to "consider" Him.<a name=207:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two main thoughts with regard to the course of Christ -- He "came out" and He has "entered in"; He came out as Apostle, but He has gone in as Priest.<a name=207:10></a> In this epistle no apostle is named, for Christ is the apostle; the apostle is the One whom God employs to inaugurate a system, We see this in Moses.<a name=207:11></a> We are told in the beginning of the epistle that God has spoken in the last days in the Son.<a name=207:12></a> The Son came out in order that in Him God might make known His mind.<a name=207:13></a> God was not speaking any longer by prophets -- He had spoken in that way -- but now He took in hand to speak by the Son.<a name=207:14></a> The idea connected with that is, that, as Apostle, Christ "comes out".<a name=207:15></a> He says, "I came from God" -- He came into the world.<a name=207:16></a> He was the Apostle -- He is a great deal more than that, for, "God has spoken in the last days by the <i>Son</i>".<a name=207:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christ has "entered in" as Priest.<a name=207:18></a> He was not properly Priest until He "entered in"; and the reason is, that He had come to accomplish

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will have no difficulty in apprehending the difference of idea between "coming out" and "entering in".<a name=208:3></a> The one who has "entered in" as Forerunner helps others who are on the road.<a name=208:4></a> Christ is Priest at the right hand of God, and as Priest He helps us who are on the road.<a name=208:5></a> Do you know how you are helped?<a name=208:6></a> Well, it appears to me that nothing is indispensable to us down here except Christ.<a name=208:7></a> You may think the good of this world in your circumstances is indispensable.<a name=208:8></a> But nothing is indispensable.<a name=208:9></a> Health is not even indispensable.<a name=208:10></a> The one thing indispensable is Christ.<a name=208:11></a> The end to which Christ is working in regard to us is to make us conscious that He is indispensable to us, and it is when this is so that we are helped on the road.<a name=208:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another thought comes out, and that is of <i>our</i> "entering in".<a name=208:13></a> What I want to point out is, that though God was making known from time to time, and by one person and another, His purpose with regard to earth, after all from the beginning He was really gathering together a company for heaven.<a name=208:14></a> It will not be difficult to show that, all along the line, from the time that sin came into the world, God was engaged in gathering a company out of the world.<a name=208:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time God was working in view of the world to come, and many past things are not repeated in the ways of God.<a name=208:16></a> The flood happened once for all.<a name=208:17></a> It was used to purge the earth.<a name=208:18></a> The flood came in order that the earth might be regenerated (in a certain sense) to be a theatre for the world to come.<a name=208:19></a> There is no repetition of the flood.<a name=208:20></a> Evidently there will be an eventual purging of the earth and heaven by fire, but there will be no purging again of the earth by a flood.<a name=208:21></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God was thus acting from time to time, and through one and another in times past, in regard to the world to come.<a name=209:9></a> But while He was doing that, all along the line there was being gathered a company for heaven.<a name=209:10></a> All those named in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>formed part of a company which was being gathered for heaven.<a name=209:11></a> Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah -- all formed part of a heavenly company.<a name=209:12></a> They had not a forerunner, the way was not very clear to them, they could not probably see the end to which God was leading them; but in the light <i>we</i> have we can see what God was doing -- He was forming a company for heaven, and if all these were not to have their part in the resurrection, they really had nothing.<a name=209:13></a>

		Now in the end of the Revelation we find the church distinguished, and we do not read much about the twenty-four elders.<a name=210:6></a> I do not think the twenty-four elders are the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=210:7></a> We are told that in the twelve foundations of the holy city are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; and hence the bride, the Lamb's wife, is distinctive of the church.<a name=210:8></a> If it included the whole of the twenty-four elders, that is, the whole heavenly company, we would scarcely get the names of the twelve apostles in the foundation.<a name=210:9></a> I think we may safely conclude that the city represents the church, that is, the church in that aspect, as having had its foundations laid in the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=210:10></a>

		If you are wishing to be healthy and vigorous, you must be in healthy conditions; and to be in healthy conditions you must have Christ in view by the Spirit, and then it is that your constitution is formed by that which you enjoy in Christ as Christ is known to us.<a name=214:2></a> In human things it may be said that a wife lives by her husband.<a name=214:3></a> God has subjected the wife to the husband, and the husband is to love the wife, and, properly speaking, the wife lives morally by the love of the husband; and, on the other hand, the husband is known in the wife, not the wife in the husband.<a name=214:4></a> We get that thought at the end of Proverbs.<a name=214:5></a> A faithful wife is depicted, and the comment is, that the husband is known by her in the gates.<a name=214:6></a> If all of us were kept by the Spirit in the light of Christ (because "the darkness is passing, and the true light now shines"), what would be the result?<a name=214:7></a> The character of Christ would come out in us, and we should be marked down here by three qualities -- truth and meekness and righteousness.<a name=214:8></a> I speak of these because I find them to be connected with the Lord Himself; and those who are living by Christ, in the light of our Sun, in conditions favourable to spiritual life (as it is possible now to live by the Spirit), will come out in truth and meekness and righteousness.<a name=214:9></a> These would be exemplified in the saints down here.<a name=214:10></a>

		The gain we have in having Christ as Forerunner is that we are linked with the Forerunner, and in the future the Husband will be known in the bride.<a name=215:3></a> The bride will be in all the brightness of the Bridegroom; the glory of God is there, and "her light like unto a stone most precious".<a name=215:4></a> The peculiarity of the church is dependent, partly on the calling of God, but even more, in a way, on the link which subsists at this moment between the Forerunner and the many sons whom God is bringing to glory.<a name=215:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I sought to make plain last time the line on which God had been working from the beginning, that is, gathering a company for heaven.<a name=216:1></a> I noticed the distinction between things at this present time, and what had been.<a name=216:2></a> The first point was, that, in contrast to saints of old, we have a Forerunner who has entered in, and we are linked with the Forerunner -- that is peculiar to the present time.<a name=216:3></a> But while there is that distinction, which is very marked, yet all the saints in heaven form one company.<a name=216:4></a> They do not form one church, but they form one company; all are in perfect unity in heaven.<a name=216:5></a> The company is presented to us in the Revelation under the figure of the twenty-four elders.<a name=216:6></a> They surround the throne, and form, so to speak, a complete company -- they have that part.<a name=216:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of the Revelation, however, we get the church distinctively: it is spoken of as the bride, the Lamb's wife -- that is distinctive, and the bride is presented under the figure of the holy city, Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from God.<a name=216:8></a> There are thus two thoughts in the Revelation -- the entire heavenly company, and the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=216:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to another point very intimately connected with what I have said, that is, the truth of the Head, the One that God had in view in all His dealings; even anterior to the world God had the Head in view; the thought of eternal life is connected with the Head.<a name=216:10></a> God had, as we find in the early part of this chapter, certain purposes connected

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with the Head, and He has "abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known to us the mystery of his will".<a name=217:1></a> There were thus not only the public and outward dealings of God in the world, but the mystery of His will, and it is the mystery of His will still, and will be until everything becomes manifest.<a name=217:2></a> When all things are made manifest, they are evidently no longer mysteries; meanwhile the apostle's labour was to make manifest the mystery of the gospel, as he was bound to do, and God "has made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself for the dispensation of the fulness of times, to head up in one all things in Christ".<a name=217:3></a> The mystery of God's will underlay all the outward and public dealings of God; and you see how different is our position with regard to those that went before.<a name=217:4></a> God did not make known the mystery of His will before, for saints would not have understood it; I do not think Abraham and David really knew what God was going to effect.<a name=217:5></a> But now the Head has come in, and the Holy Ghost has been given, in order that He might make known to us the "mystery of his will".<a name=217:6></a> That is the thought in regard to us (before the dispensation of the fulness of times), on which I want to touch, as well as on our place in connection with the "good pleasure of his will".<a name=217:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three points that come out here (I do not touch on the first six verses) in regard to saints -- first, redemption; then inheritance; then the Spirit as the earnest of the inheritance.<a name=217:8></a> It has struck me that you get redemption and inheritance coming together in Scripture.<a name=217:9></a> When the commission was given by the Lord to the apostle Paul, to go to the Gentiles to "open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God", it was that they might receive

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Christ".<a name=218:1></a> You get the same thought here -- "By whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins" -- then "In whom we have obtained an inheritance".<a name=218:2></a> Therefore these things are common to every Christian, they are not the peculiar possession of any select company.<a name=218:3></a> All have forgiveness of sins, inheritance in Christ, and finally, the Spirit as the earnest of the inheritance.<a name=218:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall touch on these points, but will first say a little with regard to the mystery of God's will.<a name=218:5></a> And to that end I am going to trace in a few words the course of things in the world.<a name=218:6></a> I have thought over the expression "the world" in Scripture -- and judge that there is often a peculiar force in the use of the term.<a name=218:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the public dealings of God, things were allowed to go on much as they might before the flood, and then God brought in the judgment.<a name=218:8></a> Man had revolted from God, and was pretty much given up; the earth was filled with violence and corruption, so that God had to bring in the flood, and there was an end to all that course of things.<a name=218:9></a> It was the era of licence; men were unrestrained, liable to direct Satanic influences -- a state which God could not allow to continue.<a name=218:10></a> Then after the flood there was a new departure, and it began with the principle of government.<a name=218:11></a> But things were not morally changed.<a name=218:12></a> Man began to show his hand again, he had a thought that does not seem to have come out before -- he was going to make a name for himself, to build a city (it was a Babylonish idea) and a tower to reach to heaven, and that led to the formation of nations; but as yet there was hardly the "world".<a name=218:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In course of time, after giving promises to the fathers, God took up a particular people, the seed of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=219>[Page 219]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the fathers.<a name=219:1></a> They were in bondage for four hundred years or more; and then God interfered to accomplish His purpose, to bring them into the land promised to the fathers.<a name=219:2></a> But before bringing them in, God established in their midst a religious system, He gave them His law, and a system of worship was ordained; and when they came into the land, they were not simply a nation, but in a sense, though separate, were the centre of a system, and that system is the "world" as I judge Scripture often speaks of it.<a name=219:3></a> There was eventually a city, and in the city a throne and a temple -- there was an organised system, not consisting of one nation, but of a number of nations connected with one nation, of which system this was the centre.<a name=219:4></a> I have thought that we have hardly always got the scriptural idea of the "world"; I think "world" implies an organised system with a centre, and an order of worship; you get that thought implied in the Hebrews.<a name=219:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the nation which was the centre of this system became perverse and idolatrous.<a name=219:6></a> They were this really from the start, in the wilderness they worshipped the golden calf, and when they came into the land of promise they did worse than the nations round about them.<a name=219:7></a> In the meantime God allowed to spring up in the world what I may call a rival system, which settled finally in Babylon.<a name=219:8></a> Babylon became the beginning of a series of empires, and God allowed the "world", which He had established, to be swallowed up by Babylon.<a name=219:9></a> Babylon had its throne and its system of worship, and was the centre, not of a world that God had formed but of man's world.<a name=219:10></a> This did not come to pass in a moment: I do not think it was thoroughly effected until Christ had been rejected.<a name=219:11></a> Long before Christ came the Jews had been under the power of Babylon; but when Christ was rejected, the divinely-appointed

		system was wholly swallowed up by Babylon, in its successor Rome.<a name=220:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then what came to pass was, that the succession of empires, which began with Babylon and ended with Rome, was in its turn set aside.<a name=220:2></a> A deadly wound, largely attributable to Christianity, was inflicted on the Gentile system -- on man's world.<a name=220:3></a> The Gentile empires are spoken of as "beasts" -- wild beasts -- and we are told that the beast received a "deadly wound".<a name=220:4></a> But <i>now</i> we have in the world, not the system that God appointed, nor the Roman empire exactly, but a corrupted Christianity; but in result this empire, this system of man, will be reconstituted, the deadly wound will be healed, and this great "beast" will be revived -- though in a new form.<a name=220:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now amid all this God has brought in the Man of His right hand, the Man in whom He purposed to head everything up.<a name=220:6></a> The mystery of His will from the beginning was bound up with the Man of His purpose.<a name=220:7></a> We get very many hints and allusions to this in the Old Testament; but now God has brought to light the Son of man, whom He has made strong for Himself, and that Man has in God's grace "tasted death for everything".<a name=220:8></a> It is on that ground that He is the Head of the world to come.<a name=220:9></a> The world to come is in contrast with the world which began with Israel (the world which has been), and is brought into view in the One whom God has made "Head over all things"; and the mystery of God's will is made known.<a name=220:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mystery of God's will has reference to the dispensation of the "fulness of times".<a name=220:11></a> Now I do not want you to defer that thought wholly to the future.<a name=220:12></a> You see many things which in the way of their public application are future; but the "fulness of times" in a certain sense is already brought in, for the reason that the One is brought in,

	<div class="paragraph">
		in whom everything is headed up.<a name=221:1></a> At the close of the chapter we read that Christ is given to be Head over all things.<a name=221:2></a> Whatever God has instituted, God has purposed to gather up in Him: whether in heaven in the way of power, or on earth in the way of thrones, they are all headed up in Christ, and in order that Christ may give character to them all.<a name=221:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great point to get hold of the truth of the Head, because you get then the system of things which centres in the Head, and you are entitled to know it, because God "has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence" to make it known to us.<a name=221:4></a> I think one end in view is, that we might be delivered from the influence of things down here, that we might not be captivated and allured by them, for if we are in the light of God's will, we see also the One in whom that will is centred.<a name=221:5></a> God has seen fit to gather up in one all things in Christ; and one purpose that will be served in it is, that in all there will be brought about perfect unity, not Israel bent on one thing and the nations on another, not heaven bent on one thing and earth on another, but unity prevailing throughout.<a name=221:6></a> I judge that to be one great reason for everything being headed up in one Man, and we need to have that before us.<a name=221:7></a> The fact is, that the greatest man of the world, the greatest politician, is not a head -- he does not really influence the course of things in this world -- he follows it rather than directs it.<a name=221:8></a> Things in general take their course, and man cannot help it.<a name=221:9></a> The politician in a kind of way seeks to moderate things, and if possible to avoid complications, but the politician does not direct the course of the world; the course of the world has been much more ordered by military success than by the politician.<a name=221:10></a> The world takes its course, but where are we in regard to it all.<a name=221:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I can tell, the place of interest to the Christian is the right hand of God, and the point
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=222>[Page 222]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of interest, the One who is there, and the mystery of God's will.<a name=222:1></a> I wish to point out the interest that we have in the One who is at the right hand of God.<a name=222:2></a> That is much more important to us than even the principalities and powers and thrones and dominions over which He is Head.<a name=222:3></a> We read "To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved: in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace".<a name=222:4></a> The thing spoken of here is redemption, and the form which redemption now takes with regard to us is the forgiveness of sins.<a name=222:5></a> Redemption will yet have a fuller application in regard to the people of God, that is, as to the body.<a name=222:6></a> God has not yet released the body, but we have forgiveness of sins.<a name=222:7></a> The believer does not come into judgment, and has the forgiveness of sins that he may have a purged conscience, so as to approach God.<a name=222:8></a> If we had not forgiveness of sins, we could never be apart from the man who had sinned; but God has given forgiveness to us that we might be apart from that man, and thus it is that we have no more conscience of sins.<a name=222:9></a> The point is, that the believer is born of God.<a name=222:10></a> If I can take account of myself in that way as formed by the Spirit of God in the divine nature, then I can say: "No more I, but sin that dwelleth in me".<a name=222:11></a> It is a very important point to take account of the inward man.<a name=222:12></a> The man who is formed in the divine nature is, it is evident, morally new.<a name=222:13></a> When a man has believed and received forgiveness of sins, the next thing that happens is that he is buried with Christ by baptism unto death.<a name=222:14></a> This ends his history as a man in the flesh, and he can "account himself dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus".<a name=222:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is a great point to have come to; but the thought of God is not only forgiveness but inheritance,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=223>[Page 223]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and the basis of that is, that Christ has died.<a name=223:1></a> Christ has died to secure forgiveness as the expression of divine love; and if God has been pleased to give expression thus to His love, you can understand that there is nothing which He will withhold.<a name=223:2></a> All that Christ is as man is given in the grace of God.<a name=223:3></a> If the love of God were such that He would give His Son to die for us, you can understand that "with him" God would "give us all things".<a name=223:4></a> Divine love would give all that Christ is as Man; and God has thus given us that greatest privilege that God could give, that is, sonship.<a name=223:5></a> With sonship, which is the gift of God, you naturally come to inheritance.<a name=223:6></a> The apostle Paul went among the Gentiles preaching the "unsearchable riches of Christ".<a name=223:7></a> The fact is, that you can only measure what is given in the grace of God by Christ Himself; if you get an apprehension of what Christ is as man, and what belongs to Him as man, you can understand the "unsearchable riches of Christ".<a name=223:8></a> And if God has seen fit in grace to give us redemption (that is, forgiveness of sins), that must carry everything else with it, for the simple reason that the forgiveness of sins is the consequence of the death of Christ; and if God gave up His Son to death, the love which thus gave up His Son must give everything else with it.<a name=223:9></a> Thus we have two great things which belong to the Christian: first, redemption, and then inheritance.<a name=223:10></a> Inheritance involves companionship with Christ; it hangs on sonship.<a name=223:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But a further point is, that we have the Spirit as the earnest of the inheritance -- for nothing is displayed yet.<a name=223:12></a> The Spirit is the earnest of the inheritance, because it is by the Spirit that we are brought into the life of Christ.<a name=223:13></a> If you want to get the present enjoyment of the inheritance, you must find it in the life of Christ.<a name=223:14></a> It is connected in my mind with the thought that "your life is hid with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if you live where Christ lives and because He lives, you can understand that the inheritance is assured to you.<a name=224:14></a> If we could be all brought to that point by the Spirit of God -- that we live because Christ lives -- the effect would be that we should get the assurance of the inheritance.<a name=224:15></a> That is what I understand by the expression, "He has given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".<a name=224:16></a> We need to cease from resting on terms.<a name=224:17></a> I do not think Scripture
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=225>[Page 225]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		intends that we should rest simply on texts.<a name=225:1></a> Scripture tells us what is for us, but it really gives us nothing; all is given to you effectually by the power of the Spirit, and I am not content to rest simply on the statement that the Spirit is the earnest of the inheritance, but I would go a step further, and understand how it is that the Spirit is the earnest of the inheritance.<a name=225:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing if we can in mind detach ourselves from the course and interests of this world, and be kept by the Spirit in the sense that we live because Christ lives.<a name=225:3></a> But if we live because Christ lives, in the day of His manifestation we shall come into the inheritance, and the apostle prays in the end of the chapter: "That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead".<a name=225:4></a> Meantime we have the seal of the Spirit, and the Spirit is an effectual seal and earnest, for by the Spirit we are conscious that we live because Christ lives.<a name=225:5></a>

		Now I want to show the place which the church has in the scheme of God.<a name=227:3></a> Nothing can be of more importance than that we should apprehend the divine scheme "in Christ".<a name=227:4></a> "In Christ" is a peculiar expression, and one of great moment.<a name=227:5></a> Properly speaking it contemplates Christ as the great Head and vessel of God's purpose; and hence if I think of Christ, what comes before my mind is the system of which Christ is the Head and the Centre.<a name=227:6></a> It is a great thing for us to have not only Christ before us, but the system and order of things which God has purposed in Christ.<a name=227:7></a> Whatever promises there are of God, in Christ is the yea, and in Him the Amen.<a name=227:8></a> The fact is, that in the foreshadowing of things (as in the Old Testament), God had before Him the whole system which it was His purpose to establish in Christ.<a name=227:9></a> Of course this did not come to light before Christ came; but now that Christ has come, there is an expression which is extremely common in the New Testament -- "all things".<a name=227:10></a> "All things that the Father hath are mine".<a name=227:11></a> "All things are delivered unto me of my Father".<a name=227:12></a> The "all things" are, of course, the things which are centred in Christ -- they are delivered to Him of His Father.<a name=227:13></a>

		As I have said before, my point is to bring before you <i>the place</i> which the church has in this system.<a name=227:14></a> This comes out specially in the early part of this chapter.<a name=227:15></a> Then we can see the consequences of that place which God has been pleased to assign to the church in Christ Jesus.<a name=227:16></a> There is no doubt that when these things take possession of the heart of man, they produce a revolution in his ways down

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the early part of the chapter (verses 1 - 10) there are two thoughts that appear, namely, our place, and that which is intimately connected with it, salvation.<a name=228:4></a> I want to make plain that salvation, in a full sense, is connected with a change of place.<a name=228:5></a> If there were not in regard to us such a thought as a change of place, it would be impossible to realise salvation in its full sense.<a name=228:6></a> It says, "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith HE loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.<a name=228:7></a> For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God".<a name=228:8></a> The thought of salvation comes out here manifestly in connection with a change of place; therefore I will dwell, first, on the change of place, and then on salvation in connection with the change of place.<a name=228:9></a> Then we can see that we are left here in the knowledge of the change of place, and in the reality of salvation, in order that everything that is of God may be maintained through us.<a name=228:10></a> You may depend upon it, God never sent us into the world simply to get our living and bring up our families.<a name=228:11></a> God sent us into the world (He first took

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can gainsay that there is a change of place for the Christian, because you and I were born for the earth, and all that we had naturally was connected with the earth.<a name=229:2></a> The expectation which men commonly entertain of going to heaven is fallacious.<a name=229:3></a> God may give a man title to heaven, but there is nothing of that kind naturally attaching to man down here.<a name=229:4></a> When God created Adam there was no idea of his going to heaven, that was no part of his life down here, there was no such hope then attaching to him.<a name=229:5></a> And in regard of man departed from God, there can be no idea of his going to heaven.<a name=229:6></a> Man's life is connected with the earth, and does not properly go beyond the earth -- except that beyond death there is judgment.<a name=229:7></a> "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment".<a name=229:8></a> Scripture does not say: "It is appointed unto men to go to heaven".<a name=229:9></a> But we find in the early part of this chapter that God has wrought (it is the work of God that is contemplated), in connection with the system which He has purposed in Christ, to quicken Jew and Gentile with Christ, and raise them up together, and make them sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=229:10></a> According to the work of God, Christians are made to sit in the "heavenly places", but that is a question of God's sovereignty: man's work never can form a claim to heaven.<a name=229:11></a> Man's works might form a kind of claim to live on earth, but not at all of going to heaven.<a name=229:12></a> The law said, "Do this, and live"; but the idea of going to heaven was never entertained, and our going to heaven involves, in the first place, God's sovereignty.<a name=229:13></a> He has made Jew and Gentile sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with a purpose of His own, "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this great scheme of God's purpose in Christ our part is not upon earth.<a name=230:3></a> There are those who will have their part, in connection with this scheme, on earth, because God will gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.<a name=230:4></a> But God has not given us a place on earth.<a name=230:5></a> That is a very important consideration.<a name=230:6></a> The Lord spoke of going to prepare a place for His disciples; and He was coming again to receive them to Himself, that they might be with Him in the place which He had gone to prepare.<a name=230:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now the work of God in us has reference to the place which God has appointed to us in the scheme He has purposed in Christ Jesus.<a name=230:8></a> To enter into that thought, the first thing is to get hold of the scheme of God's purpose to head up in one all things in Christ Jesus; and the next consideration is our place in that scheme, and the object of it, that the church in the ages to come may be the witness and vessel of the exceeding riches of God's grace.<a name=230:9></a> What can be more remarkable, when one considers their alienation from God and from one another, than that Jew and Gentile should be raised up together in order that in them the exceeding riches of God's grace might be set forth!<a name=230:10></a> What a change it indicates as regards Jew and Gentile, for how could the riches of God's grace be set forth in them if they were not in perfect accord with God?<a name=230:11></a> But the fact is, that God in His rich mercy has called us, and we have been affected and influenced by the love of God.<a name=230:12></a> Even those in whom God has not wrought in the same manner will here upon earth walk in the light of the heavenly city, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory and honour

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will see the change of place.<a name=231:4></a> If you think of yourselves in connection with the scheme of God in Christ Jesus, your place is heaven.<a name=231:5></a> It is a great thing for the mind to entertain the change of place.<a name=231:6></a> The thought of the change of place is brought in in connection with salvation, for the apostle says, "By grace ye are saved", and he repeats this, "By grace ye are saved", adding "through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God".<a name=231:7></a> The apostle was writing to the Ephesians to show them the true condition of salvation, and he emphasises salvation; for unless we are in salvation, the will of God cannot fully come out in us.<a name=231:8></a> If Christians are entangled in the world system, evidently they must be more or less in bondage; and while they are in bondage, it is impossible that the will of God can come out clearly in them.<a name=231:9></a> I think it is a very painful consideration at the present time that Christians so much regard their status and interests in the world -- and in attaching so much importance to these, they greatly hinder and obscure the expression of God's will in them.<a name=231:10></a> Salvation is a most important consideration for every one.<a name=231:11></a> When the Lord comes, and you are taken to heaven, you will realise salvation very fully; salvation will be connected then with a change of place.<a name=231:12></a> So it says, "He shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation".<a name=231:13></a>

		Israel could not realise salvation in Egypt -- God did not intend them to; neither when they were between the Egyptians and the Red Sea, there was no salvation there.<a name=232:6></a> But when they were on the other side of the Red Sea, and the waters had swallowed up their enemies, then they could say: "Salvation is of Jehovah" -- their place was changed; and if we want to enter into the reality of salvation now, it must connect itself with the apprehension of a change of place.<a name=232:7></a> And if I apprehend the divine scheme and our place in that scheme, I am delivered from the influence and entanglements of this present world.<a name=232:8></a> And that is a very important point for us, if the will of God is to be set forth in man down here.<a name=232:9></a> It would be a strange thing to translate a beggar into the palace of the king.<a name=232:10></a> But what has occurred in regard to us?<a name=232:11></a> We have been taken up from earth where we had forfeited all -- God has taken us up from the scene of moral death, and has set us in "heavenly places" in Christ.<a name=232:12></a> When I was alive in the world I was subject to the judgment of death; it is another thing entirely now.<a name=232:13></a> I apprehend (and every Christian is entitled to apprehend) the place that God has given us in that scheme in Christ.<a name=232:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the latter part of the chapter (verses 13, 18, 19, 21, 22).<a name=233:3></a> We have here different points of God's will which are to have their expression in the saints; and all hangs on the realisation of salvation, that is, that a revolution has really been wrought in the mind of the Christian.<a name=233:4></a> He has been brought to the surrender of worldly status and interest in the apprehension of the place that God has given to him in Christ Jesus.<a name=233:5></a> Now the object of this is that the will of God might be maintained in us at the present moment: not the will of God in regard to things in <i>heaven</i>, but the will of God in regard to things <i>down here</i>.<a name=233:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thought we have is of nearness, we are "become nigh"; then in verse 18 we have access; in verse 19 we are "fellow citizens of the saints and of the household of God"; in verse 21 we get the thought of the temple; and in verse 22 the "habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=233:7></a> Now no thought in all that is really new -- for all these things had been shadowed beforehand.<a name=233:8></a> The thought "ye are become nigh" is dispensationally nigh, Israel had been dispensationally nigh.<a name=233:9></a> Access is not exactly a new thought, because access in a limited way had been set forth in Israel, the priests entered into the holy place.<a name=233:10></a> Then the household of God is not a new thought, for Israel had come under God's care and protection, they had in a sense enjoyed the privileges of the household of God.<a name=233:11></a> The "temple of God" is not a new thought, the temple of God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we get a number of thoughts which are not new, but the point is, that these thoughts, having been set forth as the will of God, are to be maintained now in those who are in the enjoyment of salvation.<a name=234:3></a> It is a great thing to see that divine thoughts are not allowed to lapse, but that they are now maintained in the saints.<a name=234:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The priests did not enter into the holiest of all; but <i>we</i> enter in, and the ground of our entering in is that we have a place in heaven.<a name=234:5></a> If we did not know that God had designed a place for us there, I cannot see how we should have the power to enter in.<a name=234:6></a> But if we enter in, it means that everything that is of God and for God is maintained in us.<a name=234:7></a> That is what we are set here for at the present time.<a name=234:8></a> Jew and Gentile are become nigh by the blood of Christ; that is, they are dispensationally nigh.<a name=234:9></a> They have access to the Father, reality of access too.<a name=234:10></a> The truth is that we are in the light of the revelation which God has been pleased to give of Himself.<a name=234:11></a> The revelation of God in regard to Israel was very limited; they had God in a sense, but God had not yet come out.<a name=234:12></a> The truth now is, that God has come out, and we are privileged to be in the light of this; we have access through Jesus by one Spirit to the Father.<a name=234:13></a> It is part of the will of God, that we are nigh; and we have access, for that too is part of God's will.<a name=234:14></a> Then we are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household of God -- coming under the care and discipline of God.<a name=234:15></a> As Israel was under the discipline of God, so in a very much more real way are the saints who are of the household of God.<a name=234:16></a> God provides food for His household, and the household comes under His eye.<a name=234:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the thought of a holy temple.<a name=235:4></a> The oracles of God are found there.<a name=235:5></a> "All the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord".<a name=235:6></a> In the Epistle to the Corinthians the apostle goes so far as to say that they were God's temple.<a name=235:7></a> The light and oracles of God were there, as in the temple in Jerusalem.<a name=235:8></a> But still another thought comes out, that God is dwelling here by the Spirit; and that means great blessing for those among whom God dwells.<a name=235:9></a> When God dwelt in Israel, He was the blessing in their midst; the very fact of His dwelling was fraught with blessing for them; and in the future I have no doubt that God will be the blessing in the midst of Israel, and Israel a blessing in the midst of the nations.<a name=235:10></a>

		Now all these things were part of God's will.<a name=235:11></a> They are things which are for God, things which God had foreshadowed, and which are to be maintained in the saints.<a name=235:12></a> We have not an earthly portion nor an earthly place.<a name=235:13></a> In a sense we have no tie to earth.<a name=235:14></a> I venture to say that on earth there is really nothing indispensable to us.<a name=235:15></a> There is one thing which is indispensable to us, and that is Christ.<a name=235:16></a> The great point is that our links, properly speaking, are above, we have a place and associations above; and because of it we have privilege to enter in, and to be free from entanglements here, and thus we are fitted to set forth what is of God here.<a name=235:17></a> When Jacob began to form attachments in connection with earth, God came in in the way of discipline; and the same is true in regard to us

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire at this time to show you how the teaching of Peter and of John runs parallel with that of Paul, which came before us last time in connection with <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>.<a name=237:1></a> We find the confirmation of Paul's teachings (we get further light too) in the writings of Peter and John.<a name=237:2></a> We cannot do without any part of the New Testament, we want one part to amplify another.<a name=237:3></a> It is something of the same principle that is seen in the Old Testament.<a name=237:4></a> "No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .<a name=237:5></a>.<a name=237:6></a>.<a name=237:7></a> but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit".<a name=237:8></a> Every prophetic writing is part of the system, you cannot understand any part by itself, it has to be viewed in the light of what we may call the prophetic system.<a name=237:9></a> People who take up a particular book of prophecy and think they can by study get the meaning of it by itself, are mistaken.<a name=237:10></a> So in the New Testament, we want all the writers, not only Paul, but John and Peter, if we are to get anything like a complete thought of Christianity, for they are all employed in setting forth Christianity from some point of view; and the point of view of one can hardly be said to carry completeness -- we want the whole system of truth in that way.<a name=237:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer back for a moment to what we had before us last time in connection with <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, as to the main points.<a name=237:12></a> I was showing that the point on which, so to speak, the chapter turns, is salvation; and that salvation is connected with a change of place.<a name=237:13></a> The change of place is brought out conspicuously

		in that chapter; but in order to emphasise the thought of salvation, I sought also to bring before you the object of salvation, that is, that the mind and will of God might find its expression in us down here.<a name=238:1></a> It is not enough for us to know that there is such a thing as salvation (I suppose most Christians know that), but that we should be so in the reality of it that the mind and will of God may be set forth in us down here.<a name=238:2></a> If we are in bondage to anything that is not of God, that so far presents a hindrance to God's will being set forth in us; any one can understand that we cannot be here entirely for the will of God, if we are not free of what is unsuitable to God.<a name=238:3></a> You cannot serve two masters; the Lord said: "Ye cannot serve God and mammon".<a name=238:4></a> If a man is serving mammon, he does not serve God; I do not say that he is not a believer, that is another point; but if a man is in bondage to the world, he is not free to serve God.<a name=238:5></a> God would not be served by the Israelites while in bondage in Egypt; that was what Pharaoh wanted, but God would have the people brought out of bondage, if He was to be served by them, and I think that is always the principle with God.<a name=238:6></a>

		Now in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>the apostle exhorts us "As newborn babes to desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby <i>unto salvation</i>" (I add those two words because they ought to be there), "If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious".<a name=238:7></a> We get here (in Peter) the same thoughts practically as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>.<a name=238:8></a> To begin with, we get the thought of salvation; then of nearness and access then the thought of a spiritual house.<a name=238:9></a> Thus we have mainly the things which are taught in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>; that is, Paul and Peter do not teach different things, but practically the same thing.<a name=238:10></a> Of course, the truth is spoken here in connection with the Jews of the dispersion, but then what applies to

		I would like to enlarge on salvation so far as I understand it.<a name=239:2></a> I think one can see three steps in salvation.<a name=239:3></a> The first is, that we are delivered from bondage to one lord by being brought into bondage to Another.<a name=239:4></a> That is what I should call the first principle of salvation.<a name=239:5></a> Israel was delivered from bondage to Pharaoh really by being brought into bondage to God: that was the power of their deliverance, and the same principle applies to us.<a name=239:6></a> We are brought out of bondage to the god and prince of this world and into bondage to Christ.<a name=239:7></a> The apostle Paul could propose salvation to the Philippian jailor, and how was it to come to pass?<a name=239:8></a> By believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=239:9></a> He had been in bondage to the god and prince of this world, and the apostle spoke to him the word of the Lord; and the practical result was that he became in bondage to the Lord Jesus Christ -- in other words, there was a change of master.<a name=239:10></a> That is the first principle with regard to the believer -- the believer is "delivered from the authority of darkness and translated into the kingdom of the Son of God's love".<a name=239:11></a> We can see how very real this was in the early days, when we remember that idolatry was the "power of darkness"; when the Colossians and Thessalonians worshipped dumb idols it was not simply dumb idols, but the authority of darkness, and people were "translated into the kingdom of the Son of God's love".<a name=239:12></a> If you want to understand that expression, I would refer you to what occurred on the mount of transfiguration.<a name=239:13></a> Everything there was subdued to the authority of Christ, and Christ was announced to be "God's beloved Son".<a name=239:14></a> There we get the idea of the "kingdom of the Son of God's love".<a name=239:15></a> Any one can appreciate the immense moral

		change which took place, in the fact of people being delivered from idolatry and "translated into the kingdom of the Son of God's love".<a name=240:1></a> The change was immense, and we see it exemplified in the case of the jailor.<a name=240:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next stage of salvation is in the question of association.<a name=240:3></a> You might look at <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:21">1 Peter  3:21</a>, 22, and at <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:4">Titus  3:4</a> - 7, for in these two passages we get the idea of salvation, that is, in the change of association.<a name=240:4></a> You can realise it in some measure, if you go back to early times and contemplate what took place at Jerusalem or among the Gentiles; those who had been affected by the gospel were brought out of unclean and filthy associations into Christian fellowship.<a name=240:5></a> I have no doubt it is that to which Peter refers when he says, "Baptism doth also now save us".<a name=240:6></a> People were very much affected by being brought into pure and holy associations.<a name=240:7></a> The apostle Paul alludes to the same thing, speaking of the mercy of God, in his Epistle to Titus: "According to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost" the "washing of regeneration" is probably an allusion to baptism, through which those who were converted were brought into Christian associations, and at the same time there was a renewing of the Spirit which fitted them for those associations.<a name=240:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first step in the Christian course is evidently in the confession of Christ as Lord, so that there is a "change of master", and the second step is in the "change of association", that is, that the Gentile was brought out of his heathenism, and the Jew out of his Judaism, and both were brought into associations which took their character from the Holy Ghost.<a name=240:9></a> What is the effect in our case?<a name=240:10></a> The time was when we were entangled in the great systems of the world -- man's world.<a name=240:11></a> You may call them Christian systems; you may call the State church

		a Christian church; you may call popery a Christian church; or a dissenting body a Christian church; but every one of them is part of the great world system, and it is very difficult for any one in any of these systems to understand salvation, because they are still entangled in the world.<a name=241:1></a> I think salvation can only be rightly known in being brought into the reality of Christian association outside of these great systems, where things take their character from the Holy Ghost.<a name=241:2></a> It is true of us, as it was at the beginning, that salvation depends upon being brought into the reality of Christian association.<a name=241:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to another step in salvation, that is change of place.<a name=241:4></a> I took that up in connection with <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>.<a name=241:5></a> The point there is change of place.<a name=241:6></a> Those who had had a place on earth, or even those who had not had it (for the Gentiles have no place on earth), now have a place in heaven.<a name=241:7></a> I alluded to what I think is an illustration of this -- that the expression of Jonah, "Salvation is of the Lord", was immediately followed by a change of place: "And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land".<a name=241:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus three simple thoughts in regard to salvation: namely, change of lord and master, change of association, and change of place; and I think I may say that you will apprehend that salvation is thus in Christ Jesus, because it is only in Christ Jesus that change of place can be realised: God has "raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in <i>Christ Jesus</i>".<a name=241:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle says here, "As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation".<a name=241:10></a> All will admit that it is a great thing to be free of bondage to Satan, and from evil and worldly associations, and to be free too even as regards yourself.<a name=241:11></a> I think a great

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will pass on to verses 4 and 5, where it says, "to whom coming as unto a living stone".<a name=242:2></a> I will say a word or two in regard to the "Living Stone".<a name=242:3></a> You see in this passage an advance on the thought, "that ye may grow thereby <i>unto salvation</i>", it is, "to whom coming as unto a living stone".<a name=242:4></a> Now there are two things spoken of in connection with the Living Stone, that is, that it is "chosen of God", and "precious".<a name=242:5></a> Previously it said, "Disallowed indeed of men"; men disallowed Christ -- they crucified Him.<a name=242:6></a> But the point is, that He is "chosen of God and precious", and later on in the passage we are told that "to you who believe he is precious".<a name=242:7></a> What I make out of it is this, that Christ is the way of access, because it is in Christ that God and believers are really drawn together.<a name=242:8></a> If, on the one hand, Christ is a Living Stone, chosen of God: and, on the other hand, to you precious, God and you are really together in Christ.<a name=242:9></a> If you approach God by One who is chosen of Him (as Christ is), you have access to Him.<a name=242:10></a> Christ became precious to the woman of Samaria.<a name=242:11></a> She said, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<a name=242:12></a>" But then Christ is the "chosen of God", and thus in a sense God and she were really brought together.<a name=242:13></a> Again, in Mary of Bethany: for the same reason God and Mary were brought together.<a name=242:14></a> So it is in regard to us.<a name=242:15></a> Christ is precious to us; He took our liabilities, and has given us "living water", and now through Him we have "access by one Spirit unto the Father".<a name=242:16></a> Christ in that way has become the practical link between

		God and you or me.<a name=243:1></a> Now what I have said is extremely practical; and Christianity does not consist in the holding of doctrine, but in living association with Christ.<a name=243:2></a> There is nothing more important than that Christ is chosen of God and at the same time precious to us.<a name=243:3></a> He will not be otherwise than precious; if He is not precious to us we are nothing, but if He is precious we have everything in Him.<a name=243:4></a> I venture to say that there is only One who is indispensable to us down here, and that is Christ; a man might be bereft of everything down here, but if he had Christ he could get on.<a name=243:5></a> If Christ is everything to us, then we have great liberty in approaching the Father.<a name=243:6></a> The Lord said, "The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God".<a name=243:7></a> If Christ is not practically precious, do not let any one be content; but if He is precious to you, He is also the "chosen of God".<a name=243:8></a>

		I take up that thought in connection with access, but now we come to the "house".<a name=243:9></a> "To whom coming .<a name=243:10></a>.<a name=243:11></a>.<a name=243:12></a> ye also .<a name=243:13></a>.<a name=243:14></a>.<a name=243:15></a> are built up a spiritual house".<a name=243:16></a> We are built up a spiritual house, that is, we are of the household of God, and at the same time God dwells in us here -- we are "builded together for an habitation of God by the Spirit"; we are builded together thus that God may dwell here.<a name=243:17></a> We get these two thoughts realised in the saints.<a name=243:18></a> Now it is an immense point to recognise the mind of God in regard to His saints.<a name=243:19></a> God cares for His household; it is a privilege for a servant to minister a morsel of meat to God's household in due season; His household comes under His care and discipline.<a name=243:20></a> God takes care to provide spiritual food for the household.<a name=243:21></a> The servant of the Lord is to be occupied, when the Lord comes, with ministering to His household in due season.<a name=243:22></a> It is a great point to recognise that the saints are built up a spiritual house so that God may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are built up "a spiritual house" -- not a material house -- "an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=244:8></a> We can thus praise God and do good to men, since we are a holy priesthood to "offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=244:9></a> I think people sometimes regard sacrifices as being out of their reach, but they are really very simple.<a name=244:10></a> You get in the last chapter of Hebrews the sacrifice of praise to God.<a name=244:11></a> The very thought of being a holy priesthood is really a basis of practical life down here.<a name=244:12></a> James says, "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to

		I think you will admit that we get, in this chapter of Peter, thoughts which are very much akin to those in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, that is, the thought of access, because the Living Stone is chosen of God and precious to us; and then that we are God's household and God is dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=245:3></a> If we recognise that God is dwelling here by the Spirit we order our conduct before God, and not with reference to men.<a name=245:4></a> The point is, to be acceptable with God and so to be approved to men.<a name=245:5></a> The fact of God dwelling here by the Spirit is, so to speak, the first principle of Christian ways and conduct in the world.<a name=245:6></a>

		Now we get the same thoughts in the first Epistle of John.<a name=245:7></a> In <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:21">1 John  3:21</a>, 22, we have access.<a name=245:8></a> In <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:11">1 John  4:11</a> - 14 we get the thought of God dwelling.<a name=245:9></a> Verses 12 and 13 appear on the surface contradictory; the first says, "If we love one another", as though God dwelling were dependent upon our loving one another; and the next verse says, "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, <i>because he hath given us of his Spirit</i>".<a name=245:10></a> It is true that God has "given to us of his Spirit", but then it is equally true that it is "if we love one another" God dwells in us.<a name=245:11></a> Had there not been those who loved one another, the Spirit would never have been given.<a name=245:12></a> There were those who loved one another on the day of Pentecost, the condition was fulfilled, and the Comforter came.<a name=245:13></a> And if we are not loving one another, we shall not realise very much that God "dwells in us".<a name=245:14></a> If we love, God abides in us -- and His love is "perfected in us".<a name=245:15></a> If you want any sense of the reality of God abiding here, you must have love one for another.<a name=245:16></a> The realisation of the presence of God depends very much upon two considerations: one is, our separation from the world, that is, being in

	<div class="paragraph">
		We want to be in the reality of salvation -- disentangled from the power of evil, from evil associations, and even from attachment to a place down here, in order that the mind and will of God may be realised in us; we are in the place of nearness, and have confidence in God (so affected by the love of God that we have confidence in Him); we are under the care of God, nourished and furnished by the love of God; and at the same time (which is perhaps the greatest thing of all) we realise that God is abiding here.<a name=246:4></a> Now that is a very wonderful consideration to my mind.<a name=246:5></a> It may be in a very feeble measure that we love one another, but we cannot help loving.<a name=246:6></a> You may be confident that the saints will love those who are of God; if I love "Him that begat", I love those who are "begotten of him"; and if it is true that there are those who love God, it is most surely true that there are those who love one another.<a name=246:7></a> And that is what we are here for, that the mind of God might be realised in us, that we might be brought into salvation, so that God's mind might have expression in us down here.<a name=246:8></a>

		I suppose the thought and desire which comes out in this chapter is that the saints here might be qualified to be a witness for God: that appears to be the purport of the prayer.<a name=247:1></a> It is plain that the prayer has reference to the spiritual state of the saints; the apostle prays at the beginning that they might be "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man", and the end of it is that they might be filled unto all the fulness of God.<a name=247:2></a> The secret of this is in having the Christ "dwelling in your hearts by faith".<a name=247:3></a> It is the tendency of every one of us to witness of what is dwelling in our hearts; and if Christ is dwelling intelligently in the heart, then we are witnesses of Christ.<a name=247:4></a> I think the prayer refers to the apprehension of Christ, not exactly to what Christ has been, but more to what Christ is going to be, and therefore it is "by faith".<a name=247:5></a> It is not so much Christ as a Saviour in relation to us, but more in the light of the Bridegroom, so it takes in all that which belongs to Christ.<a name=247:6></a> I say that much in reference to the object of the prayer.<a name=247:7></a> The prayer is one that has been thought over many and many a time, and yet it is very little apprehension that one has got of the greatness of it.<a name=247:8></a> It shows the great privilege properly attaching to the church, that it should be a witness here to what Christ is according to God, that is, on the part of God, for the accomplishment of His will.<a name=247:9></a>

		Now you will get into the truth of that in apprehending the Son as the Object of the Father's love.<a name=252:6></a> It is a great thing to apprehend the Father's love to us; but it is a greater thing morally to apprehend that "the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand".<a name=252:7></a> It is a wonderful thought that the Son is our Saviour and our Head and our life; but the Son is the Object of the Father's love, and has had all things given into His hand.<a name=252:8></a> What we need to be led into is the power of the grace of God.<a name=252:9></a> We want courage to leave the world, and, according to the admonition in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, to "draw near", and apprehend the One in whom God can give effect to all His purposes.<a name=252:10></a> All that is dependent upon the fact of God dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=252:11></a> We are brought into the house of God that all these things might be available to us.<a name=252:12></a> And Christ as the Minister of the holy places is to lead us in; and if you ask me where you are to be led into, I do not know where, except into the knowledge of God; but you could not enter into the knowledge of God, if God had not come out.<a name=252:13></a> In one sense God could and did come out in a moment but it takes us a long time to enter in, we are so much hindered by things here.<a name=252:14></a> We enter in when we are prepared to enter in, as we are formed in the divine nature, so that we are <i>capable</i> of

	<div class="paragraph">

		The thought before me s to touch on two things equally important.<a name=258:1></a> One is the situation, as I must call it; and nothing can be more important at the present time, particularly to those who take any part in the work of God down here, than to see the situation.<a name=258:2></a> We want to be men of understanding; we are not worth much without understanding.<a name=258:3></a> Scripture puts great stress upon understanding -- I mean understanding of the times, in other words, of the situation.<a name=258:4></a>

		Everybody will allow that the situation is formed by God, whatever the situation may be.<a name=258:5></a> It would have no foundation if it were not formed by God.<a name=258:6></a> The first point therefore is to apprehend the situation which God has formed.<a name=258:7></a> I do not think we can much benefit others or take part in God's testimony if, as a first principle, we do not understand the situation.<a name=258:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want this morning, if the Lord help me, to unfold the situation on the one hand, and on the other, to speak of the way in which God effects His purpose.<a name=258:11></a> God always effects His purpose through a moral process in man.<a name=258:12></a> God always has effected His purpose in that way, and ever will, whether with regard to the church, or to Israel, or to the nations.<a name=258:13></a>

		I go back to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>.<a name=259:3></a> There you get a situation not formed by God, and it was a very terrible one.<a name=259:4></a> Man was alienated from God, and God took account of the alienation.<a name=259:5></a> I use the word alienation in contrast to reconciliation: I find Scripture uses it in that way.<a name=259:6></a> Well, there you get alienation.<a name=259:7></a> Men came to the plain of Shinar.<a name=259:8></a> This is in Scripture the great seat of idolatry.<a name=259:9></a> You find this in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#5">Zechariah  5</a>-- the woman sitting in the midst of the ephah was borne to the land of Shinar, to build a house there, and there to be established and set upon her base.<a name=259:10></a> The land of Shinar is the base of idolatry.<a name=259:11></a> There they prepared to make a city and a tower that should reach up to heaven.<a name=259:12></a> The practical result was complete alienation from God.<a name=259:13></a> If I may use such an expression, God's mind was alienated from man on account of man's state.<a name=259:14></a> There is, I think, that view of it.<a name=259:15></a> Men were allowed in a sense to go their own ways, and in result were alienated from one another.<a name=259:16></a> That was the moment from which nations sprang.<a name=259:17></a> There was confusion of language, and that was the proof and evidence that God's mind was turned away from man.<a name=259:18></a> There cannot be a doubt that that is the point where alienation is really marked.<a name=259:19></a>

		Then another situation comes in.<a name=260:5></a> The final test to the Jews returned from captivity was Christ.<a name=260:6></a> He came into the midst of God's people as the seed of Abraham and of David, the sign of God's covenant; and Israel stood or fell by Christ.<a name=260:7></a> God in a way overlooked all that had happened -- and this was the final test, and Israel did not answer to it.<a name=260:8></a> Then we get the casting off of Israel consequent upon the rejection of Christ.<a name=260:9></a> Then that introduces another and new situation, a remarkable situation, that is the reconciliation of the world, not God introducing a world as with Israel, but the reconciliation of the world.<a name=260:10></a> Israel became lost among the nations, but there was the reconciliation of the nations consequent upon the casting off of Israel.<a name=260:11></a> Provisionally the nations come under the influence of the goodness of God.<a name=260:12></a> That was a remarkable situation for God to create.<a name=260:13></a>

		I do not go into that; but I want to speak for a moment on the importance of the present situation, the reconciliation of the world, and the position of Christ in regard of men.<a name=261:13></a> I cannot conceive anything more important than the consequence of that in the way men come under the regard of God.<a name=261:14></a> The point especially with those of us who attempt in any way to preach is to open eyes; we want men to see the situation, the position that Christ occupies in regard of man.<a name=261:15></a> He is the "one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom for all".<a name=261:16></a> That is the truth on one side, in virtue of which the world has come into reconciliation.<a name=261:17></a> All the world has come by Christ into God's view, and is being tested as to whether it will continue in the goodness of God.<a name=261:18></a> If the Gentiles do not continue in God's goodness, they will be cut off.<a name=261:19></a> But in a certain way they have come into the tree of promise, the line of Abraham.<a name=261:20></a>

		If you could unfold to men the light that has come unto them on the part of God -- the advent of Christ from heaven, His becoming a man (God having thus good pleasure in men) to accomplish redemption, the discharging of man's liabilities that he should not be under judgment -- what would be the effect?<a name=263:1></a> People would be made conscious that they have been in darkness and lawless.<a name=263:2></a> That is always the proper effect of the preaching of the gospel, the presentation of the situation, and the consequence is that they turn from Satan to God.<a name=263:3></a> The practical result is that they repent.<a name=263:4></a> It is there that every one has to begin.<a name=263:5></a> We must all begin with repentance.<a name=263:6></a>

		I would not venture to say anything at all, after what has been before us, did I not in some sense feel conscious of having a word from the Lord.<a name=268:1></a> And what I first wish to press upon each one is our individual responsibility in regard to the maintenance of the truth.<a name=268:2></a> It is very easy to put the responsibility of maintaining the truth on those who minister the truth.<a name=268:3></a> It is certainly not given to every one to minister the truth.<a name=268:4></a> Ministry is in the power of gifts from Christ, and He claims to be sovereign in that matter; and it is a privilege to minister in the truth.<a name=268:5></a> But I say without any hesitation that it is the responsibility of every one of us to maintain the truth.<a name=268:6></a> We do not maintain the truth merely by clinging tenaciously to the terms of the truth, but by being ourselves the exponents of the truth.<a name=268:7></a> You may think what I say is hard, but I judge that we ought <i>to be prepared</i> to surrender everything -- whatever we have in this life, the dearest ties and associations, whatever honour or glory or position we may have -- in order to be exponents of the truth which the Lord has given us to maintain.<a name=268:8></a> It is very easy to justify having things agreeable here -- and God may allow us to enjoy many things here -- but they may readily be too prominent with us, and when they are the truth has a second place; and which, I ask, should have the first place -- the things of this life, or the truth?<a name=268:9></a> Every right-minded person would allow that the truth is to be the first thing, and we are at all costs to maintain it; and the divine way to maintain it is by ourselves being the expression of

		I only say that by way of preface, for what I want to come to is this -- we have heard of what the Lord has been pleased to give back to us in these last days -- the truth that Christ, the glorified Man, is the Head in heaven, and that His body is here.<a name=269:10></a> There are thousands of Christians who would allow the body in glory.<a name=269:11></a> What I saw long since was that the practical difficulty with saints lay in inability to realise the truth that the body was <i>here</i> in completeness.<a name=269:12></a> I imagine that it is accepted by every one here today that the body is here, and that Christ is Head to the body.<a name=269:13></a> That is the prominent truth, as I should understand, which the Lord has given back to us in this century, and in which we have to stand.<a name=269:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to say another word in regard to our responsibility to maintain the truth.<a name=270:3></a> There are two things here to which we have to return; two things which marked saints at the beginning.<a name=270:4></a> Where there has been departure you are bound to go back to first principles, and you have to go to the outset to find them.<a name=270:5></a> If the Spirit of God has opened your eyes in any measure to the true state of things, that is what you have to do.<a name=270:6></a> Now the two things to which I refer are great safeguards; and you must keep within them if you want to be in the truth, and in liberty from what is about.<a name=270:7></a> They are the reproach of Christ and the power of the Spirit.<a name=270:8></a> If I may speak of them as principles (though they are not exactly principles, for the Spirit of God is not a principle), these are what you must hold to, if you want to be maintained in liberty from all that is about us -- that is, from Babylon.<a name=270:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show the working of these principles at the beginning and now.<a name=270:10></a> You must remember that at the time Christ came the people of God were under the power of Babylon.<a name=270:11></a> Of course, it was the Roman power at the moment, but it was the continuation of Babylon; it was the lower part of the same great image.<a name=270:12></a> That is where the people of God were at the moment -- captive to Babylon; they had been under captivity <i>in</i> Babylon, now they were not captive <i>in</i> Babylon, but <i>to it</i>.<a name=270:13></a> The course of things is prophetically told by the prophet Isaiah.<a name=270:14></a> God brought a remnant of the people back into the land under Gentile protection, in order that Christ might be presented to them.<a name=270:15></a> That was the external state of things, and Christ was presented to the responsibility of the people; but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point is this: the Babylonish power was not set aside.<a name=271:6></a> Christ was crucified at the hand of that power.<a name=271:7></a> The Gentile was guilty in this.<a name=271:8></a> The Jew cast Him out of the vineyard, and put Him into the hand of the Roman power; and that power was immediately responsible for crucifying the Lord of glory.<a name=271:9></a> The apostle holds that the princes of this world crucified the Lord of glory.<a name=271:10></a> God did not come in at the moment to destroy the Romish power; on the contrary, He allowed it to remain and to completely set aside the Jewish polity and ecclesiastical order.<a name=271:11></a> The whole thing was broken up, Jerusalem became a heap of stones, and it was done by the hand of the beast -- the Roman power; and the ecclesiastical order -- the camp -- was completely set aside.<a name=271:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I would ask, how were the saints -- the remnant of that day -- who did not surrender the truth (for the mass had turned apostate), how were they to escape from the Babylonish power?<a name=271:13></a> For Rome was not publicly judged at that time; on the contrary, it got more complete power.<a name=271:14></a> I will tell you how they were set free from it.<a name=271:15></a> It was by the acceptance of the two principles to which I have referred, the reproach of Christ and the power of the Spirit.<a name=271:16></a> It was thus that Christians were saved in that day from the Babylonish power.<a name=271:17></a> In accepting the reproach of Christ they were delivered from ecclesiastical form and order, from dependence on the camp, as we read in the last

		What we find in this chapter (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5">Joshua  5</a>) connects itself very intimately with what I have sought to put before you; and I may remark first that what we come to here is typical of <i>assembly</i> privilege and blessing, that is, of what is not individual but collective.<a name=274:5></a> Where it is a question of the wilderness everything is individual.<a name=274:6></a> The wilderness regards the saints as individuals; we enter into that path in which we prove God individually.<a name=274:7></a> My exercises in the wilderness are not the exercises of another, and the exercises of another saint are not my exercises.<a name=274:8></a> The experience of God which I gain in the wilderness is my own, and the experience which another gains is not mine.<a name=274:9></a> As has often been said, the wilderness formed no part of the purpose of God, but of His ways.<a name=274:10></a> It is where we learn His ways, where we learn practically what God is to us; and there it is that the manna is the food of our souls.<a name=274:11></a> We are supported here by the grace of Christ.<a name=274:12></a> Manna is daily grace for daily need.<a name=274:13></a> It was Christ's path as a man here.<a name=274:14></a> The wilderness is where I learn what Christ was in His lonely pathway down here; the lowly grace of the heavenly Man, the perfect setting forth of what is according to God "in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is", as we get it in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, and again in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23">Psalm  23</a>.<a name=274:15></a>

		Now if you do not see the aspect in which the Son of God is presented here, you cannot understand the peculiar sin of Jezebel, nor can you rightly understand the promise to the overcomer in Thyatira.<a name=285:8></a> The sin of Jezebel has, I have no doubt, to do with what we find in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>; and the promise to the overcomer has relation to the sin of Jezebel.<a name=285:9></a> The whole hangs together; and if you fail to see the connection with the Son of God and that which is given to Him of the Father, you can hardly understand either the gravity of the sin or the import of the promise.<a name=285:10></a>

		It is important in a Christianised country like this to understand the character of Jezebel.<a name=285:11></a> I want you to apprehend what men have built up in this world, under the name of Christ, as it appears under the eye of God -- to see the character of it, and what its end is to be.<a name=285:12></a> You must not confound Thyatira and Jezebel.<a name=285:13></a> Thyatira is the church; but Jezebel is not exactly the church but, rather, a system which has been permitted to grow up in the church: "Thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will point out what the character of this system is.<a name=286:3></a> Jezebel calls herself a prophetess: the system pretends to speak authoritatively from God, that is its avowed character.<a name=286:4></a> Now the church was set up here on the foundation of the apostles and prophets (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:20">Ephesians  2:20</a>).<a name=286:5></a> There have been no apostles or prophets since; there could be none, because the church was built upon them.<a name=286:6></a> They completed the word of God, and there has been no subsequent communication from God in that sense; for when the foundation has been laid you do not want any further inspired communication from God.<a name=286:7></a> But here you find a system springing up in the church which avows to speak authoritatively from God, so that you have, as they say, to "hear the church".<a name=286:8></a> That is the most wicked part of the whole system, denying practically that the mind of God communicated in His word has been completed.<a name=286:9></a> The apostle Paul speaks of its having been given to him to complete the word of God (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>).<a name=286:10></a> And yet here is a system which avows to be prophetic, to speak authoritatively the mind of God.<a name=286:11></a> While she does that you have to look at her works: "To teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols".<a name=286:12></a> There was a system seducing the servants of Christ into unholy commerce with the world, into the acknowledging the god and prince of this world; that was the character of the great popish system.<a name=286:13></a> It is a teaching system which, while professing to speak authoritatively from God, has the moral effect of

		There are two Christian sacraments -- I use the word only for convenience for want of a better -- two Christian ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper.<a name=287:2></a> Now I will tell you what they set forth morally, and I do not think anybody can refuse what I say.<a name=287:3></a> Baptism speaks of dissociation from the world, and the Lord's supper of the fellowship of Christ's death.<a name=287:4></a> The second really embraces and confirms the first.<a name=287:5></a> Baptism is the act of another -- no one baptises himself: on the other hand, the Lord's supper is your own act, and in it you endorse what was set forth in your baptism.<a name=287:6></a> Apart from my own act I was a subject of baptism, which signifies dissociation from the world (as Ananias said to Saul: "Arise and be baptised, and wash away thy sins"; which really meant dissociation from all that he had been identified with before); but in the Lord's supper, by my own act, I am identified with the death of Christ.<a name=287:7></a> "In that he died, he died unto sin once"; and if you take the ground of association with Christ, you are "to reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>).<a name=287:8></a> It is most important to see the true character of the Christian ordinances and what they convey.<a name=287:9></a> They signify the moral dissociation of Christians from the present evil world.<a name=287:10></a> The children of Israel were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and were thus dissociated from all that with which they had been connected before; so we having been baptised unto Christ in the water of baptism, have been dissociated from all that in which we were before.<a name=287:11></a> We have been made also to partake of spiritual food and spiritual drink, that is, fellowship of the body and blood of Christ, which means in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if we look at the great popish, Babylonish system, what use have they made of the sacraments?<a name=288:2></a> They have used the sacraments for the support of priest-craft, for no one can administer the sacraments except the clergy.<a name=288:3></a> For the laity everything is made to depend upon the administration of the sacraments, and as the sacraments can be administered only by the clergy, you see at once the great importance that is given to the priestly order.<a name=288:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature in the system is that it is a great organisation in which man is glorified, not quite in his position in this world, but ecclesiastically.<a name=288:5></a> It is not Christ that is exalted in the system, but man.<a name=288:6></a> The head of the system is a great worldly dignitary.<a name=288:7></a> If you want to see its true character and description, you find this depicted in the latter part of the Book of Revelation.<a name=288:8></a> My only object in speaking of it now is to bring before you the character of the work that has been built up -- this great Babylonish system, in which the sacraments have been used to confer honour and authority upon men, and to make of the priesthood something entirely contrary to the mind of Christ.<a name=288:9></a> When He spoke of what would take place during His absence, of the evil servant who would say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming, and would begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken, I cannot doubt for a moment that the Lord had in view the wickedness of priest-craft.<a name=288:10></a> That is what has come to pass in perfection in the great system here called Jezebel.<a name=288:11></a> Her children, the children of the system, are killed with death -- I have no doubt moral death, that is, they become apostate.<a name=288:12></a>

		Before we come to the promise to the overcomer we have, "But unto you I say, to the rest" [or remnant], in Thyatira [there should be no 'and' here; it is the remnant only that is addressed], "as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden, but that which ye have already hold fast till I come".<a name=289:8></a> It is interesting to see here the recognition of a remnant that have not the doctrine of Jezebel, and the Lord puts no great burden upon them; what He looks for is that what they have they should hold fast till He comes.<a name=289:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first great object in salvation is to bring us under the sway of grace.<a name=290:12></a> Grace reigns now and it reigns through righteousness.<a name=290:13></a> Under the sway of grace you get the obligation to righteousness.<a name=290:14></a> When the kingdom is established in the future under the Lord Jesus Christ grace will reign for the blessing of man, and sin will be disallowed.<a name=290:15></a> Also the Psalm will be fulfilled which says, "There he commanded the blessing, even life for evermore (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>).<a name=290:16></a> We get the principle of this in Christianity, in that grace should reign through righteousness

	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing we have got thus far, that a soul has been brought under the sway of grace and has confessed Christ as Lord; what is the next step The next step is that the Lord directs the heart into the will of God, so that you may be here not for your own will, but for God's, and I think the Lord enforces that by means of discipline.<a name=291:3></a> It is a great thing to take account of the discipline of the Lord, for it is a very real thing.<a name=291:4></a> "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten".<a name=291:5></a> There is a beautiful instance of this in the last chapter of John's gospel.<a name=291:6></a> The Lord brought conviction to Peter of his sin, but besides bringing conviction to him He disciplined him; He told him what the manner of his death would be "Another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not".<a name=291:7></a> That was the Lord's discipline in regard to Peter, that Peter might be kept in the path of the Lord's will down here, and not in that of his own will.<a name=291:8></a> And I believe the object of the Lord's discipline in regard to every one of us is that we might be kept in the way of righteousness and might not wander away into the tortuous paths of self-will.<a name=291:9></a> This discipline is individual, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten", or "convict and discipline".<a name=291:10></a>

		It is very important to go back to the foundation, to see how far our hearts are really established in the kingdom, or rather how far it is established in us, so that we are under the sway of grace, of grace reigning through righteousness; how far we are found here zealous of good works.<a name=292:15></a> It is most important to be zealous of good works; but then be sure that they are good works, and do not let man be the judge of them, but Christ.<a name=292:16></a> Good works according to Christ are works of goodness and mercy and beneficence to man, but according to God, so that the light of God may be brought into men's hearts.<a name=292:17></a> You may do this in preaching, visiting, in a thousand ways, if you are really set upon the light of God penetrating and pervading the hearts of men.<a name=292:18></a> I think that is the idea of Christ's works in this passage.<a name=292:19></a>

		The Scriptures begin with the heavens and the earth, and end with the heavens and the earth.<a name=297:8></a> I just call your attention to a passage in Peter's second epistle (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:7">2 Peter  3:7</a>, 13), "We according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth".<a name=297:9></a> Then if you look on to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:1">Revelation  21:1</a> you read, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth".<a name=297:10></a> Revelation looks on to the accomplishment of that of which Peter speaks.<a name=297:11></a> You will notice that the scripture gives precedence to the heavens.<a name=297:12></a> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=297:13></a> I have no doubt that this is intentional.<a name=297:14></a> It is a principle which will he brought into effect in due time, that the heavens rule; and the heavens will rule morally,

	<div class="paragraph">
		You get heaven first coming into view in regard to Enoch.<a name=298:14></a> Death had come in by sin.<a name=298:15></a> Enoch was translated that he should not see death.<a name=298:16></a> The effect that faith had on him was this -- he prophesied, "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his

	<div class="paragraph">
		Further on we get Abraham, and heaven comes into view in connection with him.<a name=299:2></a> Two things mark him, "He looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God"; and he "sought a better, that is a heavenly, country".<a name=299:3></a> The fathers were not content with the land of promise; God showed it to them, but they sought a better, that is a heavenly, country.<a name=299:4></a> I suppose this means that they sought a country where God dwelt.<a name=299:5></a> Jesus said, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad".<a name=299:6></a> Therefore, "God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city".<a name=299:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on a little further, and in the book of Isaiah we are told that God creates new heavens and a new earth, and we get another thought; that heaven is God's throne; the earth is His footstool.<a name=299:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to these passages to show that heaven had a place in the thought of God and in the faith of men; but it was not prominent, and God was unfolding His ways in regard to the earth, which will have their issue in the kingdom in the future day.<a name=299:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the New Testament, and the first thing you find is that there is a stir in heaven, and from that point and forward heaven takes precedence, it gets its own proper place.<a name=299:10></a> In the Old Testament, while God was testing man, heaven could not get its proper place.<a name=299:11></a> Abraham's faith went beyond that testing; there is no testing of faith in heaven.<a name=299:12></a> I have no doubt the faith of other men went beyond that testing, still in the main the Old Testament is taken up with the testing.<a name=299:13></a> But the New Testament is different.<a name=299:14></a> It means the establishment by God of all that was in His mind, and

		from the outset the heavens are astir.<a name=300:1></a> The stir is first in connection with the birth of Christ.<a name=300:2></a> When Christ was born the heavenly hosts announced -- "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=300:3></a> I refer to this, because it shows heaven in motion in connection with the birth of Christ.<a name=300:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find it of interest to observe the way in which heaven comes into view in connection with the pathway of the Lord Jesus down here on earth.<a name=300:5></a> First the Lord is baptised in due time; the Holy Ghost comes down, and a voice from heaven says, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=300:6></a> The same thing occurs on the Mount of Transfiguration.<a name=300:7></a> Heaven comes into view in connection with Jesus, and there came a voice from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him".<a name=300:8></a> I think it is of great interest to see the movement in heaven in connection with the presence of Christ here.<a name=300:9></a> It is perfectly natural.<a name=300:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point before me is this: the heavens were getting their own proper precedence and it meant the superiority of all that was of heaven.<a name=300:11></a> It leads on in result to the rule of heaven.<a name=300:12></a> We see the "living bread" come down from heaven, not merely a voice from heaven, nor even the Holy Ghost from heaven, but "living bread" come down from heaven to give life to the world.<a name=300:13></a> Now you see the source of life.<a name=300:14></a> The life of the world is dependent on the living bread come down from heaven.<a name=300:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Just let me call your attention to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5:5">Revelation  5:5</a>, 6 for a moment.<a name=301:10></a> I want to point out two expressions brought into juxtaposition: the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Lamb as it had been slain.<a name=301:11></a> These expressions come out in connection with the kingdom.<a name=301:12></a> The form used for "Lamb" is a diminutive -- no doubt an expression of affection -- but it is curious that in the two verses you should get the lion and the lamb brought together.<a name=301:13></a> All this will come out in the kingdom.<a name=301:14></a> When the Lord rode into Jerusalem on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass, He came in meekness.<a name=301:15></a> Whoever heard of that in a king?<a name=301:16></a> In our modern notions of kings we admire condescension and that sort of thing; but in this King there is meekness.<a name=301:17></a> It is recorded of Moses that he was the meekest man on earth.<a name=301:18></a> The Lord had title, but with the greatest title He was meek.<a name=301:19></a> He said, "I am meek and lowly in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to another point.<a name=302:17></a> There must be the continuation of Christ here morally in His body.<a name=302:18></a> The church is the body of Christ; and if it is the body of Christ, it must set forth Christ.<a name=302:19></a> My body is the vessel in which I am set forth; but it is not impossible to distinguish myself from my body.<a name=302:20></a> What a man is gets no expression except through his body; and I take it that is what the church is to Christ, the vessel in which he is set forth.<a name=302:21></a> It is said of the body in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>that it is the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.<a name=302:22></a> Every lineament of Christ was set forth in the body down here.<a name=302:23></a> I look
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=303>[Page 303]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		upon the church in that sense as the continuation of Christ.<a name=303:1></a> There was thus a witness to the world, and that witness was to be maintained in unity.<a name=303:2></a> You get this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>"That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=303:3></a> The unity of saints was witness of the unity of the Father and the Son, the witness to the world that the Father sent the Son.<a name=303:4></a> This will come out in glory.<a name=303:5></a> The body of Christ served that purpose down here; but as Christ belonged to heaven, it is clear the body must go up to heaven.<a name=303:6></a> You could not separate Christ from His body.<a name=303:7></a> The body belongs to heaven, not to earth.<a name=303:8></a> What is set forth in the body was nothing short of Christ, properly speaking.<a name=303:9></a> The church left its first love, I know; but if Christ was caught up to heaven, the body of Christ must be caught up to heaven.<a name=303:10></a> The man-child in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>has been held to be a picture of Christ and the church.<a name=303:11></a> Heaven is the place and the expectation of the church.<a name=303:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is plain that the witness of the church has been completely obscured.<a name=303:13></a> It is vain in the present day to talk much about it.<a name=303:14></a> In a general way saints have lost all idea of the truth of the body of Christ: hence unity has been almost completely surrendered, and it cannot be doubted that the church has lost very largely its proper place of witness.<a name=303:15></a> It has left its first love and lost its true place on earth.<a name=303:16></a> It has taken a worldly place, and has come under the power of earthly influence, and has lost its own proper heavenly light and lustre.<a name=303:17></a> The body is here, I know, as the Spirit is here; but it is clear that the heavenly light and lustre have been obscured.<a name=303:18></a> The point is -- what remains for us?<a name=303:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I see a great principle in Scripture, pointed out years ago, that when failure has come to pass in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What have we to look for?<a name=304:5></a> I think, for the heavenly city.<a name=304:6></a> That led me to read the passage in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>.<a name=304:7></a> Things had gone very much to the bad in the apostle's days -- the mass were minding earthly things.<a name=304:8></a> Then it is that he says, "Our citizenship is in heaven".<a name=304:9></a> I think it is when things have gone into decay that the citizenship comes into view.<a name=304:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing becomes prominent, and that is eternal life.<a name=304:11></a> It was not so prominent a thought when the church was in its first estate, but comes more into view when things are in decay.<a name=304:12></a> It is seen in the later epistles, as was pointed out years ago, that the apostle Paul speaks of himself as apostle in connection with the hope of eternal life.<a name=304:13></a> The city and eternal life belong properly to the world to come; but they become prominent when the church has failed in its proper place as witness on earth.<a name=304:14></a> Then we are cast very much on the city and eternal life.<a name=304:15></a> "Grasp eternal life" the apostle says to Timothy.<a name=304:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what I want to refer to is the thought that "Our citizenship is in heaven".<a name=304:17></a> I do not think you can know much about this practically except as you know something about the heavenly city.<a name=304:18></a> The idea of a city in Scripture is that of a source and centre of light and rule and blessing.<a name=304:19></a> Jerusalem was that in some sort upon earth.<a name=304:20></a> You find many expressions of this in the Psalms.<a name=304:21></a> Jerusalem was compact, the joy of the earth, the gathering centre of the tribes, and so on.<a name=304:22></a> The divine idea, I do not doubt, was that the city of the great King was to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		a source of light and rule upon earth.<a name=305:1></a> If that was true of the earthly city, how much more of the heavenly city!<a name=305:2></a> We want to be well acquainted with the heavenly city.<a name=305:3></a> I should recommend every one to seek to become acquainted with the moral features and excellencies of the heavenly city.<a name=305:4></a> In the idea of rule upon earth in the present time there are many elements, for example, diplomacy, expediency, might; but you may be confident that no principle of that kind can have any place in the city of the living God.<a name=305:5></a> In the heavenly city all must be according to God and suitable to His nature; there can be nothing in the city that is contrary to any attribute of God.<a name=305:6></a> You may take that for granted.<a name=305:7></a> The walls are great and high; everything will be excluded that is not consistent with the holiness of God.<a name=305:8></a> It will bear being measured.<a name=305:9></a> All is according to the righteousness of God.<a name=305:10></a> All His rights are maintained there.<a name=305:11></a> The righteousness of God has its proper place there, and so I might go on.<a name=305:12></a> You get perfection of light in it.<a name=305:13></a> "Its light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal".<a name=305:14></a> The throne of God and the Lamb are there -- the moral sway of God and the Lamb are absolute and complete.<a name=305:15></a> The river of living water flows from it.<a name=305:16></a> It is a source of living water to the nations -- health giving influences issue from it.<a name=305:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I allude to these few features, for if you do not understand a little about the heavenly city you will not understand much about our citizenship being in heaven.<a name=305:18></a> All is according to God, and no attribute of God can find any contradiction in the heavenly city.<a name=305:19></a> You have to take that into account.<a name=305:20></a> And another thing is said, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother".<a name=305:21></a> There is liberty.<a name=305:22></a> And yet another thing is said, "From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall

	<div class="paragraph">
		change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself".<a name=306:1></a> It is a great thing to take into account the moral power connected with the Lord Jesus to subdue all things unto Himself.<a name=306:2></a> And it is in connection with the heavenly city that the heavens get their proper precedence.<a name=306:3></a> The earth ceases to have the place it had: heaven comes into prominence, and it will ever have precedence.<a name=306:4></a> Light and rule have their source in heaven.<a name=306:5></a> The earthly Jerusalem will never have quite the same place again, because the heavenly city comes in and the throne of God and of the Lamb are in it.<a name=306:6></a> The kings of the earth bring their glory and honour unto it.<a name=306:7></a> Nothing enters into it which defiles; all that is unworthy and contaminating is excluded by the very power and energy of life that marks all that is of God.<a name=306:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only just sought to bring these things under your notice, for it is interesting to see that though God for a time continued His ways on earth, yet heaven is to have precedence, and the time has come when heaven is in view.<a name=306:9></a> In the New Testament it comes very much to the front, and when you get the consummation of God's ways the heavenly city comes out to give light and bear rule on the earth.<a name=306:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to accept the fact that our being here is in a way a witness to it.<a name=306:11></a> All has failed in the church.<a name=306:12></a> Its light has become obscured by an immense mass of unholy profession, which bears the name of Christ upon earth.<a name=306:13></a> It is not much good going back upon the past; we want to have fully and continually in view the marks of that which will be prominent in the world to come, it is of great moment that we should understand that our citizenship is in heaven, and that we have only to await the coming of the Lord from heaven.<a name=306:14></a>

		The subject that I have before me for this evening, and for some subsequent occasions, is that of deliverance.<a name=308:1></a> The great importance of it to every one of us will be admitted, since we cannot be for God here except as delivered, and deliverance has come in to that end.<a name=308:2></a> God has taken in hand to set us free from all that to which we were in bondage in order that we might be for Himself; and I think that every right-minded person would admit that God is entitled, by the very nature of what He is, to have all for Himself.<a name=308:3></a> Such a thought as that is not naturally in the mind of man; but for all that I maintain that it is a right thought.<a name=308:4></a> "The Lord hath made all things for himself", we read in Scripture.<a name=308:5></a> God never created man for man's satisfaction, but for His own satisfaction.<a name=308:6></a> I think there was to be satisfaction for man; but his satisfaction was in his being for God's satisfaction -- all was very good in God's eye.<a name=308:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dare say some might think at first sight that this is a strange chapter to take up as a text on which to speak about deliverance; but really it is not so strange as it may appear, for there is in it a kind of bringing together of the truth of both Romans and Colossians.<a name=308:8></a> Deliverance, in the way in which I want to speak of it, is three-fold.<a name=308:9></a> Tonight, I take up the subject of deliverance from sin, the world, and the power of Satan; these are rightly put together in a line of a hymn, and are inseparably connected.<a name=308:10></a> That is one aspect of deliverance, and a very important one too.<a name=308:11></a> Another aspect of deliverance, which is distinct from the first, is from the law.<a name=308:12></a> And the third aspect is from

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think one may readily see that if you are delivered from sin and from the world, you are delivered from Satan's power; because, as far as I understand it, it is by sin and the system of the world that Satan can act upon us.<a name=309:4></a> He is "the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience"; and the power by which Satan holds men in bondage is sin and the world.<a name=309:5></a> The connection of the three is so intimate that it is difficult to draw a definite line between them, except in saying that they are three distinct things; for Satan existed as a being before sin, and sin existed before the world, so that evidently the three things are in themselves distinct.<a name=309:6></a>

		Now in regard to the passage I read (I commend it to your study when you have leisure), I would remark that though it starts from a very small beginning, it opens out into a very large circle.<a name=309:7></a> The beginning is in the last verse of chapter 2.<a name=309:8></a> "Born of God" is the beginning with every one of us; we are subjects of the work of God.<a name=309:9></a> "Every one that doeth righteousness is born of God", that is John's beginning.<a name=309:10></a> I may say in passing, that John does not, like Paul, take up the saints on the ground of their responsibility, for that is not exactly John's line, but on the line of the work of God in them; and the beginning of the work of God in the soul evidently is, that a man is born of God.<a name=309:11></a> Then if you run down chapter 3 the next thing is the calling; that gives our position.<a name=309:12></a> "What manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God".<a name=309:13></a> Then you pass on to another point, the nature which is suited to the calling.<a name=309:14></a> "He that doeth righteousness

		is righteous, even as he is righteous".<a name=310:1></a> And there is another element connected with it, but I cannot go fully into that point at present, and that is love; though righteousness and love do not stand on quite the same footing.<a name=310:2></a> But they are the two proper characteristics of the Christian, he is righteous as Christ is righteous, and he loves his brother.<a name=310:3></a> Then in the latter part of the chapter, in connection with this question of love, is opened out the Christian circle.<a name=310:4></a> "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren".<a name=310:5></a> It is that which made me say that in this chapter you touch on one side Romans and on the other Colossians.<a name=310:6></a> You are brought first to the great truth of a man of another order -- "He that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous", and then to the truth of the Christian circle; Romans gives the one and Colossians the other.<a name=310:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, of necessity two things are involved in the chapter, deliverance from sin and from the world.<a name=310:8></a> Deliverance from sin is really involved in doing righteousness.<a name=310:9></a> How do you know that a person is righteous as Christ is righteous?<a name=310:10></a> Because he practises righteousness; he has been delivered from the dominion of sin.<a name=310:11></a> Then again, in having passed out of death into life we have passed out of the system of the world, because the world is in death.<a name=310:12></a> John looks at things morally, and for him the world is death, and believers know that they have "passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren"; therefore practical deliverance from sin and from the world is involved in the chapter, and I want to show how it is effectuated in the believer.<a name=310:13></a> Possibly many here know it well enough, much better than myself; but to all of us, to the most advanced and to the youngest, this question of deliverance is a very important one indeed.<a name=310:14></a> I do not judge that it is effected simply

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		by the acceptance of doctrine.<a name=311:1></a> I think you can understand the expression, that you must get a certain amount of leverage in the soul in order to bring about practical deliverance from sin and from the world.<a name=311:2></a> To talk about the Christian practising righteousness unless as set free from sin is out of the question, you must have died to sin to live to God.<a name=311:3></a> And further, it is not true of anybody that he has passed out of death into life except as set free from the world -- "He that hateth his brother abideth in death" -- that is the world morally.<a name=311:4></a> I will return to that point, but what I want to show you first is the leverage, that is, the power by which God effectuates deliverance in the soul of the Christian.<a name=311:5></a> If I were to put the question, "How is deliverance effected for the Christian from sin and from the world?<a name=311:6></a>" the natural answer would be, "By death".<a name=311:7></a> I admit it; it is effectuated in that way.<a name=311:8></a> But then the Christian has to die to it, and how is he to be brought to that?<a name=311:9></a> I dare say some would answer, "We have died to it in the death of Christ".<a name=311:10></a> That will not do.<a name=311:11></a> I say the death of Christ is your title to die to it, to die to one as to the other.<a name=311:12></a> "Our old man has been crucified with him" -- that is your title to die to sin; and the world is crucified to the believer in the cross of Christ -- that is your title to die to the world.<a name=311:13></a> I quite admit the title of the Christian to die by the death of Christ both to sin and to the world; but my present point is what it is that gives power in the soul to die to sin and to the world.<a name=311:14></a> I believe Scripture makes it very plain; if a Christian is going to travel that path, and to enter into the thought of God about him, he must be attracted by the grace of God and by what God presents.<a name=311:15></a> I do not approve of asceticism, people may make an effort in such ways to cut off the connection, but I believe it is all totally false; I do not think they know what they are doing.<a name=311:16></a>

		I repeat what I said at the beginning, that God, by the very nature of what He is, is entitled to have everything for His own satisfaction; that God created everything, man and everything else, for Himself.<a name=312:1></a> If you do not accept that you cannot know what sin is.<a name=312:2></a> The point of departure was when man listened to the temptation to act for himself; sin came in, and man stepped outside the circle of divine satisfaction.<a name=312:3></a> The evidence of sin was this, that self became an object to man, he was to be governed by his own will, that is sin; you get a definition of it in this chapter, "sin is lawlessness".<a name=312:4></a> Man's thoughts centred round self, and self became the great controlling principle with him.<a name=312:5></a> It has been said, and I do not think the expression is too strong, that man set himself as a rival to God; for what God is entitled to, man claimed on his own account, and the world was all built up on that.<a name=312:6></a> Satan greatly helped man to that end, for he is the god and prince of this world; and it is by the system of the world that Satan keeps man in bondage.<a name=312:7></a> That is the working and connection of things.<a name=312:8></a> When the Lord came into the world, and was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, Satan in one of the temptations takes Him up apart into a high mountain and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, saying, "All this power will I give unto thee, and the glory of them, for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it", and if you will but acknowledge me as the prince and god of this world, "all shall be thine".<a name=312:9></a> The Lord met it in the perfection of truth, in the power of the word of God, "It is written, Thou shalt worship Jehovah thy God, and him only shalt thou serve", and He rebuked him too.<a name=312:10></a> I only refer to that in order to make plain the connection between these three things, sin, the world, and Satan.<a name=312:11></a>

		This is the one chapter in Scripture in which we get a definition of sin; "Sin", we are told, "is lawlessness", the two things are precisely equivalent, that is, lawlessness is sin and sin is lawlessness.<a name=313:1></a> The principle of sin is in the indisposition of man to be under restraint of God.<a name=313:2></a> That was the effect of man listening to the enemy, he became as God.<a name=313:3></a> You remember what the temptation was -- "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil"; man became an object to himself, and in becoming an object to himself set himself as a rival to God.<a name=313:4></a> When the man of sin is revealed, he shows himself that he is God, and claims to be worshipped as God -- man has gained his end, he is bolstered up by Satan, and thus it is that you get the climax and full expression of sin in "the man of sin", "the son of perdition".<a name=313:5></a> It does not appear to me as if Satan came to the front; he has taken the place of god and prince of this world, but his way is to act through man.<a name=313:6></a> You find in the Revelation a trinity of evil; there is the first beast, which I suppose represents the great Imperial system; and the second beast, that is the personal Antichrist, the man of sin; and finally there is Satan, who has then been cast out of the heavens, and who gives his power and authority to the beast -- he is the ruling spirit.<a name=313:7></a> And Satan exercises great power in regard to man now, through the system of this world; for this world has been built up in sin, and man has turned everything to account for his own satisfaction, to his own ends, to please himself, and through this great system Satan works on man and holds him in bondage.<a name=313:8></a> I do not go further into it, but only allude to it in order to show the intimate connection between sin, the world, and Satan.<a name=313:9></a>

		world, I am practically under the power of Satan, the enemy of God; and more than that, sin and the world are so totally opposed in nature and principle to God that I could not possibly be for God if I were not free from their power.<a name=314:1></a> Christ died for our sins, "that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father".<a name=314:2></a> It is a great thing to understand where the secret of deliverance lies, how you are practically set free from sin and the world in such a way as that you can live to God.<a name=314:3></a> It is a blessed thing to live to God as dead to sin.<a name=314:4></a> We read of Christ, "In that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=314:5></a> He died to sin to live to God.<a name=314:6></a> As to His own personal path, of course that was ever to God; but He died to sin once and lives to God, that we too might die to sin and live to God.<a name=314:7></a> It is a great thing for all of us to reach that point; for God is entitled to have everything for His own satisfaction, and to live to God, as I understand it, is to live for His satisfaction.<a name=314:8></a>

		There are two things in Scripture to which the Christian is said to die, sin and the world.<a name=314:9></a> In regard to law you are become dead to it; God has released you from one bond, and formed another.<a name=314:10></a> Then in regard to the flesh, "you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you"; that is the change that takes place in the Christian, he is no longer in the flesh, but in the Spirit.<a name=314:11></a> You are never said to die to the flesh, that I know of, but by the Spirit you "mortify the deeds of the body".<a name=314:12></a> But you can very well understand that in each case deliverance stands on a different basis.<a name=314:13></a> The law is compared to a husband; and you could not be free from law if God had not dissolved the bond.<a name=314:14></a> On the other hand, you could not be in the Spirit, if you had not received the Spirit of God.<a name=314:15></a> But in regard to sin and the world,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I lay this down as an undoubted principle, that the title of a Christian to die is in the death of Christ; it is not that I have died in the death of Christ, but the death of Christ is my title to die.<a name=315:2></a> I could not think of dying to sin if our old man had not been crucified with Christ.<a name=315:3></a> That is my title to die to sin.<a name=315:4></a> What I understand by it is, that all that comes under the idea of our old man, what a man is as in the flesh, God has dealt with judicially in the death of Christ for Himself and for me too.<a name=315:5></a> If it were not so, you could not die; if our old man had not been crucified in the cross of Christ, you would be on the footing of responsibility as to the old man; but our old man has been dealt with in the cross of Christ, that we might not be on that footing, but that we might be privileged to die with Christ.<a name=315:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in regard to the world, the same truth applies.<a name=315:7></a> The apostle says, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world" that is, that for the Christian the world has come to an end in the cross, as Christ Himself said as to it, "Now is the judgment of this world".<a name=315:8></a> Our title to die to sin and to the world lies in the cross of Christ, and were it not for that we should still be alive in the responsibility of the old man.<a name=315:9></a> That is the first thing we have to learn, for we have to apprehend the truth of God in divine order.<a name=315:10></a> First we have to learn the great work that Christ has done, the foundation of righteousness, and the grace in which God presents Himself to us; and until that lesson is learnt the soul cannot learn any other.<a name=315:11></a> Peace, and favour, the hope of glory, and reconciliation, all express the grace in which God presents Himself to us, for "Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=315:12></a> If you are not established in the grace of the gospel,

		it is futile to attempt any other lesson; but the instant the soul is established in the sense of what God is toward it in grace, then the question is raised, what am I going to be for God?<a name=316:1></a> And it is a very simple answer -- I am to live to God.<a name=316:2></a> And how are you going to live to God?<a name=316:3></a> Not on the old footing, that is perfectly certain, because there is no such thing as man living to God on the footing of a man upon earth now that Christ is gone.<a name=316:4></a> Christ has been rejected; His life is taken from the earth, and therefore it is totally impossible to live to God on the footing of a man upon earth.<a name=316:5></a> On what footing, then, are you going to live to God?<a name=316:6></a> I want to bring before you, in the answer to this, what really gives a person power to reckon himself dead indeed unto sin.<a name=316:7></a> It is in the apprehension of Christ as the second Man that the soul is drawn away from all that is connected with sin, and from all that in which sin is operative.<a name=316:8></a> That I believe to be the leverage by which a soul is enabled to die to sin, that is, to reckon itself dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=316:9></a> I would that I might be enabled in a few words to bring before you what God has brought to pass for Himself in the Lord Jesus Christ, as the second Man.<a name=316:10></a> God has secured this -- that man should be to His infinite and eternal satisfaction.<a name=316:11></a> I am looking at the Lord Jesus Christ now in a different aspect from what He is as making known to me the grace of God: He has done that, and I know nothing about the grace of God except what reaches me through the Lord Jesus Christ; but now I apprehend Him as the second Man, who has entered in to the eternal satisfaction of God.<a name=316:12></a> He is thus to us the tree of life; and it is in our apprehension of Him thus that we are enabled to reckon ourselves "dead indeed unto sin", for we have in view the thought of being alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=316:13></a> It is a wonderful privilege to join Him, to be

		of His company; but you first have to learn what He is as Man before you can have the thought of joining Him, and by that I mean that you account yourself alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=317:1></a> He is the second Man, who has been raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.<a name=317:2></a> There has been a Man here upon earth who has held everything for God; One who, in the presence of all the power of evil and everything adverse, has held, as I may say, the fortress completely alone, not another with Him, for the glory of God; One in whom the question of good and evil has been completely solved, who was divinely perfect in the knowledge of good and evil, and in whom was the perfect refusal of evil and the unvarying and consistent choosing of good.<a name=317:3></a> It is a great thing to apprehend that, in the midst of the terrible confusion of this world, the great question of good and evil has been completely solved in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=317:4></a> We have in Isaiah the expression, referring I suppose to Christ, "Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good".<a name=317:5></a> That was perfectly illustrated in Christ down here; but that is not all the truth, for He went down into death, to bear the judgment that rested upon man, for the glory of God, and He comes forth from the dead by the glory of the Father (though the glory of the Father was indeed there before He was raised -- God had been completely glorified).<a name=317:6></a> And all this has come to pass in a Man: the question of good and evil is solved, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is done with in that sense, for what came in by it has been answered: God has been glorified in the putting away of sin, and Christ as Man raised again from the dead by the glory of the Father, so that "in that he died, he died unto sin once; in that he liveth, he liveth unto God" -- all to the perfect satisfaction of the heart of God.<a name=317:7></a> And on that

		Then there is the other point, namely, death to the world.<a name=319:2></a> And I will tell you what I think emboldens a person to enter upon that ground -- it is, that it begins to dawn on the soul that there is a circle here upon earth, in which is expressed the character and ways of Christ, a circle outside of all the distinctions of flesh, a circle in which is so expressed the truth of Christ, that "we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren".<a name=319:3></a> It is not a circle of amiable, cultivated, or refined people, but one where are expressed, "bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; if any man have a complaint against any"; and the peace of Christ rules in the heart, and the word of Christ dwells there in all wisdom.<a name=319:4></a> It is the new man, where "Christ is all and in all".<a name=319:5></a> I dare say some might ask me, 'Where is that found?<a name=319:6></a>' I will tell you where it is found -- in Scripture.<a name=319:7></a> It is a great point to see that a thing is found in Scripture.<a name=319:8></a> People want to see it in fact; I say it is lamentable if you cannot see it in fact, but if I see a thing in Scripture that is enough, I will not have anything else, because that and that only is the right thing.<a name=319:9></a> I see such an idea in Scripture as a blessed circle where there is neither Jew nor Greek, circumcision nor uncircumcision, bond nor free, but where Christ is all and in all; and where instead of the communion of knowledge, or of education, or art, or science, or anything of that kind, what is expressed is the character and qualities of Christ, such as He was here.<a name=319:10></a> It is a heavenly circle, too; and that is what is really reached by a person that is dead and risen with Christ.<a name=319:11></a> I believe that

	<div class="paragraph">
		the apprehension that such a circle is revealed in Scripture, and the anxiety to reach it, encourages and strengthens a person to accept the place of death to the world, for if I am going to have part in that circle, all that binds me to the world must go.<a name=320:1></a> Society and the organisation the world presents to me, is no longer an attraction, because of what I have discovered in Scripture.<a name=320:2></a> I have learnt by experience that if you are attracted simply by the character of any particular company here upon earth, you will find that company will fail you, you will discover all kinds of flaws on closer acquaintance.<a name=320:3></a> But if you are attracted by what Scripture presents, if you get the scriptural ideal, the effect will be that you will be anxious to constitute one of such a company, and that the power of Scripture will be maintained in you.<a name=320:4></a> It is sometimes urged on us that we are set to reform the world; but if I have got to reform the world, the first I have got to look after is myself.<a name=320:5></a> As the apostle says to Timothy, "Take heed to thyself".<a name=320:6></a> But whether it be a question of death to sin or to the world, you cannot bring yourself to it by effort or self abnegation; you will come to it when you really feel the necessity of it.<a name=320:7></a> If I have got any apprehension at all of what Christ is, as Man living to God, then the necessity comes to me, if I am going to join Him, I must die to the man that is here.<a name=320:8></a> And then in regard to the world, if I get, by the grace of God, any idea of that circle of blessing to which Scripture refers -- "Passed out of death into life because we love the brethren", then I must part company with the organisation and rudiments of this world, because it is a sphere of things to which all that is of the world is perfectly foreign, and which nothing but the power of God can support.<a name=320:9></a> And it is in that way, by the light of these things breaking across the soul, that one is strengthened and encouraged; it finds a certain

		What I desire to dwell upon at this time, by the Lord's help, is the truth of deliverance from the law.<a name=322:1></a> Last time our subject was deliverance from sin and from the world.<a name=322:2></a> Deliverance from law is equally important; and I take up this passage as showing the way by which a Christian reaches this deliverance.<a name=322:3></a> For it is a point to be reached, as the apostle says, "I through the law have died to the law, that I might live unto God; I am crucified with Christ".<a name=322:4></a> It will entail going over a certain amount of ground; and in the course of it I shall hope to show you what was the intent of the law on the part of God.<a name=322:5></a> It is true that the law was the ministration of death and condemnation; but I hope you will see presently that such was not the divine end in the giving of the law.<a name=322:6></a> The law in the letter had that effect; but that was not the spirit of the law, and the point for the Christian is to see the spirit of the law: that is where we practically get deliverance from the letter.<a name=322:7></a> We find out that we are joined to the One who is the spirit of the law, that we should no longer serve in the oldness of the letter, but in newness of Spirit.<a name=322:8></a> That is the way in which deliverance is brought about, as we shall, I trust, see.<a name=322:9></a>

		I was noticing last week that there is an essential difference between sin and the world, and the law; for you could not speak of sin and the world in the sense in which law is spoken of as a husband in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=322:10></a> The idea of a husband involves a legal bond; and without the dissolution of the bond that exists you could not form a new bond.<a name=322:11></a> That is what is true in regard to the law; and where the law differs from sin and the world is in that the bond has been dissolved in order that a new bond might be formed.<a name=322:12></a> You are "become dead to the law by the

		body of Christ, that you should be married to another", that is, that a new bond might be formed on the part of the Christian.<a name=323:1></a> The meaning of it is, that so long as men were under the letter of the law they could not be joined to the One who is the spirit of the law; and therefore they must be freed from the first bond, the letter of the law, in order that they might be joined to the One who is the spirit of the law, and that is the way by which we "bring forth fruit unto God".<a name=323:2></a> That is what God has brought about.<a name=323:3></a> If the bond had not been dissolved you could not be free of the bond, and another bond could not be formed; for if you formed a second bond while the first existed, you would put yourself in the position of an adulteress -- that is the argument of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=323:4></a> This makes an essential difference between sin and the world, and law; the former are no bond, but they are elements in which man lives naturally, they belong to Egypt -- Egypt is the type of the world of sin, but the law is another matter.<a name=323:5></a> In fact, the children of Israel while they were in Egypt, though under bondage to the power of the world, had no law; it was in the wilderness they came to law.<a name=323:6></a>

		The first remark I make is this, that the way in which a Christian is righteous in the sight of God is the way by which he must live.<a name=323:7></a> You cannot be righteous on one principle and live on another, that will not do for God.<a name=323:8></a> If such a thing were possible as that a man could be righteous before God on the principle of law, then he must live on the principle of law.<a name=323:9></a> If, on the other hand, it is totally impossible for a person to be righteous before God by law, which is the principle of works, then I say he cannot live on the principle of works.<a name=323:10></a> But if it be true that the Christian is justified in Christ, then Christ becomes the principle of life to the Christian.<a name=323:11></a> The two things are bound to go together.<a name=323:12></a> The Galatians, like a great many Christians in the present day,

		sought to be justified in Christ but to live by law, it is impossible, the principle of your righteousness must be the principle on which you live.<a name=324:1></a> When God created man, the question of righteousness did not arise, because man was simply what God had made him, innocent.<a name=324:2></a> He had not the knowledge of good and evil, so that there was no question of righteousness.<a name=324:3></a> But the introduction of sin raised at once the question of righteousness -- it must be so, because righteousness is the necessary opposite of sin.<a name=324:4></a> Then comes the question, how is man going to be righteous?<a name=324:5></a> what is to be the principle of his righteousness?<a name=324:6></a> The first thing tried was the principle of works; God gave man law, but did not tell man what His thought and end in the law was, what was the spirit of the law; but He gave the law to man, and the principle of works was the principle on which under law righteousness depended.<a name=324:7></a> What follows is this, that if man could have been righteous on the principle of works, or of law, he would have lived on the principle of works.<a name=324:8></a> But the law came at a day too late for this, because man was already under the sentence of death, and law could not relieve him of that sentence.<a name=324:9></a> I think the contrast of law and grace is illustrated in the parable of the Good Samaritan.<a name=324:10></a> The man was half dead, the priest and the Levite, the representatives of the law, could not relieve him of the pressure, and therefore they passed by on the other side.<a name=324:11></a> The Good Samaritan came where the man was, and relieved him of the pressure under which he lay.<a name=324:12></a> And so Christ has come in to relieve man of the pressure of death which was upon him, by glorifying God in death, and as raised from the dead is now righteousness for the Christian.<a name=324:13></a> To put it in the words of the apostle in the epistle to the Romans, "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth".<a name=324:14></a> By end I understand to be meant the

		I want to say a little more in regard to justification, because I feel that our thoughts of justification are often too limited.<a name=325:2></a> Many a Christian who is clear enough as to forgiveness of offences does not see justification in its fulness as the Christian's relief from the judgment of God that lies now upon man.<a name=325:3></a> Many a Christian would say, I am justified from my sins, I am saved in that sense, and I shall never come into judgment.<a name=325:4></a> But then justification goes farther than that, because Christ is risen, and the thought of grace is to relieve man from the pressure of death that is on him; and justification is not complete unless a man is relieved from that pressure.<a name=325:5></a> I mean this, that for the Christian it is not only a question of faith in the blood, but faith in the One that is risen, as it says, Christ "was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification".<a name=325:6></a> And being the statement of Scripture, it is clear that nobody comes to justification in its completeness until he reaches by faith Christ risen.<a name=325:7></a> And it is an immense point to apprehend Christ risen, to see the truth that He "was raised again for our justification", that the Christian might be as free before God from the judgment of death as Christ is.<a name=325:8></a> The evidence that the Christian is justified not only from offences, but from the sentence of death which was upon him as the result of sin, is that his body becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, and he passes out of death into life.<a name=325:9></a> He is not yet raised, but he is justified in Christ; if he were raised he would be justified in that sense in himself; but he is not yet justified in his own person, but in Christ, and the proof and result of justification is, that the Holy Ghost is given, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us".<a name=325:10></a>

		You will bear with my dwelling upon this, because of the importance to every Christian to get a thorough ground-work in his soul in the knowledge of justification, and then to apprehend what is unfolded to us in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, namely, what the attitude of God is toward the believer consequent upon being justified.<a name=326:1></a> A very common illustration that has been used of the gospel, namely, that of a substitute, of one who suffers a penalty in the place of another in order that the latter may go free, does not seem to me to be right in principle or application, for in the gospel the first to go free is the substitute.<a name=326:2></a> Christ, who suffered for us, was the first to be raised from the dead, He "was raised again for our justification".<a name=326:3></a> No living soul of man was justified until Christ was raised from the dead.<a name=326:4></a> Then the believer is justified.<a name=326:5></a> And as I said before, he is not only justified from his offences, but he is justified from sentence of death that lay upon him, so that he can be raised up in the power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=326:6></a> I do not say his body is yet raised up, but the person is raised up, as we see in the case of the man at the pool of Bethesda, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>.<a name=326:7></a>

		Now I pass on to the question of deliverance from law.<a name=326:8></a> We saw last week that deliverance from sin and from the world is effectuated only as a glimpse is gained of another Man, the second Man, and of the Christian circle.<a name=326:9></a> A person is not content to take the place of death to sin except as the soul has the apprehension of another Man, of a Man that having been raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, now lives to God, as having died to sin.<a name=326:10></a> One is thus strengthened and encouraged to part company with sin, because he goes in faith to join the Man that is to the perfect satisfaction of God.<a name=326:11></a> His thought now is, I am entitled by grace to join that Man; and to join Him I must of necessity part company with the man that is here, and with the principle that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		dominates him, which is sin.<a name=327:1></a> For sin is looked at in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>as the dominating principle of the man that is here.<a name=327:2></a> And again, as to deliverance from the world, it is as I am attracted by the character of the Christian circle, the circle where Christ is all and in all, that I am led to accept the place of death to the world; I feel the incongruity of the two spheres.<a name=327:3></a> The Christian circle is where the affections and sensibilities of Christ are seen in exercise.<a name=327:4></a> The world I understand to be the sphere and scene in which the flesh lives.<a name=327:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This question of law is a very great hindrance to many of us, and I think it takes us a long time to get free of law.<a name=327:6></a> I will tell you how it works; people go to the Scriptures to find exhortations and rules; they want chapter and verse, as they say commonly, for their doctrine, and they want precepts for their conduct.<a name=327:7></a> That is all legality, it is the letter, and I think people are uncommonly fond of the letter; they go to Scripture in that sense to a large extent.<a name=327:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle says in the passage I read, "If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor", which means that if a person after seeking to be justified in Christ, and seeing that justification is alone in Christ, then goes back to law as a rule of life, that person builds again the things which once he destroyed, and he "makes himself a transgressor" his transgression is in having left the law, for if he goes back to it he condemns himself for having left it.<a name=327:9></a> The passage involves the truth of which I spoke a few moments ago, that the Christian has to live on the principle on which he is righteous; you cannot divorce the two things, righteousness and life; if Christ is the righteousness of the Christian before God, then Christ is the life of the Christian.<a name=327:10></a> Law cannot be, Christ must be, the life of the Christian.<a name=327:11></a>

		Now in looking at law for a moment as law, that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is, law in the letter, I must repeat that the letter did not express the end of God in the law; the mind of God in the law lay underneath, and those to whom the letter of the law was given never knew the mind of God in it; Moses "put a veil upon his face", we are told, and they were not allowed to see "the end of that which is annulled".<a name=328:1></a> The end does not mean, I judge, its termination, but the object and purport of God in it.<a name=328:2></a> The consequence was, that Israel took up all the law in detail, sacrifices and everything else; and as Peter expressed it, it was a burden which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear.<a name=328:3></a> The people that were under law never kept the law, it was too burdensome by far for man to keep.<a name=328:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I think, the first thing in regard to being free from law is, that one must learn in some way or other what is the effect of law, "the letter kills".<a name=328:5></a> A person has to be killed by law, has to die in that sense; the apostle does not say simply that he is dead to the law, but he says, "I <i>through law</i> have died to law, to live to God".<a name=328:6></a> I suppose it works in this way, that law brings home to a man the truth of his own utter powerlessness.<a name=328:7></a> That is the lesson to be learnt; I do not care how it is learnt, in all probability by law, but it has to be learnt.<a name=328:8></a> If I look abroad, there are very few men in the world who think themselves powerless.<a name=328:9></a> I have seen men of great determination and strong will, and have thought them strong.<a name=328:10></a> I do not think that now.<a name=328:11></a> I quite admit that there are people of a certain force of character, people who seem to carry things before them; but their strength of will and determination is not morally in opposition to the course and current of things here.<a name=328:12></a> And then again, I have a strong suspicion that men of great determination and will, who are running in the current of the world, are helped by a power that is greater than themselves.<a name=328:13></a>

		I am not sure to what extent men come under spiritual influence; but I have a strong impression that there is such a thing in the world as spiritual influence, not only for good but for evil, and that a man of will and determination may be carried on by spiritual influence stronger than himself.<a name=329:1></a> And as a matter of fact, I feel doubtful if there is such a thing really as free will with man, because where a man is dominated by the principle of sin, he is not free as to will.<a name=329:2></a> People talk about free will, but it is simply rubbish, because if a man is a slave to sin, which he is by nature, there is no question of free will, he is controlled by a principle which is beyond himself.<a name=329:3></a> For sin is not limited to man.<a name=329:4></a> The apostle John says, "the devil sins from the outset".<a name=329:5></a> Sin came into the world by man, but it did not originate with man.<a name=329:6></a> And if it is true that a man is by nature under the power of sin, then it is not a question of his will, but of sin that he is controlled by, a principle which he does not circumscribe.<a name=329:7></a> Again I say that there are spiritual influences at work, and so long as men are running in the current of sin and of the world, they are often carried by those influences a long way beyond what they intended to go.<a name=329:8></a> I think we should find plenty of instances of that.<a name=329:9></a> I believe it accounts for many dreadful things which take place in the world; dreadful ends very often had small beginnings.<a name=329:10></a> But people going in a certain current, have found that they were helped while they were going down the stream.<a name=329:11></a> Now, I believe the test of the power of will is when you attempt to go against the stream.<a name=329:12></a> Let a man be for God here, and then find what amount of power he has got.<a name=329:13></a> Let his mind recognise the rights of God, like a man waking up to the spirituality of the law, that he is to love God with all his heart and his neighbour as himself, let him begin to recognise the goodness of the law and the right and authority of God, and then

		see how much power he has got.<a name=330:1></a> Every one of us knows very well, as the apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, that "when the law came, sin revived and I died"; that is, when I saw and allowed that God had a will and right over me, I found I was totally powerless.<a name=330:2></a> And why?<a name=330:3></a> Because I wanted to go against the stream, against the current of sin, and then I found out that I had not an atom of power.<a name=330:4></a> That is the way in which the law worked, and in which it killed man, for the law killed a man in his own experience.<a name=330:5></a> The apostle says, "I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died".<a name=330:6></a> When he was alive was the time when he thought he had power to effectuate his will.<a name=330:7></a> And man thinks he has still.<a name=330:8></a> I believe it is a mistake, for when a man is thinking he effectuates his own will, he is under the power of sin; it is sin he is effectuating, not his own will.<a name=330:9></a> When a man sees what is right, as we find in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, "When I would do good", that is, when a man would recognise the rights of God, and would love God with all his heart, and his neighbour has himself, then he finds out he is totally powerless; that is, he is killed, he has no power at all in that which he knows to be right.<a name=330:10></a> And therefore it is a hopeless kind of thing for a man to be under law, because he cannot comply with the requirements of the law; it is impossible he could please God or be righteous before God on that ground.<a name=330:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But by the gospel he is brought to another great truth; he finds out that Christ is his righteousness.<a name=330:12></a> "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth": he is completely justified by Christ: "By this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins, and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses".<a name=330:13></a> What the law could not do, Christ has done for him; that is,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another point, and that is, he learns that Christ is the spirit of the law, and he is taught it by the Spirit of God.<a name=331:2></a> Being justified, he receives the Spirit of God, for a man receives the Spirit before he is set free from law; and then he finds out that there is another aspect in which the law can be regarded, that instead of looking at the requirements and the letter of the law, he can see that Christ is the spirit of the law, that God had quite a different end in the law from what appeared to man, and that the thought and intent of God in the law was not the detail, not the letter, but Christ.<a name=331:3></a> That is a wonderful moment, for then I look at Scripture in a totally different way.<a name=331:4></a> I am no longer looking at it for precepts and directions in detail as to conduct, but what I read in the law is Christ; I look at it objectively as furnishing instruction, as an expression of the mind of God as to what was to be effectuated in Christ.<a name=331:5></a> I begin to discern the spirit instead of the letter, and when a person is brought to that point it opens out entirely a new, prospect to him; Scripture becomes a totally different book; instead of its being a book of dogmas and commandments which I do not find myself able to fulfil, it is a blessed book of instruction, a book of deepest interest, as showing to me what was ever in the purpose and thought of God.<a name=331:6></a> It is then that we begin to see the glory of the Lord with unveiled face; we find the truth of Christ not only in the New Testament but in every page of the Old, not only in the prophets but in the law.<a name=331:7></a> I dare say you remember what the Lord did, as recorded in the last chapter of Luke's

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have had before us, on two former occasions, the subject of deliverance; and I can understand the question being asked, What is the great importance to the Christian of deliverance?<a name=337:1></a> I am not now speaking of conversion, and I do not want any one here to confound deliverance with conversion.<a name=337:2></a> The fact is, we are converted before we know much about deliverance.<a name=337:3></a> Deliverance is entered into by a Christian after he is converted, not before.<a name=337:4></a> I quite admit that there is a great change brought about in conversion as the effect of the light of God having entered the soul.<a name=337:5></a> It is totally impossible that the light of God should shine into a man's soul without producing a great effect, and that effect is conversion.<a name=337:6></a> But that is not the same thing as deliverance.<a name=337:7></a> It is when there has been the turning to God in conversion, that a person begins to prove the great reality of bondage and need of deliverance, and not, I think, until then.<a name=337:8></a> You may take it for granted that deliverance is not experienced until the need of it is realised.<a name=337:9></a> It is when the light of the gospel has really entered in and the Spirit of God has been received, that the need of deliverance is felt, and the way of it is found.<a name=337:10></a> But what is the end of deliverance?<a name=337:11></a> What is the gain of it?<a name=337:12></a> I will tell you; it is essential in order that you may enter into the thought and purpose of God concerning you.<a name=337:13></a> It is entirely out of the question that any one could enter into this apart from deliverance.<a name=337:14></a> If I were asked what my impression is as to the need which exists among Christians in the present day, I should say it is the need of deliverance.<a name=337:15></a>

		The subject of deliverance has been before us on previous occasions, as I may say, partially.<a name=338:1></a> First I spoke of deliverance from sin and the world, the two being very intimately connected.<a name=338:2></a> Last time we had another aspect of deliverance, and that was, from the law.<a name=338:3></a> Our subject now is one which goes to the bottom of the matter, and that is deliverance from the flesh.<a name=338:4></a> That is what I want to bring forward at this time, if the Lord enable me.<a name=338:5></a> Deliverance from the flesh is the point that is reached in the passage I read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>; and it is in order that the Christian may enter into life, for in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>you come to this, that you are passed out of death into life.<a name=338:6></a> As far as I understand the structure of the epistle, I do not think the Christian reaches life as regards himself until he comes to chapter 8.<a name=338:7></a> In chapter 6 I see life in Christ; but I do not see life spoken of as in the Christian until chapter 8.<a name=338:8></a> The question of life is and must be mixed up with the question of deliverance; and until deliverance is realised, I do not think any Christian knows or can know very much about life; for he has to pass "out of death into life".<a name=338:9></a> I refer to verse 13 of chapter 8, where the apostle says, "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live".<a name=338:10></a> That is the point where you come to life as to the believer, and then immediately consequent upon that, the Spirit of sonship is brought in.<a name=338:11></a> Now you get to the idea of correspondence to Christ.<a name=338:12></a> "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God".<a name=338:13></a> It is the first time you get any such thought in the epistle as that you are "sons of God".<a name=338:14></a> It adds, "ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father".<a name=338:15></a> You are come now to the answer in the believer to chapter 5.<a name=338:16></a> In chapter 5, "the love of God is shed

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=339>[Page 339]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us"; and now in chapter 8 we cry, "Abba, Father"; and the idea of crying, "Abba, Father" is, that you respond to the love that has been made known to you.<a name=339:1></a> Depend upon it there is a good deal passes between those two points, between the thought of God's love shed abroad in the heart and the time that the Christian really understands what it is to cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=339:2></a> Then it is that it says, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs of Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together".<a name=339:3></a> And that is the furthest point to which doctrinally the epistle brings the Christian -- the object of the epistle is gained, that is, the Christian is brought into the truth of life.<a name=339:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to say one word about life before I pass on.<a name=339:5></a> You cannot rightly talk about life apart from position; you must have a divinely ordered position in which to live.<a name=339:6></a> You get the position unfolded here, namely, that of sons or children of God, consequently you can now talk about life.<a name=339:7></a> It is curious that Paul constantly takes the opposite order to John.<a name=339:8></a> For instance, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, the position is first given, and then the life is brought in: the Lord says, Go tell my brethren, "I ascend to my Father, and to your Father", and afterwards He breathes on them and says, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost".<a name=339:9></a> Here in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>it is the opposite order, you are in the Spirit and the Spirit is life, and by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the body, and then you come to the truth of sonship.<a name=339:10></a> Life for the Christian really means correspondence to Christ, and until you have got to the point of correspondence to Christ you have not got the true idea of life.<a name=339:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come back to my present subject, the very important question of deliverance from the flesh.<a name=340:1></a> It will lead me to bring before you, first what is meant by the expression "flesh" in Scripture, and then what is the way of deliverance.<a name=340:2></a> This is found in principle in a single expression, "You are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you".<a name=340:3></a> Now, I think, that a believer receives the Spirit some considerable time, in a general way, before he learns that he is in the Spirit; for it is evident from chapter 5 that when we believe in God who raised up Christ from the dead, then the Spirit is given and the love of God is shed abroad by the Spirit in our hearts.<a name=340:4></a> But the believer may not have come to the sense that he is "in the Spirit"; though it be true of him as having received the Spirit.<a name=340:5></a> Let me go back a little over the epistle, because the point is so important.<a name=340:6></a> You get conversion fully at the close of chapter 4, when there is the apprehension that Christ "was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification"; that is, the believer is not only cleared as to the question of offences, but as to the question of death, and it is when he comes to that point that he learns the attitude in which God is toward believers, through our Lord Jesus Christ; that is, by the apprehension of what prevails in the Lord Jesus Christ, the last Adam, the believer learns what the attitude of God is toward him.<a name=340:7></a> And not only that, but the Holy Ghost is given to him; that is, he stands in the presence of the grace of God, and in the light as God is in the light; God is fully revealed to him, and he knows the grace of God, which is established through the Lord Jesus Christ, the last Adam.<a name=340:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now remember, that so far it is the grace of God toward the believer; and you are entitled to that from the very beginning, and the learning of what

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=341>[Page 341]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you are for God will not improve that.<a name=341:1></a> I quite admit it may enable you to enjoy it more; but no amount of apprehension of what you are for God will ever improve what God is towards you, because that is established and assured eternally in the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore it cannot alter.<a name=341:2></a> It is not a question of what the grace of God is toward each individual believer, but of what is established in the last Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ; and that describes what the grace of God is toward the believer and toward every believer.<a name=341:3></a> Therefore you never can improve upon the grace of God.<a name=341:4></a> And then, as I said before, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given to us; but in that the Holy Ghost is not acting on our side but on God's side, shedding abroad God's love; He is not making us love God, but He is teaching the love of God towards us; it is God's love, not ours.<a name=341:5></a> I am loth to leave the point, because I feel we cannot really enter very much into the great question of what we are before God if we are not well established in the truth of what God is towards us, for that is where the grace of God is known.<a name=341:6></a> And the measure and description of what God is towards us is what is established in the last Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ; that as we got sin and death by the first Adam, so we get the grace of God, divine favour and everything else by the last Adam.<a name=341:7></a> "As through one offence towards all men to condemnation, so through one righteousness towards all men unto justification of life"; and it goes on to say, that "as sin has reigned by death, so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=341:8></a> It is all established in the Lord Jesus Christ, the last Adam, the Head of all; and the Head describes the attitude in which God is toward all.<a name=341:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes the great question of what we are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=342>[Page 342]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for God.<a name=342:1></a> And that brings in a most important truth, the truth of another Man.<a name=342:2></a> If I might use the expression, speaking reverently, God has changed the man.<a name=342:3></a> The practical difficulty for us is to change the man; and we could not do this if we did not first understand how God has changed the man.<a name=342:4></a> For four thousand years God was dealing with one man; but now God's ways are all displayed in another Man, and that is the great truth that chapter 6 brings in.<a name=342:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A person newly converted of necessity begins to be troubled by finding that he still has that in him which tends to connect him with the whole course and order of things down here, that is, sin.<a name=342:6></a> I do not think there ever was a converted person who was not troubled more or less by that.<a name=342:7></a> He did not trouble about it before, because, though it is very possible he knew something about sins, he did not know much about sin.<a name=342:8></a> Many a person when first converted thinks that the whole course is cleared, that it will be all plain sailing.<a name=342:9></a> But it is not quite such plain sailing, for the reason I have spoken of, that he finds he has got this terrible principle in him, which always tends to connect his soul with the course of things down here.<a name=342:10></a> Also he has to find out another painful truth, and that is, that he is weak; he might have been strong in sin, but when it comes to be a question of what pleases God, and of the expression of God's will, which the law is, then one finds he is powerless for good.<a name=342:11></a> Those two lessons I believe every converted person has to learn.<a name=342:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first thing the Spirit of God brings to your attention is this, that God is not expecting improvement or strength in you, but He presents before your soul the great truth of another Man, who having been proved and tested, has entered in to His entire satisfaction.<a name=342:13></a> He is on that ground, He is not on the ground of an innocent man, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=343>[Page 343]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"In that he died, he died unto sin once; in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=343:1></a> Then the Spirit of God says further, "You likewise reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus"; you reckon yourselves in correspondence to that Man.<a name=343:2></a> If I might use the expression which I did a fortnight since, that is the leverage in the soul; for so long as I have any idea that God is looking for improvement or victory in me, I shall do no good at all; nor until I apprehend the great truth that there is another Man, who has been raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.<a name=343:3></a> That is the second Man, and that is what made me use the expression a short time since that God has changed the man.<a name=343:4></a> It is no longer testing or proving or anything of the kind; that went on for four thousand years; now there is another Man before God, and all starts from Him, and the Christian is going to be in His likeness, "If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection".<a name=343:5></a> It is simply a question of being conformed to Him.<a name=343:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in connection with this, another truth which I have also touched upon on a previous occasion comes out in chapter 7 -- the believer is "married" to Him who is raised from the dead.<a name=343:7></a> The first bond, that is, law, has been dissolved by the death of Christ; and it is now another husband to whom the Christian is united, and is consequently subject, and at the same time deriving character from Him.<a name=343:8></a> So it is not improvement at all, but another Man.<a name=343:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I very much wish you to bear in mind, if the Lord enable you, what I have tried to bring before you, this great truth of another Man, because it is there you get the thought of life brought in; not subjectively in you, but life in another, life in Christ Jesus.<a name=343:10></a> What does it mean?<a name=343:11></a> I will tell you -- there is one Man living actually, "In that he died, he
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=344>[Page 344]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		died unto sin once; in that he liveth, he liveth unto God"; and living unto God is now all on the principle of resurrection.<a name=344:1></a> Even in regard to the saints in the millennium that will live on earth, I believe they will live on the ground of resurrection; I do not say <i>in</i> resurrection, but on the ground of resurrection; because it is the presence of Christ risen which will relieve them of death.<a name=344:2></a> Now the Christian properly lives on the ground of resurrection.<a name=344:3></a> The only possible ground on which a man could live for God is that of resurrection, for death is on man, and so it says, "Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead" -- that is the ground of life, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".<a name=344:4></a> Thus you have come to this point, the apprehension of life; I do not say life in the Christian, we have not come to that yet, but life in one Man, as it says in verse 2 of this chapter, "The law of the Spirit of life", not "in me", but "in Christ Jesus", the One who is spoken of in chapter 6, as having died unto sin once, but living unto God.<a name=344:5></a> If you do not apprehend life in that way, objectively, in Christ, you do not get the idea of life at all, because the great thing that Scripture brings before you is life in another Man, and on a totally different footing; He is raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, that is the ground of life now.<a name=344:6></a> Christ is as Man in the Father's presence, to the Father's delight; He is everything that the heart of the Father could desire; He lives to the entire satisfaction of God.<a name=344:7></a> That is where life is now, in Christ Jesus, and you have to learn it as there.<a name=344:8></a> Many a person who has wanted to understand something about life has begun by looking at himself, and has made a fatal mistake, because he has not begun from Christ.<a name=344:9></a> You must learn from Christ, you must first see what has come to pass in Christ before you

		can learn what is true in yourself, for the grace of God puts you in correspondence to Christ; and if you do not learn what is true in Christ you cannot learn what is true in yourself.<a name=345:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when I come to the point of life in the believer, it necessarily involves the question of flesh and the Spirit.<a name=345:2></a> I think anybody will understand that the flesh is a very different thought from sin.<a name=345:3></a> I will show you that it is so in an instant.<a name=345:4></a> Scripture speaks of sin as having "entered into the world", but you could not talk about the flesh having entered in.<a name=345:5></a> I have said before, that sin did not originate with man; it came in by man, but it existed before, "By one man sin entered into the world".<a name=345:6></a> As far as I have any insight into it, I think the flesh is man's natural condition, it is man's nature, the seat of what I might call his moral being; thought, feeling, will and purpose all lie in the flesh.<a name=345:7></a> Now you can see that that is a very different thing from sin; it has become "flesh of sin", but I do not talk about sin exactly as being man's nature.<a name=345:8></a> I think the nature of an unconverted man is flesh, that is often the idea of the expression in Scripture.<a name=345:9></a> You find a great deal in this chapter about the "mind of the flesh", that is, the thought and purpose of the flesh.<a name=345:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now let me go back a moment.<a name=345:11></a> From the outset, from the time that a man through grace believes in Christ as raised again from the dead, that man receives the Holy Ghost, and the love of God is shed abroad in his heart; and he further learns another great lesson, that the first man is superseded, and that there is another Man raised from the dead in the presence of God, and that he is united to that other Man, married to Him, to use the figure of Scripture.<a name=345:12></a> Now what about the flesh?<a name=345:13></a> He has come to this point, that the flesh is radically bad, the character of the flesh is

		discovered, and there is no hope of amendment in it; he has learnt in chapters 6 and 7 that there is a principle in him, sin, which always connects him with this scene; and he has learnt another thing too, that when it is a question of the will of God he is perfectly weak, there is no hope in the flesh at all.<a name=346:1></a> Mark how it is put here; it says in verse 5 of chapter 8, "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<a name=346:2></a> For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.<a name=346:3></a> Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<a name=346:4></a> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God".<a name=346:5></a> Now that is the second great lesson in the chapter; the first is that there is life in Christ Jesus; the second that there is no good in the flesh, that the flesh is radically bad and God has condemned it, "God sending his own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=346:6></a> And you cannot mix up the flesh with the Spirit.<a name=346:7></a> Many people like religious stories.<a name=346:8></a> Religious literature all appeals to religious flesh.<a name=346:9></a> You may depend upon it people would never coin religious stories if they did not believe in acting on religious flesh.<a name=346:10></a>

		The practical lesson taught us in the early part of this chapter is this, that you cannot mix up flesh and Spirit, they are totally antagonistic, and there is no help in the flesh, that it is radically bad, so bad that God had to condemn it; and we have to learn the lesson, that nothing whatever is to be hoped for from the flesh.<a name=346:11></a> But then comes the great point for the Christian, "You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you".<a name=346:12></a> If I look to the flesh for anything, I am looking to what God has condemned, to what cannot yield anything at all for God, I am on a totally

		wrong tack, I have forgotten that I am "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in" me.<a name=347:1></a> That is, the Spirit of God has taken up His abode in the Christian, not simply to shed abroad the love of God in his heart, but for another purpose now, to be to him all that the flesh was as the source and spring of thought and purpose.<a name=347:2></a> I have sometimes said that Scripture does not recognise two natures in the Christian; the flesh is the nature in an undelivered man; when he receives the Spirit he is "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit", and the Spirit is not a nature but a person.<a name=347:3></a> And when he gets more light, it can be said of him that he has "put off the old man and put on the new"; and then the nature of the new man is the Christian's nature -- the new man is "created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth", that is the Christian's nature.<a name=347:4></a> If he should fail, and allow the flesh to come in, that does not prove to me that the flesh is his nature; it is like a foreign substance in him, it has no business to be seen, and has to be judged; but nature is what is characteristic.<a name=347:5></a> An unconverted man is characterised by the flesh, and there is nothing else to characterise him.<a name=347:6></a> With the Christian there is a new spring, and that is the Spirit.<a name=347:7></a> The Spirit of God has come to take the control, so that it can be said now not only that you have the Spirit, but that you are in it.<a name=347:8></a> Then it goes on to say, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin", but what then?<a name=347:9></a> "The Spirit is life", the flesh is entirely disowned, "the Spirit is life because of righteousness", that is, in view of righteousness; you can get no righteousness from the flesh, but righteousness has to be maintained, and so "the Spirit is life in view of righteousness".<a name=347:10></a>

		Then we come to another point, the ultimate raising of the body; for if the Spirit of God dwells in you it is witness that you have nothing to expect

		from the flesh, but you have everything to expect from the Spirit, righteousness, and the eventual raising up of your mortal body.<a name=348:1></a> Therefore you are not a debtor to the flesh, you will not get righteousness from the flesh -- "He that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption", that is what you will get from the flesh: "but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life", if you want eternal life you must reap it of the Spirit -- that is how Scripture puts it.<a name=348:2></a> It is virtually what the Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, "He that drinketh of this water", that is, the water that springs from beneath, "shall thirst again, but he that drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life".<a name=348:3></a> It is a great thing when we have really settled it in our souls that we have nothing to expect from the flesh, but everything from the Spirit that dwells in us.<a name=348:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have come to the statement, "If you live after the flesh you shall die"; the apostle puts it in a very strong way; any person that lives after the flesh will die, all tends to that end, of the flesh he will reap corruption; "but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live".<a name=348:5></a> When I mortify the deeds of the body, then it is I am delivered from the flesh; the flesh is there, but I am no longer under the control of it; I have "put off the body of the flesh", when I come to this point that by the Spirit I "mortify the deeds of the body".<a name=348:6></a> The flesh can only work in the members, and when we mortify the deeds of the body, that is, the deeds to which the body is prone, then the apostle says, we shall live; you come on to other ground, it is, so to say, the condition on which you live.<a name=348:7></a> I venture to say this, that no Christian has any experience of life at all if he does not "mortify the deeds of the body".<a name=348:8></a>

		I do not deny his Christianity, and that he may know something of what the grace of God is towards him; but he has no sense of life, of correspondence to Christ, save as mortifying the deeds of the body.<a name=349:1></a> The principle of life in Christianity is this, that you pass out of death into life, "The Spirit is life because of righteousness"; and the practical carrying out of that is, that by the Spirit you "mortify" -- you do not allow -- "the deeds of the body".<a name=349:2></a> They are called the deeds of the body because if the flesh works, it works in the body.<a name=349:3></a> Take a person that gets into a passion, it is the body that is the vehicle; the will, and the lusts of the flesh all work through the body.<a name=349:4></a> For my own part, I have felt that my members are my great trial.<a name=349:5></a> Something hasty comes to the tongue: what is it offends?<a name=349:6></a> The tongue, the member, What has been working there?<a name=349:7></a> The flesh.<a name=349:8></a> If the conception is there, the thing in the Christian ought to be nipped in the bud; the deeds of the body are to be mortified by the Spirit.<a name=349:9></a> Thus you come to this wonderful point, that now that the Spirit of God is there you are practically delivered from the dominion and control of the flesh, and the Spirit is free to do His own proper work.<a name=349:10></a> When the Spirit is in conflict with the flesh, He is doing the work which is necessary for the Christian, but not the work in which He delights.<a name=349:11></a> I put it to anybody here, if Christ has been "raised from the dead by the glory of the Father", do you not think the Spirit of God has the most supreme delight in Christ?<a name=349:12></a> He has, and what do you think His delight is in the Christian?<a name=349:13></a> To lead him in suitability to Christ, in entire correspondence with Christ; that is His proper work, not to be simply in conflict with the flesh.<a name=349:14></a> I think it is miserable and degrading to think that there should be that continual conflict between the flesh and Spirit to the end of the chapter.<a name=349:15></a> The word as

		And there is another great truth, that the Christian is now formed by the place in which Christ has set him.<a name=350:2></a> As surely as possible, my child is formed by my house; he is formed for good or evil by the system and framework of affections by which he is surrounded.<a name=350:3></a> The same thing is true of the Christian -- he is set in the presence of the love of God, and is formed by the associations in which the grace of God has set him.<a name=350:4></a> The youngest Christian has "the love of God shed abroad in his heart", he has the power and ability to cry "Abba, Father"; but he does not know much about it till he knows deliverance.<a name=350:5></a> But the moment I come to that, I am formed for God by the associations and affections in which the grace of God has set me.<a name=350:6></a>

		As I said at the beginning, why I insist so strongly on the truth of deliverance (though I am ashamed to speak of it, because I know so little about it) is because I believe it to be of all moment if you want to enter into what the thought of God is about you.<a name=350:7></a> It is totally impossible to enter into the divine thought that you are the companions of Christ (for that is what God has called you to), unless you are practically set free as to the state of your soul from everything to which Christ has died, sin and the world, and law and flesh.<a name=350:8></a> And as I have said before, the first thing that the Spirit of God sets to work to do when He is received is to bring before your soul the great truth that God has changed His man; that all the stages of probation of the first man are completely over, all has been ended in the cross of Christ; but that another Man has come in, in whom God has been completely glorified, and that the Christian is joined to Him, to take his character from Him.<a name=350:9></a> Then the truth of life in

		Christ Jesus is apprehended, the true character of the flesh is discovered, and now the Christian is "not in the flesh but in the Spirit", and the purpose of the Spirit is to lead the Christian in correspondence to Christ.<a name=351:1></a> That is all on the blessed ground of sonship, and "the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God".<a name=351:2></a> We are a heavenly band.<a name=351:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pray God in His great grace to make it plain to all here.<a name=351:4></a> All these truths we have to enter into experimentally; the mere statement of them, or the mere apprehension of them doctrinally will not suffice, will not bring deliverance to you.<a name=351:5></a> All has to be wrought in the soul.<a name=351:6></a> The soul has to learn practically and experimentally the truth of another Man, and (what is so essential if you are going to join company with that Man) that you must part company with the man that is here, the man that is dominated by sin.<a name=351:7></a> That is of all moment.<a name=351:8></a> And in that way the believer learns what the true character of the flesh is, and the righteousness of God's judgment of it, that God has "condemned sin in the flesh"; thus the whole state has been condemned, that the believer might be "not in the flesh but in the Spirit", that the Spirit might be life because of righteousness, and also be the Spirit of sonship to lead the believer, according to the grace of God, into what is true in Christ.<a name=351:9></a> May God give to us to understand it in His great grace, and to be led by the Spirit of God on that blessed line where we not only know the love of God, but where by the Spirit we respond to that love, that is, we cry, "Abba, Father", with the blessed consciousness by the Spirit that we are the children of God; and if suffering with Him here, if in that association, that we are "heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together".<a name=351:10></a>

		The subject that has occupied us on the three previous occasions has been "deliverance", but then deliverance has, in the thought of God for the saints, its own distinct purpose and object.<a name=352:1></a> And as I understand it, the end in view is that we may enter in our souls into the proper place of Christians as in association with Christ risen, and thus as one body by the Spirit here on earth.<a name=352:2></a> When we have reached that point, then I think all can understand that deliverance is realized.<a name=352:3></a> That is what led me to the passage I have read, for in the beginning of chapter 3 you get the thought of being risen with Christ, and this means that we are in association with Christ.<a name=352:4></a> The idea, as I understand it, is that the power of God that has operated in Christ in His resurrection has also taken effect in the saints; not in the same way, because with Him it was in literal resurrection, and in the saints it is moral; but it is the same power, and by divine power they are placed on one common platform with Christ, as risen together with Him.<a name=352:5></a> And I doubt if anybody understands what Christianity is if he does not apprehend that.<a name=352:6></a> It is all very well to bear a good name in the world six days in the week, and to be a Christian on the seventh; but that is not Christianity.<a name=352:7></a> Christianity is brought out in the passage I have read in Colossians; at the close of chapter 2 you pass out of one scene, and in the beginning of chapter 3 you have got another scene in view, though you may not yet be there.<a name=352:8></a> That is what I shall try by the grace of God to make plain: there is another scene opened to the view of the Christian.<a name=352:9></a> It is presented in a few words in the beginning of chapter 3, "If ye

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the two scenes to which I have alluded, the one is in contrast to the other; the one is an order of things in which man dogmatises, and lays down the law.<a name=353:3></a> The other is an order of things in which man has no place at all, but everything is completely of God, "the things above, at the right hand of God": you may depend upon it there is nothing of man there, all is of God.<a name=353:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken of deliverance as a subject of the last importance to us as Christians, and have referred to it in three aspects, first, deliverance from sin and the world, which are intimately connected, then deliverance from law, and finally deliverance from the flesh.<a name=353:5></a> I will briefly touch on the three again, to connect the whole together.<a name=353:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think that people enter into deliverance from sin and the world until they get something positive in their souls.<a name=353:7></a> It is no good their saying they are dead to sin and the world if they are not dead; and I do not think they reckon themselves dead, until there is a certain power of God in the soul, and this lies in the apprehension of another Man.<a name=353:8></a> As we get in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, "Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father", it is another Man, "In that he died, he died unto sin once; in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=353:9></a> It is perfectly evident that the man here lives to himself; that is the principle of sin.<a name=353:10></a> But what has come to pass in regard to another Man is, "in that he died, he died unto sin once", He had to say to sin

	<div class="paragraph">
		in bearing the judgment of it, "in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=354:1></a> The great point is this, that a Man, of another order, has entered in to the eternal and perfect satisfaction of God, "raised from the dead by the glory of the Father"; and it is the sense and power of that in the soul which really enables the Christian to reckon himself "dead to sin, and alive unto God in Christ Jesus".<a name=354:2></a> Any Christian would feel the incompatibility of sin with grace.<a name=354:3></a> Then in regard to the world, the world is the system of things in which the flesh lives; and I do not think persons would be content to accept death to the world if they did not apprehend that there existed another sphere, another circle, in which the character of Christ is seen.<a name=354:4></a> I do not say more now in regard to deliverance from sin and the world, because I am only recapitulating.<a name=354:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Subsequently we had before us death to the law, a very important point.<a name=354:6></a> The law was a bond under which the Jew was held; but God has dissolved the bond by the death of Christ.<a name=354:7></a> The bond does not exist for the Christian, he is not under law.<a name=354:8></a> It is not quite like death to sin and to the world, there is no bond there; but the law was a bond, and the point in regard to it is that God has dissolved the bond in order that another bond might be formed.<a name=354:9></a> You are "become dead to the law by the body of Christ", that is, in Christ that bond is dissolved, "that you might be to another, to him that is raised up from the dead, to bring forth fruit unto God".<a name=354:10></a> I will put it in other language for you, which may perhaps tend to simplify it.<a name=354:11></a> The apostle says, "In that I live in flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me"; that is my bond, he says, not law.<a name=354:12></a> The Christian is bound to Christ, by the sense of what Christ has done for him.<a name=354:13></a> The law did nothing for him except condemn; now he lives by the faith of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=355>[Page 355]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Son of God, who loved him and gave Himself for him; there it is he gets deliverance from law.<a name=355:1></a> He walks under the influence of love, not simply the love of God but the love of Christ.<a name=355:2></a> Some might think they are the same thing, but they are not; there is the love of God and there is the love of Christ.<a name=355:3></a> You could hardly say that God loved me and gave Himself for me; God gave His Son for me, but Christ "loved me and gave himself for me".<a name=355:4></a> It is a Man that loved me and gave Himself for me; He is divine, but He is a Man.<a name=355:5></a> So, too, He "loved the church and gave himself for it".<a name=355:6></a> That is the second point, deliverance from law.<a name=355:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the third point came before us last time, and that is, deliverance from the flesh, which is comparatively simple, because it lies in this, that the Christian being indwelt by the Spirit is not in the flesh.<a name=355:8></a> He has to learn that; and as to the way deliverance is realized, he has to learn that God has in the cross judged sin in the flesh.<a name=355:9></a> I do not think the Christian practically understands deliverance from the flesh until he sees what was effected typically in the brazen serpent and actually in Christ; then he sees that the state of man in the flesh has been judged in order that the believer might be indwelt by the Spirit.<a name=355:10></a> When I once see that God has judged sin in the flesh, then I say, I am not debtor to the flesh; I am indwelt by the Spirit, for the judgment was effected in order that the Spirit might be given and might be life in the believer.<a name=355:11></a> It is just according to the type in Numbers, where the next thing after the brazen serpent is the digging of the well and the springing up of the water, "Spring up, O well" That is, it is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus springing up in the Christian, and that is the way he gets, practically, deliverance from the flesh.<a name=355:12></a>

		in detail; but the difficulty is that all these things have to be put together in each one of our souls, because they all work together.<a name=356:1></a> I am quite warranted in taking them up in detail, for indeed Scripture does so; but they must all be put together in the soul of the believer, because deliverance has to be complete; he has to be practically freed from sin, and the world, and law, and the flesh; that is the divine thought.<a name=356:2></a> And the object and purpose on the part of God in it is that he may enter into the blessed truth of association with Christ; pass practically out of one scene into the presence of another blessed scene opened up to his view entirely outside of all that is here.<a name=356:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Allow me to dwell first on the two or three verses at the close of chapter 2.<a name=356:4></a> The apostle has completed the doctrinal part in verse 19, and then in verse 20 he comes to the hortatory part, and says, "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though alive in the world" -- not "living" exactly, but "alive" in the world -- "are ye subject to ordinances, (Touch not, taste not, handle not, which are all to perish with the using), after the commandments and doctrines of men?<a name=356:5></a> which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will, worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body, not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh".<a name=356:6></a> Now I think any one can see there is one scene here, the world; and it is not the world of gross things, not Egypt, but it is what one may call the religious world, and in the religious world man dogmatises, the law is laid down.<a name=356:7></a> Even the law of God in the Old Testament was in dogmas; the apostle speaks of it in the early part of the chapter, as "the handwriting of ordinances", dogmas.<a name=356:8></a> But in the religious world it is after the traditions of men; man lays down and prescribes what is suitable to the religious person.<a name=356:9></a> You will

		find it in all the great systems which exist in the present day; Christianity has got back to dogmatism.<a name=357:1></a> Man prepares a rubric, he lays down rules as to service, he gives directions as to the ordering of the person and even of the dress.<a name=357:2></a> That is the character of things that exist in the religious world, it is dogmatism; it calls for unintelligent obedience, and the end and purpose of it is the satisfaction of the flesh.<a name=357:3></a> I have often thought, in connection with the great religious things in the world, for whose satisfaction do they exist?<a name=357:4></a> Whom do they please?<a name=357:5></a> Suppose you have intellectual preaching, to which it is a great pleasure to man to listen, is that to please God or man?<a name=357:6></a> So, too, in regard to musical services; whom are they intended to please?<a name=357:7></a> If you had the most magnificent music which it was possible to produce upon earth, do you think for an instant that human music could please God?<a name=357:8></a> What has God to say to human music?<a name=357:9></a> There is such a thing as singing with the heart and in the Spirit, and with the understanding; but nothing can please God except what is in the Spirit.<a name=357:10></a> All else is for the satisfaction of the flesh.<a name=357:11></a> Of course you see all I have spoken of in its most gross form in Popery; but you can see plenty of it outside Popery, round us here in the world.<a name=357:12></a> I might take up a good many other things besides those I have mentioned, such as laying down of seasons and times and days; for they are of the same order of things.<a name=357:13></a> People are dogmatised; it is not intelligent subjection which is called for, but unintelligent subjection, that is, people do things, not because they see any spiritual purpose or reason in them, but because they are laid down after the commandments and traditions of men, and serve for the satisfaction of the flesh.<a name=357:14></a> And they are well pleased with what they do in this way; there is a sort of satisfaction in it, it is not that God is pleased, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to the Christian, the point is this: he is dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world.<a name=358:3></a> Christ in a sense came under the rudiments of the world, for He had His human identity, was "made of a woman, made under the law", He was presented to Jehovah, and was circumcised.<a name=358:4></a> But He has died out from all that order, and we are dead with Him, "If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world".<a name=358:5></a> A Christian has passed morally out of that scene.<a name=358:6></a>

		Now I want to look a little at the scene opened to us at the beginning of chapter 3, though I can speak but little as to it, seeing that so little is said about it, and really it is a scene on which one finds it very difficult to touch.<a name=358:7></a> "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=358:8></a> Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<a name=358:9></a> For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=358:10></a> When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory".<a name=358:11></a> Now may the Lord enable me to say a word in regard to these two or three verses.<a name=358:12></a> It is not that I can pretend to expound them; I can only throw out a thought or two in regard to them.<a name=358:13></a> We have come, as I was saying at the beginning, to what I believe to be the great purpose and end of deliverance, that is, that we are risen together with Christ.<a name=358:14></a> How that is brought about we are told in verse 12 of chapter 2, "Buried with him in baptism, wherein

		also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".<a name=359:1></a> My own impression, although I would not be very positive about it, is that it should read, "<i>In whom</i> also ye are risen with him": I am not clear about connecting it with baptism, I am more inclined to connect it with Christ: "in whom", that is, it is in Christ, the Christian is risen with Him.<a name=359:2></a> Now we come to the exhortation founded on it, "If you are risen together with Christ".<a name=359:3></a> You can understand that the Christian is not yet risen; but Christ is risen, and God has wrought in the Christian in the same power by which he raised Christ, and by the same Spirit; and the way in which it is wrought in the soul is "through faith of the operation of God, that raised him from the dead".<a name=359:4></a> What that means is this, that I see the force and meaning of God's operation in raising Him from the dead.<a name=359:5></a> I begin to see something of the glory of God, what God would secure for Himself out of the wreck and ruin of everything here, and the beginning of it was the resurrection of Christ.<a name=359:6></a> When Christ died, everything was gone as you might say; the world was dead in trespasses and sins, Jew and Gentile alike; Christ was in death, and what was to come out of it all?<a name=359:7></a> The first ray of light that breaks in upon that scene of darkness is the resurrection of Christ; the power of God raises Christ from the dead; it is God working, who commanded that out of darkness light should shine, and the first ray of light is the glory of God raising Christ again from the dead, that is the real beginning of all for God.<a name=359:8></a> Now I apprehend what God is doing, I see the character of his operation, that the purpose and intent of God is to recover.<a name=359:9></a> The resurrection is really the divine power in recovery.<a name=359:10></a> Satan destroys, man destroys, as the Lord said to the Jews, "Destroy this temple", that was what they would do, "and in three days I will

		raise it up".<a name=360:1></a> I see that Christ raised again from the dead is the glory of God in contrast to the destructive power of man and of Satan.<a name=360:2></a> I delight not only in the personal resurrection of Christ, but in the operation of God that raised Him from the dead.<a name=360:3></a> And I am entitled to take this ground, I am risen together with Him; God is bringing a company out of death, and Christ is first of that company, He is the first-fruits of the resurrection.<a name=360:4></a> God "is bringing many sons to glory", and He has taken the first-born of them out of death.<a name=360:5></a> And the same power which wrought in Christ has wrought in us, and the way in which it is evidenced is in faith in the operation of God, that raised him from the dead.<a name=360:6></a> We are of His company, risen together with Him, in association with Him, and He is "not ashamed to call us brethren".<a name=360:7></a> All the sons that are brought to glory are taken out of death.<a name=360:8></a> It is the triumph of God, His glory, that He takes a company for glory out of death.<a name=360:9></a>

		I want next to show you the effect of it, and how it opens up to us another scene, a scene which is outside this scene.<a name=360:10></a> And the first point is, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=360:11></a> It is interesting to see the different way in which Christ is presented to us in the different epistles.<a name=360:12></a> I think you will find that almost every statement in regard to Him in the epistle to the Colossians is really leading up to the divine glory of His Person.<a name=360:13></a> And the reason of it is that there had been a tendency among those who were affecting the Colossians to set aside the true glory of the Person of the Son.<a name=360:14></a> For instance, in chapter 1 we read, "who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth".<a name=360:15></a> And again, "for it pleased .<a name=360:16></a>.<a name=360:17></a>.<a name=360:18></a> that in

		him should all fulness dwell", and so on.<a name=361:1></a> So again in verse 9 of chapter 2 it says, "For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=361:2></a> When you come to chapter 3 it says, "where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=361:3></a> I understand by it that that is the place which Christ has taken personally; it is not a place in which any other but Christ will ever be; you read of the saints being in heavenly places, but not at the right hand of God.<a name=361:4></a> It is the place which Christ has taken personally, and to me it is the declaration of the glory of His Person.<a name=361:5></a> Angels are the most distinguished of created beings, but "unto which of the angels said he at any time, Sit thou at my right hand until I make thy foes thy footstool"?<a name=361:6></a> The place that Christ has taken as Man at the right hand of God, the place of supreme honour and power, is the declaration on the part of God of who Christ is.<a name=361:7></a> I will give you a proof of it.<a name=361:8></a> The Lord told the Jews when He was before the Council that they should see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of God, and they said unto Him instantly, "Art thou then the Son of God?<a name=361:9></a>" They felt what it conveyed.<a name=361:10></a> So, too, Stephen saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God.<a name=361:11></a> And here you get the great truth that He sits at the right hand of God; it is the proof and declaration that He is the Son of God, in the place of supreme honour and glory.<a name=361:12></a> I have often thought in regard to Christ here upon earth, that the greatest proof of His deity is what He was as Man; you could not have such a man if He were not God.<a name=361:13></a> And here I get the declaration of His deity; that is, that He sits as Man at the right hand of God.<a name=361:14></a> It is a wonderful thing for the Christian, because everything is consequently changed, and he can look up there for that very reason, for the blessed truth has come out that there is actually a man sitting at the right hand of God.<a name=361:15></a> And then the practical bearing of it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=362>[Page 362]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is that that Man is the One with whom as Man the Christian is associated, in order to draw his thoughts and heart into another scene where everything is of God.<a name=362:1></a> Mark you this, there is nothing there but what is of God; love reigns there supreme.<a name=362:2></a> When you think of Christ rejected, spit upon, and crucified down here, now sitting at God's right hand, the object of all homage and honour and glory in heaven, it is a wonderful thing to think that as Christians we are placed by the grace of God in association with such an One.<a name=362:3></a> The practical effect of it must be that you "seek the things which are above where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God".<a name=362:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is this: "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth".<a name=362:5></a> There are "things above" and there are "things on the earth".<a name=362:6></a> It is a very difficult thing to attempt to describe what the things above are; but I should suppose they are most blessed things, and I take it that things above all centre round Him who is everything to us, who loved us and gave Himself for us.<a name=362:7></a> There is no one here tonight but knows very well what the things on earth are.<a name=362:8></a> You do not want to find the earth made agreeable to you, because another scene is opened up to you, where everything centres round a Man, highly exalted, proved to be divine, and where everything is of God, and love reigns supreme.<a name=362:9></a>

		But now we have this great truth, "Ye are dead".<a name=362:10></a> The statement is not doctrinal but practical; you are dead, and "your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=362:11></a> No one knows what the life of the Christian is, it has never yet been manifested, it is hidden in God.<a name=362:12></a> If you could see Christ, you would understand then what the life of the Christian is; you will never know it till Christ appears, that is, I imagine, the meaning of the expression, "Your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=362:13></a> "When he is manifested

		we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", and no one will be like Him until He is manifested; then we shall be like Him in order that we may see Him.<a name=363:1></a> But for the moment our life is hid.<a name=363:2></a> How does that work?<a name=363:3></a> I think in this way, that a Christian wants to be hid so far as the world is concerned; I do not want to be prominent here so long as my life is hid; I would like to be in the shade down here until Christ who is my life is manifested, but though in obscurity I would not be inactive, but serving the Lord in the place of obscurity.<a name=363:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the third point, and that is "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory".<a name=363:5></a> Christ is our life, He is the real living power in the Christian, as the apostle says, "Not I, but Christ liveth in me"; that is what obtains in the present time, our life has not yet been manifested, but Christ is our life, and when He appears we shall appear with him in glory.<a name=363:6></a> I think I speak the sentiments and feeling of a great many, when I say, You do not want to come out glorious in the present time.<a name=363:7></a> You are content to wait for the time when Christ who is our life is manifested.<a name=363:8></a> I do not think we want to antedate the glory.<a name=363:9></a> One would not care to be glorious here, knowing that all the glory is at the right hand of God.<a name=363:10></a> There has been nothing but the deepest shame and humiliation and ignominy down here for Christ; He has now the blessed answer to it in the place of supreme honour and glory at the right hand of God, and I think the Christian should refuse to be renowned or distinguished in a scene where Christ has only been dishonoured, and content to wait until Christ is manifested in glory.<a name=363:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great point to me that God has opened another scene to the Christian.<a name=363:12></a> I might illustrate it by the position of the Lord Himself when He was

		May God give you to see the great blessing of this truth, to see what a great end is to be gained by deliverance, what deliverance brings you to as to the practical state of your souls, that is, into the consciousness of association with Christ, according to the grace of God; that He is not ashamed to call you brethren; you are in association with Him, you have got glory in view, and the blessed scene where everything is of God, where there is righteousness and holiness and love and majesty, and all that is of God, vindicated in a Man.<a name=364:9></a> That is the scene which is opened up to the Christian, and opened up to him in order that he may know what it is to be according to God and for God down here
