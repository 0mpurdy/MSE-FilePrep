	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have it a little on my heart to seek to unfold, as God may enable me by His Spirit, the verses we have read in this chapter, which are more especially connected with the appropriation by the believer of the death of the Son of man.<a name=1:1></a> I need hardly say that this connects itself very intimately with the blessing of eternal life, into which the believer is brought.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would first say a few words as to the general place in this gospel of these two chapters, the fifth and sixth.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a certain development in the truth that runs all through the gospels.<a name=1:4></a> There was more than one side in the Person of the blessed Lord, and we get this opened out by the four evangelists.<a name=1:5></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>Jesus is presented to us as the Son of God acting in divine sovereignty: "The Son quickeneth whom he will".<a name=1:6></a> And then again: "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son".<a name=1:7></a> The great point of chapter 5 is that the Lord Jesus exercises divine prerogative.<a name=1:8></a> God is the Judge, but all judgment is committed "unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father".<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in chapter 6, what is brought before us is the form in which eternal life was presented to men; it is an incarnate Christ, the true bread from heaven, the Son of man, sealed by the Father, who gives His flesh for the life of the world.<a name=1:10></a> This is the great point that the Lord presses in this chapter.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews claimed to be the people of privilege.<a name=1:12></a> They say: "Our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat".<a name=1:13></a> But the Lord answers: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven;
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.<a name=2:1></a> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world".<a name=2:2></a> An incarnate Christ was the form in which God presented His Son to man to be received; and a humbled Christ is food for the believer.<a name=2:3></a> He adds, "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<a name=2:4></a> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life".<a name=2:5></a> If the Jews had really discerned the grace of His humiliation, that He really was the Son of God, they would have had eternal life, but they must have gone on to appropriate His death.<a name=2:6></a> I have no doubt this would have been the case, but it is not my subject tonight.<a name=2:7></a> I wish rather to look at the absolute necessity for the death of Christ for us, and our appropriation thereof.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Most of you will remember these words in the first epistle of John: "There are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one".<a name=2:9></a> They all bear witness to the fact that God has given to us eternal life.<a name=2:10></a> But they also bear another witness, and that is, that if we have eternal life, it is not in Adam; it is not in ourselves it is in Christ.<a name=2:11></a> And that, I believe, is the teaching of the epistle; and this is how the epistle connects itself with the passage that I have read.<a name=2:12></a> It was when the Lord was dead that the blood and the water flowed forth; and the Spirit was not given until He had gone back to the Father.<a name=2:13></a> So that I do not get one of these witnesses until death has come in.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I question in my own mind whether we realise the solemnity of the fact that death has come in; and that, not death in ourselves, for, if it had been, we should have been for ever lost; but it is the death of Christ.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I wish to say a few words more about these three witnesses.<a name=2:16></a> I believe that you will find that the whole of John's first epistle ranges itself under these three heads: the consequences of the water; the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		consequences of the blood; and the consequences of the Spirit.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first two chapters are rather the result of the blood, for that is what gives us title to be with Him.<a name=3:2></a> God Himself is always light; but the witness about God to Israel was that "Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was".<a name=3:3></a> <i>Now</i> the witness is: "If we walk in the light as <i>he</i> is in the light".<a name=3:4></a> God has come out in light, and Christianity has brought us into the light in which He is.<a name=3:5></a> It is not conditional.<a name=3:6></a> God has brought us "out of darkness into his marvellous light".<a name=3:7></a> This is not attainment; it is the privilege of every believer.<a name=3:8></a> "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin", and gives us the privilege to walk in the light as He is.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third chapter the question is the nature; that which is the product in the believer of the word.<a name=3:10></a> "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures", as the apostle James says, and Peter: "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever".<a name=3:11></a> So here we get that we are the children of God, and that, "He that practises righteousness is righteous, even as <i>he</i> is righteous".<a name=3:12></a> It is a righteous nature, which has its manifestation also in love; love that enables us to "lay down our lives for the brethren".<a name=3:13></a> It is a wonderful thing!<a name=3:14></a> We may not enter into it, but still there it is plain in Scripture.<a name=3:15></a> And men may not be able to see it in us, it may be obscured, but still it is there; it is the same nature as in God Himself, it is divine.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes the third witness, the Spirit.<a name=3:17></a> This is the result; it follows on the water and the blood.<a name=3:18></a> An entirely new thing has been brought in, a new creation, and this is accompanied by the Spirit.<a name=3:19></a> The consequences of the presence of the Spirit are brought out in the fourth chapter.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is intelligence.<a name=4:1></a> The apostle says, "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit".<a name=4:2></a> We know it because God has given to us of His Spirit, and He does not take away His Spirit.<a name=4:3></a> We continue in God and He in us.<a name=4:4></a> Besides this, the Spirit is here for testimony; He witnesses that, "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world".<a name=4:5></a> Both these are the result of the presence of the Spirit of God in the believer.<a name=4:6></a> I have said thus much in preface, and would now add a few words on the passage I read.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jews were stumbled at once when the Lord spoke of giving His flesh to eat, and I do not wonder at it.<a name=4:8></a> "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you".<a name=4:9></a> This was the test.<a name=4:10></a> You may meet people who pretend to have life towards God, but if they do not know what it is to have eaten "the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood", there is no life in them.<a name=4:11></a> I need hardly say how much Socinianism there is in the present day.<a name=4:12></a> The death of Christ is slighted as to the solemn judgment of man's state effected in it.<a name=4:13></a> Now the Lord puts it as a test for the state of souls.<a name=4:14></a> "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you".<a name=4:15></a> If you have not part in death, you have not part in life.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things brought out in our chapter about the Son.<a name=4:17></a> First, He has become incarnate.<a name=4:18></a> Second, He dies.<a name=4:19></a> Third, He goes up to heaven again, where He was before.<a name=4:20></a> Now the Lord was talking here to people who were setting up religious pretensions: "Except ye eat", you are clean outside the whole thing.<a name=4:21></a> You have no part in life if not in death.<a name=4:22></a> The old state is death, as children of Adam; the new is life in Christ, but through death.<a name=4:23></a> As to the Christian, it does not say that he has life in him, but life in Christ.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next verse is not so much a test, as it is a proof.<a name=4:25></a> "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		eternal life".<a name=5:1></a> His death is the food of life.<a name=5:2></a> The eating in this verse is, I judge, an habitual thing.<a name=5:3></a> It is not a thing that is done once for all.<a name=5:4></a> And I ask, Is it not a privilege to feed on the death of Christ?<a name=5:5></a> I do not mean at the Lord's table on the first day of the week, I mean as the habit of our souls every day of our lives.<a name=5:6></a> It is an individual thing.<a name=5:7></a> Has not God brought in the death of Christ upon everything?<a name=5:8></a> From the cedar wood to the hyssop!<a name=5:9></a> I do not say it is our only food; for we have also the humbled Christ, the manna; but we do feed on the death of Christ.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And while contemplating, and a blessed contemplation it is, the death of Christ, in His perfect love to the Father, and in His triumph over evil, we have a part in what is eternal, in what never began and will never end.<a name=5:11></a> This part in life with Christ is what we are brought into; and when the time for display comes, He will raise us up.<a name=5:12></a> If, as having life, we delight to meditate on the death of Christ, Christ will raise us up at the last day!<a name=5:13></a> What a blessed thing!<a name=5:14></a> It is a present association with Christ, and the display and the glory are at the last day.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next verse we have a further statement.<a name=5:16></a> If we eat His flesh and drink His blood, He continues in us and we in Him.<a name=5:17></a> We have an eternal part in Christ; and, if I may use the expression reverently, He has in us.<a name=5:18></a> A person may in a sense have a part for a time in Christ, and then go away; but it is not this; here it is 'continue' as we get it in the epistle; it is a present and continuous, eateth and drinketh.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But more than this.<a name=5:20></a> It indicates a condition of dependence, for the life is only in Him; and the word 'continue' implies dependence.<a name=5:21></a> I have eternal life up there in Christ, and Christ is in me down here before the world.<a name=5:22></a> Christ did not present Himself to the world, but the Father; and so with us.<a name=5:23></a> We continue in Christ, and Christ in us.<a name=5:24></a> And if you want to

	<div class="paragraph">
		know what a Christian is, I can say it is Christ.<a name=6:1></a> People sometimes talk and think much of proprieties.<a name=6:2></a> Thank God, we have done with proprieties.<a name=6:3></a> And what tends to distinguish us -- that which ought to characterise a Christian down here -- is Christ, and that is what I seek.<a name=6:4></a> God does not value anything else but Christ in His people.<a name=6:5></a> It is what is before the mind that forms the person.<a name=6:6></a> If it is Christ that is before you, Christ will come out in your life and ways.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one more clause: "As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=6:8></a> I can only say as to this verse that I dare not expatiate on it.<a name=6:9></a> Indeed, what could I say about it?<a name=6:10></a> I little understand what it is for Christ to live on account of the Father.<a name=6:11></a> All that I can say is that the very same character of life as that of the Son is the life of the believer, and that inseparable connection with Christ is ours.<a name=6:12></a> In this passage there is not the thought of the body.<a name=6:13></a> It is life only that is before us.<a name=6:14></a> But life is essential to the truth of the body, and it is in this way that John is necessary to Paul; John gives us the life; Paul gives us the life in one body; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>.<a name=6:15></a> We cannot well appreciate church truth if we do not enter into what John teaches as to the life.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we have this closing expression: "This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever".<a name=6:17></a> The Lord reverts to what He had been saying in the previous part of the chapter.<a name=6:18></a> He knew very well that He was going on to death, and He insists, on the way to it, that He was the living bread which came down from heaven, "that a man may eat thereof, and not die".<a name=6:19></a> I do not doubt at all, if there had been a single one of those poor Jews listening to Him that could, in faith, have seen the Son of God through the humble exterior of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he would have had the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		blessing, in anticipation, though, as I have said, he must needs go on to the death.<a name=7:1></a> It is a great thing to get into God's thoughts.<a name=7:2></a> The pretensions of man in the present day only move one's contempt and sorrow; but that a Man could stand upon earth and say: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever" is marvellous!<a name=7:3></a> Death has now come in, and life is the result.<a name=7:4></a> Is not that worthy of God!<a name=7:5></a> The death of Christ is presented to man as the way of life, and feeding on it is a proof to the believer that he has got eternal life.<a name=7:6></a> Take the simplest soul that you can, but find it delighting in meditating on the death of Christ, and it is to me a proof that it has eternal life.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The seed of the life is in Christ, and it is a dependent life, as we have been seeing: "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=7:8></a> If you could take away Christ, you could take away the life of the believer.<a name=7:9></a> But you cannot take away Christ, for Christ is God.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing for our souls if God, by His Spirit, establishes us in the understanding of this truth, and gives us to realise what a marvellous thing it is to be in the hands of Christ!<a name=7:11></a> To know that we are going to be the subjects of His mighty power, and that He is going to raise us up at the last day.<a name=7:12></a>

		LIFE AS PRESENTED IN SCRIPTURE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:3">Psalm  133:3</a>; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:22">Romans  6:22</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have doubted sometimes if it be sufficiently seen that, when life is spoken of in Scripture, it is presented to us as a moral state into which one is brought through faith (the just shall live by faith), to which the nature begotten in the believer of the Spirit by the word necessarily answers.<a name=8:1></a> This moral state is formed by, and dependent on the way in which God is pleased to reveal Himself.<a name=8:2></a> The contrasts in which life is presented to us in the word may serve to the elucidation of this.<a name=8:3></a> I think the mistake has been made of viewing life too much according to natural ideas, as a sort of deposit in the believer -- though indeed there be a seed of God in him -- but in viewing it in this way, the moral character and import of life appears to me in measure lost.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two or three passages will show the contrasts to which I have referred.<a name=8:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:3">Psalm  133:3</a>, life for evermore is the explanation of "the blessing", and it is identified with Zion, and therefore with all the moral force of Zion.<a name=8:6></a> "There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=8:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:2">Daniel  12:2</a>, eternal life is contrasted with shame and everlasting contempt; in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>, with everlasting punishment; in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>, with a state of death, and so too, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:23">Romans  6:23</a>.<a name=8:8></a> These passages are of moment, not exactly as describing what life is, but as showing it to us in contrast either with death as a moral state in the present, or with shame, contempt, and punishment in the future.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may here notice the moral sequence which we find in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:22">Romans  6:22</a>.<a name=8:10></a> It begins with liberation from sin and bondage to God, it goes on to fruit unto holiness,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and the climax is eternal life; there is evidently a moral progression here, though it doubtless ends in glory.<a name=9:1></a> And this brings me to another point, namely, the kind of persons who are spoken of as passing into life, of whose course down here life may be regarded as the consummation.<a name=9:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>, it is the righteous.<a name=9:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2:7">Romans  2:7</a>, it is those who, by patient continuance in good works, seek for glory, honour, incorruptibility.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think it will be evident that life thus regarded could not be viewed as existing, so far at least as man's participation in it is concerned, until the necessary conditions should be there according to God.<a name=9:5></a> I do not, of course, intend to give always to life, as presented in the word, precisely the same force.<a name=9:6></a> This must be ascertained from the particular context in which it stands.<a name=9:7></a> Hence, in the Old Testament, it doubtless refers to a state of blessing to be enjoyed on the earth under Christ, when the law is written in the heart; while in the New, it is <i>in</i> the Son of God, Christ Jesus, carrying with it relationship and inheritance in Him, and is the fulfilment of God's eternal purpose.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now for the display of life it is plain from Scripture that two conditions were necessary; the first was the manifestation of life, of and according to God, in a man, the sphere of it being properly in glory, and this in One who is a quickening Spirit, the second Man, out of heaven; the other was the removal of sin from before God, and that in such a way as that the glory of God might come in where the full power of sin had been; and with this was the condemnation of the state of the first man.<a name=9:9></a> Now in the incarnation of the Son of God, the first condition was, in measure, fulfilled, and the second pledged.<a name=9:10></a> He was the living bread come down from heaven, and the bread that He would give was His flesh, which He would give for the life of the world.<a name=9:11></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will endeavour to trace a little the way in which eternal life is developed in the writings of the apostle John.<a name=10:1></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>, its character and privilege are described by Jesus Himself as the knowing the Father as the only true God, and Jesus Christ His sent One.<a name=10:2></a> This indicates at once its moral character, and renders it manifestly inseparable from the Son.<a name=10:3></a> Now what was necessary as from God was really present when the Father was manifested in the Son, become Man; but there yet remained to be accomplished the setting aside of the flesh that man might be wrought for the blessing; and to this I suppose the Lord refers in speaking of the brazen serpent in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>.<a name=10:4></a> Nevertheless in the manifestation of the Son there was something far in advance of all that had ever been before.<a name=10:5></a> Light had come in as to the portion which the grace of God had in reserve for man.<a name=10:6></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, the Lord speaks of eternal life through the giving of God's Son as the witness and expression of God's love to the world, and it is into the enjoyment and joy of this love that the believer in the Son is brought.<a name=10:7></a> This is eternal life, and is far beyond any question of kingdom.<a name=10:8></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, the worship of God as Father is spoken of, the result of the living water in the believer; it springs up unto everlasting life.<a name=10:9></a> Thus we have God known in His love, and worshipped as Father in Spirit and in truth.<a name=10:10></a> In chapter 5, it is the effect of hearing the voice of the Son of God, and there is the consequent passage from death unto life.<a name=10:11></a> Here, as I have before shown, it is an entire change as regards the state of things in which a soul lives morally.<a name=10:12></a> In chapter 6, the Son of God incarnate is presented as the bread of life -- the bread of God -- and the way of life for man was to eat of this bread; all the grace of God was seen in the form in which the life was presented to man.<a name=10:13></a> At the same time He would give His flesh for the life of the world, and His death of necessity became the test of faith.<a name=10:14></a> Except they ate His flesh and drank His blood they had no life

		in them, and the Lord warns them that His words must not be understood in a carnal sense, for they were spirit and life.<a name=11:1></a> The true secret underneath all, was that the Father was drawing souls to the Son; and in an incarnate and crucified Christ faith has a portion given and enjoyed in communion with the Father and the Son.<a name=11:2></a> And this is eternal life, which for us will find its completion in resurrection at the last day.<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the passages cited show that the idea of life, in the first revelation of it in Scripture, is a moral order of things into which the believer enters through grace, where wholly new objects are presented to him, which he is capable of enjoying in virtue of a new nature implanted in him.<a name=11:4></a> And the same thing is evident in the first epistle of John, where the believer is viewed as being in life, enjoying the knowledge of the Father and the Son -- born of God that he may enjoy it -- having confidence with God, knowing the love of God, into the enjoyment of which he is introduced, and delivered from fear because love is made perfect with us, "because, as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=11:5></a> And, in chapter 5, the apostle reverts to the fact of the eternal life being in the Son, and ends with the expression, "He is the true God and eternal life" that is, that eternal life means a new order of things, so far as man is concerned, true only in the Son, and in believers as abiding in Him.<a name=11:6></a> The boundaries of the land of Israel's inheritance might be limited, and there might be a limit to the subsistence which the land could afford; to Christ there can be no limit; the extent and area for blessing, so to speak, and the power to maintain those blessed are illimitable.<a name=11:7></a> In the writings of Paul, life is viewed rather as a display in the future, in which God's eternal purpose for man's glory will find its accomplishment.<a name=11:8></a> It was promised in Christ before the world was; it is now brought to light by our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled

		death; and grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=12:1></a> Thus, though the apostle recognises the present power of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and exhorts Timothy to grasp eternal life, yet he speaks in general of eternal life as the consummation of the believer's course, but which is at the same time the fruit of God's eternal purpose.<a name=12:2></a> It is all the difference between a state of life in Christ in glory, and a state of life in blessing on the earth under Christ.<a name=12:3></a> The apostle Paul, speaking of life more in display, connects it with Christ in His present position in glory, rather than, as is the case with John, with the Son become Man.<a name=12:4></a>

		There is another point, in connection with what I have said, of considerable importance, and that is, that life, as to man's participation in it, is in Scripture commonly linked with faith.<a name=12:5></a> The necessity and fact of new birth is constantly spoken of in the word, and in Peter the gospel is said to be the word by which it is produced; but it still remains true that faith is the way of life, and this is of the highest moment, because, though a soul may not in believing be very intelligent as to the import and moral bearing of faith, it really means the receiving of Christ, and the consequent renunciation of self and the world.<a name=12:6></a> What is done administratively in the putting off the old man and putting on the new, is really effectuated morally in faith in Christ crucified and risen.<a name=12:7></a> A soul is thus committed to Christ, in principle owning that, as to its own condition, it is lost; and having thus been drawn of the Father to the Son, the Spirit is received, the power and witness of the state of life and blessing in Christ, into which it is brought.<a name=12:8></a> My impression is that it is in this way life is presented in Scripture; not so much as a deposit in the believer, though indeed Christ lives in him in the power of the Spirit, but as a state of blessing, whether in Christ in glory, or under Christ on the earth, into which a believer, conscious

		The employment of words in Scripture is an interesting subject of study.<a name=14:1></a> Words in common use amongst men, and recognised as conveying certain general ideas, are employed to communicate thoughts in connection with God, with the consequence that the revelation of God imparts to the words a peculiar force of meaning which is not found in dictionaries, and which can only be learnt from Scripture itself.<a name=14:2></a> A word of this kind is 'piety'.<a name=14:3></a> It appears in the Authorised Version only in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:4">1 Timothy  5:4</a>, the original being in other cases rendered 'godliness'.<a name=14:4></a> Piety, however, unquestionably conveys more correctly the idea.<a name=14:5></a> The Scripture employment of the term has one point in common with the dictionaries, in that it refers it both to God and to parents.<a name=14:6></a> The dictionaries differ among themselves, some explaining it as bearing (reverence, respect, etc.<a name=14:7></a>), and others as discharge of duty, conduct, etc.<a name=14:8></a> The object of the present paper is to seek to present the force with which the word is used in Scripture.<a name=14:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is doubtful if its precise equivalent is to be found in the Hebrew scriptures -- the expressions which most nearly approach it being probably the word commonly rendered 'fear' of the Lord (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111:10">Psalm  111:10</a>; <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#1:7">Proverbs  1:7</a>), when speaking of a quality, and that translated 'saints', or 'godly' (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#4:3">Psalm  4:3</a>, etc.<a name=14:10></a>), when referring to a class of persons.<a name=14:11></a> In the New Testament the expression is in two instances applied to persons not as yet in the enjoyment of Christian privileges.<a name=14:12></a> (See <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:2">Acts  10:2</a> - 7)

		As piety is presented in the first epistle to Timothy as the antidote to different forms of evil which the apostle by the Spirit foresaw would corrupt Christianity,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=15>[Page 15]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is important to ascertain what is intended to be conveyed by it.<a name=15:1></a> At the outset then I would say, it is a quality generated in the heart by the sense of benefits received from one rightly entitled to reverence and affections.<a name=15:2></a> It would hardly be an obligation on the part of parents to show piety towards their children, or masters towards their slaves; the converse would hold good.<a name=15:3></a> Piety is not like faith.<a name=15:4></a> The latter is the reception for once and for all of a divine testimony, or the substantiation of things hoped for and conviction of things not seen.<a name=15:5></a> Piety is rather a growth in the heart, stimulated by the knowledge of the goodness of the one who is its object.<a name=15:6></a> Practically it may perhaps be defined as the exercise of reverent affections in a spirit of grateful confidence.<a name=15:7></a> It brings the comfort of the knowledge of God into present things, supporting in endurance, and tends to that quietness and rest of spirit which leave the mind free to find its occupation in the things of faith.<a name=15:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having thus given the general idea, I proceed to show how piety is presented in detail in the epistles, as opposed to the forms of evil anticipated by the apostles.<a name=15:9></a> The first of these is spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4">1 Timothy  4</a>.<a name=15:10></a> It is not looked at as universal, but 'some' would in the latter times depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats.<a name=15:11></a> I suppose that the end proposed by such commandments was, by depriving the body, to attain the subjugation of evil.<a name=15:12></a> The practical result was to introduce a class of separatists, not in the power of the Spirit, the remains of which may be seen to this day in popery and the like.<a name=15:13></a> However plausible the end proposed, the means by which it was to be reached were very bad.<a name=15:14></a> In addition to the legality involved, there was a still greater evil in the slight thus cast on the beneficent provision of God for the creature.<a name=15:15></a> The Christian is still in the place of the creature, and whatever mercies

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God may have ordained for the creature are not to be refused, but received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.<a name=16:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in piety there was the recognition of this -- the confidence begotten by God's grace -- and hence it was the safeguard against these commandments which falsified the character of God.<a name=16:2></a> The blessed God who has bestowed the greater benefits does not withhold the lesser.<a name=16:3></a> There is, too, in piety that warmth and nurture of soul in which lies the secret of keeping in subjection the body.<a name=16:4></a> A well-nourished soul is the real security against unruliness of body.<a name=16:5></a> Hence Timothy is exhorted to exercise himself rather unto piety -- the range of its value being far greater than that of bodily exercise.<a name=16:6></a> The working of it is that instead of practising abstention in a legal way from mercies which are God's provision for the creature, the soul rests in the confidence of being specially the object of God's kindness and care, and finds piety profitable unto all things, having promise of life, of the present one, and of that to come.<a name=16:7></a> Thus reverent affections and happy confidence, perhaps amid labour and reproach, are set forward as against legality and asceticism, by the spirit of which souls would be withered.<a name=16:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if on the one hand, piety recognises God's beneficence even to all men, and accepts His mercies with thanksgiving, it refuses on the other, to run in the ways of the world, in pursuing present advantage, and so leaving the place of dependence on God.<a name=16:9></a> In this way it guards against another form of evil which has pervaded the church, and which, we learn from <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6">1 Timothy  6</a>, originated in heterodox teaching, and insubjection to wholesome words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=16:10></a> Wholesome words tend to health in the soul.<a name=16:11></a> If the Lord has said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you", it is a wholesome word, which should settle the whole question of "these

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		things" for the disciple.<a name=17:1></a> But where the spirit of self-will and insubjection wrought, there came in, not only questions and strifes of words, but a sense of the importance of worldly gain; and piety came to be regarded as a means to this end -- "holding gain to be the end of piety".<a name=17:2></a> Now the gain in piety is not prospective -- to be sought or schemed after -- but present.<a name=17:3></a> Piety with contentment is great gain, and for the simple reason that the soul has for its resource God and His goodness.<a name=17:4></a> It may be a question as regards ourselves whether there is not a deficiency in point of piety.<a name=17:5></a> In the midst of the influences of the world, we are seduced almost imperceptibly into walking in its ways, ordering our business and our homes according to man.<a name=17:6></a> Individually, our piety is our testimony, since it results not only in maintaining a path of separation from the world and its ways, but in bearing witness to those around that a living God is, to us at least, a blessed reality, and a resource as to present need.<a name=17:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I conclude with a remark or two as to the way in which piety is introduced in 2 Timothy and 2 Peter.<a name=17:8></a> In the former, the apostle refers to the state of evil which would be prevalent in the last days, when men would be marked by passions and evils as gross as had existed in heathenism.<a name=17:9></a> They would, however, have a form of piety, but denying its power.<a name=17:10></a> And the teachers and those that would exercise influence over weak and superstitious minds would arise out of this state of things.<a name=17:11></a> Thus, unbroken will and unsubdued passions, all the darkness of the human heart, might be covered by an exterior of affected humility and self-abnegation, which would gain a reputation for sanctity in the eyes of the uninstructed, but would be only piety in form, and not in spirit.<a name=17:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 2 Peter, piety is in one case coupled with life, and in another with holy conversation; and in the chain which is found in chapter 1: 5 - 7, piety follows endurance, as brotherly love follows piety.<a name=17:13></a> What I

		It is of all moment that we should first clearly understand the things which are distinctively characteristic of Christianity, and then see how they affect us in our pathway through the world.<a name=19:1></a> It is in this pathway that the faith of saints is practically tested.<a name=19:2></a> Many of us would like to find some unvarying rule by which, in the midst of church difficulties, to steer our way; while, as to circumstances, we should be well pleased to see, as another has said, a full supply for every need within our reach.<a name=19:3></a> Neither the one nor the other is at all likely to be the experience of saints if going on with God, since there would in either case be but little call for the exercise of <i>faith</i>, or of moral perception.<a name=19:4></a> The question then arises, Are we to be dismayed by the anticipation of troubles in the assembly, or of pressure in our individual path?<a name=19:5></a> What is the antidote?<a name=19:6></a> The answer is <i>confidence</i> -- and confidence is the effect of nearness, having its source in the knowledge of God: "I know whom I have believed".<a name=19:7></a> Nearness may be spoken of as the peculiar characteristic blessing of Christianity.<a name=19:8></a> Now that redemption has been accomplished, and Christ is exalted as Man to God's right hand, God has begun to effectuate the purposes of His will, and in this the heavenly takes precedence of the earthly.<a name=19:9></a>

		In John we find not only the manifestation on earth of the eternal life which was with the Father, but also the work of the Father who was seeking worshippers in spirit and in truth, and was drawing to the Son, that the Son might introduce those drawn to Him into the blessing and privilege of eternal life; and this not deferred, but present, though the communion of His death was essential to it.<a name=20:6></a> He that ate His flesh and drank His blood had eternal life.<a name=20:7></a> As He lived because of the Father, so he that ate Him would live because of Him.<a name=20:8></a> The place suitable to this was the Father's house, to which He would bring His own; but meantime the Comforter would come, and in that day they would know that Jesus was in the Father, and they in Him, and He in them.<a name=20:9></a>

		In the Hebrews we are on somewhat different ground, and it is important to remember that no shadow in the law contained the very image of Christian privilege.<a name=21:2></a> There we find that though believers have, as being incidentally a people of God on earth, a throne of grace, the calling is that they are sons, whom Christ is not ashamed to call brethren; and that, as a priestly company, they already have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, to serve the living God.<a name=21:3></a> We not only receive, as Israel will, the effect of Christ's death in forgiveness here, but we must go through that death into the marvellous light of God's presence, into which flesh has no entrance.<a name=21:4></a>

		In the presence of difficulties in the assembly, saints are often puzzled and overwhelmed by a cloud of writing and talk; what we need is to be so in the enjoyment of liberty with God, that we maintain confidence; the result is, that we instinctively gain a sense of what is according to God, and a moral judgment often of spirits as well as of words.<a name=22:3></a> The Lord had, as one may say, His intuitions from above (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:30">John  5:30</a>), and we have to try the spirits whether they are of God, because everything is not now to be trusted.<a name=22:4></a> The same spirit of confidence applies to difficulties in the individual path of saints.<a name=22:5></a> The secret of ability to endure is confidence in a living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and especially of them that believe -- a confidence that leaves all with God, in the sense that from the outset He has laid out all our pathway down here, having in view an end that is worthy of His goodness.<a name=22:6></a> There is no other secret of health and comfort in the soul of the saint, and it is in the liberty of nearness to God that this secret is learned.<a name=22:7></a>

		I want to dwell upon the first of these verses, and then to show you how the third verse connects itself with the first.<a name=26:3></a> "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".<a name=26:4></a> I desire to show what it is to know the Father, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, His sent One.<a name=26:5></a> I will speak a word or two at the end as to the capacity, but now I want to speak about what the blessing is in itself.<a name=26:6></a> The Lord prays these words (He speaks here as a divine Person): "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee".<a name=26:7></a> He, the Son, prays to be glorified, in order that He may glorify the Father.<a name=26:8></a> I wish that God might enable me to make plain, in some degree, the force and meaning of that verse.<a name=26:9></a> It is a very great verse.<a name=26:10></a> He was no longer to be here in humiliation: He prays to be taken out of humiliation; to be glorified, that He may glorify the Father.<a name=26:11></a> One word about the Father.<a name=26:12></a> It is a great thing to know the Father, to understand what God intends to convey to us by the name of the Father.<a name=26:13></a> There is nothing connected with the name of the Father in Scripture but pure grace.<a name=26:14></a> Scripture keeps every other thought apart from the name of the Father.<a name=26:15></a> There are things connected with the name of the Son that are not in connection with the Father's name.<a name=26:16></a> For instance, judgment is not connected with the Father's name, but is with the Son's, because He, as Son of man, has been humbled.<a name=26:17></a> I remember we were once pretty much taught that the Son was for us, and God, as Judge, against us; but Scripture brings before us a very different idea in connection with the name of the

		I do not think there is anyone who would not admit that we can recognise in the New Testament what might be called two parts in the ministry.<a name=37:1></a> Paul speaks of it distinctly; there was that which he ministered to those not established, and what he ministered to those who were 'perfect'; he did not minister to the unestablished what he ministered to those who were 'perfect'.<a name=37:2></a> "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect", whatever the word 'perfect' may mean; I do not go into that now.<a name=37:3></a> One point distinguishes one part of this ministry (I do not quite like to speak here of ministries) from the other; namely, that what he ministered to the perfect were "the deep things of God"; what we are accustomed to understand by that is, that he ministered to them the counsels of God, the things God has purposed for His own glory -- our glory, too, as far as that goes.<a name=37:4></a> In connection with that he brings forward the subject, not of what saints <i>had</i>, but of what they <i>were</i>.<a name=37:5></a> The condition of a vast number of souls is, that they need to understand deliverance; they do not apprehend the meaning and power of the work of Christ as deliverance.<a name=37:6></a> They know it as justification, but I do not think they know it as deliverance.<a name=37:7></a> So long as they are in that state, I do not doubt the apostle would talk to them, and we ought to do the same, of what they <i>have</i>; but with the others, the 'perfect', it is what they <i>are</i>.<a name=37:8></a> When I come to God's purposes, and look at saints in reference to those purposes, it is no longer a question of what saints have, but of what they are in relation to them.<a name=37:9></a> In Ephesians it is, "May grow up to him in all things".<a name=37:10></a> That is not what I have, but what I am.<a name=37:11></a> Growth is in what I am for God.<a name=37:12></a> "Holding the truth in love", and so on.<a name=37:13></a> I think, in

		It is a blessed thing to go to the Father in liberty.<a name=42:12></a> I am bent upon one thing; I do not want to do the best I can for myself in this world; in fact, I do not care so very much about this world, but I do care that the Son should fill me, that He should be promoted in saints.<a name=42:13></a> I want Him to displace everything in me that is not of Himself.<a name=42:14></a> It is practically "as the truth is in Jesus".<a name=42:15></a> The "having put off .<a name=42:16></a>.<a name=42:17></a>.<a name=42:18></a> the old man .<a name=42:19></a>.<a name=42:20></a>.<a name=42:21></a> and your having put on the new man".<a name=42:22></a> There is the displacing of the one thing to make space for the other.<a name=42:23></a> The great point is, that the Son should be promoted in me, and the same in every other saint of God.<a name=42:24></a>

		THE DEATH OF THE LORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 Corinthians
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been observed that in the first epistle to the Corinthians the apostle reverts continually to the death of Christ, while in the second epistle, the glory of the Lord seems to be that which is occupying his soul, and is the standpoint from which he speaks.<a name=44:1></a> It is quite remarkable how the death of Christ is interwoven in the treatment of each succeeding subject in the first epistle; and it would seem that, in the application of that death to the Christian conscience, a sort of progress is observable; and this it is desired, with the Lord's help, to bring under notice.<a name=44:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that there were many things in the state of the Corinthians calling for correction, and these defects are in general dealt with by pointing out their inconsistency with the death of the Lord, which is to the Christian the test of things, whether in himself or in the world.<a name=44:3></a> Further, there can be little doubt that the levity with which the death of the Lord was regarded, accounted in some degree for the toleration amongst them of some who denied resurrection.<a name=44:4></a> For had they entered into the varied import of Christ's death, they must have apprehended the necessary consequence (morally) of Christ's resurrection; and the resurrection of Christ is the pledge of the resurrection of saints, as well as of the judgment of all men.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle begins in reference to the schisms existing at Corinth, and the tendency to attach importance to men and to human wisdom.<a name=44:6></a> He recalls the great, and one might almost say, exclusive, subject of his testimony among them -- Christ crucified.<a name=44:7></a> The great groundwork laid by God had been, that in sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He had condemned sin in the flesh; man's state as in the flesh -- the old man -- had in the cross been brought to an end judicially before God.<a name=45:1></a> While this is the foundation of grace, it at the same time declares that man is good for nought, whether for wisdom or for righteousness.<a name=45:2></a> Hence the folly of glorying in men.<a name=45:3></a> The want of apprehension on the part of the Corinthians of the import of the cross of Christ, hindered the apostle unfolding to them the hidden wisdom of God.<a name=45:4></a> But the defect had not been in the testimony presented.<a name=45:5></a> Many a Christian accepts Christ's death as the ground of forgiveness, who knows little of its meaning as the judgment of the flesh and the world system with it.<a name=45:6></a> Still the testimony presented had left no room, nor given any excuse, for the exaltation of men.<a name=45:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to pass on to the next reference to the death of Christ, which is found in chapter 5.<a name=45:8></a> Here the question is as to the character of the assembly, and so of each member in it.<a name=45:9></a> The assembly were the people of God at Corinth, and Christ their passover had been sacrificed for them, and this was to become the test of their state.<a name=45:10></a> They could not connect the passover and the old leaven.<a name=45:11></a> They must be in suitability to it -- must, as a redeemed people, keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name=45:12></a> This is to characterise us during the complete period of our sojourn here, for we must remember, that the things typified by institutions of periodical recurrence under the law, are to the Christian constant and characteristic.<a name=45:13></a> We see thus that, as the cross of Christ was the cutting down of man in his pretensions, so that we should not glory in men, the sacrifice of Christ is the test of character in a redeemed people.<a name=45:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next distinct allusion to the death of Christ is found at the close of the subject treated in chapters 8 - 10.<a name=45:15></a> The question raised was as to the liberty of a Christian to perform an act, or to enter into an association
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that might be construed by others into an acknowledgement of idols.<a name=46:1></a> The apostle, while maintaining Christian liberty, in his conclusion enjoins the most rigid withdrawal from idolatry.<a name=46:2></a> He speaks to the saints as to wise men, and presses on their attention that the cup of blessing which they blessed and the bread they broke, was the fellowship of the death of Christ.<a name=46:3></a> He does not speak here of the position which a Christian occupies as having been committed to Christ's death in baptism, but of the habitual participation of that in which Christ's death is symbolised, and in which act, intelligent appreciation of, and delight in that death, are expressed by each and by all -- the fellowship of the saints, as one body in the death of Christ.<a name=46:4></a> This made evident the impossibility of fellowship with anything that was an object of worship in Satan's world, a system which includes many things venerated by men.<a name=46:5></a> The Lord who had died would have no part with Satan, nor allow His people to raise any such question between Himself and Satan.<a name=46:6></a> We see then that Christ's death is the true test of objects here that claim the homage of men.<a name=46:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, in chapters 11 to 14 we have the correction of disorder in the assembly as convened, and the first point has reference to the Lord's supper.<a name=46:8></a> Here it is that the Lord's death is brought in in the most touching way.<a name=46:9></a> The commemoration of it, according to the order of this scripture, appears to be the introduction to spiritual exercises and manifestations in the assembly; and lightness in this commemoration is wholly unsuitable.<a name=46:10></a> The failing, in eating, to discern the Lord's body, arising from lack of self-judgment, brought in chastisement.<a name=46:11></a> The spring of becoming conduct in the assembly is suitability in spirit to the Lord's death, and the first occupation there, is remembrance of Him in death, the affections responding to the love manifested in the giving up of His life for us.<a name=46:12></a> This is indeed a suitable prelude to the exercise of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		gifts in love to, and desire for, the edifying of His members here.<a name=47:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To sum up, we have seen that the death of Christ is the test of human pretensions, of character, of associations, and of fitness in the assembly.<a name=47:2></a> It forbids the exaltation of man, and the allowance of the old leaven in the saints.<a name=47:3></a> It demands rigid separation in the whole body from idolatrous associations in Satan's world, and calls for self-judgment on the part of all in the assembly as gathered.<a name=47:4></a> Saints are to bear the impress of it in every circumstance.<a name=47:5></a> In every sphere, and in all its ways the assembly is to be free from conformity to man.<a name=47:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A word is added, in conclusion, on a point already indicated.<a name=47:7></a> It must be admitted, that any person having any degree of spiritual apprehension of the reality and meaning of Christ's death, would be impressed with the necessary sequence of His resurrection.<a name=47:8></a> He must be the first to rise from the dead; and once the truth of His resurrection is accepted, there is little difficulty as to the resurrection of the saints.<a name=47:9></a> This is the line of argument in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, and we may conclude that lack of conformity in the Corinthians to Christ's death was the secret of the allowance among them of a denial of resurrection.<a name=47:10></a> Saints are established in the faith of the latter, in having in their souls the solemn and practical bearing of the former.<a name=47:11></a>

		We have seen, in a previous paper, how, in the first epistle, the death of the Lord is continually introduced as being, for a Christian, the test of everything here; and this must indeed be so, seeing that it is the one point where truth as to everything has been absolutely expressed.<a name=48:10></a> The exaltation of man on earth and fleshly leaven in the saints are rebuked by it.<a name=48:11></a> In the second epistle we have the great idea presented to us of the glory of the Lord as the standard, and conformity to that glory as the end now for man.<a name=48:12></a> This is, manifestly, a completely new order of things for man.<a name=48:13></a>

		Instead of there coming from the place of God a demand on man for righteousness, there was the ministration, as from God by Christ, in effective power, of the Spirit and righteousness of that which fitted and qualified man for God Himself in His own place -- that which is embodied and expressed in the last Adam, the quickening Spirit -- and the result is that the believer, having received all from there, can look at the glory of the Lord and be conformed to it in moral and increasing superiority to all here.<a name=49:2></a> That glory is connected in his thoughts with grace, and not with law, with giving instead of demanding.<a name=49:3></a> God is known in a new way, as Jesus said to the woman of Samaria, "If thou knewest the gift (giving) of God".<a name=49:4></a>

		Now in the glory of the Lord there is, as in the glory in the face of Moses, the witness and proof of the divine origin of the covenant; and hence the apostle made no secret of this glory.<a name=49:5></a> He obscured it neither in walk nor word.<a name=49:6></a> If his gospel was veiled, it was veiled in them that were lost.<a name=49:7></a> If we would understand the nature of the ministry, we need to be instructed as to the glory of Christ: that glory is, in truth, its sanction.<a name=49:8></a> All has to be learnt in what has been effected in Christ, and this is the substance of the testimony.<a name=49:9></a> In Him, man has been taken from the lowest place (sin having been put away, and God glorified) and exalted to the very highest.<a name=49:10></a> Christ has been exalted far above all heavens, to fill all things.<a name=49:11></a> He has secured for man a heavenly order and place, and Himself rests in it.<a name=49:12></a> He is the image there of God.<a name=49:13></a> The Holy Spirit has come to bring report of His glory, and works here in power by gifts for the deliverance of man and for forming him according to Christ.<a name=49:14></a> Further, in this

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two other points that come before us in this connection.<a name=50:11></a> First of these, are the motives that were effective in the apostle to maintain him suitably in this ministry.<a name=50:12></a> If God wrought specially by him in the introduction of this era of heavenly blessing, it had to be made manifest that the power was of God.<a name=50:13></a> The vessel must be broken, that the light might shine out.<a name=50:14></a> The apostle had to be practically divested of all sense of human competency, and set free from the influence of worldly motives, to be the instrument in carrying out this ministry.<a name=50:15></a> He must be independent of every influence, and of all fear of consequences, carrying his life in his hand, confident in every condition.<a name=50:16></a> We see how all this was effected and maintained in him by the power and grace of God.<a name=50:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, in dealing with men, he must himself be alive to the realities which men have to face, so as to be in a condition to persuade men.<a name=50:18></a> He had to deal, practically, with consciences and hearts -- the moral

		elements in man.<a name=51:1></a> If men were to find in Christ their life and righteousness before God, it could not be without exercise of conscience.<a name=51:2></a> They had to be brought under the fear of the Lord, and to a sense of their state of alienation from God.<a name=51:3></a> Here was the point where the apostle was brought, practically, into contact with the moral elements and necessities in man, persuading and beseeching.<a name=51:4></a> Not only bearing testimony of the blessings existing for man in a glorified Christ, but dealing with men in reference to their state, beseeching them to be reconciled to God.<a name=51:5></a> At the same time announcing to them the great groundwork of this ministry of reconciliation, in that God had made Him, that knew no sin, to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=51:6></a> Thus we find, that underneath the fact of Christ having been made sin, lay the wonderful conception of divine grace, that men, once wholly controlled and characterised by sin, should become the expression of this divine righteousness before the heavenly principalities through all eternity, and should be made His God's delight as regards righteousness.<a name=51:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are the glad tidings of the glory of Christ, the blessed answer, to His having been made sin, and the pledge and assurance of what is in Him for man, through grace, and ministered through the inspired word of the apostle.<a name=51:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to bring before you is the way in which God has seen fit to present Himself to us in respect of His purpose.<a name=52:1></a> This is a point of moment, especially at a time when Christianity is in decay in this world.<a name=52:2></a> The house of God has been corrupted in the hand of man, and has become a great house.<a name=52:3></a> The grace of God has been neutralised to a large extent in Christendom by mixing gospel and law.<a name=52:4></a> But if this is recognised in the soul, the point for us is to fall back on the purpose of God, for it is impossible that God can be diverted from His purpose.<a name=52:5></a> Behind the testimony in the early days of Christianity, God had His purposes.<a name=52:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, the Lord gives the apostles their commission: "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=52:7></a> That was the testimony in which God saw fit to approach man.<a name=52:8></a> Forgiveness of sins and inheritance are the two terms of God's testimony.<a name=52:9></a> But behind this testimony, God was setting to work to accomplish the counsel of His will.<a name=52:10></a> The name of God was blasphemed through Israel, but God will accomplish His purpose in Israel.<a name=52:11></a> The name of God may be blasphemed -- and is largely blasphemed -- through Christianity, but God will surely accomplish His purpose in Christianity.<a name=52:12></a> He cannot be diverted from it; and therefore, in a day of ruin like that in which our lot is cast, it is highly important, for the establishment of our souls, that we should enter into the apprehension of the purpose of God.<a name=52:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when God speaks of His purpose, you commonly get the expression in Scripture, "in Christ Jesus".<a name=52:14></a> Christ Jesus is the vessel of God's purpose.<a name=52:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Anyone can readily see the difference in speaking of Christ as Lord and Saviour, and the presentation of Him to us as the vessel of God's purpose -- the expression and revelation of it.<a name=53:1></a> It is a wonderful thing that God has made His counsel known to us, His counsel in a living Man.<a name=53:2></a> You could not learn it simply by reading the scripture; it is made known to us in a living, glorified Man.<a name=53:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every promise of God is in Christ Jesus, and He is presented to us so that our hearts may receive instruction in the counsel of God.<a name=53:4></a> All will see the importance of being instructed of God.<a name=53:5></a> If I saw what God's purpose is concerning me, I would not desire to thwart it or to hinder it; I cannot further it; but I think it is very possible to hinder its effectuality in one's own soul.<a name=53:6></a> The Galatians had begun in the Spirit, and now the apostle had to say to them, "Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?<a name=53:7></a>" What is the truth?<a name=53:8></a> The truth is the expression of God's will.<a name=53:9></a> We have the letter of the truth in Scripture, but the Spirit is the Spirit of the truth.<a name=53:10></a> It is a most important thing for us to know the truth; the Lord said to the Jews, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free".<a name=53:11></a> When you get an insight into the counsel of God, and all that is contained in His will, the practical result in you is that you are brought into liberty, and then your anxiety will be not to thwart His purpose.<a name=53:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope that you will take in the thought I have referred to, namely, that when God speaks to us as to His purpose, you get the expression, "in Christ Jesus".<a name=53:13></a> It occurs two or three times in this chapter.<a name=53:14></a> One instance of it is in verse 14: "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ"; and again, "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=53:15></a>

		What we get in this chapter (I am only going to dwell on two points in it) is the blessing of Abraham that in Christ Jesus has come to the Gentiles, and sonship -- in other words, things old and new.<a name=54:10></a> There are certain things in Christianity which are new, that never were revealed before; but there are also things which are taken up from the Old Testament.<a name=54:11></a> The Lord Jesus said to His disciples in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, after He had spoken all the parables recorded there, "Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old" (verse 52).<a name=54:12></a> If I speak about the blessing of Abraham, that is not new.<a name=54:13></a> I will tell you what <i>is</i> new about it, that is the way in which it has reached the Gentiles.<a name=54:14></a> But the blessing of Abraham was not in itself new.<a name=54:15></a> But when you come to the truth of sonship at the close of the chapter, that is new.<a name=54:16></a> Sonship never could come to light until Christ came.<a name=54:17></a> Paul says about

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the blessing of Abraham reaching the Gentiles, I will first endeavour to tell you what the blessing of Abraham was.<a name=55:8></a> In fact it is stated here "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness".<a name=55:9></a> In believing God, in the eye of God, Abraham disappeared.<a name=55:10></a> He disappeared from the position in which he was as a man in this world, under death, but, on the other hand, he was approved of God; God took account of him for another world.<a name=55:11></a> He believed God.<a name=55:12></a> But do you think that God was going to endorse anything in Abraham?<a name=55:13></a> Not at all.<a name=55:14></a> In faith he was gone; but there was the other side of it; God counted his faith to him for righteousness.<a name=55:15></a> That has never come into effect yet.<a name=55:16></a> It will do so in another scene.<a name=55:17></a> Christ said, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad", and in the day of Christ, God's reckoning of Abraham will come to light.<a name=55:18></a> God accounted it to him for righteousness, but though he had this reckoning from

		God, yet as to himself, looked at as a man in this world, Abraham disappeared.<a name=56:1></a> That is, I judge, the principle underlying it, and, in fact, you could not come into blessing in any other way.<a name=56:2></a> Take a Jew in this world, under the curse of a broken law, and the judgment of death.<a name=56:3></a> The law was the ministration of death; it made matters worse, it added the curse to death.<a name=56:4></a> Man was already under death, and the law came and added the curse.<a name=56:5></a> This was a terrible position for man to be in; how was man to escape it?<a name=56:6></a> That man must disappear.<a name=56:7></a> Abraham disappears, but he reappears, according to the reckoning of God.<a name=56:8></a> I do not doubt but that is God's way; it is the way in which, by faith, we pass out of the judgment of death and the curse.<a name=56:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now, as to the way in which the blessing has reached the Gentiles.<a name=56:10></a> It is in Christ Jesus; "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith".<a name=56:11></a> The Son of God became Man, He accepted the place of the curse, and entered into the judgment according to God.<a name=56:12></a> This was according to the will of God.<a name=56:13></a> He says, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God", and in the accomplishment of the will of God He disappears as after the flesh in death.<a name=56:14></a> Christ died, but He reappeared in resurrection, not after the flesh, but according to the power of God.<a name=56:15></a> He left death and the curse behind, and He reappeared as the communicator of the Spirit.<a name=56:16></a> He comes out as the Last Adam and the Second Man.<a name=56:17></a> Death and the curse were in our cup, but Christ took the cup; He died out of the state to which it belonged, but He reappeared in the power of God's victory, and as a life-giving Spirit to men.<a name=56:18></a> Christ is marked out in John's gospel as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the same principle is true in regard of us.<a name=57:2></a> God communicates to the believer the gift of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the proof that, as after the flesh, you have disappeared from under the eyes of God.<a name=57:3></a> It is on that ground alone that God could communicate the Spirit.<a name=57:4></a> "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you".<a name=57:5></a> The history of the flesh, in this sense, has for God's glory been closed up in the death of Christ in order that Christ might communicate the Spirit to men.<a name=57:6></a> But what I feel is that, though we have received the Spirit, it is a long time before we understand that we have disappeared as after the flesh.<a name=57:7></a> We have each to learn that in its own proper way, and this takes us a long time.<a name=57:8></a> As a matter of fact, you may be sure that you disappeared after the flesh in the eye of God before God ever communicated the Spirit to you.<a name=57:9></a> It was really in the death of Christ; but when it comes to the question of what is true as regards our consciousness, it is a long time before we come to that point.<a name=57:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you do come to it, you are brought into Christian liberty.<a name=57:11></a> The Holy Spirit is the witness on God's part to the Christian that he has disappeared after the flesh, but what is true in God's eye is a very different thing from what is true in our eye.<a name=57:12></a> God has arrived at the truth from His side, but we have to arrive at it, beloved friends, from our side.<a name=57:13></a> I do not think that you get practically free of the flesh until you have first learned what the flesh is; in the same way, you do not get free from sin until you have learnt what sin is; but you would never learn these lessons if God had not given you the Holy Spirit.<a name=57:14></a> And when in the goodness of God we have learnt that, as after the flesh and as under judgment, death and the curse, we have disappeared, then we have reached the point where God began.<a name=57:15></a>

		Now, take the case of the Galatians.<a name=58:1></a> They had begun in the Spirit, the apostle takes them up on that ground.<a name=58:2></a> They had believed God's testimony, and God had imparted to them the gift of the Spirit, but they had not learnt that they had disappeared from the place of men under the curse.<a name=58:3></a> If they had, do you think they would have put themselves afresh under the law?<a name=58:4></a> Who would be such a madman as that?<a name=58:5></a> The fact is, they had not entered into the truth.<a name=58:6></a> The practical working of the truth in the soul is this, that, as regards this scene, I am content to disappear; I have been buried.<a name=58:7></a> Our righteousness and acceptance with God belongs to another scene, another world.<a name=58:8></a> In this scene of sin, the true path for the Christian is to get out of sight.<a name=58:9></a> You were out of sight in God's eye as after the flesh when God communicated to you the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=58:10></a>

		I think you will see the importance of understanding this principle which has been verified in Christ, that is, of passing out of sight as under the judgment and curse, and reappearing as the recipients of the Spirit.<a name=58:14></a> We have disappeared as in one life, but have reappeared in another.<a name=58:15></a> The blessing of Abraham has come on the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<a name=58:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have been speaking about hitherto, are "things old" -- the blessing of Abraham, and that side of things.<a name=58:17></a> The promise of blessing was first made to Abraham: "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed", and afterwards confirmed to the seed of Abraham in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>.<a name=58:18></a> The same promise was made: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the New Testament the truth comes to light that the seed of Abraham was the Son of God, and that brings in the things "new".<a name=59:3></a> You could hardly have learnt <i>that</i> in the Old Testament; when we read the Old Testament in the light of the New, we see many things much more clearly.<a name=59:4></a> The fact is, I have sometimes thought that one might put the New Testament before the Old, for it is in the light of the New Testament that you understand the Old.<a name=59:5></a> The prophets did not understand the prophecies; it is <i>we</i> who understand them.<a name=59:6></a> The Old Testament scriptures were not written for the contemporaries.<a name=59:7></a> Christianity is the real beginning for God.<a name=59:8></a> I quite admit that God had taken a people provisionally, but as to the accomplishment of God's counsels, the beginning was Christ, and the continuation of Christ is Christianity.<a name=59:9></a> We have come to the consummation of the ages and the starting-point is at the end of testing.<a name=59:10></a> God has set to work to accomplish the counsel of His will.<a name=59:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I said before, Christ Jesus is not only the Seed of Abraham, but the Son of God.<a name=59:12></a> We read in verse 24, "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.<a name=59:13></a> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.<a name=59:14></a> For ye are all the children (or sons) of God, by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=59:15></a> For as many of you as have been baptised unto Christ have put on Christ.<a name=59:16></a> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.<a name=59:17></a> And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise".<a name=59:18></a> Now, I think this, that the expression "in Christ Jesus" invariably refers to Christ in resurrection.<a name=59:19></a>

		WHAT IS TRUTH?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think this is a legitimate and important subject of inquiry -- and the more so as by the inquiry we are enabled to apprehend what sin is in principle.<a name=65:1></a> It is certain that in the coming of the Son of God into the world, the two great forces that were in conflict were the truth and sin.<a name=65:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before going further into the subject, it may perhaps be assumed, that truth is, on the one side, the setting forth and expression of what is of God, and therefore in nature divine, and, on the other, the consistency of the creature morally with the position in which God has set it.<a name=65:3></a> It is evident that on the latter side only could sin come in, and consequently sin can never be co-extensive with truth.<a name=65:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Christ we see the perfect realisation of truth.<a name=65:5></a> He is the truth.<a name=65:6></a> In Him has been fully set forth what is of God in nature and character before men; and at the same time, He has maintained before God, in true moral suitability, every position which as Man He was content to occupy in His presence.<a name=65:7></a> He set the Lord always before Him.<a name=65:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of God, as such, it is said He is true; but not that He is the truth.<a name=65:9></a> In the Son is the expression -- He is the Word.<a name=65:10></a> Hence it is not difficult to see that Christ is the test of everything.<a name=65:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now sin in its fullest character and development sets itself to oppose and resist the truth.<a name=65:12></a> Had not Christ come and spoken to the Jews, they had not had sin, and the logical conclusion of this resistance of the truth is, that the man of sin takes advantage of the rejection of Christ to show himself as God.<a name=65:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The beginning of sin was, I judge, when the creature turned to itself as an object, and so ceased to have God as such.<a name=65:14></a> It departed from God.<a name=65:15></a> That is first

	<div class="paragraph">
		seen in the devil, who sins from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.<a name=66:1></a> He first became enamoured of his own beauty, and puffed up, and afterwards, as it seems to me, coveted a position that God had given to man (as head and centre of a system) and had not given to an angel.<a name=66:2></a> Morally, Satan ceased to be in the truth of the creature.<a name=66:3></a> His position he could not change, but was no longer in moral accordance with it.<a name=66:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same may be said of man.<a name=66:5></a> Being tempted, he sought to be as God, knowing good and evil.<a name=66:6></a> He, too, became an object to himself; self came in, and sought elevation, and he ceased to be in moral consistency with the position of the creature, though he could not alter that position.<a name=66:7></a> He stood not in the truth.<a name=66:8></a> The climax, as we have seen, is in the man of sin, the son of perdition.<a name=66:9></a> Backed up by Satan and worldly power, he opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God, or worshipped, and sets himself in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.<a name=66:10></a> He virtually says there is no God in the heavens, and man on earth is God.<a name=66:11></a> He has truly become an object to himself, and would be to others.<a name=66:12></a> He has wholly ceased to be in the truth of his position as a creature.<a name=66:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now sin being such, and working in this way, it is evident that it must ever resist the truth, since in the truth there is the setting forth, not only of what God is in His blessed nature, but of what the creature should be before God.<a name=66:14></a> As we have seen, all this is found in Christ, and, in taking away the sin of the world, He Himself comes in as the truth.<a name=66:15></a> But this must be gone into a little more in detail.<a name=66:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God has come forth, become Man, not only full of grace and truth, but Himself the truth.<a name=66:17></a> This seems to point to a wholly new order of things in the universe, in that everything, instead of standing on its own footing of responsibility, will be established in and maintained by Christ.<a name=66:18></a> The first great step in this is in His having become Man.<a name=66:19></a> Though truly God,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=67>[Page 67]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and ever expressing here what was of God; yet, having come into the position of the creature, He never ceased to be in moral suitability to the position He had taken.<a name=67:1></a> Perfect God-ward, in love, dependence, and confidence, He pleased not Himself.<a name=67:2></a> And all this comes out most distinctly in His death.<a name=67:3></a> In obedience He laid down a life in which sin had no place, and on which death had no claim; but was in suffering in perfect moral accordance with the character of God, though made sin that He might remove it from before God, and be Himself eternally separated from it, that He might in result take away the sin of the world, so that there might be a new creation in those that had been of the old.<a name=67:4></a> Hence we have sin removed, while Christ abides, the truth.<a name=67:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We arrive now at this point, that all is shut up in Christ.<a name=67:6></a> In Him alone is the eternal security of blessing -- since in Him, not only is God's nature displayed, but everything, every position in heaven or on earth, is headed up in Him in whom it will be set forth suitably to the character of God who created it.<a name=67:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence in the millennium it is not so much man, as Christ, that comes into view.<a name=67:8></a> He, so to speak, covers all.<a name=67:9></a> All is secured and maintained in Him.<a name=67:10></a> He fills all in all.<a name=67:11></a> It is of moment to see how everything, law, old covenant, flesh, old creation, the world, have all been brought to an end before God in Christ, and that He remains who is to fill all in all.<a name=67:12></a> He is the new starting-point, in whose death the true judgment of God has been expressed in regard to everything, while He Himself, as Man, is the truth, the expression of what is according to God's mind as to everything, be it man, Israel, or what not.<a name=67:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christians are of the truth, having part in the new man, which, after God, is created in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=67:14></a> This is, of course, looking at them abstractly as in Christ, born of God.<a name=67:15></a> In this sense they cannot sin, being the offspring of truth,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and not simply being responsible to abide in the truth; nothing can come from them but what is of the truth.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to practically abiding in the truth, it is a question of grace, and faith that finds its delights and enjoyments in all that Christ is, so that we are maintained under the power of what is of God and divine, and morally in keeping with it.<a name=68:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The above is but a very bare and brief sketch of the subject, but may be of interest as opening up in measure how completely sin is to be displaced, and how in its place we have, in the coming in of Christ, the expression on the one side of what is divine, and blessed, because it is divine; and on the other, the maintenance and security of every position which God has created; the perfect triumph of truth over all.<a name=68:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read this scripture with the thought of bringing before you something of the great principles of God's ways.<a name=69:1></a> These come out clearly and prominently at particular moments, but they were always with God, they were not new.<a name=69:2></a> You have to distinguish thus between the particular occasions when certain things come to pass, and the principles which are enunciated in these things.<a name=69:3></a> Every promise of God is Yea and Amen in Christ.<a name=69:4></a> He is the Yea and the Amen, but the promises of God were in His mind always.<a name=69:5></a> The promises of God are scattered in detail over the Word, but they form part of the scheme and principle of promise.<a name=69:6></a> God may speak about certain things to Abraham, and about other things to David, but all the things of which God speaks form one whole -- they are not fragments and detached, having no connection.<a name=69:7></a> And the scheme of promises was complete when God brought to light the truth of the church.<a name=69:8></a> The church, though not a promise, was, in a certain sense, the completion of all; there were no more promises to come out; God has revealed all, and the church is the crowning stone in the edifice of grace.<a name=69:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not my purpose now to go into the promises of God; I only referred to them as to the principles pervading them.<a name=69:10></a> There are two great principles expressed in the passage I read, which are of all moment for us to understand; they are the Cross and New Creation.<a name=69:11></a> These two principles are testified in Christ.<a name=69:12></a> So the apostle lays, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>, a great deal of stress on the preaching of the cross; it was God's wisdom and God's power.<a name=69:13></a> And later on you get another thought, "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus".<a name=69:14></a> That is the other side of the truth.<a name=69:15></a> One side of the

		I want to speak a little about the cross as the power of God and the wisdom of God, to show what it was in the purpose of God to effect by the cross, and more than that, what God <i>has</i> effected by the cross.<a name=70:4></a> I do not mean exactly in the way of the salvation of souls, but as the public testimony of God in the world.<a name=70:5></a> Its power is greatly hindered at the present time by the state of Christendom; the enemy has come in to thwart the testimony -- and he has succeeded only too well -- by corrupting Christianity.<a name=70:6></a> It is, however, important to see what it was in the purpose of God to overturn by the testimony of the cross.<a name=70:7></a> Anyone acquainted with the history of the world knows very well that Judaism on the one hand, and philosophy on the other, were both overturned by the testimony of the cross.<a name=70:8></a> It was light expelling darkness.<a name=70:9></a> It was in the purpose of God to do this.<a name=70:10></a> No doubt they have reared their heads again, but that is because the enemy has succeeded in corrupting Christianity.<a name=70:11></a> As long as the testimony of the cross was maintained here according to God, it effected what God intended it should effect; it overturned every pretension to light that existed, and God intended that it should do so.<a name=70:12></a>

		The thought of the "power of God" in this chapter is that of a sign of God's intervention.<a name=70:13></a> The Jew looked for a sign, and the Greek sought after wisdom.<a name=70:14></a> The Jew demanded a sign; it was so when the Lord was here, they asked for a sign.<a name=70:15></a> I suppose they thought themselves entitled to it; one would judge so from their language.<a name=70:16></a> A sign was the evidence of

		<a name=71>[Page 71]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		divine intervention, like the manna in the wilderness.<a name=71:1></a> On the other hand, the Greeks sought after wisdom.<a name=71:2></a> The force of the word 'wisdom' I understand to be <i>resource</i>; that is, I think, the prominent idea in Scripture in the thought of divine wisdom.<a name=71:3></a> Now the point is this, that the cross was both the power and the wisdom of God.<a name=71:4></a> It was the sign of God's intervention, and, on the other hand, it was the resource of God, and why?<a name=71:5></a> Because it was the divine means of saving souls.<a name=71:6></a> The power of God in the cross was to subdue man, and the wisdom of God was to enlighten man; that is, that man was to be enlightened by what came out in the cross.<a name=71:7></a> The cross was thus the resource of God.<a name=71:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there are two aspects of the truth of the cross; there is the divine and the human side.<a name=71:9></a> I am not now speaking of the hand that wicked men had in it, but of what the cross was according to the thought of God.<a name=71:10></a> I am regarding it as being wholly of God.<a name=71:11></a> Christ <i>was</i> crucified by wicked men, but it was not the work of wicked men that accomplished redemption.<a name=71:12></a> The cross was the divine way of accomplishing redemption.<a name=71:13></a> The passage I read does not refer to the work of wicked men at all.<a name=71:14></a> Peter, when preaching on the day of Pentecost, spoke of the part that wicked men had in the death of Christ, and you can understand this, for the Jews to whom he spoke had crucified Christ, and Peter was seeking to reach their conscience.<a name=71:15></a> But the apostle Paul looks at the cross as entirely the work of God.<a name=71:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the two aspects I spoke of, I think one is the human side, and the other the divine.<a name=71:17></a> One side was the demonstration of what man was as before God.<a name=71:18></a> In the ways of God it was ordered that there should be such a demonstration.<a name=71:19></a> Christ entered into man's place.<a name=71:20></a> Even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that was not a question of wicked men, but of divine necessity.<a name=71:21></a> It was necessary, for the glory of God,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that there should be a demonstration before God of the true position of man.<a name=72:1></a> In the cross, an expression which you get in the law, was fully exemplified: "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree".<a name=72:2></a> The curse had to do with a broken law.<a name=72:3></a> The effect of the law on man was that he came under the curse, though he was under death before.<a name=72:4></a> The law was the ministration of death, God never intended that the people were to have life by the law.<a name=72:5></a> No law was given able to quicken.<a name=72:6></a> The law said, "This do and thou shalt live", but in the divine mind the law was the ministry of condemnation and of death, and death and the condemnation must have been there to be ministered.<a name=72:7></a> But the law added this, that those who were under it and did not continue in all things written in the book of the law, came under the curse.<a name=72:8></a> Now, Christ was made a curse in the eye of God that there should be a demonstration of the true place of man as before God.<a name=72:9></a> We pass over things very lightly and never really understand what we are in the sight of God except as we apprehend it in the cross of Christ.<a name=72:10></a> That was our merit, our desert.<a name=72:11></a> My own feeling about it is that, in order to apprehend what my true place is before God, I need to learn what the cross was.<a name=72:12></a>

		Now, there is another side to the cross that we can dwell upon -- a very much more blessed side.<a name=72:13></a> The cross was the foolishness and weakness of God, at all events in the eye of man.<a name=72:14></a> But "unto us which are saved it is the power of God".<a name=72:15></a> The fact is, that the incarnation of the Son of God enabled God to come in testimony into death itself, that He might reveal Himself to man.<a name=72:16></a> It may seem a strange thing to speak of God coming into death, but that is the real testimony of the death of Christ.<a name=72:17></a> He did not come into it <i>as God</i>, but became man in order that, in the way of testimony, God might come into death.<a name=72:18></a> The cross was thus the wisdom of God and the power of God, for it is the unmistakable sign of God's intervention

		Now I take another point.<a name=73:16></a> Where do you learn the love of God?<a name=73:17></a> As we have seen, in the death of Christ.<a name=73:18></a> God came down into death, in the way of testimony.<a name=73:19></a> Surely the Son of God, who died, had part in divine love.<a name=73:20></a> I am quite alive to the fact of His having become Man.<a name=73:21></a> There was the setting forth before God in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is still another thought in connection with the truth that the cross is the power of God: it is the sign, the mark, of God's intervention on man's behalf.<a name=74:4></a> The first sign that God gave in Christ was in the Babe.<a name=74:5></a> The Babe was the sign of God's intervention on man's behalf; the Son of God came into the place of the weakness of man, and that was the sign of God's intervention on man's behalf.<a name=74:6></a> There was no help for man in the strength of flesh.<a name=74:7></a> You get the sign again spoken of in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>.<a name=74:8></a> Christ was the living bread come down from heaven, the blessed expression, in humiliation, of the grace of God to man; the humiliation was morally suitable to the grace.<a name=74:9></a> The people wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of His mouth; they were food for man.<a name=74:10></a> Jesus "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him".<a name=74:11></a> Such was the pathway of service of the Lord here on earth.<a name=74:12></a> But the cross was the greatest sign of all.<a name=74:13></a> In it God in testimony came into the place of judgment.<a name=74:14></a> Man must go, but the love of God abides.<a name=74:15></a> The cross is not only the wisdom of God, but it is the power of God.<a name=74:16></a> There is nothing like the cross; it is really God coming in testimony into the very place of man's judgment, to make manifest beyond all question His thoughts of love.<a name=74:17></a> The mighty power of God could not have come in except death had been there to God's glory.<a name=74:18></a> In the

		Now, I want to say a few words as to the purpose of God.<a name=75:6></a> This was, by the testimony of the cross, to overturn every pretension to light that existed; that is, on the one hand Judaism, and on the other hand heathenism.<a name=75:7></a> The heathen were at the time of the gospel dreadfully debased, but religious pretension, and the pretension to wisdom, were found in Judaism and philosophy.<a name=75:8></a> The Jews demanded a sign, and the Greeks sought after wisdom, and it was the purpose of God to bring both to nought by the testimony of the cross, and this was done.<a name=75:9></a> I do not doubt that if Christianity had not been corrupted by the artifices of the enemy, the effect of the preaching of the cross would have been far greater even than it was.<a name=75:10></a> In our day, the principles which God intended to overturn by the testimony of the cross, have reappeared in the name and under the guise of Christianity.<a name=75:11></a> The great evil of the day is in the accommodation of Christianity to Judaism and philosophy.<a name=75:12></a> They have reared their heads in the midst of Christendom, and the power of the testimony has been greatly neutralised.<a name=75:13></a> The point for us is to get back to the cross.<a name=75:14></a> It is God's testimony as to Himself on the one hand, and as to man's state before God on the other.<a name=75:15></a> We see in it the revelation of God in the very place of man's judgment.<a name=75:16></a> What a wonderful exchange the believer makes, in his thoughts, by the cross; he exchanges himself for God, he gets

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add a word or two as to the closing part of the chapter, just to present the other side of the truth.<a name=76:5></a> God's ways were so ordered that no flesh should glory in His presence, but then, in the last two verses, we have the truth that we are of a new stock, of which God is the source: "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus".<a name=76:6></a> It is of all moment that the Christian should take account of himself as being of another stock.<a name=76:7></a> If Scripture speaks about what is of God in Christ Jesus, it evidently refers to Christ Jesus risen, and He is the source and spring of the Christian; you are of God.<a name=76:8></a> I suppose it may be spoken of as new creation, and He (Christ) is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.<a name=76:9></a> It is difficult for a Christian to take account of himself as being of another order, because the order of Adam and the order of Christ do not correspond.<a name=76:10></a> When Christ became Man, He came into the order and place of the first man, but, raised again from the dead, He is eternally separated from that order, and is the Head, the Beginning, of a new order.<a name=76:11></a> It is most important to take into account, in our minds, what we are in Christ Jesus as outside of what we are in the flesh.<a name=76:12></a> In the flesh, there are many things which pertain to us which can have no connection with what is in Christ Jesus, such as natural relationships, and the like.<a name=76:13></a> In Christ Jesus there is not the distinction of male or female, on which relationships down here are founded.<a name=76:14></a> All is very different from that of which you have experience.<a name=76:15></a> But what we are in Christ Jesus takes

		precedence of what we are in the flesh, and therefore it has to be more important in our eyes.<a name=77:1></a> We often fail there, and put what we are in the flesh first, and what we are in Christ second.<a name=77:2></a> But to put it in the language of Scripture, we have to "put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, .<a name=77:3></a>.<a name=77:4></a>.<a name=77:5></a> and .<a name=77:6></a>.<a name=77:7></a>.<a name=77:8></a> put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness".<a name=77:9></a> That is what is to rule in my ways and conduct down here.<a name=77:10></a> Paul says to the Galatians, "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.<a name=77:11></a> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God".<a name=77:12></a> When I talk of Christ Jesus, it brings before me at once the thought of a new order, and so of a new system of relationships.<a name=77:13></a> There is a system of relationships connected with man as God made him, and there is also a system of relationships connected with Christ Jesus, and these relationships, with the Christian, take precedence of the relationships after the flesh.<a name=77:14></a> The Christian has to take account of himself as of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=77:15></a>

		Then the apostle goes on to say, "Who has been made to us wisdom from God".<a name=77:16></a> The object of that is to render us independent of man and man's pretension to wisdom.<a name=77:17></a> We know the resources of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=77:18></a> But He is also made unto us righteousness; Christ is our righteousness.<a name=77:19></a> He is further made unto us sanctification.<a name=77:20></a> How is sanctification to be effected?<a name=77:21></a> It is as you are conscious of being in Christ, and grow in grace.<a name=77:22></a> You have not sanctification as a matter of faith; such an idea is a great mistake.<a name=77:23></a> <i>Christ</i> is sanctification to us, that is, as having Him for an object.<a name=77:24></a> Then follows the closing word, that He is made redemption to us.<a name=77:25></a> All culminates in redemption.<a name=77:26></a> The force of the passage is to make nothing of us, and at the same time to make us independent of all the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage which I have read is a remarkable one, and arises out of a charge which apparently had been made against the apostle Paul, from which he vindicates himself.<a name=85:1></a> I think it is evident that the charge of lightness, and want of steadfastness of purpose, had been brought against the apostle by the Corinthians, or, at all events, by some amongst them.<a name=85:2></a> The general state of an assembly is one thing, but there may be influences at work in an assembly, as at Corinth, sufficient to cause anxiety in regard to the assembly.<a name=85:3></a> They had taken occasion at Corinth of the apostle not having come at the time he intended, to bring against him this charge of want of fixity of purpose.<a name=85:4></a> The passage which I read is short, but the way in which the apostle deals with the matter is remarkable, and brings before us the fact that the apostle's ways were governed by the testimony committed to him.<a name=85:5></a> And so he vindicates himself by bringing before their minds this testimony and its proof of the stability of God's promises.<a name=85:6></a> A person is influenced by his knowledge of God; the knowledge which he enjoys of God, and the assurance of the firmness and stability of what is of God, is that by which he is affected, and his ways take their character from this.<a name=85:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that comes out in the passage before us.<a name=85:8></a> The apostle might have spent chapters in attempting to vindicate himself otherwise, but all the vindication on which he ventures in regard to himself is contained in two or three verses.<a name=85:9></a> If the apostle's ways were not in accordance with the knowledge he had of God, he was not worth much.<a name=85:10></a> And so it is in regard of us.<a name=85:11></a>

		There are two parts in the passage.<a name=86:1></a> The first three verses, that is eighteen to twenty, speak of what may be described as God's side, and the succeeding verses, that is twenty-one and twenty-two, of our side.<a name=86:2></a> The apostle begins by saying: "As God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay".<a name=86:3></a> Whatever there might have appeared to be in the apostle's ways, there had been no uncertainty about his word -- that is evident.<a name=86:4></a> "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.<a name=86:5></a> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of God by us".<a name=86:6></a> Evidently, the passage so far speaks of things on the divine side, that is, of the confirmation and establishment of every promise of God in Christ, with a special object, that is, "for glory to God by us".<a name=86:7></a> That is one side.<a name=86:8></a> Then you get our side.<a name=86:9></a> It adds: "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".<a name=86:10></a> The passage describes the way in which God has wrought in order that His glory might come out in us.<a name=86:11></a> In speaking of glory to God by us, I do not think that the apostle refers to the future, but to the present.<a name=86:12></a> God has contemplated that at the present moment there should be glory to Himself by us, and I believe that just in proportion as our souls are in the full light of the Son of God, and of what God has brought to pass in Him, so there will be glory to God by us.<a name=86:13></a> That is what God intended in the church down here.<a name=86:14></a> It is difficult to take these things in, in the present day, on account of the state of the professing church.<a name=86:15></a> Everything is so marred, so poor and weak, that it is hard to enter into the divine thought, and for the reason that you do not see the representation of that in which God's glory was to be expressed.<a name=86:16></a>

		Paul's testimony is somewhat different.<a name=88:2></a> The point of it is that Christ is the Son of God.<a name=88:3></a> This brings before us, not that He had gone to God, but that He came <i>from</i> God.<a name=88:4></a> Paul was the first to bring that out.<a name=88:5></a> You get it amplified in the writings of John, but it had no part in the public testimony of Peter and John, so far as that is recorded.<a name=88:6></a> It waited for a special instrument to be raised up, and that was Paul.<a name=88:7></a> The very thought of the Son of God was of One who came from God.<a name=88:8></a> In confirmation of what I have said, I quote a passage in Galatians: "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law".<a name=88:9></a> We have here the thought of the sending forth.<a name=88:10></a> Now, if the Son of God comes forth, the point of His coming is to make God known to us.<a name=88:11></a> And further, in grace the Son of God came into the place and estate in which man was in regard of God.<a name=88:12></a> He was made sin, and became a curse; entering, too, into death.<a name=88:13></a> The purpose of it was that He might bring into death the light of God.<a name=88:14></a> He actually anticipated, so to say, everything which is upon man, and brought into death the full light of God.<a name=88:15></a> And the result of that is, that instead of our having to enter into all that which is upon us in its terrible reality, the revelation of God is light and life to our souls.<a name=88:16></a> That is what we see has come to pass in the Son of God.<a name=88:17></a> He brought the light of God into the place of our distance.<a name=88:18></a> I could not give you a greater proof of the grace of God.<a name=88:19></a> I think it is of all moment to see that the full light of God has come out in the death of Christ.<a name=88:20></a> It did not come out fully in the life of Christ.<a name=88:21></a> I quite admit that God was manifested in the flesh.<a name=88:22></a> There was abundant testimony in all the ways and words of Christ down here of who He was and who had sent Him; but it is in the death of Christ that you get the full revelation of God to us in regard of that which lay on us.<a name=88:23></a> God took

		occasion of man's place under death and the curse of a broken law to make Himself known to us in the fulness of His love.<a name=89:1></a> The Lord speaks of this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a> - 16.<a name=89:2></a> You see there that the object of the Son of man being lifted up was to make room for the full light of God to come out in love.<a name=89:3></a> "God so loved the world".<a name=89:4></a> It is in the death of Christ that we learn really the nature of God.<a name=89:5></a> "God is love", and "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=89:6></a> That is Paul's testimony.<a name=89:7></a> I would that everybody here might really know the full extent of the grace of God in presenting Himself to us in the Person of His Son in regard of all that which lay upon us -- the curse, and death, and judgment -- presenting Himself to us there in order that we, instead of entering into the reality of these things, might have the light of God as the life of our souls.<a name=89:8></a> And the application of that principle is very wide.<a name=89:9></a> It refers to every family, for the revelation of God will be, in greater or less degree, the life of their souls; only I would ask you just to bear in mind that you must not confound the revelation of God with man's ability, even divinely given, to enter into that revelation.<a name=89:10></a> Man may have more or less ability, by the grace of God, to enter into that revelation, but the revelation of God in the death of Christ stands good for all.<a name=89:11></a> It is a truth of universal application.<a name=89:12></a> I think it is in that sense that the Lord gave the commission to the apostles in the last chapter of Matthew, to baptise to the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=89:13></a> The revelation was good for all, for ourselves, and for Israel, and for the nations, but there may be a great deal of difference, in different families, in the power to enter into the greatness of the revelation, but, anyway, the revelation is the light of souls in every family.<a name=89:14></a> For instance, the way in which God presents Himself to Israel in the new covenant will be their light: "All shall know me,

		But there is another point connected with the Son of God, namely, that every promise is now established in Him.<a name=91:10></a> The promises of God had relation to man, whatever they were.<a name=91:11></a> They regarded man, and therefore, in order that these promises might be effectual, they needed to be centred at a point from which God could affect and subdue man, for it was impossible that God's promises could be brought to pass if it were not in God's power to affect man according to Himself; but that is what God <i>has</i> proved His power and ability to do; it is in the Son of God that all the promises of God are yea and Amen.<a name=91:12></a> If you look for a moment at these promises, they related both to Jew and Gentile.<a name=91:13></a> The great promise to Abraham, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed", had relation to the Gentile as well as to the Jew, and so,

	<div class="paragraph">
		many other passages in the Old Testament relate to the Gentile.<a name=92:1></a> There are ample promises to the Jew, and at the same time rich promises for the Gentile.<a name=92:2></a> Christ is to be the "Head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me".<a name=92:3></a> There are abundant promises for the Gentiles, in Christ.<a name=92:4></a> The great promise to Abraham was connected with blessing, but we have also foreshadowed the complete victory over the power of evil -- the head of the serpent was to be bruised; then there is, too, the promise of the new covenant -- man was to be morally a reflex of God; and when that came to pass, God would dwell among men.<a name=92:5></a> And we have also the purpose of God to reign.<a name=92:6></a> God Himself was going to take the kingdom.<a name=92:7></a> God had the kingdom, in a sense, when David reigned in Jerusalem.<a name=92:8></a> Then, when the line of David became completely unfaithful, and God had to break with them, power was put for the time into the hands of the Gentiles, and we have the times of the Gentiles.<a name=92:9></a> But we see in the Old Testament the purpose of God Himself to take up the throne; Jehovah would reign.<a name=92:10></a> The kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdom of our God, and of His Christ.<a name=92:11></a> Now, these promises refer to man, whether it is the bruising of the head of the serpent, or the blessing of all nations in Abraham.<a name=92:12></a> Every promise involves the blessing of man.<a name=92:13></a> But then, the promises could not, as I have said, be established until there was a point from which God would affect man.<a name=92:14></a> Now there <i>is</i> such a point, that is, the Son of God, in whom is revealed God's love, and every promise of God is held in Him to God's glory.<a name=92:15></a> That is the light into which we have come -- the light of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ, where every promise of God is established and firm, because from that point God can make man willing in the day of His power.<a name=92:16></a> That is what will come to pass in the case of Israel, and that is what God has done in regard of us.<a name=92:17></a> And now, in regard of the promises of God, in the

		And now, I just say a few words as to how we are affected.<a name=93:2></a> It is important to see that side of it, if these promises are to be to the glory of God by us.<a name=93:3></a> "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God: who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".<a name=93:4></a> The first expression that you get there is a little difficult to interpret.<a name=93:5></a> My impression is this, that it means attaching us firmly unto Christ.<a name=93:6></a> That is the work of God, and I think that work of God, as I understand it, is carried on in the hearts of the saints.<a name=93:7></a> God is the One who does it.<a name=93:8></a> The way in which it is wrought is this, that God gives Christ such a place in the hearts of the saints, as that He attaches us firmly to Him; He dwells by faith in the heart.<a name=93:9></a> Then, God has anointed us.<a name=93:10></a> He has given us intelligence in the power of the Holy Spirit, a spiritual intelligence of things.<a name=93:11></a> I think I can give you an interpretation of it.<a name=93:12></a> Look at the apostle's prayer, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love" -- just notice how all the Godhead is brought into the passage: the Father strengthens you with might by His Spirit in the inner man, that the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith -- "that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend" (that is the effect of the anointing) "with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ" (that is, that your hearts may be firmly attached to Christ) "which

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, God has also sealed us.<a name=94:8></a> The seal is the mark which God has put upon us, and that is the Spirit.<a name=94:9></a> It is the expression, the evidence, that we are genuinely God's property.<a name=94:10></a> He has His mark upon us.<a name=94:11></a> We get the consciousness by the Spirit that we are not our own, but God's property.<a name=94:12></a> And more than that, He has given us the earnest of the Spirit; His Spirit is the Earnest of the inheritance and of glory in our souls.<a name=94:13></a> That is what God has effected on our side.<a name=94:14></a> What He has effected on His own side is in order that He might subdue the hearts of men by the revelation of Himself.<a name=94:15></a> What a wonderful company we should be if we were here in the full sense of the certainty and fixity of everything which God has promised, if our souls had power to take up the whole range of those promises!<a name=94:16></a> How conscious we should be of blessing if we saw the beauty of that system, everything established in the Son of God, and we firmly attached to Christ; anointed, that we might have intelligence as to the

		The chapter before us supposes an ability to know which lies in the possession of a kindred nature, and hence we have unfolded here the whole economy of divine love in its application to us.<a name=96:6></a> The passage is plain enough.<a name=96:7></a> It is not here the question of relief, but of putting us in line with the wonderful way in which the love of God connects itself with the course of a Christian all along to the end, until all responsibility is over, and God will rest in His love.<a name=96:8></a> The line that John takes is to connect the love of God with the believer down here.<a name=96:9></a> He does not see him set in heavenly places; but he is not of the world, and is in the enjoyment of heavenly things.<a name=96:10></a> Some have said that John does not speak of heaven.<a name=96:11></a> Anyway he unfolds more distinctly than anyone what is essentially heavenly, and at the same time he gives us the moral judgment of the world.<a name=96:12></a> He tells the young men that

		all that is in the world is not of the Father, and gives them the means of forming a moral estimate of what is in the world; and the things which we have judged we are freed from the power of.<a name=97:1></a> If a man is not free of a thing it proves that he has never really judged it.<a name=97:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return to our chapter: we see how love connects itself with us all the way through.<a name=97:3></a> Knowledge, as I said before, is an essential element of Christian blessing.<a name=97:4></a> It is the form which eternal life takes in regard to us -- to know the Father, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, His sent one.<a name=97:5></a> But then it is love that knows love; and the man that does not love does not know God, for God is love.<a name=97:6></a> We see the character of the knowledge in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:14">John  10:14</a>, 15, where Jesus says, "I know my sheep, and am known of mine; as the Father knows me, and I also know the Father".<a name=97:7></a> It all lies in the new being, in what we are as quickened of the Son.<a name=97:8></a> Apart from this the knowledge could not be, however fully God might be revealed.<a name=97:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two principal elements in our blessing; namely, the relationship which we have in chapter 3 and the knowledge in chapter 4.<a name=97:10></a> The relationship peculiar to John is that of children of God unknown of the world, partners of Christ's rejection.<a name=97:11></a> The relationship of sons refers more to association with Christ in glory.<a name=97:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now as to knowledge.<a name=97:13></a> In verse 7 we have, "He that loveth is born of God", and, the apostle adds, "knows God".<a name=97:14></a> Then immediately the love of God, in its application to us, is unfolded.<a name=97:15></a> It is long before we really come to the acceptance of the great truth that we love God because He first loved us.<a name=97:16></a> We are so much hindered by thoughts of self, and what we are for God, that we are little able to look at the love of God in itself.<a name=97:17></a> First, we see the love in its application to us as sinners -- when there was total insensibility as to God and His goodness.<a name=97:18></a> Then it was that He, of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His love, sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him.<a name=98:1></a> And not only so, but the apostle adds, "herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins".<a name=98:2></a> Though spiritually there was total insensibility in our souls to God, there was at the same time responsibility, for we had consciences; and God sent His Son to meet the whole case, both as to our state and our sins.<a name=98:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is the love that is toward us as saints.<a name=98:4></a> "We have known and believed the love that God has to us".<a name=98:5></a> Here it is love to us not as sinners, but as saints in our pathway here.<a name=98:6></a> The apostle had just said, "We have seen and bear witness that the Father sent the Son as Saviour of the world".<a name=98:7></a> Saints are viewed as being in this blessed circle, and the secrets of divine grace come out and enlarge the heart.<a name=98:8></a> "God is love; and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him".<a name=98:9></a> I have thought that the Son by coming here, not only brought divine affections here -- for He was their object, and they rested on Him as man -- but He left them here; for He left objects of them, and hence the affections remained, resting on those who were loved with the love with which He was loved as a Man here.<a name=98:10></a> It was indeed a small beginning, but what great things have come out of it!<a name=98:11></a> The Son brought here the greatest thing he could bring -- the Father's love; and He left it here, while never Himself ceasing to be the supreme object of it.<a name=98:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now, finally, we have love made perfect with us in regard to the day of judgment -- that which closes for ever the chapter of our responsibility.<a name=98:13></a> And here it is "that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; for as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=98:14></a> The object is that we may be without fear; for fear hath torment.<a name=98:15></a> The thought of the judgment-seat might bring some sense of fear, and that is met by the truth that as He

	<div class="paragraph">
		who is Judge is, so are we in this world.<a name=99:1></a> We are in the acceptance and favour already in which the One is who is Himself Judge.<a name=99:2></a> Every bit of fear has to be dispelled from the heart of saints; they are to be made perfect in love.<a name=99:3></a> And when we have reached this, it is then we are free to recognise that we love Him because He first loved us.<a name=99:4></a>

		GOD'S WRITING IN THE HEART TO THE END OF OUR BEHOLDING THE GLORY OF THE LORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are, in the passage before us, two principles taken up from the type of Moses bringing down the tables of the law: the first is <i>writing</i>, and the second is <i>glory</i>.<a name=100:1></a> The one was the accompaniment of the other.<a name=100:2></a> The introduction of the tables of stone on which God had written the ten words was accompanied with glory.<a name=100:3></a> The glory was in the face of Moses, the writing was on the tables of stone.<a name=100:4></a> Now, you get the antitype of that in this chapter: the writing is in the heart of the Corinthians, and the glory in the face of Christ.<a name=100:5></a> And what I want to make plain is the connection between the two things, for the one is really dependent upon the other; when there is the writing, then there is "beholding the glory".<a name=100:6></a> If the Corinthians were the subject of the writing, the writing qualified them to behold the glory.<a name=100:7></a> The apostle speaks of that in the last verse of the chapter: "We all", he says, "beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord the Spirit".<a name=100:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think, as far as I understand the passage, that the apostles were the only ones who looked at the glory of the Lord, for he says "we <i>all</i>".<a name=100:9></a> There is no veil now over the face of the Lord -- that is the idea of the last verse.<a name=100:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two points I have indicated are of great practical interest to us.<a name=100:11></a> They make evident the greatness of Christianity -- what a contrast it is to all that went before, though it is the antitype of it.<a name=100:12></a> The writing upon the tables of stone and the glory in the face of Moses were evanescent.<a name=100:13></a> Where will you find the tables
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=101>[Page 101]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of stone now, or the glory in the face of Moses?<a name=101:1></a> That glory was there but for a moment, it all passed away.<a name=101:2></a> Moses passed away; he had to die in the wilderness, he was not permitted to enter the land; and I suppose the glory passed away from his face long before he died.<a name=101:3></a> But the writing to which the apostle refers in the antitype is the real writing of God in the tables of the heart, and the glory with which that is connected is eternal.<a name=101:4></a> It is the reality in contrast to the type.<a name=101:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another important point connected with the subject, which we shall see more distinctly presently.<a name=101:6></a> Beholding the glory of the Lord is pretty much equivalent to entering the holiest.<a name=101:7></a> What the epistle to the Hebrews opens up to the mind of the Jew, this chapter opens up to the mind of the Gentile.<a name=101:8></a> To the Jew the idea presented was entering the holiest; here, to the Gentile, it is beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face.<a name=101:9></a> If you behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, you have entered the holiest, I think that is sufficiently plain.<a name=101:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would desire first to give you the scripture idea of a veil.<a name=101:11></a> It is that which conceals the glory of God.<a name=101:12></a> You get an example of it in the Lord upon earth; the glory of God was in Him veiled.<a name=101:13></a> The glory of God was there, but under a veil of flesh.<a name=101:14></a> The Lord had taken the condition of man, in humiliation, down here.<a name=101:15></a> Now we have, in contrast to that, "beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face".<a name=101:16></a> There is no veil upon the face of the Lord.<a name=101:17></a> He is declared to be the Son of God by the place in which He is.<a name=101:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will give you another illustration of a veil.<a name=101:19></a> Providences are a veil behind which God hides His glory.<a name=101:20></a> We are all familiar with the providences of God, in which a great many things come to pass in the world which are not according to God's glory.<a name=101:21></a> The providence of God is inscrutable.<a name=101:22></a> It is a wheel within a wheel -- a kind of riddle which no one can read.<a name=101:23></a> That came out in the case of Job.<a name=101:24></a> God allowed a great
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=102>[Page 102]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		many terrible things to befall Job in His providence, but the glory of God and His purpose in regard to Job were hidden behind.<a name=102:1></a> And so it is to this day; we see the providence of God, and the varied things which God permits in His providence, but they are no expression to us of His glory.<a name=102:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>and 5, you see the glory of God, the throne and the One that sits upon it, and those that surround the throne.<a name=102:3></a> You get the Lamb in the midst of the throne, and the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders.<a name=102:4></a> You get the glory of God coming out there, but in chapter 6 you find horses sent forth into all the earth, symbolising providential dealings and forces that hide the glory of God.<a name=102:5></a> This will not always be the case; the time will come when God will no longer hide His glory behind a veil of providences; the veil will be put aside and the glory of God be revealed.<a name=102:6></a> The sun is always shining, but it is often veiled by clouds.<a name=102:7></a> And so with the glory of God; though hid by providences, it will in due time shine forth.<a name=102:8></a> But the Christian is able in the meantime to go behind the providences of God, and see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=102:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now take up the two points, viz.<a name=102:10></a>, the writing, and the glory as connected with it.<a name=102:11></a> And I think that glory must be connected with writing.<a name=102:12></a> The ten commandments were first spoken to the children of Israel from the top of the mount.<a name=102:13></a> There was no writing or record then.<a name=102:14></a> The people heard the voice of God, and God intended that they should hear it.<a name=102:15></a> I suppose the idea prevailed that if God spoke to man, and man heard His voice, man would die, but in contrast to that, idea, the truth came out that God spoke to man, and man lived.<a name=102:16></a> Man being under sin, and death as the judgment of God, one could understand the idea that if God spoke to man, man would die, but the contrary comes to pass.<a name=102:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=103>[Page 103]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when Moses came down from the mount, he brought with him the tables of stone.<a name=103:1></a> That is, he brought down a record, and this proved that, beyond the fact of the voice of God speaking to man, a record was in the mind of God.<a name=103:2></a> Writing is a record.<a name=103:3></a> A thing committed to writing is recorded, and it was in the purpose of God to have a record or transcript of His mind.<a name=103:4></a> For the moment, the writing was on tables of stone.<a name=103:5></a> Moses brought the tables of stone down to the camp, but the children of Israel were sitting down to eat and drink and rising up to play.<a name=103:6></a> Moses broke the tables of stone and went up to the mount the second time, and received other tables written, we are told, with the finger of God, which he brought down into the camp and put into the ark of the covenant.<a name=103:7></a> What that witnessed was that the law of God must be vindicated in Christ before it could be written in the heart of man.<a name=103:8></a> The tables of stone were put up in the ark, they were hid there, it was the divine provision for them.<a name=103:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The antitype is seen in the new covenant, in which God speaks again about writing.<a name=103:10></a> He writes, this time, on the fleshy tables of the heart.<a name=103:11></a> "I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people; and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest.<a name=103:12></a> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more".<a name=103:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the new covenant is in evident contrast to the old.<a name=103:14></a> The old was connected with the writing of God upon the tables of stone, but the new with the writing of God upon the heart and mind of man, and this means an effective work of God in man which makes man a reflex morally of God.<a name=103:15></a> God works thus to make man responsive to Himself.<a name=103:16></a> The law was in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=104>[Page 104]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		itself good, but if man could have kept the law, he would hardly have been responsive to God, for the love of God was not yet made known.<a name=104:1></a> The time of response to God had not yet come, and that is shown plainly enough in the fact of the ten commandments being written on tables of stone.<a name=104:2></a> The tables could give no response.<a name=104:3></a> The effect of the writing of God is not simply that a man becomes acquainted with the grace of God, but that man responds to the grace which is made known to him.<a name=104:4></a> He apprehends that God loves him, and then it is that he loves God, and is thus responsive to God.<a name=104:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there was another point that came out in connection with the writing, viz.<a name=104:6></a>, the glory in the face of Moses.<a name=104:7></a> Moses came out from God, he came from the glory where God was, and he carried in his face the reflection of the glory.<a name=104:8></a> His face shone when he came down to the children of Israel.<a name=104:9></a> It brought out this, that the writing had the ratification of glory; and signified that when the moment came for God to write in the heart of man, man would then behold the glory of the Lord.<a name=104:10></a> For the moment, the glory was there in type, but the people could not bear the glory, nor were they allowed to see the end, and therefore Moses put a veil upon his face when he spoke to the people, but when he went in to Jehovah the veil was taken away.<a name=104:11></a> You get the apostle applying this as a figure to Israel in his time.<a name=104:12></a> When Israel turns to the Lord, the veil, which is for the moment on their heart, is taken away, as it was in the case of Moses.<a name=104:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope you will be able to carry together the two thoughts of the writing of God and beholding the glory of the Lord.<a name=104:14></a> If we have the privilege of beholding the glory of the Lord, of entering the holiest, our competency to behold the glory is the fruit of the writing of God in us.<a name=104:15></a> It was that which enabled the apostle to behold the glory of the Lord.<a name=104:16></a> Do you think the bulk of Christians in the present day behold

		the glory of the Lord?<a name=105:1></a> I doubt it.<a name=105:2></a> I am not unchristianising them for a moment; they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but I do not much think that they behold His glory.<a name=105:3></a> The reason is that the lines of God's writing are so poorly impressed on their hearts.<a name=105:4></a> Israel will be in advance of many Christians, for they will behold the glory of the Lord; not, perhaps, in the sense in which we do, but they will turn to the Lord when the law is written in their hearts and they will all know the Lord.<a name=105:5></a> "All shall know me, from the least to the greatest; for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more".<a name=105:6></a> Every one, from the least to the greatest, will have the knowledge of the Lord in that day, but then I think it is the blessed result of the law being written in their hearts and minds.<a name=105:7></a> Now, in the application to ourselves (for with us it is not the law written in the heart), we have something very much greater.<a name=105:8></a> What the apostle speaks about in the early verses of the chapter is not the law written in the heart, but a writing of Christ, ministered by the apostles, and in lines, not of ink, but of the Holy Spirit.<a name=105:9></a> That is, the Spirit of God is spoken of here in contrast to ink.<a name=105:10></a> I do not know whether you have ever noticed how an inscription is made upon marble.<a name=105:11></a> The letters are first cut out with a tool, but afterwards, they are lined in with ink.<a name=105:12></a> That is what the apostle, I take it, refers to here, and in contrast to the ink we have the Spirit of God.<a name=105:13></a> The lines become indelible; they are intended to be so.<a name=105:14></a> They are in the Spirit of God -- a permanent record of God.<a name=105:15></a> Now, I do not think that the work of God in a man's soul is done by an instrument.<a name=105:16></a> I think I can tell you to what extent God is pleased to employ instruments.<a name=105:17></a> Speaking in a general way, any light which man gets in regard to God comes to him by an instrument.<a name=105:18></a> I do not think that any instrument is seen in new birth, because it appears to me to be entirely and exclusively the work of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The evangelist has to do a wonderful work.<a name=106:11></a> He may reason with people, like Paul did with Felix; he may persuade men, "knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men", but the great object to which all his means tend is that he may enlighten the souls of men in regard to God; in other words that he may open their eyes, that men may be undeceived by being enlightened with the revelation of God.<a name=106:12></a> And therefore you can understand that the more the soul of the evangelist is pervaded by the revelation of God, the better able he is to carry out his work of enlightening the souls of men.<a name=106:13></a>

		Being thus the subjects of Christ's writing, and having boldness to enter into the holiest, we behold the glory of the Lord.<a name=109:3></a> What I understand the glory of the Lord to be is that He is the minister, in power, of all that is in the mind of God.<a name=109:4></a> Every divine purpose is centred there; from that point everything will be set forth.<a name=109:5></a> If you go through the Old Testament, you will see that all the purposes of God were set forth in figure in different men.<a name=109:6></a> God set forth one thing in Adam; another in Noah; another in David; another, it may be, in Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=109:7></a> Thus, different men were used of God in Old Testament times for the setting forth of different purposes.<a name=109:8></a> Hence you see the feebleness of all, because there was no man then in whom <i>every</i> purpose could be set forth so that such purposes could be held as one system.<a name=109:9></a> There was as yet no man competent to hold all God's purposes, and, as a fact, God was dishonoured in all.<a name=109:10></a> Adam fell; Noah got drunk; David sinned and became liable to death; and Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and commanded all the world to be idolatrous.<a name=109:11></a> But now we behold the glory of the Lord, all God's purposes centred and set forth in one Man, who has completely glorified God in regard of all that had dishonoured God.<a name=109:12></a> The glory of God has been secured in the very place where God has been dishonoured, and the One in whom God has been glorified is at the right hand of God, the centre of every divine purpose.<a name=109:13></a> He is Son of man -- He takes up Adam's dominion; He takes up David's kingdom -- He is ruler over the house of Jacob; He is Head of the Gentiles.<a name=109:14></a> Thus every ray of divine glory converges in Christ and is set forth to us where it cannot fail.<a name=109:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought, beloved friends, is, as the Lord may enable me, to seek to bring out what one might call the leading features in this particular portion of Scripture, the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=113:1></a> In many ways attention has been called to it of late.<a name=113:2></a> And it has a peculiar importance, because the special line of truth developed in it is in view of the proper testimony and service of Christians as one body on earth.<a name=113:3></a> I will show this more distinctly presently, but it is the peculiar character of the epistle.<a name=113:4></a> In order to help, I will contrast Colossians with other epistles.<a name=113:5></a> As I have said, the epistle has a peculiar interest if you want to know the service and testimony of saints as one body; not in their individuality.<a name=113:6></a> There is a great deal of our pathway which is connected with our individuality; I have to tread my path individually through the wilderness; and wherever saints are looked at as in the wilderness, it is always in their individuality.<a name=113:7></a> I do not see anything collective or corporate in connection with the wilderness; if you want to come to what is collective or corporate you must get beyond Jordan.<a name=113:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Colossians, as has often been said, does not contemplate Christians as having gone up into the land, but as over Jordan; they are at Gilgal, that is, in the place where circumcision is realised; that is, they understand what it is to be dead and risen with Christ in the place of spiritual circumcision, and spiritual circumcision is realised.<a name=113:9></a> In connection with this, especially in the third chapter, you get the saints as one body (for that is the point of view), and the character of Christ coming out in them.<a name=113:10></a> It has often been said, and I fully go with it, that no
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=114>[Page 114]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		one saint is adequate to express the character of Christ in its completeness; some feature or trait of Christ may be prominent in one particular saint, but if you want to get the character of Christ expressed in its fulness, you must have the whole body of saints in their relation one to another.<a name=114:1></a> And that is what we see in the third chapter.<a name=114:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before I pass on to what comes out in the epistle, I want to remark this: every epistle bears certain peculiar marks; and one mark which is stamped upon the epistle to the Colossians is, that it refers in a distinct way to Gentiles, it contemplates Gentiles.<a name=114:3></a> Other parts of the word of God, like the Hebrews, contemplate specially Jews, Jewish Christians; while the epistle to the Ephesians takes up in a peculiar way both Jew and Gentile; but the Colossians contemplates rather distinctly Gentiles.<a name=114:4></a> The proof of this is in the close of this first chapter, where the apostle says, "to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you" -- Christ in the Gentiles -- "Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=114:5></a> And it is perhaps on that account, as being addressed to Gentiles, that in the first chapter stress is laid upon reconciliation.<a name=114:6></a> If you go to other parts of the word of God, where the Spirit of God is addressing Jews, you will find other distinctive marks.<a name=114:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in speaking of this epistle in contrast to other epistles in the New Testament, I will first notice what you do not get, before I tell you what you do get.<a name=114:8></a> For instance, you do not get, as in Ephesians, the proper <i>heavenly</i> relationship of saints.<a name=114:9></a> You do not find, as far as I am aware or have looked into it, in the epistle to the Colossians, the truth of sonship, and that is the proper full heavenly relationship of saints.<a name=114:10></a> And it is the leading point in the epistle to the Ephesians, "Chosen us in him", we read there, "before the foundation of the world, that we should
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto" sonship "through Jesus Christ to himself".<a name=115:1></a> What the epistle to the Ephesians opens with is the heavenly relationship to which we are called, that is, sons through Jesus Christ to God.<a name=115:2></a> But the epistle to the Colossians does not go on to that.<a name=115:3></a> Again, you will not find in it what you find in the first epistle of John.<a name=115:4></a> There the great point is the peculiar present relationship, as children, in which we stand.<a name=115:5></a> I do not mean to say but what sonship is a present relationship; but sonship in its scope and bearing refers to glory.<a name=115:6></a> We are predestinated to be conformed unto the image of God's Son, that is Christ in glory, "that he might be the firstborn among many brethren".<a name=115:7></a> That shows you the true idea of sonship.<a name=115:8></a> But what is peculiar to the first epistle of John is the relationship down here of children.<a name=115:9></a> I have no doubt there is the thought in both terms of association with Christ; but the thought of sonship is association with a glorified Christ; that of children is rather association with an unknown, rejected Christ.<a name=115:10></a> The latter is the peculiar truth which is developed in the first epistle of John; the calling of children, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God", and in connection with this, the truth of eternal life.<a name=115:11></a> I do not think you will find either relationship brought out in the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=115:12></a> No doubt Colossians may touch John or touch Ephesians; but it has its own distinctive line, and that distinctive line is this -- the reproduction of the character of a heavenly Christ in the saints as one body, and it is this which leads me to say that the great point of the epistle is the testimony and service of the saints looked at as one body.<a name=115:13></a> You get it brought out in chapter 3 in the exhortations, while chapters 1 and 2 contain the doctrine which leads up to it.<a name=115:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to bring out a little, as the Lord may

		enable me, the doctrine.<a name=116:1></a> I propose taking only the first chapter tonight, and I divide it into two parts.<a name=116:2></a> The first is the glory of Christ, which is the great introduction, the headship of Christ, if we may so say; and the second is the scheme of reconciliation which is in a way identified with His very being, and specially the reconciliation of persons which is going on at this present time.<a name=116:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second chapter the great leading thought is the suitability or correspondence of the saints to the Head.<a name=116:4></a> Then you come, in the third chapter, to the exhortations which show us the true character of the saints as one body down here.<a name=116:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, of course, all this demands death to the world.<a name=116:6></a> As long as people are hampered and hindered by worldly associations and so on, and take up the position practically of dwellers upon earth, the testimony is in measure marred.<a name=116:7></a> If you want to come out in this way, as part of the one body in which the character of Christ is displayed, you have to be set free from that which connects you with the course of things down here.<a name=116:8></a> Hence it is that circumcision comes in: we have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ to be vessels for the display of the character and life of Christ.<a name=116:9></a> But if that is to be the case you must have a practical breaking of the links which connect you with the course of things here.<a name=116:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just one word more by way of introduction.<a name=116:11></a> You will find it peculiarly interesting to connect the epistle with <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:20">John  17:20</a>, of which it is the practical accomplishment, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=116:12></a> There it is, if I understand the verse aright, that the unity of saints here was to be the testimony to the world that the Father sent the Son.<a name=116:13></a> In Colossians the

		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		point is the testimony of saints as one body.<a name=117:1></a> But then what it amounts to is this, that they become a testimony to the world that the Father sent the Son; that is, that if all the saints were walking together perfectly according to the mind and Spirit of God, the result would be a present testimony to Christ; and that is the object of this verse of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "That the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=117:2></a> All turns to that; the more you look into it in the word of God, the more you see that the carrying out of Christian obligations all results in testimony to the Son, that the Father sent the Son.<a name=117:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not purpose dwelling on the first part of the first chapter, as my points are, first, the glory of Christ, and secondly, in connection with it the great work of reconciliation.<a name=117:4></a> I do not think we attach quite enough importance to reconciliation.<a name=117:5></a> We have to remember that it is the purpose of God to put everything on that ground; and I think I might go so far as to say that it was the eternal purpose of God.<a name=117:6></a> I do not doubt for one single instant that God perfectly well knew everything which would come in in connection with creature responsibility; and I think it was in eternal purpose that everything should be based upon reconciliation; that is, upon peace having been made by the effective work of Christ.<a name=117:7></a> To go back to Leviticus for a moment, I quite admit that the day of atonement, which might perhaps be rendered the day of reconciliation, does not come out until the failure of the priesthood.<a name=117:8></a> It is after Nadab and Abihu had offered strange fire and died that God brings out the idea of reconciliation.<a name=117:9></a> But then, although it comes out in that way in the course of the testimony of God, I doubt not that it was in the eternal purpose of God.<a name=117:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>is a proof of it to me, because there it was in eternal purpose that Christ should become man, should take the body prepared for Him, and by the offering up of Himself lay the foundation of the will of God being accomplished

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=118>[Page 118]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		on that basis.<a name=118:1></a> Still it comes in in Leviticus strikingly, that after the failure of the priesthood, God reveals the great truth of reconciliation.<a name=118:2></a> Hence the day of atonement is the pre-figurement, the bringing out in type and shadow of the scheme of reconciliation; and that is what we have here in the first chapter.<a name=118:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this has begun, although the time has not yet come for the reconciliation of <i>things</i>.<a name=118:4></a> Yet peace has been made and therefore God does not delay; and what is going on at this present moment, though not the reconciliation of things, is the reconciliation of persons.<a name=118:5></a> That is the great point of the present moment, so that the apostle can day, "You now hath he reconciled".<a name=118:6></a> The same thing is found in other parts of the word of God; in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>the apostle speaks of the ministry which God had committed to him as the ministry of reconciliation, the basis of it being that "He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him", and what the apostle was carrying out was this ministry, preaching the word of reconciliation.<a name=118:7></a> In Romans the same occurs, "By whom we have now received the reconciliation".<a name=118:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I will refer for a moment to verses 12 and 13, in which is beautifully interwoven the thought of the Father and the Son.<a name=118:9></a> It says in verse 12, "Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light", for counsels belong to the Father; the accomplishment of counsels is the part of the Son, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love".<a name=118:10></a> Thus we have a blessed unfolding of the Father and the Son; and further, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins".<a name=118:11></a> Now we come to the unfolding of the glory of the Son, "Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

		of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.<a name=119:1></a> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.<a name=119:2></a> For it pleased the Father", or, as the verse might be read, "For in him all the fulness was pleased to dwell; and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven".<a name=119:3></a> Now I would impress upon you one very important point in connection with the Lord, namely, that when He is presented to us in the epistles He is in general presented according to what He <i>now</i> is.<a name=119:4></a> There is plenty of unfolding in the word of God of what He <i>was</i>; but the point in the epistles is what is true in Christ now, what is true in Him as the risen glorified Man.<a name=119:5></a> If you want to understand the epistles, this is an important point to bear in mind.<a name=119:6></a> There is plenty in the epistles to tell you what He was; for instance, if I go to the second chapter of the epistle to the Philippians, I find what He was; that He existed in the form of God, and that He emptied Himself and took a servant's form, and became in the likeness of men; but in general where the epistles speak of the Lord Jesus Christ, they present Him to us according to what He is now, and they tell us what is true in Him now.<a name=119:7></a> For instance, in the next chapter: "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; it could not, of course, be said that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him <i>bodily</i> until He became a man.<a name=119:8></a> Now that He has become Man, and is as man in glory, what we are told is that in Him dwells all the completeness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=119:9></a> John speaks also of what He is now; Jesus

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only make that remark by way of preface before I pass on to speak of verse 15.<a name=120:2></a> What we find here is this, He is "the image of the invisible God".<a name=120:3></a> Beloved friends, He was eternally God; "the Word was God".<a name=120:4></a> Scripture takes uncommon care to guard the Person of the Lord Jesus; more care in regard to Him than in regard to any of the divine Persons, because He has become Man; and therefore Scripture is most tenacious of and careful to maintain His glory, the glory of His Person; "the Word was God".<a name=120:5></a> He existed as God, but when He existed in the form of God, you would hardly say He was "the image of the invisible God"; but now as Man He is, "the image of the invisible God"; for the invisible God is the invisible God, that is, He cannot be seen.<a name=120:6></a> But there is nothing of the invisible God that is not represented in that risen glorified Man, in whom dwells "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=120:7></a> 'Image' is one of the strongest terms used in Scripture; Scripture uses both 'likeness' and 'image'; and 'image' is by far the stronger term of the two.<a name=120:8></a> There is no feature of the invisible God which is lacking or unrepresented in Him.<a name=120:9></a> But then it is all there in a man; He has taken the form of a servant, and become in the likeness of men, and is highly exalted as man, and remains man for ever; and in that Man dwells "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; He "is the image of the invisible God".<a name=120:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, more than that, He is "the firstborn of every creature".<a name=120:11></a> That is His relation as to creation.<a name=120:12></a> He is the 'firstborn', the One pre-eminent; just as God could say of David's son, "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth".<a name=120:13></a> Firstborn of every creature is what He is in regard to creation: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But His headship would not be complete, if one might say so, if this were all; and we get another headship, and that is not in relation to things but in relation to persons.<a name=121:11></a> Now I want to call your attention to this.<a name=121:12></a> It says, "He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence".<a name=121:13></a> Here it is another character of headship altogether, and specially connected with the fact of His being man.<a name=121:14></a> He is the Head of the body; that is not a relation in which He stands to things, but to persons.<a name=121:15></a> The body is composed of persons.<a name=121:16></a> "He is

		But now I turn to the other point which comes out here, namely, the reconciliation -- what Christ is in reference to reconciliation.<a name=123:5></a> It says, "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell, and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven".<a name=123:6></a> Now, beloved friends, here we get a statement which witnesses to us the essential deity of Christ: "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell".<a name=123:7></a><a href="#123:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This verse tells us what <i>was</i>, that is, that nothing was lacking there that is of the completeness of God, neither morally, nor in attribute, nor in anything else.<a name=123:8></a> "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell".<a name=123:9></a> The point is this -- that the Son having become Man, the Spirit of God carefully maintains the glory of His Person.<a name=123:10></a>

Also a subsequent sentence: "It is not what is peculiar to the Son, it is only maintaining His essential deity, because all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in the Father; and so, too, in the Holy Spirit." The reason for the omission is that it has been represented to me that the Greek form of the words "to dwell" would connect the clause "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell" with the Son as become Man. I had regarded it rather in the light of what was eternally true in Him as a divine Person.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, the other is the thought which comes out here in Colossians, and that is, that the church should be a vessel in which the character and the moral features of the Head should be displayed down here.<a name=134:9></a> This may hold good to a certain extent even in the future.<a name=134:10></a> I suppose that the church will be the special vessel even in eternity in which the character of the Head is displayed.<a name=134:11></a> I believe one thought about the church is this -- it is of the Head, and every member of it moves in concert with the Head.<a name=134:12></a> That is in the idea of the body, every member moving at the will of the Head.<a name=134:13></a> I want you to bear these two things in mind in regard to the church.<a name=134:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thing in connection with it, which will bring me to the scripture before us, and that is this.<a name=134:15></a> If what I have spoken of be true, that there is a company in heaven blessed in the Head, and the vessel down here for the display of the character of the Head -- it involves this much, they must be of a

		new order, because the earthy order will not do for heaven.<a name=135:1></a> Make up your minds to that, beloved friends.<a name=135:2></a> I do not mean to say that we have done with the earthy yet; I am sure we have not, because we still bear the image of the earthy; but this I do say without hesitation, the earthy man will not do for heaven.<a name=135:3></a> He would not have done for heaven even as God made him; pure and innocent and good as he was, the earthy would not do for heaven.<a name=135:4></a> Therefore you must have a new man; and the second Man is out of heaven.<a name=135:5></a> You must receive that if you want to understand what Christianity is; the second Man is out of heaven.<a name=135:6></a> The first man was out of earth, earthy, and never could go beyond earth as he stood; and I venture to go further than that -- that if the first man had not failed, I believe it would not have been according to the glory of God that he should be recreated.<a name=135:7></a> But recreated he must be if he is to have part in the heavenly; and therefore when we come to Ephesians -- and so, too, in Colossians -- I get the great truth of a new creation brought in.<a name=135:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the truth I want to dwell on tonight is that the character of Christ is to come out here on earth.<a name=135:9></a> There are two things, blessing and character; we are blessed in heavenly places; the blessings are there, and in a sense <i>we</i> are there, but the character -- that is, the character of Christ -- is to come out here on earth.<a name=135:10></a> The character of Christ can come out in a foreign country in the saints.<a name=135:11></a> And the two important lessons to this end which I want to bring before you are, I must be of His order, and in moral correspondence to Him.<a name=135:12></a> So that what is <i>actually</i> true in Him is <i>morally</i> true of the saints.<a name=135:13></a> Because one great point which the apostle has in view in bringing before them the truth of chapter 2 is that they may be liberated from the power of things here.<a name=135:14></a> He takes up, one by one, a variety of things to which people are exposed here; opinions, philosophy, religiousness and superstition;

		and brings before them a revelation of truth in order to effect their liberation from the influence of these things.<a name=136:1></a> That is the object of chapter 2, so that they may be at liberty; and in order to bring that about he shows to them their correspondence to Christ.<a name=136:2></a> I will just explain it.<a name=136:3></a> They are circumcised, buried with Christ, that is one point of correspondence.<a name=136:4></a> They are risen with Christ, that is another point, and they are quickened together with Christ; that is another.<a name=136:5></a> Then He goes on to show them that the body is of the Head, and the Head is for the body.<a name=136:6></a> He had already shown them at the close of chapter 1 that they were of His order.<a name=136:7></a> Look at chapter 1 verse 27; "To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily".<a name=136:8></a> Then in verse 6 of the next chapter, "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving".<a name=136:9></a> Then after that, he goes to warnings.<a name=136:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, it was a very wonderful thing for the apostle to be able to tell the Colossians that Christ was in them.<a name=136:11></a> He says, "To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you"; that is the new order.<a name=136:12></a> What would a Jew have thought if you had told him that Messiah was in him?<a name=136:13></a> A Jew could understand in a certain sense what it would be to be blessed here upon earth under the rule of Messiah; but I do not think it ever entered the mind of a Jew that Messiah should be in him.<a name=136:14></a> But that is the very thing he brings before the Gentiles,

		the truth of the mystery; and that involves a new order; not simply that I am personally reconciled, but that Christ is in me the hope of glory; Christ is my life.<a name=137:1></a> Is not that a new order?<a name=137:2></a> Here you find, so to say, the heavenly Man, Christ, is in me; and, he adds in the next chapter, "As therefore ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord"; and that is true of every Christian.<a name=137:3></a> It is not a question of attainment, but it is the peculiar form in which the gospel presents itself to the Gentiles, as the apostle says in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1">Galatians  1</a>, "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him as glad tidings among the heathen".<a name=137:4></a> I have thought that the peculiarity of Paul's ministry is this, that not only are we forgiven through Christ, but that Christ becomes the life of those who are forgiven, and that therefore it is "Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=137:5></a> It is the way in which the mystery presented itself specially to the Gentiles, "Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=137:6></a> It is a blessed thing to think that Christ is my life, Christ is in me.<a name=137:7></a> It is not only that I am in Christ -- that is a question of acceptance, and favour, and blessing; but Christ is in me.<a name=137:8></a> You get John running quite parallel with it, for he says, "He that hath the Son hath life".<a name=137:9></a> There may be a distinction between Christ and the Son, but Paul and John run on parallel lines.<a name=137:10></a> "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=137:11></a> He that hath the Son hath life".<a name=137:12></a> Christ is our life; as the Lord said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=137:13></a> And I see the wonderful grace which was manifested in His incarnation, in His becoming Man in order that we might live by Him.<a name=137:14></a> You may say, I could never live by Him if He had not died for me.<a name=137:15></a> I quite admit that; "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you".<a name=137:16></a> But I see, too, the grace of His incarnation; that He became man that we might

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another important point comes in, and that is, the ministry of Christ to the soul; that the soul may grow up into Christ; as the apostle says in the last verse but one, "Whom also we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus".<a name=138:12></a> It is not exactly here a question of the body, but of "every man"; the apostle concerned himself in regard to every individual saint, in that sense, that every one should grow up unto perfection in Christ.<a name=138:13></a> That is, that all the moral qualities of Christ, as it were, should be formed in us in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=138:14></a> A full grown man, to my mind, is a man who

	<div class="paragraph">
		not only has all the faculties, but where all the faculties are in exercise.<a name=139:1></a> And that is the idea, I think, of a full grown Christian; not simply that all the faculties are there -- the faculties are there in everybody who has received Christ -- but that all should be in exercise.<a name=139:2></a> I think that is the idea in "That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus".<a name=139:3></a> It has often been said that that verse does not refer to glory, but to the effect of ministry down here.<a name=139:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is just one word more in this connection in verses 8, 9, 10 of the next chapter: "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<a name=139:5></a> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=139:6></a> And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power".<a name=139:7></a> It is that which is now true, beloved friends, in the Person of Christ, that which characterises that Man in glory; for having become Man, He remains man for eternity.<a name=139:8></a> I am not going to attempt to explain to you what the completeness is, or what it consists of; the point of the passage is that the completeness of the Godhead is there, and it is in connection with that "you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power".<a name=139:9></a> Now I am sure you will agree with me that if you are of the order of the heavenly man there is nothing upon earth that can teach you or instruct you with regard to that.<a name=139:10></a> I meet with a very great deal here on earth that can instruct me in connection with the fallen man, and his ways, and what he is; but I can get nothing upon earth, no philosophy or anything else that can possibly instruct me with regard to the heavenly Man; and therefore I have to learn it all from Christ Himself.<a name=139:11></a> And that is what the apostle is teaching them here; "Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power"; that is, you are independent of all else; that is the great thing: I have not to turn to

	<div class="paragraph">
		I commend to your study <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>.<a name=140:8></a> There I get the great truth brought out of the wonderful grace, that heavenly grace, which has come down here, manifested in the incarnation of the Son.<a name=140:9></a> The blessed, eternal Son of God became man, came into the world, in order that He might be life to it; that is, that we might eat Him and live by Him.<a name=140:10></a> His death comes in for our deliverance, because His death was needed that we might be delivered from the flesh and its connections; but the great point is, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=140:11></a> I appropriate and feed on the heavenly grace manifest in His having become man.<a name=140:12></a> People often think the incarnation merely refers to what Christ was here after the flesh.<a name=140:13></a> It is a great

	<div class="paragraph">
		mistake.<a name=141:1></a> There is hardly a thought that is set before us in John's gospel in regard to Christ which you cannot carry on to resurrection; and the incarnation not merely refers to what He was here as come after the flesh, but it refers equally to what He now is, because He is still man.<a name=141:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to our correspondence to Him.<a name=141:3></a> That comes out here in verses 11 to 15: "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh" -- omit the words "of the sins", because they ought not to be there -- "by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.<a name=141:4></a> And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it".<a name=141:5></a> Now I want to touch on the three points which come before us here.<a name=141:6></a> The first is circumcision, which brings in the thought that we are buried with Him; the second is, we are risen with Him; and the third is, we are quickened with Him.<a name=141:7></a> The words "with him" are exceedingly important, because they give the character to the thing.<a name=141:8></a> If I were risen, simply risen, apart from risen "with him", I should be raised to judgment; and I could not conceive the thought at all of being quickened except it were "quickened together with him".<a name=141:9></a> It gives the character to it.<a name=141:10></a> The first is circumcision; and the point of the whole passage is, that what is actually true in Christ is morally true in us.<a name=141:11></a> What I mean is this; that for Him circumcision has actually taken place in the cross, and that He is actually cut off from everything after

		Now there are those three things: circumcision, which cuts Him off from all here, and He lives unto God; the bands of death are loosed, because He is raised; and He is quickened, that is, He asked life and God gave it to Him, even length of days for ever and ever.<a name=143:1></a> That is what is actually true in Christ.<a name=143:2></a> Now I say the saints are in correspondence to Christ, and that is morally true of every saint.<a name=143:3></a> You are circumcised; every saint has accepted the cross.<a name=143:4></a> You are buried with Him in baptism, the putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.<a name=143:5></a> If you have not, you can never go into the holiest, because it is only on that ground you can go in.<a name=143:6></a> Flesh never goes into the holiest.<a name=143:7></a> You can only really enjoy Christian privilege as having put off the body of the flesh.<a name=143:8></a> Every real believer is on that ground, whether he realises it or not.<a name=143:9></a> Putting off the body of the flesh is that a Christian realises spiritually that which was formally expressed in baptism.<a name=143:10></a> What for?<a name=143:11></a> So that I can be faithful and for God.<a name=143:12></a> If I am ruled by the flesh -- because the body of the flesh means the rule of the flesh -- I am sinning; for if I am ruled by the flesh I follow the bent of the flesh: "The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life".<a name=143:13></a> No, I say I have put off the body of the flesh, the rule of the flesh, that is what I profess to have done.<a name=143:14></a> And what for?<a name=143:15></a> that I may be separate to God.<a name=143:16></a> That is the idea of circumcision.<a name=143:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the second: I am risen together with Him, the bands of death are loosed for me.<a name=143:18></a> That is true morally of every Christian.<a name=143:19></a> I am no longer in terror of death.<a name=143:20></a> The bands of death are actually loosed in the case of Christ, He is actually risen; but for me they are loosed morally.<a name=143:21></a> Death is no penalty upon the saint; and now I can be with God, and death is not between.<a name=143:22></a> If death were upon me as penalty, I could not be with God; nor could you; nobody could be with God if there were a shred of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the third point, which is intimately connected with resurrection; and that is, I am quickened together with Christ, so that I might live according to God.<a name=144:3></a> I am actually by the quickening power of God made alive in a way which is suitable to God Himself; quickened in a heavenly life, in the power of the Holy Spirit, that is the meaning of it.<a name=144:4></a> That is the wonderful thing which has come to pass in every Christian.<a name=144:5></a> It is a most wonderful thing, because the words "with him" give you the character of it.<a name=144:6></a> You could not understand the character of it if it did not say "with him".<a name=144:7></a> It could hardly say in an absolute sense that we are quickened, because we have yet to be quickened in regard to our bodies; but in regard to our souls we are actually made alive before God, so that we live in the order of Christ, "in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him".<a name=144:8></a> That is the effect of being made alive in association with Christ by the power of God.<a name=144:9></a> What a thought it is!<a name=144:10></a> How far have you and I entered into it?<a name=144:11></a> That we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Jesus!<a name=144:12></a> It is not simply that I approach God, that I pray to God; but I have boldness and confidence like a son; boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Jesus; that expresses the result of quickening.<a name=144:13></a> I am brought to the blessed sense of this, that I am before God, the object of His love and favour, as a son in whom He delights, and I have the answer to it by the power of the Holy Spirit in me.<a name=144:14></a>

		I have only one word more to add as to what it says later on.<a name=145:7></a> "Let no man, therefore, judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.<a name=145:8></a> Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God".<a name=145:9></a> I want you to bear two points in mind, because they are exceedingly important.<a name=145:10></a> The body is of Christ.<a name=145:11></a> You say, Of course the body is of Christ.<a name=145:12></a> Well, but the body is of the Head.<a name=145:13></a> My body is of the Head, and my body corresponds to the Head.<a name=145:14></a> And so, as to the body of Christ, the body must correspond to Christ, else it would not be the body of Christ.<a name=145:15></a> He warns them against shadows, because in following shadows they were in great danger of losing the substance.<a name=145:16></a> The words 'body' and 'substance' are the same, and you might read it 'substance', but that

		It is, I think, comprehended in the term which we get in chapter 3 -- "the new man".<a name=148:4></a> It says, "Ye have put off the old man and have put on the new".<a name=148:5></a> That is what I want to come to tonight; how the truth is to come out in practice.<a name=148:6></a> In the first two chapters the apostle had unfolded the doctrinal groundwork of it all.<a name=148:7></a> The apostle gives us in these chapters what is true of the saints before God; that is the doctrinal basis, and then in the third chapter he gives us the exhortations, the practice in which it is to work out; so that in the character and walk of the saints down here as one body, Christ is to be reproduced.<a name=148:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I just refer for a moment to the substance of what has come before us on previous occasions.<a name=148:9></a> We began in chapter 1 with the glory of Christ, His double Headship; and with it reconciliation.<a name=148:10></a> And you must begin there, because God has seen fit to put everything on the basis of reconciliation, and if you are not reconciled, you are not in any relationship with God, because nothing has really any place before God except what is on that ground.<a name=148:11></a> Christ has made peace by the blood of his cross, to reconcile all things to himself; and I pointed out that the time has not yet come for the reconciliation of things, but that what is being effected at this time is the reconciliation of persons.<a name=148:12></a> And in connection with that, Christ comes out as the Head of the body.<a name=148:13></a> Persons are reconciled; "You now hath he reconciled".<a name=148:14></a> Then in the latter part of the first chapter, and in the second chapter, we

		saw the new order, that saints now are of a new order -- Christ is in them.<a name=149:1></a> Manifestly that is a new order; it never was true before, and I do not know that it will be true upon earth again; because as far as I can judge, it is peculiar to the church.<a name=149:2></a> "Christ in you the hope of glory"; that is the new order; and you are complete in Christ; and so it says, "As therefore ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him".<a name=149:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in addition to that, we saw the correspondence of the saints to Christ, circumcised, buried with Christ, risen with Christ, quickened together with Christ.<a name=149:4></a> I was pointing out that the expression "with Christ" which is added to these terms gives to them their character; you could not understand what it is to be risen if you did not understand risen "with Christ" nor could you know the character of the quickening if you did not see it is quickened "with Christ": that gives the character to it.<a name=149:5></a> And what it involves is this -- association with Christ; we are risen with Him, in association with Him; whatever He is risen to we are risen to; whatever He is quickened to we are quickened to.<a name=149:6></a> Just as we get in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, "Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus".<a name=149:7></a> Why?<a name=149:8></a> Because Christ "died unto sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=149:9></a> Therefore you reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=149:10></a> You are quickened together with Him; that gives the character.<a name=149:11></a>

		But I must follow the course of the exhortations, the Lord enabling me.<a name=150:13></a> "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (touch not; taste not; handle not; which all are to perish with the using), after the commandments and doctrines of men?<a name=150:14></a> Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour, to the satisfying of the flesh.<a name=150:15></a> If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=150:16></a> Now it is evident that what the apostle is urging on the Colossians he is urging on us, and that what applied to the Colossians applies to us.<a name=150:17></a> That is evident from what he says in chapter 2: 1 "I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as

		have not seen my face in the flesh".<a name=151:1></a> We have not seen the apostle's face in the flesh, and yet he had great conflict for as many as had not seen it.<a name=151:2></a> Now what he urges is consistency with our standing; that is the first thing; and he takes up in the exhortations what he had said in chapter 2: 11, 12: "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: buried with him in baptism; wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".<a name=151:3></a> He appeals to them at the close of chapter 2 as being "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world", and in the beginning of chapter 3 as being "risen with Christ".<a name=151:4></a> He says, if you are so why are you inconsistent with it?<a name=151:5></a> Why, as though living (or alive) in the world, are you subject to ordinances?<a name=151:6></a> Beloved friends, the truth is this, that people who take the ground of being alive religiously in the world may be rightly enough subject to ordinances -- may be content to be instructed without intelligence to do this and that, and to abstain from doing this and that.<a name=151:7></a> The idea of dogmatism is that I submit my will to ordinances; it is just what suits the flesh.<a name=151:8></a> It is very manifest how people are well content to surrender their consciences to spiritual directors; that is the history of Christendom to a large extent, and it existed before there was any Christianity at all, because it was the principle of heathenism, and even of Judaism.<a name=151:9></a> The difference was, that in Judaism there was the "shadow of good things to come", and, of course, there was nothing of that in heathenism.<a name=151:10></a> Still, it is a remarkable fact that when Christianity came in, the apostle does not hesitate to describe Judaism as "the beggarly elements".<a name=151:11></a> And yet in spite of this the mass of people are content to be subject to ordinances, to do what they are told to do, and to abstain from doing what they are told not to do, and that in face of the apostle's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that is exactly what the apostle will not have.<a name=152:3></a> He says, "If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world", Christ is dead from the rudiments of the world; in a sense He came under them, for He was circumcised and the like, "made of a woman, made under the law"; but He died out from them, and we are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, so that all that character of things should have no application to us at all.<a name=152:4></a> That is what the apostle brings before them.<a name=152:5></a> I am outside all that which applies religiously to man in the flesh, whatever it may be, whether heathenism or Judaism or the corrupt Christianity of the present day; if it applies to man as being alive on the earth, it has not its application to me, because I am dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, and I am privileged to understand things as before God; to have intelligence of things spiritually before God is the very opposite of being dogmatised.<a name=152:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the first thing.<a name=152:7></a> Then he goes on to say, "If ye then be risen with Christ".<a name=152:8></a> Now mark again here the expression "with Christ", because that gives the character to it.<a name=152:9></a> I was saying last time that the force of resurrection is that the bands of death are loosed.<a name=152:10></a> But there is more than that in it, because you are risen together with Christ, and if you are risen together with Christ you are in touch with heaven.<a name=152:11></a> I am quite sure that Jesus was always as man, morally in touch with the heaven from which He came; that is clear enough from what took place on the mount of Transfiguration; but more distinctly still He is seen in relation to heaven when He rose again from the dead.<a name=152:12></a> His earthly path of faith was over; and when

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I sometimes think there is a tendency to regard the things above as being something for the imagination, but it is not so.<a name=154:9></a> You could not set your mind on things above if they were not revealed; but they are revealed, and what is more, there is an energy in the Christian -- Christ is in him -- by which he can "seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=154:10></a> For if Christ is in me, in the very nature of things, the power in me will go up to its source.<a name=154:11></a> The power of the Holy Spirit in me must lead me in thought and feeling right up to the source; as it says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=154:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I believe the thought of the new man is connected with testimony here; it is really a new creation.<a name=158:5></a> It is remarkable how certain things stand connected in Scripture.<a name=158:6></a> You will find that where the Spirit of God speaks about the body of Christ, the truth of quickening is introduced; while the new man is connected with new creation.<a name=158:7></a> So it says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:15">Ephesians  2:15</a>: "For to make in himself of twain" -- the word 'make' there should be 'create' -- "to create in himself out of twain, one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby".<a name=158:8></a> There you get two thoughts, the one new man and the body.<a name=158:9></a> The thought connected with the body is to reconcile unto God both Jew and Gentile in one body; but the previous thought is that He creates out of the two in Himself one new man.<a name=158:10></a> Then in chapter 4: 24: "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created" -- there you get the thought of new creation again -- "in righteousness and holiness of truth".<a name=158:11></a> Now, as far as I can see, there is only one man now, properly, that comes under the eye of God.<a name=158:12></a> The new man has come in; and Scripture never speaks of an old until there is a new.<a name=158:13></a> The old man is the old,

		because a new man has come in; and the new man is Christ, in what I may call His moral features and character.<a name=159:1></a> I think that is the idea of the new man, and is what a Christian has put on.<a name=159:2></a> "As many of you as have been baptised into Christ, have put on Christ".<a name=159:3></a> We profess to have put off the old man and to have put on the new; to have put on Christ as to His moral features and character.<a name=159:4></a> You have to remember this, that Christ has come under the eye of God here upon earth; and even in regard to the future, in the millennium, I believe what will come under the eye of God will be Christ.<a name=159:5></a> It appears to me in that day everything will be covered, as it were, by Christ, everything is put under the hand of Christ; and all is headed up in Him.<a name=159:6></a> Now in the interval we have Christ in the saints.<a name=159:7></a> They profess, as I said, to have put on Christ.<a name=159:8></a> And that is possible, for Christ is in them.<a name=159:9></a> How could Christ come out if Christ were not in us?<a name=159:10></a> The thing would be totally impossible; but the character of Christ may come out because Christ is there.<a name=159:11></a> "Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=159:12></a> You have received Christ Jesus the Lord, and you are to walk in Him, and your testimony is to be, so to say, the character of Christ.<a name=159:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are two great thoughts connected with the new man which I will dwell upon, unity and character.<a name=159:14></a> No such thing can be found in connection with the old man, except a very bad character.<a name=159:15></a> Look at what it says: "You have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision; Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all and in all".<a name=159:16></a> If Christ is all and in all, manifestly it is unity, because it is one Christ in all the saints; it is unity because it is one new man, He makes in Himself out of twain one new man.<a name=159:17></a> It is not that there are so many new men; that is not the idea presented to us; but it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		to make out of twain one new man.<a name=160:1></a> And so here, "Christ is all and in all".<a name=160:2></a> Therefore, as he says, "There is neither Greek nor Jew".<a name=160:3></a> In the new man all these distinctions are gone; there is no Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free.<a name=160:4></a> I forget all these things in the realisation of the new man: Christ is all and in all, and my mind is, so to say, withdrawn from distinctions which exist in the flesh.<a name=160:5></a> I may have to do with those distinctions in my individual path in the wilderness, but in the circle of the saints all those distinctions have to be forgotten.<a name=160:6></a> The great truth now is unity in the new man, because Christ is all and in all, and all the distinctions which existed in the flesh are abolished in what is connected with Him in glory.<a name=160:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now look abroad for an instant on the state of Christendom.<a name=160:8></a> What a practical denial it is of the truth.<a name=160:9></a> When we see saints mixed up with profession, and separated into great professing bodies here upon earth, I say it is a denial of the truth of the one new man; because what marks them is rivalry, and opposition, and all that kind of thing.<a name=160:10></a> It only proves to me how Christianity has been degraded, and the idea of the new man completely lost.<a name=160:11></a> But here it is, and the first great thought connected with it is unity, that is, "Christ is all and in all".<a name=160:12></a> If I think of myself, Christ is in me; but then if I think of another saint, Christ is in that saint, too, and it is only one Christ, and therefore you can have but one new man.<a name=160:13></a> If you want to understand anything about true unity, you must first understand the new man; nobody can have any right thought of unity without it.<a name=160:14></a> They try to bring unity about in other ways; to get a broad platform on which Christians generally can unite; that is very common in the present day, but does not realise the Scripture thought of unity.<a name=160:15></a> When I come within the sanctuary, as it were, and into the company and association of the saints, my mind has to forget the distinctions which exist in the flesh.<a name=160:16></a> I have to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is the other point connected with the new man, namely, character.<a name=161:4></a> He says, "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<a name=161:5></a> And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<a name=161:6></a> And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.<a name=161:7></a> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another; in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord".<a name=161:8></a> Now, beloved friends, here you get character.<a name=161:9></a> There are three things on the face of it -- and I do not mean to go beyond the surface -- the first is grace, absolute forgiveness; the second is love; and the third is peace.<a name=161:10></a> They mark what is true in Christ now.<a name=161:11></a> He has forgiven us, and we are to forgive as He has forgiven us.<a name=161:12></a> Of course, it all refers here to our relations one to another; we are to forgive absolutely; as the Lord said to Peter, "not till seven times, but till seventy times seven".<a name=161:13></a> Then the next thing is "love, which is the bond of perfectness".<a name=161:14></a> And then you get peace, "Let the peace of Christ" -- for everything here is of Christ -- "rule in your hearts" -- and that is to settle every question -- "to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful".<a name=161:15></a> Now you could not have a more beautiful picture of saints in unity, all entering into this truth, that they compose the one new man.<a name=161:16></a> It is the character of Christ reproduced

		in them, the moral character of the heavenly Christ; the blessed features of it as presented here being unlimited forgiveness, and love, and peace.<a name=162:1></a> How can you conciliate such things with rivalry, or opposition, or envy, or emulation, or anything of the kind?<a name=162:2></a> I think nobody can appreciate what we get here as to the character of the new man, without seeing what an utter condemnation it is of the existing condition of Christendom as we have it before our eyes.<a name=162:3></a> The fact is, the reason of the inconsistency is this, they do not know anything at all about the doctrinal basis, for they do not know anything at all about the truth of the church, hence I can well understand that they do not know what the proper testimony of saints ought to be.<a name=162:4></a> It appears to me there are plenty of Christians in the world, and good Christians too, who know many blessings, as the forgiveness of sins, and even the gift of the Holy Spirit, but have not the faintest idea of the truth of the church.<a name=162:5></a> In a sort of statement of faith which appeared recently, in which there was much that one could endorse, I was struck with the absence of two things, namely, all allusion to a glorified Christ, and to the union of the saints with Christ.<a name=162:6></a> Therefore, if people do not apprehend those points, in which really the essence of Christianity consists, I can very well understand that they do not apprehend what ought to be the proper character and testimony of saints down here, and if you do not understand the body, you cannot understand the new man.<a name=162:7></a> The body is of the Head, and the Head is for the body; I apprehend that; but I see connected with it the blessed truth which comes out in this chapter, that is, the new man, where "Christ is all and in all".<a name=162:8></a>

		Now, beloved friends, that can never be revived; but as I was saying a week or two ago, do not let us lower the standard.<a name=162:9></a> Even if practice may not come up to it, and even if it is impossible to bring saints back to the real standard, let us have the right idea.<a name=162:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is just what I wanted to come to in this chapter.<a name=163:2></a> I do not propose to go further.<a name=163:3></a> The apostle winds up with that one word, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another; in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<a name=163:4></a> And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him".<a name=163:5></a> Beloved friends, just think of the place of the saints.<a name=163:6></a> "The elect of God", an expression which is applied to Christ; as you get in verse 12, "Put on, therefore, as the elect of God" -- that is what the saints are, "the elect of God", in the place of Christ here, and the character of Christ to come out in them as one body.<a name=163:7></a> That was the divine idea; that was the thought of the Spirit of God in regard to the saints.<a name=163:8></a> And I thank God if He has given us to see what His thought was as to the testimony of the saints here.<a name=163:9></a> As I was pointing out last time, it is the practical accomplishment of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, where He prays not only for the apostles, but for those who should believe on Him through their word, "that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=163:10></a>

		May God, beloved friends, really give us, in the light of the truth here, to see the existing condition of things, that we may have a true estimate of what is about us here in the world; not expecting to see things restored to their original condition, but not evading our responsibility to seek grace to walk in the truth as it was given at the beginning.<a name=163:11></a>

		I was dwelling a little last time on the meeting of two things in Christ.<a name=164:1></a> On the one hand, every testimony which God has ever given finds its resting-place there.<a name=164:2></a> There are many and varied testimonies of God, many indications of His mind scattered through Scripture, but whatever testimony God has ever given has now found its resting-place in Christ, and that on the foundation of righteousness.<a name=164:3></a> On the other hand, we have in Christ the full revelation of God.<a name=164:4></a> "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=164:5></a> Thus we have at the same point the full revelation of God, and the establishment in a Man of every divine purpose.<a name=164:6></a> That is what is gained by contemplating the Lord.<a name=164:7></a> There is no more light to come out.<a name=164:8></a> Christianity really comes in upon the same line, for the apostle John says, "No man has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us".<a name=164:9></a> The same formula introduces that passage as introduces the passage I have quoted from the first chapter of the gospel.<a name=164:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having said so much in regard to what is true for faith, I desire to come to another point, viz.<a name=164:11></a>, how the soul reaches the sense of new creation.<a name=164:12></a> You must distinguish between two things -- the fact of new creation, and the apprehension of it.<a name=164:13></a> New creation evidently is wholly and entirely of God; it must be so.<a name=164:14></a> If it were not, it would not be new creation.<a name=164:15></a> But in the chapter before us we find the way in which the truth is reached in a man's soul.<a name=164:16></a> There is a certain line of thought which brings us to the point of new creation which I want, by the grace of God, to trace.<a name=164:17></a>

		Now, in our spiritual experience, there are two chapters: one comes to a close, and the other is eternal.<a name=165:1></a> I purpose dwelling on these two, and especially on the one which is eternal, that is, what I spoke of just now as new creation.<a name=165:2></a> I cannot tell you much about new creation -- I can tell you what Scripture says about it.<a name=165:3></a> What I see in the passage before us is the way by which new creation is apprehended in the soul of the believer.<a name=165:4></a> New creation has taken place before we have much apprehension of it.<a name=165:5></a> It is difficult to understand that anyone should be the subject of new creation without having an apprehension of it, but it is clear that any work of God must precede the apprehension of it on our part.<a name=165:6></a> A babe has some consciousness of life, but then life must be there.<a name=165:7></a> And the same holds good as to new creation.<a name=165:8></a>

		We have in the chapter this expression on the part of the apostle: "Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be acceptable to him.<a name=165:9></a> For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<a name=165:10></a> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.<a name=165:11></a> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.<a name=165:12></a> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause".<a name=165:13></a> In the course of the passage, the apostle alludes to two influences which affected him powerfully.<a name=165:14></a> One was the knowing the fear of the Lord, and the other, the love of Christ.<a name=165:15></a> "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord" is connected with the judgment-seat of Christ, and the fear of the Lord is evidently a very different thought from the love of Christ, and yet the apostle was greatly affected by

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to come to the other chapter in Christian experience which runs concurrently with the one of which I have spoken.<a name=167:5></a> "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.<a name=167:6></a> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if One died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again.<a name=167:7></a> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.<a name=167:8></a> Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new.<a name=167:9></a> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation".<a name=167:10></a> Now, I desire, by the grace of God, to open up a little this line.<a name=167:11></a> It is of a very different order indeed to what preceded, for it does not contemplate our responsibility, but that which is in contrast to our responsibility, viz.<a name=167:12></a>, the work of God.<a name=167:13></a> The Christian has his responsibility; you cannot, as we have seen, be apart from responsibility and the sense of it as long as Christ is absent.<a name=167:14></a> The Lord left His servants to take care of His household in His absence.<a name=167:15></a> Everything tends to accentuate the thought of responsibility in the absence of Christ, but that is

		Now, the first point in this line is the love of Christ, and that which is the peculiar expression of that love.<a name=168:3></a> The love of Christ is abiding.<a name=168:4></a> The expression of it was in a moment; death was the expression of His love, but the love was there to be expressed.<a name=168:5></a> Jesus Christ is "the same, yesterday, today, and for ever", but there was a moment when He gave expression to His love, and the expression which He gave of His love -- and it was <i>divine</i> love -- was that He died for all.<a name=168:6></a>

		I was speaking on a previous occasion of the wonderful truth that Christ has brought into death the testimony of God's love.<a name=168:7></a> It is there that we learn that love.<a name=168:8></a> There never was a person yet that learned the love of God but in the death of Christ.<a name=168:9></a> They may have had ideas about it, but no one ever learned the greatness or reality of it save in the death of Christ.<a name=168:10></a> It is true that what is spoken of here is not exactly the love of God, but "the love of Christ constrains us, because we thus judge, that if One died for all, then were all dead".<a name=168:11></a> The love of God refers usually to all, to men as men, but the love of Christ refers rather to those who are the objects of divine purpose.<a name=168:12></a> Christ went into death that He might acquire rights over all, but in order that those who live should live to Him.<a name=168:13></a> I think that is the light in which His death is viewed here.<a name=168:14></a> The apostle argues here, "If one died for all, then were all dead".<a name=168:15></a> That is a most solemn consideration.<a name=168:16></a> If you would arrive at the truth of new creation, you must begin by accepting that "if one died for all, then were all dead".<a name=168:17></a> The death of Christ is the most solemn witness of the state of man that ever was given in this world.<a name=168:18></a> It is, indeed, a new witness.<a name=168:19></a> God had given many a witness of the state of man, but the most solemn witness is the death of Christ; the simple fact of the death of Christ is the proof that all were dead.<a name=168:20></a>

		If Christ died, it proved that there was no one here in life under the eye of God.<a name=169:1></a> I think there are Christians who have never accepted the solemnity of that.<a name=169:2></a> When I see people disposed to take their own course here, and to give more or less licence to their own wills, it proves to me that they have never accepted the truth that "if one died for all, then were all dead".<a name=169:3></a> You cannot exaggerate the solemnity of the testimony of the death of Christ.<a name=169:4></a> It was the expression of divine love on the part of God, but also the testimony that all were under death.<a name=169:5></a> That is very sweeping, for it sets aside all the pretension of man down here, and witnesses the absolute right and title which Christ has over those who live: "they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again".<a name=169:6></a> The Christian has thus no title to live to himself.<a name=169:7></a> He has to accept the death of Christ as God's testimony that death was upon him, and if he takes the ground of claiming to live, he has no title to live to himself, but to Christ.<a name=169:8></a> That is the standard now.<a name=169:9></a>

		There were two ways in which this affected the apostle: he was beside himself to God, and sober for the sake of the saints.<a name=169:10></a> It is a great thing to be beside oneself to God.<a name=169:11></a> In coming to God, you are withdrawn from the things here into which sobriety enters.<a name=169:12></a> The apostle was beside himself to God, that is, he did not order his communications with God according to the limitations of sober sense.<a name=169:13></a> His communications with God were according to the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=169:14></a> On the other hand, with the saints sobriety comes in.<a name=169:15></a> What I understand by this is the ability to take a sober estimate of all connected with and that affected them.<a name=169:16></a> And this was the way in which the love of Christ wrought in the apostle.<a name=169:17></a> It came out in that way.<a name=169:18></a>

		We come now to the point of new creation: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, there is a new creation".<a name=170:14></a> The truth is that there is a new man come upon the scene, that is, a new order of man, and a new order of man means a completely new system of affections.<a name=170:15></a> Supposing that it were possible for man to be completely set right as man down here, that would not alter the system of affections proper to man.<a name=170:16></a> The system would abide, though the affections were purified.<a name=170:17></a> One can understand that many would like that -- they would like still to maintain in all their force the links of natural life down here, with the affections that are connected with those links purified, but that is not new creation.<a name=170:18></a> New creation means another order of

		man, and so, another order of relationships and affections.<a name=171:1></a> I have thought over an expression, "new nature", that people have commonly used.<a name=171:2></a> It appears to me to be too limited an expression to convey new creation.<a name=171:3></a> It does not give me the idea of a new man.<a name=171:4></a> When you have got the new man, then you can talk about his nature; but you must have the man first.<a name=171:5></a> And having the man, you must connect with the man a system of relationships and affections suitable to him.<a name=171:6></a> I think that a great many Christians fail to see that.<a name=171:7></a> They regard Christianity as a kind of purification of the relationships existing.<a name=171:8></a> I have no doubt that a Christian makes a better father, husband, or child than any other.<a name=171:9></a> But that is not new creation.<a name=171:10></a> All the relationships and affections which exist in connection with natural life down here will pass away for the Christian -- they all come to an end in death.<a name=171:11></a> They are connected with human life down here, and come to an end with it.<a name=171:12></a> They will not pass beyond.<a name=171:13></a> But what has been brought into view by the power of God is a new man, created after God, and at the same time a new and complete system of relationships and affections which do not pass away.<a name=171:14></a> I have no doubt that it is in that connection that eternal life comes in.<a name=171:15></a> Eternal life <i>is</i> eternal life, and we are brought into eternal life in Christ already, and so into relationships and affections which are new and of God.<a name=171:16></a> The new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=171:17></a> But it is a new man with new affections and new sensibilities.<a name=171:18></a> Everything in the new man is according to God -- holiness and righteousness, affections and sensibilities -- and Christ is the proper expression of them.<a name=171:19></a> We find in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>that "there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all, and in all".<a name=171:20></a> And the sensibilities, the affections, the peace and the word of Christ are to characterise the Christian down here.<a name=171:21></a> You are to put on love, which

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		is the bond of perfectness, and the working of this is that God becomes the supreme object of love.<a name=172:1></a> Christ has His proper place in the affections of the Christian, as the apostle puts it here: "The love of Christ constrains us".<a name=172:2></a> And there are, too, relations down here with the saints.<a name=172:3></a> "By this we know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren" -- those who are equally with ourselves the subjects of new creation.<a name=172:4></a> They have the first place with the Christian down here.<a name=172:5></a> Now, that is important, for in new creation you have to do with eternal things, and you are brought into that here.<a name=172:6></a> They are things which are unseen and eternal, but they begin while we are still down here upon earth.<a name=172:7></a> That being so, they must of necessity take precedence over things which are upon earth.<a name=172:8></a> The apostle says further, "All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation: to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.<a name=172:9></a> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech by us: we pray, in Christ's stead.<a name=172:10></a> Be ye reconciled to God; for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=172:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe how intimately the truth of new creation is bound up with reconciliation.<a name=172:12></a> I think reconciliation is largely misunderstood.<a name=172:13></a> The idea of reconciliation in many minds is of some change in themselves, but that is not the divine idea.<a name=172:14></a> God has reconciled us.<a name=172:15></a> I could not say God <i>is</i> reconciled.<a name=172:16></a> There are two thoughts presented here: the <i>ministry</i> of reconciliation, and the <i>word</i> of reconciliation.<a name=172:17></a> When the Lord Jesus was here upon earth, He was here in the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=172:18></a> It was the outset of it: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them,

		<a name=173>[Page 173]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=173:1></a> The fact is that the very presence of Christ here meant reconciliation.<a name=173:2></a> It meant that God had bridged over the distance that stood between Him and man, and in the coming of Christ all stood for Him on a new basis.<a name=173:3></a> Man was approached on wholly different ground, and that was in view of the death of Christ; but the fact remains that God was approaching man down here in the Person of Christ.<a name=173:4></a> If God had imputed trespasses, there could not, of course, have been reconciliation; but when Christ was here, God was not imputing trespasses.<a name=173:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the <i>word</i> of reconciliation.<a name=173:6></a> The force of 'word' is testimony, and the testimony of reconciliation was, that in the death of Christ the moral distance between God and man had been completely and eternally removed for God's glory in the judicial end of man in the cross; and further, God had made the very removal of man to be the occasion of the expression of His love.<a name=173:7></a> Love has come in where distance was.<a name=173:8></a> That is what the cross meant.<a name=173:9></a> All that was effected, so to speak, in a moment in the death of Christ.<a name=173:10></a> Now, the apostle says, "God hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=173:11></a> In accepting the light of the cross, people received reconciliation.<a name=173:12></a> Now this connects itself with the truth of new creation.<a name=173:13></a> If there were not new creation, one could not be in the full enjoyment of God's love.<a name=173:14></a> But new creation is there, and in virtue of it we are in the enjoyment of reconciliation; conscious, on the one hand, that the infinite distance that existed between God and man has been removed in the death of Christ to the glory of God, and that in the place of the distance there is love.<a name=173:15></a> God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=173:16></a> You have to remember that when the righteousness of God came out in Christianity, the love of God was behind it.<a name=173:17></a> God made him sin for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is plain that new creation and reconciliation are very intimately connected.<a name=174:2></a> No one could enjoy the thought of reconciliation if there were not new creation.<a name=174:3></a> The Christian is thus a man of another order; he is after the order of Christ.<a name=174:4></a> "As is the heavenly, such are the heavenly".<a name=174:5></a> He is according to God, and, as being according to God, he can enjoy the thought of reconciliation, and this is as being of God.<a name=174:6></a> The apostle says, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>"We joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation".<a name=174:7></a> I do not believe that any Christian can be in the enjoyment of reconciliation but as being in the apprehension of the love of God.<a name=174:8></a> The very presence of Christ here was the expression of His love.<a name=174:9></a> It showed that God had no pleasure in the distance.<a name=174:10></a> And there was the blessed testimony, divinely given, down here, of divine love.<a name=174:11></a> The Lord bore testimony that "God so loved the world".<a name=174:12></a> In the cross the distance was removed, and in the place of the distance we find the love.<a name=174:13></a> You get an illustration of it in the parable of the prodigal son in his coming back to the father.<a name=174:14></a> The distance was gone, and the love was there, and that marks properly our relation with God.<a name=174:15></a>

		As I said at the beginning, we get two chapters opened out here; one, which will be brought to a close at the judgment-seat of Christ, never to be reopened; and the other, which tells us of the work of God, as the effect and result of which, we enjoy the blessed truth of reconciliation.<a name=174:16></a> There is the process by which the soul arrives at the truth of new creation.<a name=174:17></a> This begins with the witness of the death of Christ.<a name=174:18></a> We know no one after the flesh, not even Christ.<a name=174:19></a> That is all passed away.<a name=174:20></a> But we come to new creation, where all things are of God.<a name=174:21></a> Everything in the line of new creation takes its character from God morally.<a name=174:22></a>

		It is a fact that we learn most things by contrast; our minds are so constituted that there are really few things that we learn except in that way.<a name=176:3></a> I could show you how in the word of God things are continually presented in contrast, because God knows well what poor feeble things we are, and He puts things before us in that way so that our minds may be able, in measure, to comprehend them.<a name=176:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to bring before you some things which will characterise the millennial age, what God has in view for that time.<a name=176:5></a> I see distinctly in the word of God that from the time sin came into this world, God had in view a world of His own, and I always read <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>as connecting itself with "the world to come, whereof we speak".<a name=176:6></a> Every trait of faith there brought out in principle connects itself with that world.<a name=176:7></a> The world here was ruined by man listening to the enemy, the enemy obtained a footing in it, and Satan has now come out as the god and prince of this world.<a name=176:8></a> Such a world will not do for God.<a name=176:9></a> God may bear with it and work out His ways in it; but it will not do for God; and what God made known to faith was that He would have a world of His own.<a name=176:10></a> In the epistle to the Hebrews we have the revelation of the

		In regard to the first, God made known, from ever the time that a real type of redemption came in, that He intended to dwell among men on earth.<a name=177:6></a> I suppose everyone here knows what I refer to -- the redemption of His people out of Egypt in virtue of the blood of the passover Lamb.<a name=177:7></a> God's purpose was not only to redeem them -- it was that He might dwell among them.<a name=177:8></a> The moment they come into the wilderness we get God's dwelling-place: that is what the book of Exodus presents.<a name=177:9></a> If you sum up the book, the first thing is redemption, the deliverance of His people; the second is the order of God's dwelling.<a name=177:10></a> He was going to set up His dwelling-place among His people.<a name=177:11></a> When we get to Leviticus we have the truth of approach to God; the tabernacle was there, and Leviticus brings before us the great truth of approach to God.<a name=177:12></a> I merely refer to that as indicating the order of God's purposes.<a name=177:13></a> It has often been pointed out that God did not dwell with Adam or with Abraham; but when God has a redeemed people, then it is that He can establish His dwelling-place.<a name=177:14></a>

		One more point comes out at the close of the chapter: "Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus".<a name=185:13></a> When I come to speak of the future, I do not read anything at all about growth: I do not think that idea comes in there; growth comes in now because we are of a new kind, and therefore there must be growth, because every saint begins as a babe in Christ.<a name=185:14></a> Every man begins of necessity as a babe, and has to grow up into a perfect man.<a name=185:15></a> The idea of a perfect man is where all the moral faculties are in exercise.<a name=185:16></a> The faculties are all in the babe, but they have to be developed.<a name=185:17></a> The

		I have often coveted the ability to present Christ in glory to the saints; I should like to be able to minister to the saints what Paul spoke of when he said, "I determined to know nothing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified".<a name=186:2></a> Who of us has an adequate idea of the greatness and glory of that risen Man?<a name=186:3></a> The first great thing is to see that He is a Man of another order, not only that He has gone to glory, but that He is from heaven: He is heavenly.<a name=186:4></a> Do you want to know some of the features of the heavenly Man?<a name=186:5></a> Righteousness, holiness, blamelessness, love, boldness, access, confidence -- those are the features of the Man out of heaven.<a name=186:6></a> And now He has gone to the Father, and we see Him no more; but He has put us in the Father's presence; He has gone there in a condition which is the full and adequate expression of the mighty power of God in resurrection.<a name=186:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must all have been struck by the way in which the Lord in this passage (chapter 24: 45 to 25: 30) turns away for the moment from the subject which was mainly before His mind, namely, the coming of the Son of man, and the judgment of the living nations, to bring out the ground and nature of the responsibility of those who confess Him as Lord during His absence.<a name=188:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position was that in which the disciples were about to find themselves placed, and is that which we also occupy, and I have thought it might be profitable to dwell a little on our relations to an absent Lord, and the way we are affected by the expectation of His return.<a name=188:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Three parables are introduced into the passage -- first, of the servants in relation to the household; second, of the virgins in relation to the bridegroom; and, thirdly, the servants in regard to the substance entrusted to them.<a name=188:3></a> In every case the predominant thought is profession and responsibility, which the absence of the Lord serves to test, and which is dealt with on His coming.<a name=188:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here it may be observed how much there is now on the earth, that, so to say, belongs to and is of deep interest to an absent Lord.<a name=188:5></a> We have three distinct thoughts in this way -- a household, rights (the bridegroom has the bride), and substance -- and the fact that He has rights and interests here secures His return.<a name=188:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we may consider the passage a little in detail.<a name=188:7></a> The uncertainty of the moment of the Son of man's coming has made manifest the need of watching, and the Lord takes occasion to show the character which

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=189>[Page 189]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		true watching would take.<a name=189:1></a> For a servant to say he is watching for the return of a master, and yet to be unconcerned as to that close to his hand which is of supreme interest to his master, would be manifestly inconsistent.<a name=189:2></a> The fact has to be recognised that the Master has a household here.<a name=189:3></a> Christ came to His own, and His own received Him not, but to as many as received Him, to them He gave title to take the place of the children of God.<a name=189:4></a> In the time that God hides His face from the house of Jacob -- and while Christ waits on Jehovah -- He says, Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me.<a name=189:5></a> To have had the nation would have been more public glory; but the household lies closer to His heart, and the household is left here under the care, in a sense, of servants during the Master's absence.<a name=189:6></a> The apparent delay in His return gives opportunity to the servants to show whether they are seeking their master's interests, or doing their own will.<a name=189:7></a> On the one hand, faithfulness to the Master would be evidenced by the expectation of His return, and would be displayed in diligent care for the need of the household; on the other hand, the thought of delay in the Master's return would bring to light in the evil servant the spirit of domination and worldliness, smiting his fellow-servants and eating and drinking with the drunken.<a name=189:8></a> It may, I think, be said that in the servants is represented the spirit of the teaching body.<a name=189:9></a> The evil servant has found his embodiment in what has ruled in popery and the like -- wherever there is a constituted clerical body and practical unbelief in the coming of the Lord.<a name=189:10></a> On the other hand, those who in faith take the ground of being set to care for the household have to remember that the household will in large measure take its character from what is heard and seen in the teachers (their doctrine and manner of life) and that the teachers on their part prove by their conduct in the household whether they are faithful in heart, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what follows -- the parable of the virgins -- we have a similitude of the kingdom of the heavens, a picture of the state of things (in the sphere where the moral sway of heaven is owned) which would immediately precede the return of the bridegroom.<a name=190:3></a> As we have seen, the bridegroom presents to us one that has rights.<a name=190:4></a> The profession is that of virgins, who have gone forth from the world to meet the bridegroom.<a name=190:5></a> They recognise and testify of the rights of the bridegroom of which He is not yet in possession, and, as virgins, they hold themselves uncontaminated from the human spirit around.<a name=190:6></a> While the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept.<a name=190:7></a> At the midnight cry all arose, shook themselves free from influences here and trimmed their lamps -- foolish as well as wise -- the wise having oil in their vessels, recognised the presence of the Spirit here and hence were in readiness.<a name=190:8></a> They were by the Spirit in real separation from the world.<a name=190:9></a> With the foolish it was imitation.<a name=190:10></a> We have through mercy been awakened to see that the Spirit is here to maintain a testimony for Christ in His absence, and in having part in the Spirit we are in readiness for the coming of the bridegroom.<a name=190:11></a> We have not to prepare.<a name=190:12></a> Wisdom is seen in the recognition of the presence of the Spirit, and consequent readiness; foolishness in the effort to be ready.<a name=190:13></a> Thus the testimony of the return of Christ has its answer in an awakening to the original profession of going forth, and in the recognition that having the Spirit we are ready.<a name=190:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Following the parable of the virgins we have presented to us another aspect of the state of things in the absence of Christ.<a name=190:15></a> A man going into a far country has called his own servants and distributed among them His substance according to their several ability.<a name=190:16></a> In the parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19">Luke  19</a>, where each servant receives

	<div class="paragraph">
		a pound, the thought appears to be that the servants are set up by the master with capital with which to trade in a sense to their own ultimate advantage.<a name=191:1></a> In Matthew I think the point is that the master of the servants distributes his substance (not in a burdensome way, but according to every man's several ability) to be used for <i>his</i> gain.<a name=191:2></a> The reward to those that are faithful is to enter into the joy of <i>their</i> Lord.<a name=191:3></a> The useless servant who had his own false estimate of his master's character neglected the talent entrusted to him, and is cast into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.<a name=191:4></a> Thus the faithfulness of the servants is tested, and, as seen in the parables which have preceded, their conduct is evidently governed by the expectation or otherwise of their lord's return.<a name=191:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To sum up, we have seen how much an absent Lord has here that is of interest and value to Himself -- a household, the care of which demands vigilance, rights to be maintained in faithful testimony (lights burning), and substance which calls for faithfulness in the use of it.<a name=191:6></a> Then we see the qualities suitable in those who are here for Christ's name in His absence -- faithfulness and prudence in those over the household, wisdom in those that have gone forth to meet the Bridegroom, and goodness and faithfulness in those entrusted with their Lord's substance.<a name=191:7></a> Further we apprehend the effect on such of the expectation of the Lord's return -- the prudent and faithful servant is vigilant in care to minister to the household, the wise virgins recognise their readiness by the Spirit to go in to the marriage, and the faithful servants are diligent in the employment of their Lord's substance.<a name=191:8></a> On the other hand we learn that what is evil, foolish, and unprofitable is utterly rejected and disowned on the coming of the Lord.<a name=191:9></a>

		I could not, beloved brethren, pretend for an instant to carry your thoughts to where what we have heard would carry them.<a name=193:1></a> But in confirmation of what has been brought before us, I have read this scripture, and would seek to bring out a little, the line on which Christ came here; feeling that it involves truth of vital importance to our souls.<a name=193:2></a>

		The greatest service that can, perhaps, be rendered at the present moment to saints is so to minister to them the truth, as to transfer them as to the state of their souls from the ground of man's responsibility to the ground of divine counsel.<a name=193:3></a>

		There is a tendency in every one of us to limit the grace of God to the clearance of our responsibility; but though all is cleared, I do not think for a moment that that is the measure of grace, nor is it really the line on which Christ came into this world.<a name=193:4></a>

		If you study the epistle to the Hebrews you may see that the evident object of the apostle is to lead those whom he addresses, off the ground of law, and to place them on that of the purpose of God.<a name=193:5></a> They were naturally on the ground of ordinances, and were accustomed to connect religion with their responsible life down here.<a name=193:6></a> The law did not go beyond the measure of man's responsibility.<a name=193:7></a> It was interwoven with the responsible life of man on earth, although it contained "the shadow of good things to come".<a name=193:8></a> Under the old covenant, religion was mixed up with responsibility; but now the counsel of God is revealed, God is bringing many sons to glory.<a name=193:9></a>

		It is evident that promise is the expression of counsel, and indeed apart from counsel we should not have promise.<a name=193:10></a> In chapter 6 it is stated that, "God, willing

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look around, it would not perhaps be too much to say that the greatest part of Christians are little more than advanced Jews; that is, their Christianity (religion rather) is interwoven with their responsible life down here: they know something of grace, and of the forgiveness of sins; but their religion may be said not to be beyond what is suited to man on earth -- it is interwoven with their responsible everyday life.<a name=194:5></a> That is well enough in its place, but it is not the height of grace -- not Christianity; and it indicates a lack of apprehension of the counsel of God; for what God has now given us is a calling in its nature entirely outside of our responsible life on this earth.<a name=194:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ".<a name=194:7></a> How could this be spoken of as part of our responsible life?<a name=194:8></a> Clearly it is God's calling, not our responsibility; and what should be desired and sought after is, that saints should be led into the apprehension of God's calling in grace, for the more the calling is apprehended the more they will come out in the colour of it.<a name=194:9></a> The more anyone apprehends the calling the more he will seek to carry the souls of the saints into it; and the more they apprehend it the more will it affect their responsible life here, and the manner in which they carry out their duties here.<a name=194:10></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:26">Hebrews  9:26</a> - 28 and chapter 10 the apostle is putting Christ in contrast to the law; the force of the passage at the end of chapter 9 is marred by the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=195>[Page 195]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		division of the chapters; evidently the great point is to put in contrast the yearly recurrence of the sacrifices with the complete and efficacious character of the work of Christ.<a name=195:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two distinct thoughts in verses 26 and 28 -- the dealing with sin and with sins.<a name=195:2></a> I have more than once felt thankful for the passage, as it appears to me to throw a reflex light on what was foreshadowed in the day of atonement; for though in contrast with the day of atonement it is nevertheless instructive as to it.<a name=195:3></a> Evidently allusion to the day of atonement is made in the end of chapter 9, and apart from verse 26, I could hardly have associated sin with the day of atonement; I judge that what this verse teaches us is that the carrying in of the blood on the day of atonement indicated the clearing of sin as before God.<a name=195:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not see that sin is here viewed as man's responsibility.<a name=195:5></a> In verse 28 sins are so viewed; verse 28 is the complete clearance of responsibility.<a name=195:6></a> But it is plain enough that what the work Christ came to accomplish was to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, and that is the complete clearing away of sin from before God in order that God might have a free hand to accomplish His counsel.<a name=195:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the line on which Christ came, and in this light <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>is here quoted, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God".<a name=195:8></a> We have the will of God presented in contrast to the offerings under the law: He taketh away the first, that He may establish the second.<a name=195:9></a> He takes away the system of offerings which were connected with man's responsibility -- the first, that He may establish the second.<a name=195:10></a> And what is that?<a name=195:11></a> God removed by Christ that which caused distance between Himself and us.<a name=195:12></a> The will, the good pleasure of God, was to remove every bit of distance between Himself and man.<a name=195:13></a> The cause of the distance between God and man has been removed, and whether we apprehend it or not, God has come close to us.<a name=195:14></a> The veil was rent

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is blessed to know that all distance is gone, whether we apprehend it or not.<a name=196:3></a> God in His boundless love and grace has drawn near to us, and the wonderful display of this is in the work of the cross.<a name=196:4></a> The veil was rent from the top to the bottom.<a name=196:5></a> No mere human mind could conceive such a thought as that the will of God was to remove every bit of distance between Himself and man; that in it He might be fully revealed, and Himself and His love fully known and enjoyed in the most perfect nearness and intimacy.<a name=196:6></a> I need hardly say that unless there were a corresponding work of grace in us it would be all unavailing.<a name=196:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For a true idea of eternal life you must put together what is presented in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>and 4.<a name=196:8></a> Chapter 3 is objective, chapter 4, subjective.<a name=196:9></a> In the one we see God coming out as the Giver of it, and in the other, the corresponding state in us, "A well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=196:10></a> The water that Christ gives cannot be disconnected from the believer nor the believer from it.<a name=196:11></a> It is a well of water in him.<a name=196:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to the truth before us, we see in chapter 10 that He does away with the one, the order of sacrifices under law, that He may establish the other -- the will of God, by which will we are sanctified.<a name=196:13></a> We thus see how the whole system of offerings is set aside, that God may establish another and a better thing.<a name=196:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add a few words on how He makes good to us that will.<a name=196:15></a> It is in putting us in company with the very One who came to accomplish His will.<a name=196:16></a> By that will we are sanctified through the offering of Jesus Christ, and the sanctification is that we are of the kindred and company of the priest.<a name=196:17></a> The Sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one -- are one company, like Aaron and his sons, and He is not ashamed to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the apostle adds a word to show the completeness of the clearance of those who are sanctified, first contrasting the position of Christ with that of priests under the law.<a name=197:8></a> "This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God .<a name=197:9></a>.<a name=197:10></a>.<a name=197:11></a> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".<a name=197:12></a> They who are sanctified by God's will are perfected by one offering.<a name=197:13></a> If sins are not completely cleared, they never can be for there remains no more offering.<a name=197:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object in Hebrews is not to unfold the ground and doctrine of justification, but to show the completeness of it -- "perfected for ever".<a name=197:15></a> We get the practical part of the chapter in verses 23 - 25.<a name=197:16></a> We are to consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as we see the day approaching.<a name=197:17></a> We have individual privilege, but we have also special obligations one toward another, and responsibility, through grace, for one another's welfare.<a name=197:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the wonderful reality before us that our salvation is commensurate with the revelation of God, and taught of Him to enter into the true apprehension of it, its gracious effect will be wrought in us, in leading us to the acceptance and fulfilment of our responsibilities in a true care for the spiritual welfare of one another.<a name=197:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two passages in the gospel of Luke, beloved brethren, to which I should like to turn: <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:20">Luke  15:20</a> - 24; chapter 17: 11 - 21; chapter 18: 15 - 30.<a name=198:1></a> It appears to me that the more we get instructed in divine truths the more we see that there are certain things which <i>must</i> be.<a name=198:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture does not present truths in an arbitrary or fragmentary way, but shows us that certain consequences must follow from what God is, and the way in which He has revealed Himself.<a name=198:3></a> I can compare it to astronomy.<a name=198:4></a> In the solar system, when an astronomer knows the place and influence of the sun, he knows the course which other bodies in that system must take.<a name=198:5></a> It is simple to see that the courses of the subordinate bodies are governed by the influence of the sun.<a name=198:6></a> These things afford us an illustration of the truth.<a name=198:7></a> In proportion as you get acquaintance with God you see that other things must be, because of what God is.<a name=198:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is the centre of the moral universe, as the sun is of the solar system, and He has set His creatures as it were in orbits.<a name=198:9></a> Anyone who knows astronomy has an idea of what would ensue if a planet left its orbit; but that is what has taken place morally.<a name=198:10></a> Satan -- a creature -- fell from his orbit, the fallen angels from theirs, and man from his; the results we know.<a name=198:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what we see is that God has revealed Himself in a power in which He is able to recover, not to put man back on the old footing, but to put all on an infinitely more blessed platform than in creation, because God is revealed morally, and that of necessity puts all on different ground.<a name=198:12></a> Now that we have the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=199>[Page 199]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		revelation of God in His blessed being and ways we find a vastly more perfect system of blessing.<a name=199:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to say a word about is of what must be true in Christianity.<a name=199:2></a> From the nature of the revelation of God you have an inner and an outer.<a name=199:3></a> The inner is a calling entirely above and outside of man's natural being and path here on earth.<a name=199:4></a> It flows from the revelation that God has been pleased to make of Himself.<a name=199:5></a> If God has been pleased to reveal Himself, as He has, the privilege must be commensurate with the revelation.<a name=199:6></a> But it is also true that the Christian is on earth, not under law and prophets, but in the kingdom of God -- and this is the outer -- for we are left down here to fill up the rest of our life in flesh for God's will.<a name=199:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be noted that two things are presented in Luke -- the Father's house and the kingdom -- and we shall see the place and importance of each to the Christian.<a name=199:8></a> Neither one nor the other can be held exclusively; you must see both.<a name=199:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should like for a moment to refer to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a> - 19, where you get exactly the same principle.<a name=199:10></a> There are manifestly two ideas there.<a name=199:11></a> One is Christ's assembly; the other, the kingdom of heaven.<a name=199:12></a> The one is the inner, and the other the outer.<a name=199:13></a> The one refers to us corporately, the other individually.<a name=199:14></a> The Christian has part in both, and it is important to apprehend both.<a name=199:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth as to Christ's Person had been revealed, and now there was a rock upon which Christ could build His church.<a name=199:16></a> <i>The "rock" is the confession of Christ as the Son of the living God -- in the glory of His Person</i>.<a name=199:17></a> The soul has the sense of His supremacy.<a name=199:18></a> That is the rock, so to say, in the soul of the believer.<a name=199:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ's assembly is a corporate idea, and the structure is here.<a name=199:20></a> Saints are all component parts of the structure, and it is a great thing to enter into the fact -- as otherwise we drop down to congregationalism.<a name=199:21></a> Christ's assembly is not simply a congregation, but a

	<div class="paragraph">
		structure of which each saint is a stone.<a name=200:1></a> A congregation might be characterised by the holding of certain truths, but it would not be thereby a structure -- there might be no building.<a name=200:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have also in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:19">Matthew  16:19</a> the thought of the kingdom and the place which the Lord has in regard to it.<a name=200:3></a> He gives to Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=200:4></a> He says, 'You are to act for Me on earth'.<a name=200:5></a> Christ is as man the great Luminary set in heaven to rule or govern on earth, and Peter was to act down here in the light of heaven.<a name=200:6></a> We have to act down here under the authority of Christ in all that is connected with the service of His name.<a name=200:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both things are true to the Christian.<a name=200:8></a> He is a stone in the structure as the result of the work in his soul, that is the inner; but he has an outer sphere, too, the kingdom, where he has to act under Christ's authority on earth.<a name=200:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come to the gospel of Luke.<a name=200:10></a> Now, beloved friends, I have something to say here, and I trust to be enabled to say it.<a name=200:11></a> We read, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: and let us eat, and be merry", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:22">Luke  15:22</a>, 23.<a name=200:12></a> I do not think this scripture presents the height of divine counsel, but it is a most wonderful revelation of the grace of God, and the pleasure of God in recovery.<a name=200:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What would have become of man on earth if God had not come out to recover?<a name=200:14></a> The pleasure of God is in recovery.<a name=200:15></a> It is what chapter 15 conveys.<a name=200:16></a> We have in the chapter every divine Person active in grace.<a name=200:17></a> It is the administration of grace.<a name=200:18></a> The shepherd seeks the sheep, the woman sweeps the house, the father runs to meet the prodigal.<a name=200:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One word on the "best robe"; I think you cannot leave out in this the thought of <i>state</i>.<a name=201:5></a> If you do not allow that this thought is involved, you put the best robe over the prodigal's rags, and it is not the thought of God to cover thus the moral ruin of the prodigal.<a name=201:6></a> He provides something entirely new.<a name=201:7></a> If he is accepted in Christ, Christ is also in him.<a name=201:8></a> It is not in my judgment the same as the wedding garment in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#20">Matthew  20</a>.<a name=201:9></a> That was a necessity -- a man had no business to be at the feast without it.<a name=201:10></a> It was an insult to the king to disregard what was provided for the guest.<a name=201:11></a> The man without the wedding garment said virtually, 'I am fitted to be here by suitability of my own'.<a name=201:12></a> The wedding garment is divine righteousness for a sinner -- the only title to be at the festivity.<a name=201:13></a> The <i>best</i> robe was put on after reconciliation had been effected.<a name=201:14></a> It formed no part of the prodigal's first inheritance, but was what the Father brought out; it is <i>Christ</i> -- not only as covering the prodigal, but <i>Christ in</i> the prodigal.<a name=201:15></a> The result is the prodigal is perfectly fit and conscious of being received.<a name=201:16></a> He is there in the state suited to the place.<a name=201:17></a> He is at home there.<a name=201:18></a> That is what I mean by the inner, and that is the glory of the Christian, and I compassionate any Christian who has no sense of his glory.<a name=201:19></a> My glory is what I am with the Father, not what I am in the world.<a name=201:20></a> How far do we know what it is to be withdrawn from the outward of our life here and to retreat into the inner

		Then in the latter part of the chapter we find that riches which give a man importance in the world, and are the token of material prosperity, make it difficult for him to enter into the kingdom.<a name=203:10></a> The tendency naturally is that when a man is compassed with material prosperity he does not care for the moral, that is, the revelation of divine goodness.<a name=203:11></a> There is a conflict always going on between the material and the moral, and man's soul is the battleground.<a name=203:12></a>

		I have read this chapter not with the purpose of expounding it, but as following the line of thought which came before us in the last lecture.<a name=217:1></a> My point was to show the superiority of Christ to man.<a name=217:2></a> You will say, of course, everybody takes that for granted; but I think it is not only to be taken for granted, but an apprehension should be gained of it.<a name=217:3></a> What we want is the knowledge of Christ.<a name=217:4></a> The apostle Paul speaks of "The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ".<a name=217:5></a> We may have lost opportunities and advantages here and we want compensation.<a name=217:6></a> I do not think God intends us to be without compensation.<a name=217:7></a> I am afraid people do not always get the compensation, and have a sort of regret as to what they have sacrificed, but that is a poor thing.<a name=217:8></a> Paul had made sacrifices, had evidently given up a great deal, reputation, connections and associations, but he had compensation, and it was found in "The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord".<a name=217:9></a> Therefore, the knowledge of Christ is a very great point for the Christian.<a name=217:10></a>

		I took up two or three points last time in connection with chapter 2, points of interest, showing the superiority of Christ to man.<a name=217:11></a> One was in connection with the marriage at Cana.<a name=217:12></a> I was pointing out that it showed how Christ could do better for man than man could for himself; then, in connection with the temple, that man does one of two things, he either corrupts or destroys.<a name=217:13></a> But Christ raises up.<a name=217:14></a> "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=217:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There was another point, that Christ knew more of man than man of himself.<a name=218:1></a> Man did not know his own lawlessness; Christ did.<a name=218:2></a> Hence the Lord speaks of the necessity of a man being born again.<a name=218:3></a> No man naturally knows sin.<a name=218:4></a> Man's conscience does not witness to sin, but in regard to its activity.<a name=218:5></a> But even where sin does not come into conception, there is the principle of lawlessness.<a name=218:6></a> Man does not know it, but Christ did.<a name=218:7></a> The Lord spoke of the necessity for a man to be born again, in order that he may come under the moral sway of God.<a name=218:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I was saying that in the idea of the temple you have to take in the thought of the oracles.<a name=218:9></a> The oracles of God are most important to man.<a name=218:10></a> I say that much to lead up to chapter 3.<a name=218:11></a> The point of chapter 3 is that in it we get the oracles; as in chapter 2 the temple.<a name=218:12></a> In the tabernacle, and again in the temple, was the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat, and when you come to the real temple, that is Christ, you have the oracles of God.<a name=218:13></a> You have to distinguish between the temple and the oracles.<a name=218:14></a> It is a great point to know the value to us of the temple so that we may get the oracles.<a name=218:15></a> There are three points I take up in connection with the chapter.<a name=218:16></a> The first is the speaker, I contrast the speaker with man at his best; then the oracles, that is, what is spoken.<a name=218:17></a> Then the effect of the oracles, of the speaking.<a name=218:18></a> You get that brought out in the chapter very simply.<a name=218:19></a> One word in advance in regard to the effect of what is spoken; we have it before our eyes.<a name=218:20></a> People are attracted and attached to a centre so that they are recovered from lawlessness; on the other hand some are repelled.<a name=218:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will say a little in regard of the speaker.<a name=218:22></a> The verses I read dwell a good bit on speaking, "We speak that we know, and testify that we have seen".<a name=218:23></a> Then afterwards, "What he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth".<a name=218:24></a> Then again, "He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God".<a name=218:25></a> Men

		often speak, but one thing must mark all speaking on the part of man: no man can speak (I am not referring to senseless people, but to people accounted wise in this world) who has not knowledge, but then the knowledge that man has is acquired.<a name=219:1></a> Whatever may be the field of knowledge, whether philosophy or science, it must be acquired.<a name=219:2></a> Man must have observed and co-ordinated things in his mind, he must possess capability, be able to notice facts and put them together; deduce conclusions, and in that way arrive at what is called knowledge, but evidently it is acquired.<a name=219:3></a> There is another point in regard of man: every conclusion of man, and even his observation, may be marred or distorted to a certain extent by some difficulty in apprehension, because it is extremely uncommon to find a man entirely without bias or prejudice; if there be anything of that kind affecting the mind of man it is pretty clear that his conclusions are not likely to be absolutely correct.<a name=219:4></a> Now in regard to the Son of God we get a remarkable expression: "The Son of man which is in heaven", and another, "We speak that we know, and testify that we have seen".<a name=219:5></a> Christ had not to acquire knowledge; knowledge was inherent.<a name=219:6></a> That is the difference between Christ and any human speaker.<a name=219:7></a> No human speaker could say, "We speak that we know", because man as man knows nothing; when he comes into the world he knows nothing; all he knows is acquired.<a name=219:8></a> Christ never had to acquire knowledge.<a name=219:9></a> The officers who came to take Him had to say, "Never man spake like this man".<a name=219:10></a> The Jews said, "How knoweth this man letters never having learned?<a name=219:11></a>" At twelve years old, in the midst of the doctors at Jerusalem, "All that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers".<a name=219:12></a> All serves to illustrate what we get here, "We speak that we do know".<a name=219:13></a> "He that is of God speaketh the words of God".<a name=219:14></a> Therefore there can be no comparison between man and Christ.<a name=219:15></a> There is a

		contrast, but no comparison.<a name=220:1></a> There is one more point, every man upon earth is affected by the fogs and mists of earth; that is as certain as possible; we know it in natural things, and in moral things there are plenty of fogs and mists.<a name=220:2></a> I do not believe there is any man who is entirely unaffected by them.<a name=220:3></a> Of the Son of man it is said, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven".<a name=220:4></a> I understand by it that He is entirely above the mists and fogs of earth.<a name=220:5></a> He is above the clouds, and unaffected by them, they can produce no effect upon the mind of the speaker here.<a name=220:6></a> There is nothing distorted, nothing out of order or proportion.<a name=220:7></a> He is the speaker, who speaks that He knows and testifies that He has seen.<a name=220:8></a> I trust I have carried you thus far, and that all will apprehend the superiority of <i>the</i> speaker -- the Son of man which is in heaven -- to every human speaker.<a name=220:9></a> Plenty of men profess to be seekers after truth, but their vision is pretty sure not to be perfect, because it is affected by prejudices that prevail upon earth.<a name=220:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the next point -- the oracles.<a name=220:11></a> There I think we can see the contrast between what man speaks and what the Son of man speaks.<a name=220:12></a> "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=220:13></a> In this chapter the Lord says a good bit about the light.<a name=220:14></a> "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light .<a name=220:15></a>.<a name=220:16></a>.<a name=220:17></a> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.<a name=220:18></a> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God".<a name=220:19></a> All the Lord speaks here is in anticipation of resurrection.<a name=220:20></a> I want you to bear that in mind, the Son of man had to be lifted up.<a name=220:21></a> The light could not come out fully until resurrection.<a name=220:22></a>

		What I understand by the light is the revelation of God.<a name=221:1></a> In the death of Christ we get the light of divine love.<a name=221:2></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son".<a name=221:3></a> Another thing had to come out in regard of God, that was divine power, and that was seen in the resurrection of Christ.<a name=221:4></a> Resurrection meant that Christ was given back of God to man in the virtue of redemption.<a name=221:5></a> We get a beautiful expression in the epistle to the Hebrews, "Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant".<a name=221:6></a> Therefore, in Christ the light is of the love and power of God toward man and on man's behalf.<a name=221:7></a> All that the Lord said and did in the course of His ministry anticipated that.<a name=221:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:23">Acts  26:23</a> it says, "That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles".<a name=221:9></a> He was to come out in that way in resurrection.<a name=221:10></a> As the Lord said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=221:11></a> The temple was to be in resurrection.<a name=221:12></a> That is what God ordained.<a name=221:13></a> I am referring now to what is spoken, and it is difficult to put that before you, because when we talk about speaking, we expect to hear words; but there is a very old saying, that facts or acts speak louder than words; they do, and that is essentially the case when the facts or the acts are of God.<a name=221:14></a> The testimony of God has come out in facts.<a name=221:15></a> There are words to explain it, but the testimony is in the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=221:16></a> As I said, the death of Christ is the great expression of divine love.<a name=221:17></a> "The Son of man must be lifted up" as the perfect expression of divine love.<a name=221:18></a> God saw fit Himself to take up the liabilities under which man lay by the judgment of God in order that He might show mercy to man.<a name=221:19></a> Hence the Son of man lifted up is not simply the testimony to what man's condition was, but to divine

		love, in its bearing in regard to man.<a name=222:1></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=222:2></a> The latter part shows the consequence.<a name=222:3></a> I am occupied with the foundations.<a name=222:4></a> The other fact is the resurrection of Christ; the power of God has intervened to raise up Christ from the dead in virtue of redemption, that He might in that way be given back to man.<a name=222:5></a> When the Israelites carried the ark into battle, and the Philistines took it, there might justly be said, "Ichabod", that is, the glory had departed from Israel; but God gave the ark back.<a name=222:6></a> He did that in the sovereignty of His mercy.<a name=222:7></a> So in resurrection God has given back Christ to man in the blood of the everlasting covenant.<a name=222:8></a> If you have followed me you will have seen that the facts of the death and resurrection of Christ speak much stronger than words.<a name=222:9></a> I have no doubt that all the Lord Jesus did and said was leading up to these facts.<a name=222:10></a> It is doubtful if the disciples understood any act of the Lord's life -- either His words or His miracles -- until they understood His death; everything was illuminated by it.<a name=222:11></a> In contrast to that, man gives you volumes; you may get wisdom on the part of man in a way, for there are capable men of the world, with great powers of observation, large minds, having great knowledge of human nature, and acquainted with the history of things in the world; they are men of interest, and we read their works, but it is only books they give you.<a name=222:12></a> But I can understand anybody saying, does not that show great breadth of mind in the men themselves?<a name=222:13></a> Yes, but what have you got to?<a name=222:14></a> Only man; and they making use of the ability God gave them.<a name=222:15></a> There is another class of men, possessed of wealth, and bestowing on men all kinds of benefits, building institutes and libraries for the improvement of man's mind, perhaps with the idea of improving man morally.<a name=222:16></a> It might be said of such, Do not acts speak louder than words?<a name=222:17></a>

		The first point I speak about is that of knowledge.<a name=229:1></a> It is not the revelation of God that we see in this chapter, that was in the previous chapter.<a name=229:2></a> I was speaking last time of the superiority of Christ as seen in that chapter.<a name=229:3></a> He could say, "We speak that we know, and testify that we have seen".<a name=229:4></a> He was the Son of man which is in heaven and what He had seen He testified, and what He testified was what was in God.<a name=229:5></a> He knew what was in God, and consequently we get the mind of God brought out.<a name=229:6></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=229:7></a> John the baptist speaks in the same sense at the close of the chapter.<a name=229:8></a> He says, "What he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth".<a name=229:9></a> But he adds, no one receives His testimony.<a name=229:10></a> No man can know what is in God except by the Spirit of God.<a name=229:11></a> A man may know certain things about himself.<a name=229:12></a> Adam could not know God as we do; he knew the goodness of God, but was not capable of knowing God.<a name=229:13></a> You do not know God by faith; you believe certain things which are in the mind of God with reference to man; for instance, if God makes known His grace in regard to man in forgiveness of sins, man can take that in, because it refers to himself; but as to the question of knowing God, no man is able for that except by the Spirit of God.<a name=229:14></a> The mind of man cannot soar above the things of man.<a name=229:15></a> We can and do know a great deal by the Spirit of God; but the mind of man in itself cannot go beyond the things of man.<a name=229:16></a> It is in that way that in the previous chapter we see the greatness of the Lord; He could say, "We speak that we know".<a name=229:17></a> He knew all that was in the mind of God.<a name=229:18></a>

		But this chapter brings out the truth of what we read in the end of chapter 2, "He knew what was in man".<a name=229:19></a> Christ knew not only what was in God, but what was in man.<a name=229:20></a> Now no <i>man</i> knows what is in man.<a name=229:21></a> The Lord knew what was in man, because He

		Man is lawless.<a name=231:1></a> By lawlessness he has brought confusion in, and there is, and must be, with lawlessness the principle of unbelief.<a name=231:2></a> We get the warning in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 3: 12, "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God".<a name=231:3></a> Now the Lord knew this; he knew all things perfectly in regard to the woman, and all that he speaks was of that knowledge.<a name=231:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point in connection with that is, the Lord could speak about giving living water, because He had the power to meet all these things.<a name=231:5></a> This is very important as connected with Christ's knowledge.<a name=231:6></a> I do not think the Lord would have had any kind of pleasure in bringing to light all that was in man if He could not have met it.<a name=231:7></a> It is a poor thing to expatiate upon evil if you cannot meet it.<a name=231:8></a> But in regard of man I say, Where is the man that knows his fellow-man?<a name=231:9></a> The most far-sighted men in the world, those who assume to be leaders in a moral point of view, philosophers, and people of that description, do not know man.<a name=231:10></a> And the secret of it is that they do not know themselves, and they do not know themselves because they are not outside themselves; they do not know God, and their ideas will be entirely at fault, because they assume that there are capabilities in man which do not exist, that is my impression.<a name=231:11></a> It is a common idea in the present day that the condition of the world may be greatly improved by education and by placing people -- especially what may be called the degraded classes -- in better conditions of living.<a name=231:12></a> I have no doubt the condition materially may be greatly improved, and that education may in a sense tend to lessen crime, but education and improved conditions of living will never meet lawlessness, and therefore the confusion will remain.<a name=231:13></a> It may come out in another way, but it will remain.<a name=231:14></a> And another thing will increase with education and improved conditions of

		living, and that is the disintegration of society.<a name=232:1></a> The bonds by which classes have been hitherto bound together have been greatly dissolved by increasing education.<a name=232:2></a> The truth is, that all that man can do in that direction does not meet the question of lawlessness.<a name=232:3></a> And where lawlessness is confusion will be, and controversy and unbelief.<a name=232:4></a> All the theories of man with regard to social improvement are built up on the idea of capability in man, and there is not moral capability in man.<a name=232:5></a> Certain gross things that take place in the world may be put to shame, but the idea of moral capability in man is a mistake; nothing that man can do will touch the root question, which is lawlessness.<a name=232:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I said before, the Lord saw perfectly into the woman.<a name=232:7></a> There was controversy between herself and God, as of course there must be where there is lawlessness.<a name=232:8></a> Why do you think the Lord brought the woman's history to light?<a name=232:9></a> why did He say to her, "Thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband"?<a name=232:10></a> Some would say, Because He wanted to arouse her conscience, but that is not the only reason; to my mind He brought it to light because He was going to meet it all.<a name=232:11></a> Whatever the Lord brought to light in regard to evil in man He was going to meet.<a name=232:12></a> He alone could meet it.<a name=232:13></a> And the way He took to meet it was entirely according to God, by bringing all to an end, bringing man to an end in order that He might communicate to man living water.<a name=232:14></a> There is an intimate connection between what Christ knew in regard to man, and what He was capable of meeting.<a name=232:15></a> He could accomplish the will of God in bearing all that lay upon man by the judgment of God, in order to bring that man to an end in the cross, that He might communicate the gift of the Spirit, so that man might pass out by one door, but come in by another.<a name=232:16></a> Every one passes out by one door, the death of Christ, but comes in by another, that is by the living water that Christ gives.<a name=232:17></a>

		Evidently we have a great contrast between Christ and man.<a name=233:1></a> It is perfectly certain to my mind that no man knows his fellow, for the simple reason that he does not know himself.<a name=233:2></a> The Christian can say, "For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwells no good thing".<a name=233:3></a> If I were not outside the flesh, in the knowledge of God, I could not say that.<a name=233:4></a> If I do say it, I add, In another person's flesh dwells no good thing.<a name=233:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That leads me to another point, that is, Christ as the Giver, and there again I would point out the contrast between Christ and man.<a name=233:6></a> I was saying that we get in the chapter an implied contrast between the last Adam and the first.<a name=233:7></a> "Man was made a living soul".<a name=233:8></a> He had nothing to give.<a name=233:9></a> All he had was what God had made him.<a name=233:10></a> A man of the world can only give what he has acquired.<a name=233:11></a> He can give wealth, colossal gifts in that way, but he must have acquired it.<a name=233:12></a> He has not got it naturally.<a name=233:13></a> So, too, man can bestow on other men works of art and genius, but then he must have acquired skill in that line of things in order to give, and for the reason that every man comes into the world naked, he possesses nothing.<a name=233:14></a> Another point in regard to man is, that he cannot give to another what will reinstate that man morally.<a name=233:15></a> A man might give to a poor man what would take that man out of his circumstances, but he could not give to a fallen man what would reinstate that man morally.<a name=233:16></a> All the giving of man is subject to limitations.<a name=233:17></a> When we come to the last Adam the first principle of His giving is, He gives what is of Himself.<a name=233:18></a> He does not give what He has acquired.<a name=233:19></a> In one sense He has acquired the right to give, but what He gives is of Himself.<a name=233:20></a> I take living water to be essentially of Himself.<a name=233:21></a> "The last Adam is a life-giving Spirit".<a name=233:22></a> He can give living water, because He has terminated in death the lawless man that brought in confusion.<a name=233:23></a> But Christ gives what is of Himself.<a name=233:24></a> Now that is a point of the greatest possible importance when you

	<div class="paragraph">
		consider that Christ is the Son of God; to think that He can give what is of Himself.<a name=234:1></a> I can go a point higher, If He gives that which is of Himself, He gives that which is of God.<a name=234:2></a> Living water is of Himself, but then that is of God.<a name=234:3></a> It is the Spirit of God.<a name=234:4></a> The Lord opens the question with the woman here in saying, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=234:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is the strongest possible contrast between the giving of Christ and the giving of man, even at the best.<a name=234:6></a> But there is another point in regard to the giving of Christ, and that is, He gives what will reinstate man morally.<a name=234:7></a> And I go a step further than that.<a name=234:8></a> He gives what can set up man morally in a position in which he never was before.<a name=234:9></a> Man is reinstated morally, that idea is clearly maintained in Scripture.<a name=234:10></a> "Christ suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God".<a name=234:11></a> Man is reinstated, you get that principle, too, in the prodigal in Luke, he was reinstated with the Father.<a name=234:12></a> The fact of man being reinstated with God is not inconsistent with the idea of man being brought into a position in which he never was before.<a name=234:13></a> Man is recovered for God.<a name=234:14></a> No one can gainsay that.<a name=234:15></a> He is not brought back in the way in which be left God; when brought to God he is clad in the best robe, the ring is on his hand, and the shoes on his feet.<a name=234:16></a> But he is brought back.<a name=234:17></a> I connect 'reinstated' with the thought of the living water.<a name=234:18></a> "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=234:19></a> The first principle in connection with the living water is that a man is brought into the kingdom of God, under the moral sway of God.<a name=234:20></a> If man is brought under the moral sway of God he is reinstated with God.<a name=234:21></a> There is an end of lawlessness when man is brought into attachment to Christ, which he is by

		THE TWO MINISTRIES AND THEIR RESULTS IN THE SOUL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are evidently two ministries presented to us in the New Testament, that of the gospel and that of the mystery.<a name=239:1></a> They are specifically stated by Paul, and may be found in principle in Peter's writings, and though the two are in perfect accord, and the same persons the subjects of both, yet they are shown to us in distinctness with their respective objects.<a name=239:2></a> I desire to set forward, in measure, the nature of each, with its effect in the soul.<a name=239:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I may first remark that in speaking of the ministry of the gospel, I do not refer exclusively to its proclamation to the unsaved, for I think that the ministry of the gospel is necessary for the establishment of those who through grace have believed, as is made evident by the character of the epistle to the Romans.<a name=239:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The preaching of the gospel has a twofold object: to make known on the one side the righteousness and grace of God in Christ; and on the other to bring the soul through the death and resurrection of Christ consciously into relationship to God on the ground of His glory, and into the consequent enjoyment of salvation from all that is opposed to God.<a name=239:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I would remark that too much stress cannot be laid on the fact that before ever the gospel came into the world, the world had been guilty of rejecting God's Son, and that, in spite of full testimony given both in words and works; and hence the ground on which the gospel now rests is that of the purpose and glory of God.<a name=239:6></a> That Christ was rejected by His own people all would admit; but Scripture goes further and lays it down to this world and its princes.<a name=239:7></a> Jesus Himself said, "Now is the judgment of this world".<a name=239:8></a> Christ came here in grace, not imputing

		trespasses to men, healing all that were oppressed of the devil, relieving men from the outward effects of sin, ministering in every kind of divine beneficence, but He was cast out and crucified.<a name=240:1></a> Now, though this fact may be lightly passed over by men, it is not so of God, and the consequences are momentous.<a name=240:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is, that while the gospel perfectly meets man's need and his failure in his responsibility, yet the ground on which it has come in is that of the purpose of God, for His glory, to accomplish His will; and souls who have received the gospel leave the world morally to enter God's house.<a name=240:3></a> The basis of it is that where man was most guilty, sin was removed from before God by sacrifice, and God perfectly glorified.<a name=240:4></a> Christ having died for all (for the state of all was alike), all are invited to come in, but whether men respond or not to the call, God will surely accomplish, by the gospel, His own purpose.<a name=240:5></a> He will have His house filled.<a name=240:6></a> The Jews fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them, and God is calling out of the Gentiles a people for His name.<a name=240:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All who preach the gospel should be conscious that they are the servants of God's purpose; and in this light they will see the equal importance of the ministry of the mystery with that of the gospel.<a name=240:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have already said, the object of the ministry of the gospel is, besides revealing God's righteousness for faith, to bring our souls consciously into relation to God through Christ on that ground.<a name=240:9></a> It makes God known in His love and goodness -- and by faith of it we are justified, have peace with God, access by faith into favour and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<a name=240:10></a> His love is shed abroad in our hearts, and we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.<a name=240:11></a> We are in God's marvellous light, and before Him apart from all that is contrary.<a name=240:12></a> At the same time our whole thought of God is completely changed.<a name=240:13></a> We are brought to Him.<a name=240:14></a>

		The mystery speaks of Christ and of the assembly.<a name=242:2></a> The first important point is to apprehend what the Head is, and then that the members are in accordance with the Head, as Rebekah was of the kindred of Abraham and thus suited to be the wife of Isaac.<a name=242:3></a> It is evident that Christ could not have entered on the position of Head of the body while here after the flesh, for He stood completely alone as the corn of wheat.<a name=242:4></a> As Head He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, wholly of a new source and order, "out of heaven".<a name=242:5></a> He is also separated by death from all the distinctions by which men are divided on earth according to the ordering of God, in order that He may be Head alike to Jew and Gentile.<a name=242:6></a> He forms in Himself out of twain, one new man.<a name=242:7></a>

		The mystery makes known not only the Head, but the glory of our connection with the Head.<a name=243:1></a> We were by the baptism of the Spirit members of Christ before we knew it, but the ministry of the mystery not only informs us of the relationship which subsists, but forms us spiritually for the enjoyment of the relationship.<a name=243:2></a> It makes known to us that Christ is in us.<a name=243:3></a> It is not as men on earth (supposing we had ever had any status before God as such) that we could be united to Christ, but as having, when spiritually dead, been quickened by the power of God into a new order of being corresponding morally to what Christ is as Man in glory.<a name=243:4></a> "As is the heavenly such are the heavenly".<a name=243:5></a> There is with the Christian an inner and an outer man, and the inner man is that with which the Christian identifies himself before God, and in virtue of which he looks to be clothed upon with his house out of heaven; and even now beholding the Lord's glory he is changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=243:6></a>

		What I desire, beloved friends, to draw your attention to are the two distinct lines which can be seen running through the whole of Scripture: what may be called man's line, that is, the line of man's responsibility; and God's line, that is, the line of God's purpose.<a name=247:1></a> I believe there is hardly anything more important to us than to apprehend the distinction between those two lines.<a name=247:2></a> And further, to see that our souls are really and practically -- I mean as to their apprehension -- established on the ground of divine purpose.<a name=247:3></a> I have thought sometimes of an expression which the apostle used to the Ephesians when leaving them; that he had not "shunned to declare to them all the counsel of God".<a name=247:4></a> And I doubt if a greater service in ministry could be rendered to the saints than to transfer them, as to the state of their hearts, from the ground of man to that of divine purpose.<a name=247:5></a> I think there is in type an illustration of it in the case of the children of Israel; while they were in Egypt, in the land of judgment, they were, as to their sense of things, on the ground of man's responsibility.<a name=247:6></a> They were sheltered from judgment by the blood that was sprinkled on the lintel and on the side posts; but subsequently they were set in movement -- I believe this began with the passover -- and the end of it was they were delivered out of Egypt, brought through the Red Sea, and were in type brought to God, that is, to the apprehension in their souls that they were the objects of divine purpose.<a name=247:7></a> If you want the confirmation of it, you have only attentively to read their song when they had passed through the Red Sea.<a name=247:8></a> It is all full of purpose: "<i>Thou</i> shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,

		I say that much by way of introduction; but I want to show you the thought carried through Scripture, and to speak tonight about the beginning of it, and the circumstances, which, in a certain sense, led to the revelation of counsel.<a name=248:8></a> I quite admit you cannot talk about circumstances leading to purpose; but circumstances led to the revelation of purpose, and that is what comes out here.<a name=248:9></a> Then I want to carry the thought on, if there be an opportunity on future occasions, to what is developed in the New Testament: for the idea of purpose comes out very much more fully in the New Testament than in the Old.<a name=248:10></a> You get it in the way of promises in the Old, but in its scope in the New Testament it carries us to eternity and heaven.<a name=248:11></a> I do not mean to say that promises have to do with heaven, but everything which God establishes in heaven is <i>of purpose</i>.<a name=248:12></a> Therefore, to take a succession of things, when I come to the New Testament I find the "better hope", and the "promise of

		The expression with which Stephen opened his address to the Jews in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>"The God of glory", throws a deal of light on God's dealing with Abraham.<a name=249:11></a> I believe, beloved friends, that that single expression is pregnant with meaning: "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham".<a name=249:12></a> You remember at the close of his address, it is recorded that he "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God".<a name=249:13></a> I believe that a vast deal is comprehended between those two expressions, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham" and "he saw the glory of God".<a name=249:14></a> What it conveys to my mind is this, that Stephen apprehended that, in spite of and even through the perversity of the Jews, God had gained His end; He was the God of glory, and the glory of God was there in Jesus at the right hand of God.<a name=249:15></a>

		A wonderful thing!<a name=250:1></a> What a grasp of truth Stephen had at that moment!<a name=250:2></a> What an illumination he got by the Holy Spirit!<a name=250:3></a> The fact is, he was in the truth of his position as a stone in the temple; completely under the power of the Holy Spirit, and the result of it was that he got extraordinary illumination as to Scripture.<a name=250:4></a> The test of people is light; that is, if you are in the truth of what you are, in the truth of the temple, as a stone, the effect of it will be that you will get light on the Scripture.<a name=250:5></a> Now I believe that the idea of "the God of glory" comes in when things on earth had, so to say, gone to the bad.<a name=250:6></a> Then it is that God comes in as One who was cherishing, if I may so say, His own secret purposes, in the accomplishment of which He would be glorified; here in the case of Abraham we get a revelation of purpose; but the purpose existed before.<a name=250:7></a> God saw all before Him completely from the foundation of the world, just as eternal purposes existed in the heart of God before the foundation of the world.<a name=250:8></a> We were chosen in Christ, it says of Christians, before the foundation of the world.<a name=250:9></a> So in regard of everything here upon the earth, I mean as to the disposal of the earth, everything was before the mind of God from the foundation of the earth.<a name=250:10></a> You read in the Revelation of those who were written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the slain Lamb.<a name=250:11></a> And at the dividing of the earth, God had in view the tribes of Israel.<a name=250:12></a> But then purpose is one thing, the revelation of the purpose is another; and the revelation of purpose came out in promise, when, so far as man was concerned, everything on earth had really gone to the bad.<a name=250:13></a> That is the first point I want to establish.<a name=250:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing comes in in intimate connection with it, and that is idolatry; because we find that in all that state of things, man is not self-supporting; he wants some spiritual power behind to support him, and he gets it.<a name=251:12></a> When Nebuchadnezzar made the image of gold, and commanded all the earth to worship it, who can doubt that the devil was behind?<a name=251:13></a> It was the grossest form of idolatry, everybody in the empire commanded to bow down to the image of the empire which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.<a name=251:14></a> So, too, in the last end of imperial Babylon, man sets himself to be worshipped, in a certain sense takes the place of God here upon earth.<a name=251:15></a> Who is behind that?<a name=251:16></a> I do not think anyone can doubt.<a name=251:17></a> It is like the unclean spirit that, after going out of the man takes to himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and they enter in, and the latter state of that man is worse than the first.<a name=251:18></a>

		Now, beloved friends, that brings me to Abraham; and I would that I might be enabled to show you the important principles that come out in connection with him, for they are principles of vital moment to every one of us to understand.<a name=252:3></a> I believe they are principles which reflect the greatest light upon the character of God Himself, and that is the value of them to me.<a name=252:4></a> The real value to my soul of a great part of the Old Testament is, that it gives wonderful light as to what God Himself is.<a name=252:5></a> We get instructed in the light of the knowledge of God, and we then feel that certain things must be.<a name=252:6></a> Argument in this way is right enough, if you reason down from the settled knowledge in your soul of what God is.<a name=252:7></a> Then you can see that certain things must be because of what God is.<a name=252:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Just one word with regard to promise and purpose, because I do not think everyone quite understands the connection between the two.<a name=252:9></a> As far as I see, promise is not co-extensive with purpose, because promise in Scripture is, in general, connected with the earth, and purpose goes beyond the earth.<a name=252:10></a> All the promises of God are yea and amen in Christ; and we are the heirs of promise, but they relate to the earth and to God's disposal of the earth.<a name=252:11></a> We are the heirs of promise, for it speaks in Hebrews of God showing "to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel".<a name=252:12></a> What I want to say about the connection is this, that promise is always of counsel.<a name=252:13></a> Promise, when unconditional, is the expression of counsel.<a name=252:14></a> A conditional promise is different, because a conditional promise involves two parties; but an unconditional promise, such as God gave to Abraham, is the expression of purpose.<a name=252:15></a> Nothing can be more important than to bear that in

		mind.<a name=253:1></a> The verse I have quoted proves it: "God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath".<a name=253:2></a> You could not have any statement more conclusive as showing that the unconditional promise of God is the fruit of counsel.<a name=253:3></a> Now what God practically says in the case of Abraham is this: 'I am sovereign, and I intend to have a man; the world is gone to the bad, but I choose My man.<a name=253:4></a> And what is more, the earth is My inheritance, and I will dispose of the earth as I see fit'.<a name=253:5></a> That is what man will not tolerate; there is nothing that the human heart hates more than the idea of sovereignty on the part of God; but God is sovereign, and purpose exhibits the sovereignty of God, and the sovereignty of God comes to light when in the thoughts of men God had been displaced.<a name=253:6></a> God called Abraham (he was to be the progenitor of Christ), and says, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed".<a name=253:7></a> God says, "I will bless"; and what is more, He says, "Unto thy seed will I give this land".<a name=253:8></a> Those are two thoughts of the greatest moment to get hold of in connection with God, for our only solid standing ground is the sovereignty of God in blessing and disposing.<a name=253:9></a> I do not think any soul has got any real rock to stand upon until it has got to that point, the sovereignty of God in choosing and blessing, and that God will dispose of the earth as He sees fit: and who is going to quarrel with God?<a name=253:10></a> If God had not been sovereign and had not chosen, there would have been nothing but perfect ruin for the whole world.<a name=253:11></a> What would have become of the world if God had not made Himself known in this way?<a name=253:12></a> I have read the Psalms lately with very great interest, for I see the point of conflict in them is whether the man of the earth or God's man is to possess the earth.<a name=253:13></a> There was God's man, David pretty generally, and he knew that he was the man of God's choice, and the question was whether the man of God's choice was to

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken so far on God's side; but now I want to speak on Abraham's side.<a name=254:7></a> The principle which marked Abraham, the one simple principle which has obtained ever with the true people of God is this -- faith.<a name=254:8></a> It is in that way Abraham comes before us, as the expression of faith.<a name=254:9></a> If one may so say -- though I do not like the term altogether, but I daresay it will not be misunderstood -- the one virtue of Abraham was faith; and it is a principle of great importance, because its practical effect is that it links the heart of the believer with God until God establishes His purpose, and at the same time separates it from the world; he believed God and his faith separated him from the world and from kindred; God was the first thing with him.<a name=254:10></a>

		Now all these are points of great moment when you come to the proper relations of the soul with God, because the soul has to accept the truth that God is sovereign.<a name=254:11></a> The world has rejected Christ, Satan is its god and prince, but God is sovereign in blessing and choosing, and we have to accept it.<a name=254:12></a> I say unhesitatingly to everybody here tonight, that God would have you believe in Him, in the sovereignty of His purpose to bless, and would have your heart linked by faith with Himself, and separated thus from the course of this evil world.<a name=254:13></a> I could bring you plenty of examples of this effect of faith, but you have only to study chapter 11 of the epistle to the Hebrews for yourselves,

		And, beloved friends, there was another thing which I have before noted, that Abraham was to be the progenitor of Christ, for Christ must come in; for if God was determined to bless, and to dispose of the earth as He pleased; there was that resting upon man here which must first be set aside by the judgment of God.<a name=255:9></a> Death and the power of Satan rested upon man, and all that must be removed before God could accomplish His purposes.<a name=255:10></a> They were things which could not be effected in Abraham, he could not remove the judgment of God, he could not free himself of death, nor bring in resurrection, and put aside the power of the devil here.<a name=255:11></a> Therefore, in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, Abraham's seed comes in to do what could not be done in Abraham.<a name=255:12></a> The sovereignty of God, and God's right to dispose of the earth as He pleased, and faith; all these principles come out in Abraham, but for the removal of the judgment which lay upon man, and the breaking of the power of the enemy, we must look to another than Abraham, and we get that in the promised seed, that is in the true Isaac.<a name=255:13></a> For everybody who understands anything at all about Scripture knows that Isaac is a type of a risen Christ.<a name=255:14></a> Abraham received Isaac in figure raised again from the dead.<a name=255:15></a> In Isaac typically I see Christ offered up in sacrifice to remove

		to enter in at the door of purpose.<a name=273:1></a> I invite you to accept in faith this ground, that I am bringing many sons unto glory, and to lay hold of the better hope'.<a name=273:2></a> That is virtually, as it appears to me, what God said to the Jews.<a name=273:3></a> It is a wonderful triumph of the grace of God.<a name=273:4></a> And I will tell you the reason of it, because God was working, not, so to speak, from the guilt of the Jews, but from the death of Christ.<a name=273:5></a> He had been completely glorified, redemption was accomplished, and God was working on that basis.<a name=273:6></a> And when God comes out in the riches of His grace, He begins with the Jew.<a name=273:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt at all that the "better hope" refers to conformity to Christ in glory; and those converted had to travel that road.<a name=273:8></a> Many of the Hebrews had accepted it; and if they were not up to it in their souls, still they had accepted the "better hope" in accepting the testimony of Christ in glory.<a name=273:9></a> And I think that is the position of many souls now; they have accepted the testimony of Christ in glory, but I very much doubt whether they are really in the apprehension of the bearing of it.<a name=273:10></a> When I see Christians eager to make the best of this world, it does not appear to me much as if they had really apprehended the "better hope", and were established on the ground of divine purpose, that God is bringing many sons unto glory.<a name=273:11></a> If I had a true sense of that in my soul, you may depend upon it I should sit light to everything here.<a name=273:12></a> Not but what I would by the grace of God be faithful in every circle here; but things would sit upon me lightly if I really laid hold of what God is doing at the present moment, bringing many sons unto glory, and Christ the pattern of what we are to be, that "as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly".<a name=273:13></a> If that took possession of anyone's thoughts, I do not think present things would have much influence over them.<a name=273:14></a> They would enjoy soul salvation.<a name=273:15></a>

		With regard to the Hebrews, the practical result of it was this, that by the very fact of becoming companions of Christ they became "heirs of promise", that is, they were really of Christ; as the apostle says, "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified, are all of one".<a name=274:1></a> As Christ's they became heirs of the promises, and therefore the promises made to Abraham belonged to them.<a name=274:2></a> And that is how the apostle takes them up in chapter 6.<a name=274:3></a> Who are heirs of promise?<a name=274:4></a> Not Jews; they are put aside for the time being.<a name=274:5></a> Christians are the heirs of promise.<a name=274:6></a> Therefore the apostle says, "God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath".<a name=274:7></a> What for?<a name=274:8></a> "That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us".<a name=274:9></a> The hope was never set before Abraham; what I read about Abraham is that he sought a better, that is a heavenly country, but the hope was never definitely set before him of being the companion of Christ in glory.<a name=274:10></a> That is the hope set before us; and it is we that have that hope who are to get the "strong consolation" that flows from the "two immutable things".<a name=274:11></a> Beloved friends, have you got that "strong consolation"?<a name=274:12></a> Is your soul settled on the ground of divine purpose?<a name=274:13></a> When God makes the promise that is founded on purpose He confirms it with an oath.<a name=274:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		An oath is a most interesting thing in Scripture, for when you find a real indication of divine purpose you will generally find it confirmed with an oath.<a name=274:15></a> For instance, "The Lord hath sworn and will not repent.<a name=274:16></a> Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=274:17></a> Aaron was never made a priest with an oath, but Christ is made a priest with an oath after the order of Melchisedec, because He is priest according to purpose.<a name=274:18></a>

		But there is one word more.<a name=276:9></a> As the consequence of that, of necessity you must accept death to the world.<a name=276:10></a> It is an old saying in regard to the Hebrews, 'inside the veil involves outside the camp'.<a name=276:11></a> You cannot take up the position of a Jew upon earth, because the way through the veil is not, and never will be, open to them; but if you go through the veil, that is, if you have real priestly privilege as sanctified by Jesus Christ, you must accept the place of death to the world; you cannot separate the two.<a name=276:12></a> If you have heavenly portion and privilege, "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus", the other must follow, that you accept the position of death to the world and the whole course of religious man here upon the earth.<a name=276:13></a> That is what the Spirit

		It is a terrible lesson to have to learn, that "in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing"; but if I have apprehended that, I do not care to take up any position here as a man on earth.<a name=277:2></a> If I am morally and radically bad, it is not much good to claim any position here.<a name=277:3></a> But I have a wonderful position in divine grace, a companion of Christ, sanctified by His offering; and not only that, but He has given me the power to support me in the wonderful position which grace has given me.<a name=277:4></a> It is no use having life if you have not the substance to support life.<a name=277:5></a> The Christian has both.<a name=277:6></a> The substance is faith; faith which brings in the power of God to support me in the possession and enjoyment of "the better hope".<a name=277:7></a>

		In standing here, beloved friends, I am a little disinclined to touch the subject of eternal life; but in taking up such a line as that of divine purpose I have felt that one was, in a sense, compelled to touch upon that subject, that it was, indeed, impossible to avoid it, because it is in Scripture so very distinctly connected with divine purpose; as you read in this chapter, God "hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose".<a name=279:1></a> That is, whatever the works of man might be, the grace and purpose of God were in the background, and we are taught that they not only existed, but that they have come to light, that Christ "has annulled death and has brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel".<a name=279:2></a> Death was the judgment of God upon man, and the power of the enemy.<a name=279:3></a> Until death was annulled, both as God's judgment and the enemy's power, the time had not arrived for bringing life and incorruptibility to light; but now they are brought to light by the gospel, God has fallen back upon "His own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus".<a name=279:4></a> When there was no question before Him of responsibility, or works, or death, or anything of the kind, the purpose, the promise of life in Christ Jesus, was there.<a name=279:5></a>

		I have said on previous occasions what should commend itself to any simple Christian, that promise, if unconditional and absolute, such as "the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus", is of necessity with God the expression of purpose; it could not be otherwise, else it must have come in as an afterthought; and I have also spoken of the promises to Abraham; and,

		Last week I spoke of "the better hope" as being a question of counsel, seeing that it is in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>connected with the expression, "God, willing .<a name=280:3></a>.<a name=280:4></a>.<a name=280:5></a> to shew to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel" -- the better hope is of the counsel of God, who is "bringing many sons unto glory".<a name=280:6></a>

		Tonight the thought before me is of eternal life and the gift of the Holy Spirit; not exactly to present these things in themselves, but to show the connection of these truths with the counsel of God, how they have come to light as of God's "purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world was".<a name=280:7></a> Of course, that is looking at eternal life in what I may call its highest development; for eternal life is a term of wide import in Scripture.<a name=280:8></a> It refers, in the direct bearing of it, to blessing upon the earth; that is evident from the way in which it is first introduced to us in the Old Testament.<a name=280:9></a> But Paul shows it to us as connected with heavenly glory; and for that reason carries it back to what was in the purpose of God before the world was, and thus disconnects it from the course of the world altogether.<a name=280:10></a>

		I referred a moment ago to what comes out in this passage, namely, that life and incorruptibility were not brought to light until death was annulled.<a name=280:11></a> That leads me to what I believe to be a very important thought connected with life in Scripture, namely, that it is outside of responsibility, and what responsibility could bring in.<a name=280:12></a> I want to make that point very plain to everybody here tonight.<a name=280:13></a> It is, I believe, one most

	<div class="paragraph">
		If I go back to Adam, Adam was alive by the breath of God; but we must remember the footing upon which Adam was before God, that of responsibility; and if he failed in his responsibility, death would come in.<a name=281:2></a> And, therefore, no one could rightly talk of Adam having eternal life, because everything with him was dependent upon his standing in obedience.<a name=281:3></a> "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die".<a name=281:4></a> I suppose, if Adam had remained as God created him, he would have lived for ever, for death was not upon him; he was perfect, and death came upon him as the sentence of God when he sinned.<a name=281:5></a> "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin".<a name=281:6></a> This much was proved, that innocence could not stand against the tempter.<a name=281:7></a> God put man on the footing of responsibility, with a command, and a penalty if he transgressed, and the penalty came upon him; as it has been said, 'Adam did and died'.<a name=281:8></a> I bring this forward, beloved friends, because I think it is a most important point to apprehend in connection with eternal life, that it is outside of responsibility, and therefore of death.<a name=281:9></a> As it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=281:10></a> The way in which Christians come into life is that they pass "out of death into life".<a name=281:11></a> I do not think anyone could rightly talk about having life without knowing what it is to have "passed out of death into life".<a name=281:12></a> Christ has "annulled death and has brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel".<a name=281:13></a> The two things go together.<a name=281:14></a>

		I desire to touch on the truth of eternal life in three connections -- as presented in the Old Testament, and by John, and by Paul; and my object is two-fold: to show the place which the Holy Spirit in each case has in it, and its connection with the purpose of God.<a name=281:15></a> Whether it be for blessing on earth, or in the line in

		which John presents it to us (which is connected with earth really, though it be what is heavenly upon earth), or in the aspect in which Paul speaks of it, as connected with Christ in glory, in every case life is presented to us as of the purpose of God; and therefore (a very important point to remember) outside of responsibility and death.<a name=282:1></a> I do not mean to say that we have done with responsibility; we have never done with it so long as we are here upon earth and Christ is absent; but I say you have part in that which is outside of your responsibility.<a name=282:2></a> So, too, I am liable to death unless the Lord come; but it is none the less true that I have passed out of death into life.<a name=282:3></a> There is an expression in Scripture which confirms it to me, and that is "the glory of the children of God".<a name=282:4></a> Our glory is, that in the power of the Holy Spirit we are with God outside of what is connected with our outward and responsible life here upon earth; and I am sorry for the Christian who does not know something about it.<a name=282:5></a> With the Father I am a child, the gift of the Father's love.<a name=282:6></a> There are responsibilities flowing from it, that is, to walk consistently with it; but the thing itself is a privilege which in its nature is outside of responsibility.<a name=282:7></a> Our outward life down here is not in itself the expression of the privilege which belongs to a Christian, though it is affected and governed by it.<a name=282:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, I have so far spoken on the negative side in seeking to show that eternal life, properly speaking, is outside of responsibility, and death, the result in man of responsibility; and everybody here will admit that life is constantly presented in Scripture in contrast to death.<a name=282:9></a> When we come to what is more positive, there are three main ideas connected with life, and very important ideas they are, too, which I will try to unfold a little.<a name=282:10></a> The first is blessing, the second is character, and the third, power.<a name=282:11></a> Now mark this, we have to learn everything from Scripture; it is no good bringing preconceived thoughts to Scripture,

	<div class="paragraph">
		because that is not subjection to the Spirit of truth nor to the word of God; and I think I can prove to you without any very great difficulty that the three thoughts I have mentioned are connected with life in Scripture.<a name=283:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take the first distinct mention of eternal life in Scripture, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>, which I turn to at this moment simply for the purpose of speaking of eternal life as blessing.<a name=283:2></a> In the third verse we read: "For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=283:3></a> I think I am justified in saying that Scripture presents eternal life to us as blessing.<a name=283:4></a> Again, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#21">Psalm  21</a>, where it is said of the king: "He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever".<a name=283:5></a> It is really the answer in blessing which God gave to the sufferings and death of Christ.<a name=283:6></a> He is installed as the great Head and source of blessing for ever and ever.<a name=283:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, too, with regard to character -- for in working the subject out in its various connections, I will show you how these three thoughts come in -- I give you one passage, "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body".<a name=283:8></a> By the word 'life' in this passage I understand the character of Jesus, what He was morally here upon earth; and that is to be manifest in the mortal body of a Christian.<a name=283:9></a> But as we shall see presently, there is a further thought connected with it.<a name=283:10></a> Character is intimately connected with being; that is, character is the expression of what a person is in his moral being.<a name=283:11></a> He that doeth righteousness <i>is righteous</i>, even as He is righteous.<a name=283:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the third main idea, and that is power.<a name=283:13></a> And what I gather from that is "If Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness".<a name=283:14></a> "The Spirit is life", that is, I judge, the thought of power.<a name=283:15></a> Power in the Christian is connected with the Holy Spirit, for he has

	<div class="paragraph">
		not one atom of spiritual power in himself, and therefore the scripture goes as far as to say, "The Spirit is life"; that is, potentially.<a name=284:1></a> If you speak of blessing, the blessing to us is sonship; if you speak of character, the character is Christ in us; but if you speak of power, the power is the Holy Spirit.<a name=284:2></a> So the apostle says to the Galatians, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit".<a name=284:3></a> I want you to bear these three very important points in mind -- blessing, character, and power -- because you will see how they appear in each connection in which eternal life is presented to us in Scripture.<a name=284:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, I desire first to touch on the truth of eternal life as predicted in the Old Testament, in connection with the world to come, the millennium; then on the way John presents it to us, and afterwards as revealed to us through Paul in connection with Christ in glory.<a name=284:5></a> Of course, the last two are very intimately connected, because they have their application to the same body of people, to Christians; we have part in the truth as presented by John, and in the truth as presented by Paul.<a name=284:6></a> I will show you presently the contrast between the two last; but I may just say that, in general, in John life is presented to us in the present; with Paul it is presented to us in full result in Christ.<a name=284:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To refer again to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=284:8></a> It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=284:9></a> Now, beloved friends, my conviction is that you find the three thoughts I have referred to in that Psalm: blessing, character, and power.<a name=284:10></a> There is no doubt the Psalm is prophetic; it refers to what will be made good here

		upon earth in the world to come, the millennium.<a name=285:1></a> It is the last Psalm but one, you will notice, of what are called the Songs of Degrees; they are a kind of supplementary Psalms, which lead right away in thought from the people in the sense of distance and woe to the full result in blessing and unity in Zion.<a name=285:2></a> You will observe that it is "the mountains of Zion" where God "commanded the blessing".<a name=285:3></a> Do you know what Zion represents in Scripture?<a name=285:4></a> Zion is the "city of the great King"; nothing on earth can be compared to Zion.<a name=285:5></a> Mount Sinai is contrasted with it in Hebrews; but nothing can be compared to Zion, because of what is connected with it in the ways of God.<a name=285:6></a> Zion is the place of God's choice.<a name=285:7></a> God refused Shiloh, and there was not found a place for the ark until it was brought to mount Zion.<a name=285:8></a> The ark had been delivered into captivity; as it says, "He delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand"; but "He smote his enemies in the hinder parts, he put them to a perpetual reproach", and brought back the ark.<a name=285:9></a> But by whom?<a name=285:10></a> By David, the man of His choice.<a name=285:11></a> He rejected Ephraim, and chose Judah; He rejected Saul, and chose David.<a name=285:12></a> The great beauty of Zion is its moral connection; it is the witness of the long-suffering faithfulness of God.<a name=285:13></a> When His people had forfeited everything by their conduct, God brought back the ark.<a name=285:14></a> Never was a more disastrous step taken than to carry the ark into battle.<a name=285:15></a> It was making a god of the ark.<a name=285:16></a> And the people lost it.<a name=285:17></a> God knew how to recover it, and He did; but it was with no honour to the people.<a name=285:18></a> They had lost all; they had, so to say, nothing without the ark; but God brought it back to mount Zion, and then David led the song: "Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy" -- His loving-kindness it really is -- "endureth for ever".<a name=285:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that is quite enough to prove how the thought of this Psalm is connected with the purpose of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great idea which predominates in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>is blessing: "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity".<a name=286:2></a> They have reached blessing: it refers, I suppose, to the unity of Judah and Israel when they are brought together again upon earth as "one stick".<a name=286:3></a> But I think the dwelling together "in unity" gives us also the character in which life becomes manifest.<a name=286:4></a> They have got the blessing, and what marks them is that the jealousies, the contentions, and divisions which formerly existed are completely set aside.<a name=286:5></a> Then you find also the third idea, and that is power.<a name=286:6></a> It is like the oil, "the precious ointment", for their dwelling together is the effect of the influence and power upon them of the Holy Spirit, which flows from the true Aaron in glory.<a name=286:7></a> And it adds: "There he commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=286:8></a> Thus they will be relieved in that day of death; they will be no longer on the footing of responsibility, because the law will be written in their hearts, and Christ will be present.<a name=286:9></a> The first covenant depended upon the conduct of the people, as well as upon the faithfulness of God; the second is the covenant of God's will, and their responsibility having been met, their sins and iniquities are remembered no more.<a name=286:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not want to dwell too much upon scriptures that speak of the blessing of Israel, because after all these have only an indirect bearing on us.<a name=286:11></a> I go on to what applies to us more directly, and I turn your attention to two passages in the gospel of John (chapters <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a> - 17 and <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:13">John  4:13</a>, 14): "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<a name=286:12></a> For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=287>[Page 287]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but have everlasting life.<a name=287:1></a> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved".<a name=287:2></a> Again, "Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=287:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the gospel of John we are struck with this, that it is the intervention of God by His only-begotten Son outside of all dispensation.<a name=287:4></a> It is really the coming out of God in the revelation of His love to the world.<a name=287:5></a> Therefore, as has been often noticed, in the introduction of the gospel we do not find any genealogy of the Lord traced down from Abraham or David or up to Adam.<a name=287:6></a> And another point noticeable in the gospel is, that Christ is commonly presented to us as outside, so to say, of the circumstances of His merely earthly life.<a name=287:7></a> He is presented to us by John as with the Father, that is, that morally He was outside the present scene and all connected with it (although He actually had His part in it); and hence John could say in the opening of the gospel: "The word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of an only-begotten with a Father".<a name=287:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And there is another point, namely, that in Christ as "with the Father", was manifested to the disciples the truth of eternal life.<a name=287:9></a> As the apostle says, we "shew unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us".<a name=287:10></a> I do not mean to say but what Christ had His part in responsibility here; that I fully admit; and in truth He came here to die; He was going to give His flesh for the life of the world; but my conviction is that there was manifested to the disciples in Christ what was entirely outside of responsibility and the reach of death, what He was with the Father.<a name=287:11></a> They saw the blessing in which as man Christ was with the Father.<a name=287:12></a> They saw, too,
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		His character, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the blessed traits which came Out in Him; and further, that He was here in the power of life; "In him was life", although that expression really refers more to what is divinely true of Him.<a name=288:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I want to come to the application of John to us.<a name=288:2></a> If you would get a true idea of eternal life as John presents it, you must take the two passages I read in conjunction; the one gives us what I may call the objective side, and the other is the subjective side, and you must put the two together.<a name=288:3></a> The point in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>is the way in which God has come out, and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the means by which the believer goes in; for it was not enough simply that God should come out.<a name=288:4></a> The way in which God has come out is revealed in the verses I read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>; it is God revealed and acting in the sovereignty of divine love.<a name=288:5></a> "God so loved the world".<a name=288:6></a> Who besought God to love the world?<a name=288:7></a> Love is sovereign; "God so loved the world".<a name=288:8></a> Who can say why?<a name=288:9></a> No one.<a name=288:10></a> All we can do is to accept what Scripture says, that "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son", He came out in that way in the gift of His Son, and the Son of man has been lifted up, "that whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have eternal life".<a name=288:11></a> I believe that privilege must be commensurate to revelation, and that if God has seen fit to reveal Himself thus in the sovereignty of divine love, He must be known accordingly.<a name=288:12></a> God is love; and in His love to the world is the manner and character in which we know God.<a name=288:13></a> I think it is a privilege which is peculiar to this moment.<a name=288:14></a> Nothing can alter the character of God, but there may be certain things which are prominent in any given moment; and this is such.<a name=288:15></a> How do you think Israel will know God in the millennium?<a name=288:16></a> As Jehovah in His eternal faithfulness, whose mercy endures for ever.<a name=288:17></a> But our privilege is to know God revealed in the greatness of His love to the world.<a name=288:18></a> Why must the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Son of man be lifted up?<a name=289:1></a> On account of the condition of man?<a name=289:2></a> Quite so; but really on account of the love of God.<a name=289:3></a> That is the ground on which it is put, for Jesus adds immediately, "for God so loved the world".<a name=289:4></a> In order for the love of God to the world to be adequately expressed and to be made good, it was necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up.<a name=289:5></a> I ask all here one simple question, Do you know God in the sovereignty of love?<a name=289:6></a> Because what it means is this, God will hold nothing back from those whom He loves.<a name=289:7></a> It has often been said that love will do the best it can for its object.<a name=289:8></a> And if this is the way in which God has been pleased to come out, there is nothing that He will hold back from the objects of His love.<a name=289:9></a> It is a great thing to know God in goodness, but it is a greater thing to know God in love.<a name=289:10></a> I think I have an idea of the grace of God, but a very poor one of the love of God.<a name=289:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to touch on the other side of the truth, that is, the means by which we go in.<a name=289:12></a> That is what comes out in chapter 4; the Lord says to the woman of Samaria, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=289:13></a> You cannot conceive anything more wonderful than that, that the believer was not only to be relieved but to have, as one might say, a spring in himself.<a name=289:14></a> I have no doubt whatever that the allusion is to the Holy Spirit, though not exactly as indwelling us and uniting us to Christ; I think it is the Holy Spirit connected with the believer in the most intimate way; if I might use the expression, speaking reverently, as if the Holy Spirit were mine, that I might use Him in that sense.<a name=289:15></a> And I believe it is so; I do not think there is any limit to the use which a believer may make of the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=289:16></a> "The water that I shall give him shall be in

		him, a well of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=290:1></a> The idea which it conveys to me is that the office of the Holy Spirit is the ministration of Christ to the soul of the believer on the principle which you find in chapter 6, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=290:2></a> The soul eats, and enjoys, and delights in that living bread, in the grace expressed in the Lord Jesus Christ as come down from heaven.<a name=290:3></a> The soul lives by Him.<a name=290:4></a> Then comes the consequence; there is a well of water springing up into eternal life.<a name=290:5></a> It refers to the answer in the believer of affections which spring up in him God-wards by the Spirit.<a name=290:6></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>gives us the divine side; <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>gives us the believer's side.<a name=290:7></a> We could not have a sense of the sovereignty of divine love and not respond to it; "He that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God".<a name=290:8></a> "We love him because he first loved us"; affections in the power of the Holy Spirit are generated in the believer towards the blessed source of the benefit, the One who has come out in the love presented to us in chapter 3.<a name=290:9></a> It is the Spirit of Christ, not exactly the Spirit of God.<a name=290:10></a> (I do not mean different in personality, but in aspect.<a name=290:11></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you will see that the three things of which I have spoken are verified here: that we have blessing, character, and power.<a name=290:12></a> The blessing is that we are children.<a name=290:13></a> "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the children of God".<a name=290:14></a> And the character is Christ.<a name=290:15></a> "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me".<a name=290:16></a> And the power is the Spirit of life given of Christ.<a name=290:17></a> "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=290:18></a> There is the blessed spring and power of affections in the Holy Spirit.<a name=290:19></a> I need hardly say, beloved friends, that all begins with God, in the work of the Spirit of God in the soul; a man has to be born again, as we read, "Whosoever loveth is born of God, and knoweth God".<a name=290:20></a> But I speak of what are the characteristics of life.<a name=290:21></a>

		One word more in regard to the blessing.<a name=291:1></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ thy sent one".<a name=291:2></a> There again is the blessing.<a name=291:3></a> It hangs on the truth that we are brought into the place of children.<a name=291:4></a> We are set in that place before the Father, and therefore eternal life, in the very nature of it, is with the Father, and the privilege and blessing of it is, "That they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ thy sent one".<a name=291:5></a> I have spoken about the character, or in other words the moral being, and also of the power.<a name=291:6></a> But on that point I will just refer to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, where the Lord breathes on the disciples, and says, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit".<a name=291:7></a> He communicated to them, I do not doubt, what is referred to in chapter 4, the "well of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=291:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will not dwell further on what comes out in John, but pass on to the thought of life in Paul, and will read three verses in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love; having predestinated us unto sonship by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will".<a name=291:9></a> Now, beloved friends, I think you will get great light from this passage on the way in which eternal life belongs to the Christian; not quite as John presents it, though consistent with it, but in connection, in the most distinct way, with the eternal purpose of God.<a name=291:10></a> It is that which led me to refer to this passage, because life is presented here, beyond all question, in connection with eternal purpose; He has "chosen us in him before the foundation of the world".<a name=291:11></a> What for?<a name=291:12></a> "That we should be holy and without blame before him in love".<a name=291:13></a> I do not think it can be disputed that what comes out in this passage is totally apart from

		Beloved friends, what privilege and blessing to be with God and before God, with no shade of distance; not alone to know God Himself in an the grace and love of His being, but to know Him, too, in all the range of divine wisdom; that is what I understand the privilege of sonship to be.<a name=292:11></a> That is what we are brought into; as the apostle says in Galatians, "Ye are all the sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus"; we are brought into it in faith now, but in actuality when we get to heaven.<a name=292:12></a> In actual condition, and as to the place of it, we are not in it yet; but we are there in a sense because we are united to Christ.<a name=292:13></a> Sonship is the blessing.<a name=292:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On former occasions we have had before us certain truths presented in the Scriptures, first the promises made to Abraham; then the "better hope" of the epistle to the Hebrews; and, last time, the subject of eternal life and the gift of the Spirit; and I have sought to show each truth in its connection with, and as the outcome of, the counsel of God.<a name=297:1></a> Tonight I wish to speak of a truth of a different character -- the mystery -- but, by the Lord's help, to present it also in the light of counsel.<a name=297:2></a> My conviction is this (I may be mistaken, and am not dogmatic on such a point), that the peculiar ministry for the moment is the counsel of God.<a name=297:3></a> There are plenty of other things which are prominent and have a great place in the minds of Christians; but I think, for the establishment of the people of God, and for the working out of God's will in them, it is all important to present to their souls the counsel of God.<a name=297:4></a> I have not spoken of the truth of election, which has reference to individuals, but in a broader way of the counsel of God.<a name=297:5></a> And by the counsel of God I mean the things which God has taken in hand to establish according to His will, on the basis of accomplished redemption.<a name=297:6></a>

		Before speaking on the subject of tonight, I should like to say one word in reference to the gospel.<a name=297:7></a> I am convinced that the basis on which the gospel rests is the counsel of God, and that were it not for the counsel of God there would be no gospel.<a name=297:8></a> One cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that the world has rejected every overture which God could make to it even in grace, and that so far as the responsibility of man is concerned all hope is closed.<a name=297:9></a> This is evident from what the Lord said in reference to the coming of the

		Comforter, that when He was come He would convict the world of sin, because they believed not on Him.<a name=298:1></a> You have to remember that Christ was presented to the world in divine grace and power and goodness, and that the world did not believe in Him.<a name=298:2></a> Therefore, the Holy Spirit convicts the world also concerning judgment, "because the prince of this world is judged"; that is, that as the result of the rejection of Christ, Satan is declared the prince of this world.<a name=298:3></a> I do not say he was not the prince of the world before, but I do not think it came out until the world had definitely rejected Christ.<a name=298:4></a> And the Lord says, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me".<a name=298:5></a> Then the gospel comes in on the ground of divine counsel; that is, it is the means which God uses for the accomplishment of His counsel, though at the same time the gospel opens the door to all, for Christ died for all.<a name=298:6></a> One could not be free in the preaching of the gospel if that were not accepted.<a name=298:7></a> "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all".<a name=298:8></a> But while the gospel opens the door to all, the object of the gospel is not only to save souls, but to bring them into the counsel of God about them.<a name=298:9></a> You may say that the preaching of the gospel does not effect that fully; but I think the preaching of the gospel ought at all events to pave the way for it, and not to give to souls the idea that, being saved from judgment, they are free to live in the world out of which Christ has died.<a name=298:10></a>

		Now, beloved friends, all that I have presented on previous occasions has been connected with saints individually, whether the promises, or the better hope (which is really fellowship with Christ in glory), or eternal life and the gift of the Spirit.<a name=298:11></a> All those subjects refer to the blessings we are brought into and privileged to enjoy individually.<a name=298:12></a> It is evident that life refers to us individually; individually we are alive to God in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will first speak a few words as to the meaning to be attached to the expression 'mystery', and then I desire to show you what the mystery is.<a name=299:6></a> People have not always a very definite idea of what is intended to be conveyed by Scripture expressions, and there may be some here tonight that have not any very clear thought of the expression 'mystery'.<a name=299:7></a> I trust to make clear to you what mystery means, that we may understand it, if the Lord give us understanding.<a name=299:8></a> And to what end?<a name=299:9></a> That we may be practically in the truth of it, that is, that it may be, so far at least as we are concerned, carried out.<a name=299:10></a> I am not at all blind to the difficulties peculiar to the present moment, because the truth of the one body applies to every saint upon earth, and yet it is but a very small proportion of the saints upon earth who have any understanding at all of the one body.<a name=299:11></a> If I were to talk to the greater part of Christians about the mystery, they would not know what I meant at all.<a name=299:12></a> It is but a fragment of them who have any idea at all of the truth of the one body.<a name=299:13></a> My conviction is that ninety-nine out of every hundred saints, as to the condition of their souls, have never got beyond congregationalism; they have never got to the idea of a structure.<a name=299:14></a> And even amongst ourselves,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=300>[Page 300]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we know a great deal more about gathering than about building.<a name=300:1></a> The great mischief is where the two are not held.<a name=300:2></a> I quite admit the importance of gathering: "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name"; but without building it must result in congregationalism, which does not present the truth of the church.<a name=300:3></a> What the Lord says in the very first allusion to the church is, "On this rock I will build my assembly", and that is a structure.<a name=300:4></a> I allow that there is the Lord's congregation here in the world, but what the Lord speaks about in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>is a structure.<a name=300:5></a> Building and gathering, I am convinced, ought to go hand in hand.<a name=300:6></a> If souls are gathered out to the name of the Lord Jesus, there ought to be at the same time the building up of souls in Christ; for there is only one material in the structure which Christ builds, that which grows to a holy temple in the Lord, and that material is Christ.<a name=300:7></a> It is not man as such that is built in it, neither Jew nor Gentile, I mean morally; it is Christ and nothing but Christ: "On this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=300:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now as to the idea connected with 'mystery'.<a name=300:9></a> The word is employed in Scripture in many connections.<a name=300:10></a> I do not know that we find it in the Old Testament, but we find it frequently in the New.<a name=300:11></a> The Lord spoke of the mysteries of the kingdom.<a name=300:12></a> So, too, mystery is employed in a more general sense in the first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=300:13></a> And in the Revelation we read that the mystery of God should be finished.<a name=300:14></a> It has been said, and I quite go with it, that mystery means something which is known only to the initiated.<a name=300:15></a> It was an expression current among the heathen.<a name=300:16></a> I daresay someone would ask me, Who are the initiated?<a name=300:17></a> Well, I say, everyone who has the Holy Spirit is of the initiated.<a name=300:18></a> Therefore the mystery is the property of every real Christian, for we could not speak of a person being a real Christian unless he have the Holy Spirit, though, as it has been said, he

		<a name=301>[Page 301]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		may be on the road to it.<a name=301:1></a> But every real Christian is of the initiated, and is entitled to be in the secret of the mystery.<a name=301:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another and a very important moral thought connected with it.<a name=301:3></a> A mystery is something which cannot exist in the <i>public</i> ways of God.<a name=301:4></a> Let me give you an illustration from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>.<a name=301:5></a> The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven could not exist in the public ways of God.<a name=301:6></a> If the kingdom were established in power and glory, you could not have such a character of things as is presented in that chapter; because the form of the kingdom shown there contemplates no difference between Jew and Gentile; "the field is the world", and there are "the children of the wicked one".<a name=301:7></a> And do you think when God comes in in His public ways there will be the children of the wicked one, the 'tares' in His kingdom?<a name=301:8></a> Not a bit of it.<a name=301:9></a> And do you think in that day there will be no distinction between Jew and Gentile?<a name=301:10></a> But no such distinction is known in the mysteries of the kingdom.<a name=301:11></a> The Lord says, "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven"; and He explains to them how all is brought about: the seed is sown, and springs up, and the consequences of it are seen.<a name=301:12></a> The kingdom of heaven, in the form in which it is presented to us in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, exists in the time when the king is hidden and God has not come out in His public ways.<a name=301:13></a> When He does, the kingdom will have a totally different character.<a name=301:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I come to another point, that is, to the mystery presented to us in the epistle to the Ephesians (chapter 5: 28 - 32): "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.<a name=301:15></a> He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<a name=301:16></a> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ the church.<a name=301:17></a> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<a name=301:18></a> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife,

		<a name=302>[Page 302]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and they two shall be one flesh.<a name=302:1></a> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church".<a name=302:2></a> In this very striking passage, we have Paul saying, "This mystery is great".<a name=302:3></a> Peculiar stress therefore is to be laid upon what you get there; but he says, "I speak concerning Christ and concerning the church".<a name=302:4></a> Now the mystery as presented to us in this passage refers first to Christ.<a name=302:5></a> What I understand it to mean is this, that Christ in the time that He is cut off from His natural kindred, becomes the head of a joint body on earth, composed of Jew and Gentile.<a name=302:6></a> I think there is an allusion to this in the passage.<a name=302:7></a> Christ is separated from His kindred after the flesh, as Joseph was; and in the time of His separation He has become the Head of the assembly composed of Jew and Gentile.<a name=302:8></a> And that is what never could be in the public ways of God.<a name=302:9></a> When the Lord comes again, and the kingdom is set up in glory, do you think such a thing could be possible?<a name=302:10></a> It is totally impossible.<a name=302:11></a> Jew and Gentile will have their respective places in that day, but what will mark the Gentiles will be that they will eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table; they will be blessed intermediately through Israel.<a name=302:12></a> Israel will be the channel of light and blessing on earth in that day, because the promises belong to Israel, and the Gentile will be brought into blessing subordinately to Israel.<a name=302:13></a> Jehovah will reign, and Christ will be King of the whole earth, and the Head of the Gentiles; but not the Head of a body composed jointly of Jew and Gentile.<a name=302:14></a> It is in the time of His rejection that He takes that place.<a name=302:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to come to another side of the mystery.<a name=302:16></a> I have spoken of the Head, now I want to speak of the body; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:4">Ephesians  3:4</a> - 6.<a name=302:17></a> "Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=303>[Page 303]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint par-takers of his promise in Christ by the gospel".<a name=303:1></a> The mystery here is connected with the body, and what is presented is that which is impossible in the public ways of God, that Jew and Gentile should be joint heirs and a joint body.<a name=303:2></a> It evidently refers to the present moment, because, if it referred only to the future, the word 'heirs' would not be used.<a name=303:3></a> 'Promise' I understand to mean here that to which God has engaged Himself.<a name=303:4></a> I do not think it refers to a promise specifically made to any person.<a name=303:5></a> A promise on the part of God is an expression of purpose.<a name=303:6></a> Just as we get "the promise of life in Christ Jesus" -- God has been pleased to engage Himself to it.<a name=303:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just show you the two sides of the mystery; on the one that Christ has become the Head of a joint body composed of Jew and Gentile; and on the other, that the Gentile has become a joint heir, and a joint body, and joint partaker of God's promise in Christ through the gospel -- the gospel being the way by which it has been brought about.<a name=303:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to a few thoughts in connection with chapter 3.<a name=303:9></a> It is a deeply interesting chapter, and brings in Paul and the administration committed to him; and in order to lead up to it, I must refer to what comes out at the close of chapter 1 and the beginning of chapter 2 of Ephesians.<a name=303:10></a> Chapter 1: 19 - 23: "What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=303:11></a> There is not a word about mystery

		Now I desire to bring out a thought or two in connection with what the mystery, the one body, is.<a name=306:3></a> The apostle says, "Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel".<a name=306:4></a> It was when the whole world was lost in dark insensibility to God, that God began to bring this about.<a name=306:5></a> The Jew was lost in the darkness of unbelief, in spite of every possible testimony presented to him; and the Gentile was sunk in the degradation of idolatry.<a name=306:6></a> Such was the condition of the world before God.<a name=306:7></a> What God does in the first place is to set Christ at His own right hand in the heavenly places.<a name=306:8></a> And the next thing God does historically in the unfolding of His ways is to call out a remnant of His people -- it is shown in the epistle to the Hebrews -- He presents to them the better hope.<a name=306:9></a> "The Lord added daily the saved ones to the assembly"; He saves a remnant of His people, and He brings them into the assembly; they were baptised by the Holy Spirit.<a name=306:10></a> Now if Jew and Gentile were to be a joint body, do you think the Jew was to come down to the level of the Gentile?<a name=306:11></a> Such a thing could not be.<a name=306:12></a> The Jew had rejected Christ, but dark as the poor Jew had been, he was not, when his eyes were opened, to come down to the level

		In the epistle to the Colossians we get the truth of the new man, which is intimately connected with the body.<a name=310:3></a> The great idea in it is that "Christ is all and in all", and that the sensibilities and affections, and the word of Christ, the whole moral beauty of Christ, come out in the saints as one body here upon earth in their relations one toward another.<a name=310:4></a> When you think what the history of the world had been in the presence of heaven, was not that an amazing result for God to produce?<a name=310:5></a> Did not that prove to principalities and powers in the heavenly places the unbounded resources of God, to see a body here upon earth, composed of those naturally so diverse as Jew and Gentile had been, directed by the Head, and displaying all the blessed characteristics of the Head?<a name=310:6></a> I would to God we had a greater sense of the beauty of the Head, of the fulness of the Lord Jesus Christ; that we knew more of the unsearchable wealth of Christ.<a name=310:7></a> The apostle says, "Whom we preach" -- speaking of Christ -- "warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ".<a name=310:8></a> I trust that Christ is formed in every soul I am speaking to, but are you anxious to "grow up unto him in all things which is the head"?<a name=310:9></a> We ought to have such a sense of the virtue and moral excellence of the Head that the one thing to be desired is to grow up unto Him in all things; that we might get more away from man, and ourselves, and all the workings of flesh, to be more conformed to Christ in glory.<a name=310:10></a> It is a great thing to get the Head before you.<a name=310:11></a> You will never understand what He is as Head to the body if you do not understand what He is as Head to you.<a name=310:12></a> The Head is the source and the standard to each one of us, and when I understand what He is as Head to me, then I understand what He is to the whole body.<a name=310:13></a>

		It will not be a unity of agreement or an alliance, but unity in the character of Christ Himself; as the apostle says, speaking of the new man, "There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all and in all".<a name=311:1></a> That is the great reality God did produce down here.<a name=311:2></a> It has been terribly marred in the hands of man.<a name=311:3></a> But then, all the work of man and the failure of man cannot possibly alter what God has effected.<a name=311:4></a> The body is here, and it is a very great thing if God has given us just to return to the truth of it; and although our sphere of influence may be a very small one, and we may have very little opportunity of coming into contact with the saints of God, yet so far as we can, it is a very great point to walk in the truth of the mystery, not only correct in our individual path, but deeply concerned in regard to our relations one towards another, so that the character of Christ may be seen in the company of the saints collectively.<a name=311:5></a>

		In conclusion I may say that I do not think anybody would question for a moment that the mystery is connected with the eternal purpose of God.<a name=311:6></a> And it is a very important truth for us.<a name=311:7></a> The knowledge of the mystery marks us off practically from the great mass of Christendom.<a name=311:8></a> Of course, all saints are in the body, and in the mystery; but they are not instructed in it.<a name=311:9></a> I suppose everybody here tonight is so more or less, and the point for us is to walk in the reality of it.<a name=311:10></a> The first thing is to give up our own heads, that is, the direction of our own minds, to be under the direction of the Head in heaven, and then to be very jealous that the blessed traits and features of Christ should be reproduced in us in our relations one with another down here.<a name=311:11></a> If you want a guide for the assembly, study <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>, and see what comes out there.<a name=311:12></a>

		What is before me, beloved friends, to speak on this evening is the calling of God.<a name=313:1></a> It is evidently a very important matter to get a clear idea of.<a name=313:2></a> A little later on in the epistle we find the thought of our calling, and there is a shade of difference between the two expressions.<a name=313:3></a> The apostle refers to God's calling in the prayer at the close of the first chapter: "That you may know what is the hope of his calling"; and what I want to unfold a little tonight, as the Lord may enable me, is what is conveyed in the expression "his calling", and to add a word or two about "the hope" of it.<a name=313:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's calling, I need hardly say, must needs be according to His purpose.<a name=313:5></a> We read elsewhere, "Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose".<a name=313:6></a> So, too, we have, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, the expression, "The called according to his purpose".<a name=313:7></a> The calling of God is not always identical, and I want to show what is God's calling for the Christian.<a name=313:8></a> We get a reference to it in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, where the apostle speaks of pressing on for "the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".<a name=313:9></a> He looks at it there as the end, the prize for which he was striving might and main, the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=313:10></a>

		There are three things which come before us in verses 3 - 5 of this chapter: the first is the calling; the second is the state which befits the calling; and the third is the proper scene of the calling.<a name=313:11></a> In thus speaking of them I refer to them in the reverse order to that in which they are presented to us in the passage.<a name=313:12></a>

		The three verses are evidently intimately connected, and the connection is marked in verse 4 by the word 'according', and in verse 5 by the "having predestinated"; the three points are thus connected together.<a name=314:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When I read the scripture, I dare say you noticed the recurrence of one expression, that is, "his will".<a name=314:2></a> First you get in verse 5 the good pleasure of His will; then, in verse 9, the mystery of His will; and then, in verse 11, the counsel of His own will.<a name=314:3></a> The thought connects itself in my mind very intimately with <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, in which, referring to Christ, it says "I come .<a name=314:4></a>.<a name=314:5></a>.<a name=314:6></a> to do thy will, O God"; it goes on to say, speaking of the offerings under the law, "He taketh away the first that he may establish the second".<a name=314:7></a> It is very important to apprehend the real line on which Christ came here, namely, to establish the will of God.<a name=314:8></a> God does not take counsel with any; there are very few of us who do not take counsel with someone, but God has no one to take counsel with, He works all things after the counsel of His own will.<a name=314:9></a> I refer to that, because it makes it so evident that the calling is according to the will of God, what we are called to is the fruit of His counsel.<a name=314:10></a> As I was saying at the outset of these lectures, the service I desire to render to the saints is to establish their souls on the ground of divine counsel, for a vast proportion of the people of God, as to the state of their souls, are not beyond the ground of responsibility as men on earth.<a name=314:11></a> They do not see that the end of conversion in God's sight is to set them on the ground of His counsel, and that the work of Christ answers to that, for the clearance is complete: "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".<a name=314:12></a> You must not confound 'sanctified' and 'perfected'.<a name=314:13></a> 'Sanctified' is by far the greater thought of the two.<a name=314:14></a> "By the which will we are sanctified", set apart for God.<a name=314:15></a> The pith of that passage in its application to us is, that

		we are set in the place of priests, having access as sons to God.<a name=315:1></a> And then the truth is added that by one offering Christ has perfected for ever -- that is as to their conscience -- them which are sanctified, so that there is no more conscience of sins.<a name=315:2></a> I see more and more how in the gospel the question of man's responsibility is completely met; but I am sure that no question of man's responsibility can come up to the will of God; and our calling is according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace.<a name=315:3></a> It is not according to our will or our thought, but it is the good pleasure of His will.<a name=315:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I dwell upon these verses in detail, I should like to say a word or two about the expression "calling".<a name=315:5></a> It is not the first time that we find a calling in Scripture.<a name=315:6></a> I see two callings in Scripture, and there may be more -- an earthly and a heavenly calling.<a name=315:7></a> If I go back to the beginning, I do not see that Adam had a calling; God put him on the footing of responsibility.<a name=315:8></a> He was set up in Eden a perfect creature as God had made him, the head and centre of God's creation down here; but he had not a calling, his point was to abide in what God had made him in the place of responsibility.<a name=315:9></a> That was no question of faith.<a name=315:10></a>

		Passing on through the history of the Old Testament we come to Abraham.<a name=315:11></a> It may seem a curious thing to say, that though Abraham was called out by God, yet no present calling was revealed to him.<a name=315:12></a> He was a pilgrim and a stranger, he sought a heavenly country, he looked for Christ's day.<a name=315:13></a> We are told all that, but still I do not think we have the truth of a present calling revealed to Abraham.<a name=315:14></a> I do not doubt what the place of Abraham will be in glory.<a name=315:15></a> He will find what he sought -- "a city which hath foundations".<a name=315:16></a> "He that seeketh findeth".<a name=315:17></a> Abraham sought it according to the instinct given him of God, and you may be sure he will find it.<a name=315:18></a> But Abraham received promises rather than a calling.<a name=315:19></a>

		Now we come to the New Testament, to Christians and the calling of God, I think verse 5 of this chapter makes what the calling is perfectly plain.<a name=316:5></a> It is in the greatest possible contrast to what the calling of Israel is.<a name=316:6></a> He has predestinated us to sonship to Himself, through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will.<a name=316:7></a> That is God's calling so far as we are concerned, and it is the highest privilege which can be conferred upon us.<a name=316:8></a> It has often been said, in regard to union, we are members of Christ; while, in sonship, we are companions of Christ.<a name=316:9></a> He is "the firstborn among many brethren".<a name=316:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to enlarge a little upon this latter.<a name=316:11></a> We find He has "predestinated us to sonship" -- I alter the form of the expression, because "the adoption of children" does not exactly give the sense: it really is "sonship" -- He has "predestinated us to sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will".<a name=316:12></a> I think a great many people read that verse and do not apprehend the force of it.<a name=316:13></a> People have very vague ideas about sonship.<a name=316:14></a> What gives character to sonship in that verse is "through Jesus Christ".<a name=316:15></a> It implies that in order for the accomplishment of the counsel of God, it was needful that Christ should become man, and take His place as man in heaven.<a name=316:16></a> We never could have had the place of sonship through Jesus Christ as He was here upon earth, for He speaks of Himself as the corn of wheat

		that to bear fruit must fall into the ground and die.<a name=317:1></a> There was no such thing as His being the firstborn among many brethren, on the footing of what He was after the flesh, not on His account, but on our account.<a name=317:2></a> One thing was against it -- the judgment of God, death, rested upon every man here in the world when Christ came into it.<a name=317:3></a> And therefore to begin with Christ had to remove that judgment, to die, in order that the judgment which rested upon man might be annulled, and that He might take a new place as man in resurrection, and not only in resurrection, but in heavenly glory, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=317:4></a> The truth is, divine righteousness had to have its full display in Christ in His exaltation.<a name=317:5></a> He glorified God as man, He bore the judgment which rested upon man down here, "Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead", and now divine righteousness has its full display and expression in Christ.<a name=317:6></a> He is not only raised, but exalted to the right hand of God in the heavenly places, and there it is that He is become "the firstborn among many brethren", and we are to be conformed to Him, for the calling is to sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself.<a name=317:7></a> If you trace it to the beginning, that is, what had to be accomplished in order that the will of God might have its full effect.<a name=317:8></a>

		There is another point which I think is important, and that is, that in Scripture the expressions 'children' and 'sons' are not confused.<a name=317:9></a> Both expressions are used in regard to Christians.<a name=317:10></a> A Christian is a child of God.<a name=317:11></a> 'Child' is the word which is always employed in reference to the Christian by the apostle John: "Now are we the children of God".<a name=317:12></a> And again, in the first chapter of John's gospel, "To as many as received him, to them gave he title to take the place of the children of God".<a name=317:13></a> On the other hand, Paul almost invariably uses the word 'sons', though he does once or twice say 'children', too.<a name=317:14></a> A remarkable

		instance is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, where both expressions are employed.<a name=318:1></a> I will show you the distinction between the two.<a name=318:2></a> You could not speak of the Holy Spirit being the Spirit of children; but He is the Spirit of sonship, and for this simple reason, that the Holy Spirit has come down from Christ glorified, from the Son of God in glory, and is therefore the Spirit of sonship in us.<a name=318:3></a> The truth of sonship is this -- the calling of the Christian corresponds to what Christ is in glory, not to what Christ was when He was here upon earth, but to what He is now, and therefore the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of sonship.<a name=318:4></a> But we are children of God.<a name=318:5></a> The idea which children of God conveys to me is that we are the partners of Christ's rejection.<a name=318:6></a> Sonship is that we are the companions of Christ in glory.<a name=318:7></a> And both things are perfectly true to the Christian.<a name=318:8></a> We have fellowship in the sufferings of Christ, and, as in that place, are the special object of the Father's affections.<a name=318:9></a> That is what Christ was when He was here upon earth; He was suffering and rejected; but He was the unfailing object of the Father's delight and affections.<a name=318:10></a> What characterises a child is this, "If so be that we suffer with him".<a name=318:11></a> But while we suffer with Him, we see "what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God" -- mark what follows -- "Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not".<a name=318:12></a> It accords with the expression in the first chapter of John's gospel, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<a name=318:13></a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not".<a name=318:14></a> But what then?<a name=318:15></a> "To as many as received him, to them gave he title to take the place of the children of God".<a name=318:16></a> And therefore it is that the world does not know Christians, because it knew not Him.<a name=318:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thought connected with the calling, and that is priesthood.<a name=319:4></a> The two things are intimately connected, sonship and priesthood.<a name=319:5></a> Because the great idea connected with priesthood in Scripture is access, and it is sons who have access.<a name=319:6></a> There is a further privilege of sonship -- namely, intelligence of the mind and will of the Father.<a name=319:7></a> But the other point is equally true, that we have priestly access.<a name=319:8></a> Sonship is what God has called us to.<a name=319:9></a> How much do we really enter into it?<a name=319:10></a> Many Christians rejoice in the thought of children, and I think we ought to rejoice in it.<a name=319:11></a> We are the children of God now, the apostle lays special stress upon it in that way: "Now are we the children of God"; but it is none the less true that God has called us to the fellowship of Christ in glory.<a name=319:12></a> And what for?<a name=319:13></a> Our pleasure?<a name=319:14></a> No, for His pleasure, "according to the good pleasure of his will".<a name=319:15></a> Remember this, God's counsel is for His pleasure.<a name=319:16></a> He does not order simply for my pleasure, but He makes me know that what I am before Him is for His pleasure.<a name=319:17></a> Your exaltation in the grace of God, whatever you may be called to, is according to His will.<a name=319:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one word about "the hope of the calling".<a name=320:4></a> I have heard the question frequently asked, What is "the hope of his calling"?<a name=320:5></a> Well, I have no doubt at all "the hope of his calling" is purposely left indefinite; Scripture does not say exactly what it is.<a name=320:6></a> But the idea which it gives me is the calling in the consummation of it; I think the point of the prayer is that you should get the present good of it.<a name=320:7></a> If God instructs my soul, by the knowledge of Himself in what is the hope of the calling, I get the present good of it.<a name=320:8></a> We get as heavenly light what soon will be our part.<a name=320:9></a> It is no use attempting to relegate the calling to the future, for the calling is revealed, and the moment it is revealed it is true to faith and good to those who believe.<a name=320:10></a> The secret things belong to God, but the revealed things belong to faith.<a name=320:11></a> And therefore, if the calling is revealed, though you may not yet have got the actuality of it, the actual condition of it, yet what is revealed is the property of faith, and therefore the calling is as good to me as it will be when I get the consummation of it at the coming of the Lord.<a name=320:12></a> I think that is the idea conveyed in the expression.<a name=320:13></a>

		Now I come back to verse 4.<a name=323:2></a> If a person has the Holy Spirit, it is not difficult for me to apprehend that that person is holy and without blame before God in love, so far as he is in the Spirit; but I think the verse gives the standard, and that it is a standard which is to be realised down here.<a name=323:3></a> I do not think I can say I am it; I think any person would make a grave mistake who said that; but it is my standard; and if Christ had complete possession of the heart of a Christian, the Christian would be this, he would be "holy and without blame before God in love".<a name=323:4></a> I have no doubt it will be completely realised in glory.<a name=323:5></a> The condition is a very blessed one, it is a wonderful thing to be practically holy, so that there is a complete instinctive shrinking from all that is evil.<a name=323:6></a> The Christian is to be holy and without blame before God, so that no charge can be laid against him; but then there is another word, that he is to be holy and without blame before God "in love", that is, in the exercise of spiritual affections.<a name=323:7></a> Beloved friends, I do not think a Christian is of himself capable of any spiritual affection, but every spiritual affection in the Christian lies in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=323:8></a> And so the apostle says of the Colossians that Epaphras had declared to him their "love in the Spirit".<a name=323:9></a> The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life in a Christian.<a name=323:10></a> I believe the great defect with most of us is that we are not sufficiently under the sense of obligation, for the moment I come under the sense of obligation, the Spirit of life enables me to respond to the obligation.<a name=323:11></a> I will explain what I mean.<a name=323:12></a> I say, "If God so loved us", what is the obligation?<a name=323:13></a> "We ought also to love one another".<a name=323:14></a> There is the obligation, and the moment that obligation is accepted, the Holy Spirit enables you to fulfil it, and therefore all

		PAUL'S TEACHING SUBSTANTIATED BY JOHN'S IN VIEW OF THE LORD'S COMING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be of service at this moment to bring under the attention of saints the place filled in Scripture by the writings of Paul and John respectively, and the relation in which the one stands to the other in regard to their inspired testimony, for it must not be forgotten that though each inspired instrument has his own distinct line, all the writings go to form one homogeneous whole.<a name=341:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be remarked at the outset that whatever place John filled as an honoured and inspired instrument of inspiration, he had no <i>distinctive</i> commission given to him as regards public service in the world.<a name=341:2></a> He occupied a place in testimony in common with Peter and the twelve, but he laid no distinctive foundation.<a name=341:3></a> Peter was specially commissioned to feed and shepherd the sheep and lambs of Christ.<a name=341:4></a> Paul had a special mission to Gentiles in the gospel, and to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery, but John was to tarry till Christ came.<a name=341:5></a> Hence we find Peter building up new-born saints (Jews of the dispersion) as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, and Paul as a wise master-builder laying a foundation, but the same thing is not found in John's epistles, which serve rather to guard saints from being turned aside from what was from the outset, that is, as to Christ.<a name=341:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel of John and in his epistles we find scarcely an allusion to the assembly in any aspect, though we do find there truths which are essential to it.<a name=341:7></a> In the Revelation the Lord shows to John in a mystical way the assemblies in Asia as an existing fact, and He makes known through John the decline and partial recovery that were to have place in the assembly as a whole; but the point of view is the assembly as

	<div class="paragraph">
		in responsibility, and viewed as departed in heart from its espousal, which had been the special work of Paul.<a name=342:1></a> All this is shown to John, not as a fresh revelation, but as "the things which are" in view of the introduction of things that should be after these, for obviously the latter could not come in until the end of "the things that are" had been made clear.<a name=342:2></a> In the end of the Revelation, John is permitted to see the heavenly city, the bride, the Lamb's wife, in its relations earthward, so to say.<a name=342:3></a> The aim of Paul's ministry had been to set the saints before God in heavenly places according to the truth of the calling of the bride; while John sees her as the holy city descending from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<a name=342:4></a> The assembly is then seen as the intermediary through which God will display His glory to men, and this connects itself with the general line of truth in John; but I think it must be admitted from what has been said that in no sense or aspect can the assembly be regarded as the distinctive work of John.<a name=342:5></a> No dispensation of it was committed to him.<a name=342:6></a> All he has is, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=342:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The foregoing remarks will serve to clear the ground for what follows.<a name=342:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is commonly thought, and perhaps justly, that John's writings are historically the latest of Scripture, but, while admitting this, it must be remembered that to Paul, and not to John, was given to complete the word of God, by the unfolding of the mystery.<a name=342:9></a> What is given to us in the writings of John develops nothing as to God's dispensations, but serves to fill out and confirm what was already there.<a name=342:10></a> As to God's dispensations there can be nothing beyond Paul, in whose writings alone we have the two great parts of Christianity, namely, the gospel of the glory and the mystery.<a name=342:11></a> My present object is to seek to make clear to any who may read, the relation in which John's writings stand to Paul's.<a name=342:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=343>[Page 343]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been often observed that when decay and failure began to be manifest in the assembly viewed as a system set up here on earth, the apostle Paul in his epistles to Timothy and Titus falls back on the promise of life in Christ Jesus, a truth which now became prominent with him, and he speaks of himself as apostle, according to the hope of it.<a name=343:1></a> When the assembly, having become corrupted, could no longer safely be leant on as the pillar and base of the truth, eternal life in Christ comes specially into notice, and apart from the knowledge of it the truth of the assembly according to the thought of God cannot now be apprehended.<a name=343:2></a> According to Paul's general line of teaching, eternal life tends to connect saints with the purpose of God as displayed in Christ in glory, and to separate believers thus in mind and spirit from the corruption which prevails down here, and at the present time it is, I judge, the way by which the truth of the assembly must be reached.<a name=343:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It does not mean that the truth of the assembly is in any way put in the shade, but that eternal life is the road by which the truth of the assembly must be learned.<a name=343:4></a> It was simple in the early days for the saved ones to be added to the assembly, and they were thus practically sheltered from the untoward generation around; but when the assembly has been leavened by evil, and become a place of shelter for every evil thing, the way of return to the truth must of necessity be difficult.<a name=343:5></a> To keep Christ's word, and not deny His name, and to know that He has loved the assembly, demands personal acquaintance with Himself.<a name=343:6></a> In other words, the knowledge of 2 Corinthians must in souls precede that of 1 Corinthians.<a name=343:7></a> I refer, of course, to spiritual apprehension -- Christ written in the heart, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, is needed now to emancipate a soul from the corruptions of Christendom, so that it may enter spiritually into the truth of the assembly.<a name=343:8></a> Many may be brought

		ostensibly on to what is termed church ground who have no spiritual apprehension whatever of the assembly, for the reason that they know little or nothing of life in Christ, which places them morally outside the whole course of things here.<a name=344:1></a> In the true power of it as seen in Paul, we know no one after the flesh.<a name=344:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have before referred to the fact that Paul carries the thought of eternal life on to conformity to Christ in glory, but there is certainly no intention by this to relegate the truth of it to the future.<a name=344:3></a> His ministry was of the new covenant, and had special reference to Christ being written in the heart; and by looking at the glory of the Lord we are changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=344:4></a> He would have saints sow to the Spirit, that of the Spirit they might reap eternal life, and desires Timothy to lay hold on eternal life to which he was called.<a name=344:5></a> Now it is here that, as appears to me, the writings of John are of the greatest moment to us.<a name=344:6></a> He comes in in a way in which neither Paul, nor Luke, the companion of Paul, could.<a name=344:7></a> He bears witness of Christ as having been with Him from the outset.<a name=344:8></a> From him we learn how the question of eternal life had its solution in what had been manifested in Christ here on the earth, unknown of the world and refused by His own.<a name=344:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great feature of John's testimony as to Christ is the declaration of the Father, that is, God revealed toward the world as love, and as now having in the Son, as man, an adequate and sufficient object for the satisfaction of His love.<a name=344:10></a> Then we have the great work effected by Christ in removing from before God, by the cross, all that was contrary to God and that compromised His glory in order that those given to Christ by the Father might be set in His own place as objects here of the Father's love, and receive from the Son the water which He gives to be in them a well of water springing up to eternal life, thus connecting

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that in Scripture there are two distinct senses in which light is spoken of, namely, as exposing, and revealing.<a name=347:1></a> I think we have been accustomed to connect with light too exclusively the former idea.<a name=347:2></a> In natural light we have an analogy; by the bright rays of the great light appointed by God to rule the day, not only is everything which comes within their action exposed, but the heat and vivifying power which emanate from the source of light accompany and cannot be separated from the rays.<a name=347:3></a> They are felt and appreciated by everything not utterly insensible and devoid of feeling.<a name=347:4></a> Thus it was when Christ was here.<a name=347:5></a> He was the light of the world, and those who came within the rays of this light found themselves exposed; but there was with, and characterising those rays, a warmth and power which attracted hearts that felt the weariness engendered by the sin and coldness of the world; and the Lord could say, "He that followeth me shall not continue in darkness, but shall have the light of life".<a name=347:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men welcome increased light in science and natural things, which really means increased knowledge.<a name=347:7></a> How much more does the christian heart welcome the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=347:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the passage before us we have a striking illustration of the application of light in two aspects, that is, as exposing and revealing, the first a necessity of righteousness, the second, so to say, a necessity of love.<a name=347:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man is, since the fall, departed in heart from God, but he cannot in conscience totally ignore God, of whose existence there are too many evidences, and whose word is too well vouched to be easily set aside.<a name=348:2></a> Hence he renders to God outward service, honouring Him with his lips while his heart is far from Him.<a name=348:3></a> There is the total absence of real affection toward God, the heart not having learnt that God has loved him.<a name=348:4></a> What should we think in the family circle of children who, while maintaining outward propriety of demeanour in their intercourse with their parents, made it manifest by the lack of warmth and reality that their hearts were devoid of affection?<a name=348:5></a> And is God to be worse served than parents?<a name=348:6></a> Does man owe less to Him?<a name=348:7></a> Hence it is not difficult to apprehend the completeness of the Lord's exposure of the worthlessness of human service of God.<a name=348:8></a> And it is in principle as true in Christianity as in Judaism.<a name=348:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nor is the exposure of the human heart less severe.<a name=348:10></a> What application could temptation by evil have to a heart that was not already in touch with the evil?<a name=348:11></a> Satan undoubtedly acts on the heart of man, but only to call into activity principles of evil already dwelling there.<a name=348:12></a> Such is the desperate state of things existing in man which was exposed by the light that came into the world.<a name=348:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if all had ended here the case would have been sad indeed.<a name=348:14></a> The exposure would have been complete enough, but the poor exposed heart left without hope, without being made acquainted with good.<a name=348:15></a>

		When God created man, man could not be said to be a dog; nor could he have been acquainted with the moral goodness of God, for he knew neither good nor evil.<a name=349:1></a> He knew God as a beneficent Creator, and One who cared for his well-being; but I do not think he knew God spiritually; but, so to speak, through the medium of created things, and of all that had been established and ordered in relation to himself on earth.<a name=349:2></a> The first man is out of earth, earthy.<a name=349:3></a> But with the fall all was changed.<a name=349:4></a> Man had acquired the knowledge of good and evil, but was withal alienated in heart from God.<a name=349:5></a> Hence the necessity of which the Lord speaks in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>of a man being born again, in order that a spiritual craving may be created in his soul, which nothing but the apprehension of God spiritually can satisfy.<a name=349:6></a>

		But then it is that he is content to accept the place of a dog, of one who, as regards God, has been without shame or sensibility, and thus left without claim on God, save on His compassion.<a name=349:7></a> Such is the place the soul has to take in truth; but only to find that divine goodness and power have come within reach of the appropriation of the most degraded here, with the full knowledge of their degradation, the great divine end being that the love of God might be revealed to the heart of man.<a name=349:8></a> This is light, or rather love revealed as light, good for the feeblest heart.<a name=349:9></a> The Son of man must be lifted up to bear the whole weight of the judgment that rested on man by reason of sin, that God might be revealed as love to the poor human heart, and the believer be enabled by the Spirit to respond to that love which has been manifested to him in the gift of the only-begotten Son of God.<a name=349:10></a> The love of God is shed abroad in the believer's heart by the Holy Spirit given him, and now by the Spirit cries, Abba, Father.<a name=349:11></a> Not only has he reached blessing but liberty.<a name=349:12></a>

		When the Lord comes into the coasts of Caesarea-Philippi, He questions the disciples as to what the people said of Him, and then as to what <i>they</i> said of Him, and Peter confessed, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=351:1></a> No one could have told what change was coming in; the confession of Peter determined it.<a name=351:2></a> The Father had revealed something to Peter, and that revelation determined what was to come in consequent on the rejection of Christ: not only that Christ was rejected, but He had rejected them, "He left them and departed".<a name=351:3></a> We come then to Peter's confession, which brought to light what was to supplant all that existed.<a name=351:4></a> Hence He says: "Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<a name=351:5></a> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it".<a name=351:6></a> Now, the thought of the church is very familiar to us, though many people associate very wrong ideas with it, and look upon it as either a material building, or an organisation of men; but here it means 'assembly'.<a name=351:7></a> I have no doubt that, as to the main idea, Christ was going to build for the day of His glory, not for this world.<a name=351:8></a> We find the <i>present</i> application of the truth of building in chapter 2 of Peter's first epistle; but in this chapter I think the day of His glory is in view, and the idea of the assembly was determined by Peter's confession.<a name=351:9></a> Nothing would have been adequate to that confession but the building of the assembly, nothing else would suit it than that there should be a

		Every intelligent person would answer in a moment -- in Christ.<a name=397:1></a> I see in Christ all that men should be for God, but I see also that He has taken up and discharged every liability under which man lay.<a name=397:2></a> Hence it is that there is redemption in Christ Jesus.<a name=397:3></a> It is very important to apprehend that that is for God.<a name=397:4></a> His proper rights as to the creature maintained, and the rights of redemption secured, and the practical result is that God has set forth Christ in relation to all men, a Mediator between God and men.<a name=397:5></a> Through one righteousness, grace is towards all men unto justification of life.<a name=397:6></a>

		I take another point -- light.<a name=397:11></a> Christ is a light for the revelation of the Gentiles; the Gentiles have come thus into the view of God; they were hid away from God in the darkness.<a name=397:12></a> It is not often that He penetrated into the darkness as in the case of Nineveh; they were hid away in the darkness of idolatry.<a name=397:13></a> Now a great change has come in by Christ.<a name=397:14></a> He is a light on the part of God so that He might see the Gentiles.<a name=397:15></a> He has proclaimed to them in consequence His righteousness in Christ Jesus, that He would have all men to be saved, that was the effect of Christ being a light of the Gentiles.<a name=397:16></a>

		Now I take up the thought of salvation.<a name=398:1></a> Christ is God's salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=398:2></a> I think what may be meant by that is the deliverance of the ends of the earth from the bondage of idolatry and Satan's power.<a name=398:3></a> There is a beautiful expression in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#98">Psalm  98</a>, "All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God".<a name=398:4></a> Where do they see it?<a name=398:5></a> It could only be in Christ.<a name=398:6></a> The ends of the earth were in the eye of God, there is a breach in the power that held them in bondage.<a name=398:7></a> All this mighty change has come in by Christ; we do not apprehend it enough.<a name=398:8></a> The introduction of Christ and the accomplishment of redemption could not leave the situation as it was.<a name=398:9></a> It changed the situation of the Jew, he has become lost in the world, but redemption was accomplished so that Christ might take up a certain position towards all, and so He claims the ends of the earth for our God.<a name=398:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak about the other side.<a name=398:11></a> What I have so far spoken of is what is presented to faith: "I have set thee for a covenant to the people, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the ends of the earth".<a name=398:12></a> It is the common testimony and is preached for faith.<a name=398:13></a> But now as to our side.<a name=398:14></a> You may not yet exactly possess what you believe; your faith sees redemption and light and salvation in Christ, but you may not really have got them.<a name=398:15></a> The point is, how do you get them?<a name=398:16></a> You have not righteousness really till you are brought into attachment; you may apprehend that it is there, but if you have not Christ you have not it, for having Him is righteousness.<a name=398:17></a> You have Him by the Spirit.<a name=398:18></a> Righteousness in its application to all men is presented to faith, and when that is believed the Spirit is given and one is brought into attachment, and a bond is formed between Christ and the believer who can say -- Christ is my righteousness.<a name=398:19></a> All appropriation is by the Spirit of God.<a name=398:20></a> It is very important to see the righteousness of God in its

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now take redemption.<a name=399:2></a> We see the value of redemption to God and to Christ -- that is for faith.<a name=399:3></a> It is a great thing to apprehend it, but how are we going to say, "In whom we have redemption"?<a name=399:4></a> We could never say that but by the Spirit, but having the Spirit we can say, "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins".<a name=399:5></a> That depends on the Spirit of God who is the proof and seal of the believer being in Christ.<a name=399:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to salvation.<a name=399:7></a> I have attempted to speak of what Christ is as God's salvation, but if I have received the Spirit, and am so brought into attachment to Christ, I see that He is salvation to <i>me</i>; I have obtained the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, I have appropriated Him by the Spirit, and that is what many Christians lack.<a name=399:8></a> Faith is there, they apprehend what God is in the revelation of Himself, and in His mind toward man, but there is a lack in appropriating Christ to themselves and all that is set forth in Christ.<a name=399:9></a> He is salvation to <i>me</i>.<a name=399:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I add a word more.<a name=399:11></a> When you appropriate Christ and all that is in Christ, you of necessity reject yourself.<a name=399:12></a> If you say He is righteousness to you, how do you show it?<a name=399:13></a> You practise righteousness by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=399:14></a> And if you practise righteousness by the Spirit of Christ you reject yourself.<a name=399:15></a> The very fact that you practise it by the Spirit of another Man is the proof that you have no righteousness of your own.<a name=399:16></a> If you say, Christ is light to me, what do you virtually allow?<a name=399:17></a> That you have no light in yourself.<a name=399:18></a> A mariner could not steer his ship if he had not the light of heaven; even his compass will not do of itself, the light of the heavens is essential for its adjustment.<a name=399:19></a> Well, I say, Christ is light to us, and till we had Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		No man can say that Christ is light to him but by the Spirit of Christ, but it means, I reject myself as dark.<a name=400:3></a> So every step brings you to the rejection of yourself as you adopt Christ instead of yourself.<a name=400:4></a> Salvation is in Christ Jesus.<a name=400:5></a> Naturally we are in bondage to the world and sin; how do you get out of it?<a name=400:6></a> By getting into another atmosphere, and until you do, you will never get out of the world.<a name=400:7></a> And what has established the atmosphere?<a name=400:8></a> Christ.<a name=400:9></a> He has established the Christian circle down here; you do not love the brethren naturally, you love them by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=400:10></a> What does all that mean?<a name=400:11></a> It means that in the apprehension of salvation in the Christian circle you reject yourself, because you have accepted and appropriated Christ.<a name=400:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that Christ has come in, it is an absolute impossibility that another man can have place before God.<a name=400:13></a> God may allow things to come to such a pass that antichrist may be set up, but no other man save Christ can abide before God.<a name=400:14></a> There must of necessity be the rejection of ourselves as we appropriate and adopt what is in Christ.<a name=400:15></a> It virtually means, I have no righteousness.<a name=400:16></a> And to say that Christ is light to me is tantamount to saying there is none in us.<a name=400:17></a> Would a philosopher say so?<a name=400:18></a> No, he is not prepared to humble himself, he thinks he has light in him.<a name=400:19></a> So as to salvation, it allows that I was in bondage and could not deliver myself.<a name=400:20></a> I reject the man that was not susceptible to salvation; that man has to be rejected as Christ is accepted and appropriated.<a name=400:21></a> We have to begin in faith to apprehend what Christ is for God in the moral universe, and its bearing; but then comes another experience on the part of the Christian, to find that he has everything in Christ -- redemption,

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it should be a great encouragement to us that the Spirit should see fit to give us a picture of the church (or of Christianity, if you will), not only in the order of the early days, as seen in the early chapters of the Acts, but, too, when things were not in that order.<a name=415:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle brings before us here that in which he could find his satisfaction, when the most painful elements had come in -- such elements as you see in chapter 2 and in chapter 3 particularly -- "Many walk [not simply few] of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ", etc.<a name=415:2></a> That was what the church had come to to a large extent.<a name=415:3></a> They were not heathens, nor Jews; but in practice they were the enemies of the cross of Christ.<a name=415:4></a> If that were the state of things then, it is the state at the present moment.<a name=415:5></a> It is what profession has come to; the mass of Christendom are in practice the enemies of the cross of Christ.<a name=415:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by that expression is this: people who sanction the flesh are the enemies of God's testimony.<a name=415:7></a> The cross of Christ means that God has set aside the flesh in the cross, and those who sanction it in divine things are enemies of all the testimonies converged in the cross.<a name=415:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If that was the outward state of things at the beginning, and is still the outward state of things, we may take the other side, and we may find that in which the heart of the Lord can find satisfaction.<a name=415:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Philippians shows it.<a name=415:10></a> Philippi was a fragment of the church, and there, in a general state of declension, the heart of the apostle could find

	<div class="paragraph">
		satisfaction.<a name=416:1></a> You cannot find a greater privilege than to give satisfaction to the heart of Christ.<a name=416:2></a> The church is <i>here</i> to answer morally to what Christ is <i>there</i>.<a name=416:3></a> Every trait of Christ will be set forth by the church in glory and it should be so here now.<a name=416:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to see that that is the connecting link between the church in glory and the church now.<a name=416:5></a> The apostolic church comes to an end when the Spirit leaves it, and only corruption is left.<a name=416:6></a> In the meantime "Jew and Gentile are builded together by the Spirit".<a name=416:7></a> What supplants it in the millennium is the Holy City.<a name=416:8></a> But the <i>body</i> of Christ is the connecting link between the present and the future.<a name=416:9></a> That is just as real now as then, and then, as now.<a name=416:10></a> The moral thought of the body is that in which He Himself is set forth, e.<a name=416:11></a>g.<a name=416:12></a>, you cannot penetrate into my mind: all that anyone knows of me is that which is set forth in my body; they may see the expression of my mind in my eye, and in my words.<a name=416:13></a> The body is that in which the intelligence of man is set forth.<a name=416:14></a> "<i>His</i> body is the fulness of him which filleth all in all".<a name=416:15></a> That will be true hereafter of the Holy City, but it is true now.<a name=416:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Christ in you, the hope of glory", that is Christ set forth in the church.<a name=416:17></a> That was the intention of the church -- to be the reflex of Christ in glory, to be the presentation of Christ in the very scene where He was rejected.<a name=416:18></a> That is what the body is set here for, not that <i>we</i> are to be seen, but <i>Christ</i>; not simply Christ in the individual, but Christ in the company.<a name=416:19></a>

		Previous to speaking of the Christian circle in chapter 2, the apostle unfolds in chapter 1 the whole outward state of things at the moment, and it is what corresponds to what we are conscious of at this moment.<a name=417:5></a> We should be thankful that the Spirit has opened up to us the outward state of things as here: there is nothing covered up, but the whole state of things at Rome is all laid bare to us.<a name=417:6></a> I am thankful it is so.<a name=417:7></a> If you see all this now the next thing is to be ambitious that there should be too what answers to chapter 2.<a name=417:8></a> If it were not for the word of God we could not understand the outward state of things at present.<a name=417:9></a> But seeing that, we must remember "the arm of the Lord is not shortened", but our desire be to answer to chapter 2 -- the circle.<a name=417:10></a> You can never run the race unless you know something of the calling.<a name=417:11></a> In Hebrews you get, first the calling, and then the race.<a name=417:12></a> That is a point of great importance.<a name=417:13></a>

		I just refer to a few points in the chapter.<a name=420:2></a> Verses 12 - 20.<a name=420:3></a> I ask one question.<a name=420:4></a> What possible satisfaction could the apostle find in Rome in the general state of things there?<a name=420:5></a> He was in prison, though what came to pass in the providence of God was that the apostle was vindicated; it was manifested that he was not bound as an evil-doer, but that it was in connection with the testimony, "bonds in Christ".<a name=420:6></a> God allowed it to be so ordered that the testimony was not marred.<a name=420:7></a> The effect of that was remarkable; it was to give impetus to the preaching of the gospel.<a name=420:8></a> But even in the preaching, the motives were not all pure (verses 15 - 18).<a name=420:9></a> There is a deal of mixed motive in connection with the testimony here.<a name=420:10></a> Not a state of things to afford satisfaction to the heart of the apostle.<a name=420:11></a> But his great heart carried him above it all.<a name=420:12></a> It is great grace that this state of things should be opened out to us.<a name=420:13></a> He saw that it would work to his salvation (verse 19) personally, that Christ might "be magnified", etc.<a name=420:14></a> His salvation was not deliverance from prison, but has a much larger sense, complete deliverance from all the power of the enemy, and the way of it was through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, so that "Christ might be magnified .<a name=420:15></a>.<a name=420:16></a>.<a name=420:17></a> whether by life or by death".<a name=420:18></a> He was certainly a very special vessel of God's testimony.<a name=420:19></a> "For to me to live is Christ"; he was so transparent, so governed by God's testimony, that not Paul was seen in the apostle, but Christ was seen in him.<a name=420:20></a> Even the state of things at Rome, which must have been exceedingly trying to his spirit, "yet would turn to his salvation".<a name=420:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now as to his thought in regard to the saints.<a name=420:22></a> It is blessed to see his confidence in God in regard to himself, but what he desired and expected on the part of the saints at Philippi -- what was this confidence in

	<div class="paragraph">
		which he could find satisfaction?<a name=421:1></a> (verses 23 - 30.<a name=421:2></a>) Now one point which strikes me is the remarkable way in which the heart of the apostle goes out to the saints.<a name=421:3></a> He is in a strait, yet determines to remain for their sake.<a name=421:4></a> He partook in the affection of Christ which so strikingly comes out in the gospels.<a name=421:5></a> There is nothing more beautiful than to see the affection of Christ coming out in a vessel -- here working in him, the prisoner.<a name=421:6></a> You can understand his saying, "For to me to live is Christ".<a name=421:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will never understand the truth of the church if you do not apprehend the devoted affection with which Christ regarded the little company of disciples down here.<a name=421:8></a> There is the same devoted affection in resurrection.<a name=421:9></a> The same comes out in the apostle, though it meant personal gain to depart; yet he was content to remain for their sakes.<a name=421:10></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have pointed out what I thought was the connection in the epistle, the progress in it of what is unfolded.<a name=423:1></a> It is not a doctrinal epistle; there is not the unfolding of the purpose of God; but it is essentially a practical epistle.<a name=423:2></a> Another thing is that it presents what is highly experimental, e.<a name=423:3></a>g.<a name=423:4></a>, you do not get <i>sin</i> spoken of.<a name=423:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 1 we get the state of things existing when the apostle wrote.<a name=423:6></a> There is no attempt to gloss over the state of things which existed there.<a name=423:7></a> It was not encouraging, nor was the outward state of Christianity, as disclosed in the end of chapter 3, "enemies", etc.<a name=423:8></a> And at Rome the testimony was bound by the world power.<a name=423:9></a> These points connect it with our time.<a name=423:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 we get the generation according to God -- a divine generation -- a circle according to God.<a name=423:11></a> I say 'generation' because children of God (blameless and harmless, without rebuke, etc.<a name=423:12></a>) are to come out here in that light.<a name=423:13></a> It is not their position, but their characteristics.<a name=423:14></a> The desire of the apostle was to see them answering to it.<a name=423:15></a> There is divine power here to give effect to that.<a name=423:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God cannot be bound.<a name=423:17></a> He will not work in channels which men have made for Him.<a name=423:18></a> You cannot bind "leviathan with a hook".<a name=423:19></a> But He is here to effect what is according to God and He certainly will carry out what is for God's good pleasure.<a name=423:20></a> There may not be much in display, but the mighty power is here and works according to God, and to promote what is suitable to God.<a name=423:21></a> But you cannot bind the Spirit of God, and there is no more important thing than for saints to be in the line where He works.<a name=423:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And what was there at Philippi?<a name=423:23></a> A handful of people of no account in this world, but great in the

		eyes of God, sons of God.<a name=424:1></a> That is a point of great encouragement.<a name=424:2></a> We are small enough in this day, despised and thought nothing of by man, nothing can exceed our smallness, and the Philippians were not much different.<a name=424:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 you get the <i>race</i>, which is individual, and answers to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>.<a name=424:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9">1 Corinthians  9</a>shows the purpose of his running.<a name=424:5></a> The idea of a race must view the saints as individuals.<a name=424:6></a> Each seeks to reach the goal -- you do not run as a company.<a name=424:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 2 there are three points:-
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The mind which is in Christ.<a name=424:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) The exaltation of Christ.<a name=424:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) Divine generation (I use the word in its moral sense) down here.<a name=424:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will see how these three points are connected.<a name=424:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The mind of Christ.<a name=424:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) Is consequent on the first and
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) Follows that -- the company here "blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation".<a name=424:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my conviction is that all is based on the first part.<a name=424:14></a> The exaltation of Christ, and the formation of the Christian circle is based on the cross, on <i>death</i>, because death is prominent in the first part of the chapter.<a name=424:15></a> Death is emphasised -- even the death of the cross.<a name=424:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian company is the vessel of testimony, "Among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life".<a name=424:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is only one subject of testimony in Christianity.<a name=424:18></a> It has not always been that, God has had different testimonies at different times.<a name=424:19></a> Now, the only one is Christ, at the right hand of God.<a name=424:20></a> Our great anxiety should be whether we are morally according to it, so that there is no hindrance to the light of the Lord

		shining out here.<a name=425:1></a> The Lord will be displayed, but before that there is a testimony to the glory of the Lord.<a name=425:2></a> The Holy Spirit is here for that.<a name=425:3></a> The testimony of the church is, and was, for that.<a name=425:4></a> The vessel of testimony should be according to that glory.<a name=425:5></a> "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>.<a name=425:6></a> That is where people are not anxious enough.<a name=425:7></a> There are many who see what it is but are not anxious to be in accordance with it.<a name=425:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And death is the basis.<a name=425:9></a> Why?<a name=425:10></a> The great difficulty in the way was the man down here, and man owned of God, too.<a name=425:11></a> And by man I mean a certain order of man, a man of that kind after the flesh -- under death and as under the law, under the curse.<a name=425:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The important point was to set aside that man -- for God's glory.<a name=425:13></a> God did not do so till man had first been tested in every way.<a name=425:14></a> He ran riot to the flood; after that he failed under law.<a name=425:15></a> He was tested by the presence of Christ, and then by the witness of the Holy Spirit.<a name=425:16></a> The point was to set aside the hindrance -- that was the great difficulty with God.<a name=425:17></a> Now the Son of God comes out (in the first part of the chapter) a divine Person, and what we have in the passage is that <i>He</i> goes down into death.<a name=425:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two steps in order that man may be set aside completely and eternally for God's glory.<a name=425:19></a> What Christ had to enter into <i>really</i>, we have to <i>in mind</i>.<a name=425:20></a> With Him it was death actually, with us it is very different, because the great obstruction to the work of God in us is <i>ourselves</i>.<a name=425:21></a> We have to come to the cross in order that the obstruction may be removed.<a name=425:22></a> As long as I allow anything of self, I am an obstruction to the work of God in me.<a name=425:23></a> There is nothing more important for us than to have that mind.<a name=425:24></a> It is beautiful to see how God reaches a result.<a name=425:25></a> Death was a result to reach and God had a short way of reaching it.<a name=425:26></a> We
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=426>[Page 426]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		have a long way in reaching it.<a name=426:1></a> God could reach that end shortly, but we often take a long tedious way to reach it.<a name=426:2></a> But if you do not reach it you simply leave a great obstruction in God's ways with you.<a name=426:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verses 4 - 11.<a name=426:4></a> Now, beloved friends, you see two great steps in the course which Christ took.<a name=426:5></a> First in verse 7, the second in verse 8.<a name=426:6></a> The Spirit of God does not speak of humbling Himself till He has become man.<a name=426:7></a> In the first step He does not consider Himself, "Lo, I come to do thy will", that is, before He becomes man.<a name=426:8></a> How often <i>we</i> assert ourselves in doing what we are appointed to!<a name=426:9></a> <i>He</i> "took upon him the servant's form".<a name=426:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second step, "He humbled himself", etc.<a name=426:11></a> Death meant the removal of the man which existed before the eye of God.<a name=426:12></a> He disappeared in the death of Christ.<a name=426:13></a> That death was the end of the man, <i>and</i> in it God was glorified.<a name=426:14></a> God might have set aside the man in judgment, but that was not God's way, but God was glorified where man was set aside.<a name=426:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Obedient unto death, even the death of the cross".<a name=426:16></a> It is a great thing to know that the man who was the obstruction has so disappeared that God is completely glorified.<a name=426:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to come to death and the death of the cross.<a name=426:18></a> The apostle could say, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless", etc.<a name=426:19></a>, and "How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?<a name=426:20></a>" God could simply and quickly reach the point in the death of Christ, but it is by a tedious way that we have to travel.<a name=426:21></a> Do we desire to reach it?<a name=426:22></a> We must be as clay in the hands of the potter, content to let Him mould us.<a name=426:23></a> If so we should have to come to the mind of death, That man has gone for God and I can say he has gone for myself, I am crucified with Christ.<a name=426:24></a> I do not get the <i>judgment</i> of the cross, Christ took that, but to the mind of it.<a name=426:25></a> If you have not come to it, there is a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second point is consequent on the cross, "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father".<a name=427:2></a> Everything shall be under the hand of man, but under the hand of the Man who glorified God.<a name=427:3></a> By 'name' I understand '<i>renown</i>'.<a name=427:4></a> "At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow".<a name=427:5></a> It is not a question of authority over those who believe, but it is universal authority based upon God being glorified in the death of Christ.<a name=427:6></a> "Every knee" shall bow.<a name=427:7></a> Now there is the possibility of the knee bowing in grace and faith.<a name=427:8></a> That is what the Christian does now; it is the condition of salvation.<a name=427:9></a> "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved".<a name=427:10></a>

		It seems to me this epistle is of peculiar interest to us, because of the great moral connection between what is in it and the present time.<a name=431:1></a> I am aware that the epistle was written at a time when Rome was at the height of her power, and outwardly all the circumstances of the church were different; but beneath the surface there are marks which identify it with the present time, e.<a name=431:2></a>g.<a name=431:3></a>, the world power had asserted itself with regard to God's witness.<a name=431:4></a> He was not man's apostle, not a self-constituted apostle, but God's apostle, and the world power had bound him.<a name=431:5></a> Do you say, 'how much did the world power know of it?<a name=431:6></a>' Not very much, certainly, but that does not alter the fact.<a name=431:7></a> You have the same principle today.<a name=431:8></a> The world power takes cognisance and control of Christianity.<a name=431:9></a> The Queen, in England, is recognised as the head of the church -- the reigning power claims authority over the church.<a name=431:10></a> It came in specially with Rome, which became the seat of ecclesiastical authority.<a name=431:11></a>

		One great point in the chapter is the exaltation of Christ at the right hand of God, and at the same time, the Christian circle in which God is operating to give them deliverance morally from all that is not of resurrection.<a name=433:14></a> In chapter 3 there is another thought.<a name=433:15></a> It is not the circle.<a name=433:16></a> The apostle unfolds what has a place religiously on the earth, and you will find in contrast to that the Christian has to pursue a race largely on account of the state of things here.<a name=433:17></a> One point which connects it remarkably with the present time is, the chapter opens with apostate Judaism and ends with

		In the Scriptures the Spirit of God has seen fit to give us a picture of the church, not only when all was in order, as at Jerusalem in early days, but also when things had fallen into disorder.<a name=440:1></a> In this epistle the apostle Paul has shown us that in which his heart found comfort and resource when this was so.<a name=440:2></a> There are several elements in this epistle which indicate the pass to which things had come.<a name=440:3></a> There were those who had become "enemies of the cross".<a name=440:4></a> In such a state of things the Spirit of God is pleased to show us in what the apostle found satisfaction.<a name=440:5></a> There are many in our day of the same character as those described by the apostle, not enemies perhaps of Christ, but enemies of the cross, that is, who sanction the flesh.<a name=440:6></a> If the state of things which characterised the apostle's day marks ours, I do not see why there should not be here at the same time that which is for the Lord's satisfaction, something which He can approve.<a name=440:7></a> I do not believe we could have a more just ambition than to give satisfaction to the heart of Christ.<a name=440:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church here is correspondent to Christ in glory.<a name=440:9></a> There is a connecting link between the church now and the church in glory.<a name=440:10></a> The house of God, that form of God's dwelling, will come to an end, the heavenly city will supplant it; but the body of Christ is the connecting link between the present and the future; it will be as real then as it is now.<a name=440:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral idea in the body is that the mind is set forth in it; my body is the part which is patent, my spirit cannot be penetrated, but the body is that in which my mind is set forth.<a name=440:12></a> So, too, the body of Christ is that in which Christ is set forth; you get

		<a name=441>[Page 441]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the expression, "Christ in you, the hope of glory", that is, Christ set forth in His body.<a name=441:1></a> The church down here is morally the reflex of Christ in glory; it is the mystery, the presentation of Christ in a body, in the scene from which He has been rejected.<a name=441:2></a> It is not we to be seen, but Christ; not simply Christ in the individual, but Christ in the company.<a name=441:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 of this epistle we have the company -- the circle.<a name=441:4></a> In chapter 3 is the race, and that is individual; there is a race, and there is a circle.<a name=441:5></a> Chapter 4 is supplementary, and gives the bearing of one who is running the race of the third chapter.<a name=441:6></a> There are two things that mark the Christian -- the calling, and the race.<a name=441:7></a> These come out in Hebrews, in which chapter 10 gives the calling, and chapter 12 the race.<a name=441:8></a> So here in chapter 2 we get the Christian circle, with which the calling is connected.<a name=441:9></a> If you are answering to the mind of Christ with regard to the circle, then you will run the race; chapter 3.<a name=441:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But previous to speaking about the company, we find the apostle describing the outward state of things in profession and in the world.<a name=441:11></a> This is brought out in a remarkable way in chapter 1; the scene is not rose-coloured, but the real state is laid bare to us.<a name=441:12></a> Much corresponds to what marks the present time, and if so, let it be our desire to see a company answering to what is set forth in chapter 2.<a name=441:13></a> The Lord's arm is not shortened, He can work this now.<a name=441:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will speak of the outward state of things in connection with three centres: (1) Jerusalem, where Christianity began; then (2) Antioch; and (3) subsequently, Rome.<a name=441:15></a> These were centres of the Spirit's activity in the testimony.<a name=441:16></a> What opposed the testimony in Jerusalem was the religious element; the Jewish leaders, the priests and scribes, were the opposers.<a name=441:17></a> God's testimony now, as then, is Christ Jesus in glory; and God does not display anything until He has first set it forth in the way of testimony; this is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=442>[Page 442]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's way, and it could be proved all through Scripture.<a name=442:1></a> The promises were given in the way of testimony, and they are not in display yet, though confirmed in Christ.<a name=442:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony now is Christ in glory, and God does not display Christ until there has been a full testimony to this.<a name=442:3></a> We form part of that which is the present testimony to His glory.<a name=442:4></a> The testimony consists not in what people say, but in what they are.<a name=442:5></a> Testimony, in the divine thought of it, is what people are.<a name=442:6></a> Abraham and those who had promises gave testimony to them by what they were.<a name=442:7></a> They were strangers and pilgrims, and sought a heavenly city.<a name=442:8></a> Moses' testimony was in identification with the people of God in reproach.<a name=442:9></a> If we are in the light of Christ's glory, we must accept the other side too, we must be identified with His reproach -- with the cross.<a name=442:10></a> Do you think that anyone in the light of the glory of the Lord is governed by what people are here?<a name=442:11></a> He is carried in superiority to all here, and that is the testimony.<a name=442:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you read the beginning of the Acts you can see what the apostles bore witness of; what had they to testify of but the sufferings and glory of the Lord?<a name=442:13></a> The apostle Paul did so, too, when he was converted, but he gave witness also to His fuller glory -- that He was the Son of God.<a name=442:14></a> The twelve bore witness to the exaltation of Christ as the Holy Spirit taught them, but in the apostle Paul's case, Christ having been revealed to him from glory, immediately he preached that He is the Son of God, and this was additional light to what the twelve had testified.<a name=442:15></a> "It pleased God to reveal HIS SON in me", and this was for preaching.<a name=442:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The element at Jerusalem which opposed the testimony was the religious one; it would not tolerate a testimony to an exalted Christ.<a name=442:17></a> We have not quite the same character of opposition now; it came directly from the Jewish leaders.<a name=442:18></a> Now God has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=443>[Page 443]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		scattered the Jews all over the world.<a name=443:1></a> The opposition was from without.<a name=443:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At Antioch you get a different form of opposition.<a name=443:3></a> The effort of the enemy there was to mar the testimony by bringing in a Judaising element -- insisting that Christians should be circumcised and keep the law.<a name=443:4></a> This opposition was from within.<a name=443:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we pass on to Rome, we do not get there the religious opposition, but the world-power, and the apostle was held in bondage by the world-power.<a name=443:6></a> This identifies that time very much with the present; the testimony has come under the world-power -- not in the literal way in which it was in the apostle's day.<a name=443:7></a> The world-power is allowed of God in the interests of the testimony, not to dominate it as it does.<a name=443:8></a> It was never the intention of God that the world-power should take the control, any more than that the apostle of the testimony should be held in bondage by it.<a name=443:9></a> From that time to this, more or less, the testimony has been held in bondage by the world-power.<a name=443:10></a> This is what marred the Reformation, it was fettered, and so is the testimony now, by the world-power.<a name=443:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to a few details in the chapter in verses 12 - 20.<a name=443:12></a> I ask what possible satisfaction could the heart of the apostle have had in the general state of things in Rome, and even in regard of the testimony?<a name=443:13></a> Some were preaching Christ of contention.<a name=443:14></a> Yet what came to pass in the providence of God was that it became manifest that the apostle was not in bonds as an evil-doer, his bonds were in Christ -- this was manifest in the palace, and to all.<a name=443:15></a> This was important, because, if it were not so the testimony would have been marred.<a name=443:16></a> This fact of his being vindicated gave an impetus to preaching, but a great deal of mixed motive was betrayed in the preaching.<a name=443:17></a> Though there was not satisfaction to the apostle in this, yet his heart was great enough to rise above it.<a name=443:18></a> And there was another thing -- he saw it would work for his salvation.<a name=443:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=444>[Page 444]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Personally with him the point was that Christ should be magnified in his body.<a name=444:1></a> Salvation here means his complete deliverance from all the power and workings of the enemy, not from prison and bonds.<a name=444:2></a> The way of it was by their prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<a name=444:3></a> The apostle was so transparent that he could say, "To me to live is Christ", and so Christ was magnified in his body.<a name=444:4></a> This, too, was his earnest expectation and his hope.<a name=444:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we see, too, his thought in regard of the saints, not merely in regard to himself.<a name=444:6></a> There was that at Philippi in which the heart of the apostle could find satisfaction, as we see (verses 24 - 30).<a name=444:7></a> One point which strikes us is the remarkable way in which his heart went out to the saints.<a name=444:8></a> He was in a strait, having desire to depart, but he chose to remain for the sake of the saints, he partook in the affection of Christ for His own.<a name=444:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more beautiful than the affection of Christ at work in him, and exercising him in regard of the saints; it was the reproduction in him of Christ.<a name=444:10></a> You cannot understand the church if you do not apprehend the devoted affection of Christ for those whom the Father gave to Him.<a name=444:11></a> Death did not change Him, nor resurrection; His affection is ever the same.<a name=444:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the saints, the apostle wanted that their conversation should be worthy of the gospel of Christ; they were not to be afraid of their adversaries; no one could be afraid of adversaries if they stood in the light of the gospel, in the light of the glory in which God has been pleased to shine forth.<a name=444:13></a> We first taste the grace of God, but when the heart has become acquainted with that we learn the glory of God, that is, the effulgence of God shining out in Christ.<a name=444:14></a> God has achieved all the purpose of His heart; every attribute of God is set forth in a Man, and that Man is vested with power to conform all to the pleasure of God.<a name=444:15></a> Every attribute of God is effulgent in the face

	<div class="paragraph">
		of Jesus Christ; but more, He has power to subdue everything to Himself, but all has to start from the right hand of God.<a name=445:1></a> The new man is created "after God", in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=445:2></a> That is the work of Christ at the right hand of God, and of the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=445:3></a> The light has come in to discover the lost piece of silver; and the light is the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=445:4></a> The first act of Christ from the right hand of God was to give the Holy Spirit, and His last act of power from that place will be to conform us to His own image in glory.<a name=445:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the gospel; God has no testimony but the gospel, and the gospel is the light of the glory of God.<a name=445:6></a> Outwardly, or apparently, we are in the world, but our souls are in the light of the glory of God.<a name=445:7></a> It is only thus that we can walk worthy of the gospel and not be afraid of adversaries; Christ is at the right hand of God in power.<a name=445:8></a> We can only bear testimony to His glory as we are in the light of His glory, and in the consciousness of the power with which He is vested to conform all to Himself.<a name=445:9></a> This is what God has achieved for Himself.<a name=445:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And our conversation is to be that which becometh the gospel of Christ; and as servants we should be characterised by the affection of Christ, which enabled the apostle to sacrifice his own personal advantage for the sake of the saints.<a name=445:11></a> That was really divine affection.<a name=445:12></a> May these things mark us more.<a name=445:13></a>

		(2) A GENERATION ACCORDING TO GOD

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to observe the progress of the truth in this epistle.<a name=446:1></a> Philippians is not doctrinal, it is a practical epistle; it is not exactly an unfolding of the purpose of God, but highly experimental.<a name=446:2></a> Sin is not referred to in it, as has been said.<a name=446:3></a> In chapter 1 is opened out the state of things which existed in the apostle's day, of which he makes no secret.<a name=446:4></a> The apostle was held in bondage by the power at Rome; this was not encouraging, neither was the state of Christians encouraging; he speaks of all seeking their own, and of those who were enemies of the cross of Christ.<a name=446:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2, however, we get the generation which is according to God, what might be called a divine generation morally; "children of God", the Philippians were to come out here in that light.<a name=446:6></a> The passage does not refer so much to their position, but as to how they were to come out morally.<a name=446:7></a> "Blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life".<a name=446:8></a> The apostle desired that the saints might be here answering to that which is according to God.<a name=446:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to remember that there is divine power here to effectuate in the saints that which is for His pleasure, "it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure".<a name=446:10></a> The Spirit of God will carry out that which is for God's good pleasure; it may not be anything great in display, nor yet may it be operated in the channels we might expect, but none the less there is mighty power down here, undiminished power to effectuate what is according to God; the Spirit of God cannot be bound.<a name=446:11></a> It

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is a great thing to be in the line and circle where the Spirit of God so works.<a name=447:1></a> In the apostle's day what was wrought was that the little company at Philippi should be here bearing the character of the children of God; they were not of great account in this world, for they were but poor; and this is encouraging to us; nothing possibly can exceed our smallness and insignificance, but so it was, too, with the Philippians.<a name=447:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 3 presents the race, and is individual, and most important in its bearing; the race is also referred to in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>, and again in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9">1 Corinthians  9</a>, "So run I, not as uncertainly", the apostle shows there the purpose which energised him in running.<a name=447:3></a> We do not run a race as a company; it is each one for himself trying to reach the goal.<a name=447:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things which come out in the second chapter: (1) the mind of Christ Jesus, which is also to come out in the saints; (2) the exaltation of Christ; and (3) the generation which was to be here according to God, "blameless and harmless, children of God, without rebuke".<a name=447:5></a> I believe the whole is based on the first point.<a name=447:6></a> The exaltation of Christ, and the Christian circle here are both based upon the "death of the cross".<a name=447:7></a> The Christian circle is the vessel of testimony, for the saints are to shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=447:8></a> There is but one subject of testimony now; it was not always thus.<a name=447:9></a> God has had different testimonies at different times; but the testimony now is Christ at the right hand of God; Christians are said to be "light in the Lord".<a name=447:10></a> God has given testimony to the glory of the Lord, and He would have us in the light of it before Christ comes out in display.<a name=447:11></a> The Holy Spirit has come down here to report the glory of Christ, and the vessel of the testimony is in the light of that glory.<a name=447:12></a> Saints are not anxious enough as to being suitable for that testimony; we all like to be in the light of it.<a name=447:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, death is the basis of all; it must be so, for
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=448>[Page 448]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there was a man down here after the flesh, under death, under law, and under curse; until that man was set aside to God's glory God could not carry out the purpose of His will; God did not do this until that man had been fully tested, without law, by law, by prophets, and finally by Christ.<a name=448:1></a> That man was the difficulty in the way of God.<a name=448:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has come to pass is this -- a divine Person has come forth, and that Person has gone down into death in order that that man should be for ever set aside to God's glory; thus to remove out of the way what was in the way of God carrying out His purpose.<a name=448:3></a> We have on our part to enter in mind into that which Christ entered into actually; we have to come in mind to letting that man go, otherwise there is obstruction to the work of God in me.<a name=448:4></a> There could be nothing more important than to come to that: "Let this mind be in you".<a name=448:5></a> Death was the point to be reached and God reached it shortly in Christ; we have to reach that end by another road, and it often takes us a long time to reach it, and if you do not reach it, there is constant obstruction in God's ways with you.<a name=448:6></a> We are sometimes indisposed to go that road.<a name=448:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to return to Christ (verses 5 - 11); there are two steps in the course which He took: (1) "He made himself of no reputation"; (2) "He humbled himself and became obedient unto death".<a name=448:8></a> He is not spoken of as humbling Himself until He had become a man.<a name=448:9></a> He did not consider Himself even when in the form of God, He made Himself of no reputation.<a name=448:10></a> How often we assert ourselves, but He made Himself of no reputation, of no account.<a name=448:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have the second step, "He humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross", and death meant the removal of the old man from before the eye of God.<a name=448:12></a> When Christ died the man that stood in the way disappeared from under the eye of God, and to God's glory.<a name=448:13></a> There were two
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=449>[Page 449]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		things -- the old man was gone, but more than that, God was glorified where that man was set aside; the man after the flesh who was the obstruction to God carrying out His purpose has disappeared.<a name=449:1></a> The apostle had reached death and crucifixion for himself, he could say, "I am crucified with Christ"; we get to it often in a more tedious way.<a name=449:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are you all content to be as clay in the hand of the potter?<a name=449:3></a> If so, you have come to that mind, that the old man has gone.<a name=449:4></a> All have to come to the mind of the cross, not to its judgment, for Christ took that.<a name=449:5></a> If you do not, you maintain a great obstruction to God's having His way with you.<a name=449:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the second point (verse 9), "God also hath highly exalted him".<a name=449:7></a> All is put under the hand of man, but not under the hand of the man who offended, but of the One who glorified God; God has highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name.<a name=449:8></a> Name implies renown; it is not the thought here of the authority of Christ over those who believed, but of His universal authority, "every knee shall bow".<a name=449:9></a> There are those who are bowed now in grace and faith, but the thought here embraces all.<a name=449:10></a> We confess Him now as Lord, with the mouth, but "We see Jesus crowned with glory and honour", all is put under that Man; the world to come is put under man because He has accomplished redemption.<a name=449:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When all which stood in the way was removed, God had a free hand, and He put forth His mighty power, and raised Christ from the dead and set Him at His right hand.<a name=449:12></a> When God began with Adam, He began with the dust of the earth, but the starting-point for the carrying out of God's purpose is now the right hand of God -- all emanates from that point.<a name=449:13></a> There is given to Christ universal dominion.<a name=449:14></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>confirms this in verses 22 - 26; we have there two things: "The Son quickeneth whom he will", and (2) all judgment

	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle has a peculiar interest to us, for there is a moral connection between what comes out in it and the present time.<a name=453:1></a> I admit that it was written at the time when Rome was in the plenitude of its power, and the church in a different condition from what it is now, but still, if we look beneath the surface, there are points which correspond to the present time.<a name=453:2></a> First, the world-power had asserted itself in regard of God's apostle.<a name=453:3></a> Paul was not a self-constituted apostle, he was God's messenger, God's apostle.<a name=453:4></a> He had a testimony from God, and the world-power held him in bondage.<a name=453:5></a> So the world-power today claims authority over the church of God.<a name=453:6></a> The Queen is recognised as the head of the church in England.<a name=453:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no lack of preaching in the apostle's day; many were emboldened to take part in the preaching, for it had become manifest that his bonds were in Christ.<a name=453:8></a> The apostle rejoices in the fact of the gospel being preached, but there was not much comfort if he looked at the motives at work in it; this, however, is regarding things as they are viewed in chapter 1, outwardly at Rome.<a name=453:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the next chapter we get another standpoint, that is, from the divine side, on the platform of resurrection.<a name=453:10></a> This world is the platform where man works, where forces come into collision; but resurrection is God's platform.<a name=453:11></a> Sin has been removed and the old man condemned, and God is now free to act according to His will towards man; God is free to justify; and on the platform of resurrection to fulfil all the good pleasure of His will, to act according to Himself.<a name=453:12></a> In connection with that there are two things which are the present fruit of the death of Christ, and are what

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is not properly an order of things connected with this world; many regard it so, they go to church and pray for the queen and in regard to many things in the world, but they do not apprehend that the platform for God and the world to come is resurrection.<a name=454:3></a> A wonderful revival has come to pass on this earth where Christ was rejected, that is, Christ has been revived.<a name=454:4></a> He comes out now in the saints.<a name=454:5></a> There is thus the revival of Christ in the very scene where He died.<a name=454:6></a> God's good pleasure in the Philippians was that in them there should be such a revival of Christ.<a name=454:7></a> The colour in which these Philippians were to come out was of <i>Christ</i>.<a name=454:8></a> They were a poor people in this world, of no account in man's eye, but a vessel in which God by His mighty power would revive Christ.<a name=454:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saints are a new generation, morally outside this world, and on the platform of resurrection; and in them there is the testimony of Christ down here.<a name=454:10></a> There is the testimony of Christ in resurrection glory at the right hand of God; and there are, too, the excellencies of Christ coming out in the saints down here.<a name=454:11></a> Christ is revived in the Christian circle; sin and the flesh have been removed, and the saints are the vessel in which Christ is displayed.<a name=454:12></a> It is God who worketh in them both to will and to do of His good pleasure; the good pleasure of God is <i>Christ</i>.<a name=454:13></a> On the other hand, God works with His saints on the ground of resurrection to deliver them from everything that is not <i>of</i> Himself; from sin, the flesh, and the world, and to bring them to the point that they are risen together with Christ.<a name=454:14></a> And what is the effect of that?<a name=454:15></a> They are here in the character of God in Christ, "blameless and harmless" -- a divine generation -- children of God, shining as lights in the world; the

		little circle being thus the vessel of God's testimony down here.<a name=455:1></a> Christ was God's testimony when here; now the church is the vessel of it; but all depends upon God working in us, both to will and to do of His good pleasure.<a name=455:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian can be set free from the bondage of sin and the flesh.<a name=455:3></a> So long as we are here sin and the flesh are in us, but a Christian can say, 'I have greater pleasure in refusing the flesh than in yielding to it'.<a name=455:4></a> I am free by grace of its control.<a name=455:5></a> So too in regard of the world, God has wrought to deliver us morally from this world; and as you are delivered you find the Christian circle outside the great systems of this world.<a name=455:6></a> So long as Christians are connected with these they are more or less hid, but they are brought to light when they are apart from the world; they are manifest as the elect of God, holy, and beloved.<a name=455:7></a> One could not insist too strongly upon these two consequences of Christ's death: His present exaltation as man, and the Christian circle here in which God works according to His pleasure, bringing the saints into deliverance.<a name=455:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 3 is of a different character, the apostle brings before us there the true character of what has a place religiously down here, and that the Christian course is a race.<a name=455:9></a> There are in the chapter two features which connect what is presented with the present time.<a name=455:10></a> At the beginning of the chapter apostate Judaism is seen, at the end of the chapter apostate Christianity, and between these is the race (verses 2, 3).<a name=455:11></a> "Beware", is the warning in verse 2 "mark them" in verse 17.<a name=455:12></a> At the beginning of the chapter we get terms which describe apostate Jews, "dogs" and "concision"; dogs is a term of opprobrium, and indicates people without moral sensibility of conscience; and concision (not circumcision) that they rested in what was outward, a mere rite.<a name=455:13></a> The apostle's word is to beware of such.<a name=455:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But at the end of the chapter we get "many walk",
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=456>[Page 456]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and the "many" means the mass.<a name=456:1></a> The apostle speaks in strong terms of those as enemies of the testimony of the cross, and that because, I suppose, they sanctioned the flesh.<a name=456:2></a> Anyone who gives licence to the flesh is so far an enemy of the cross; such glory in their shame.<a name=456:3></a> Christianity had come to this in the apostle's day; the conduct and course of many was a practical denial of Christianity.<a name=456:4></a> We can readily see how these things connect themselves with the present time.<a name=456:5></a> The church had largely departed before the apostles went, and the "last times" set in immediately after them.<a name=456:6></a> If we look abroad now in Christendom it is easy to see those who live selfishly -- for themselves -- while professing the truth.<a name=456:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to present the contrast to all that.<a name=456:8></a> The apostle speaks of running a race; he does not speak of himself as an apostle here, but as a saint.<a name=456:9></a> He was a man of like passions with ourselves, but he is brought before us as an example.<a name=456:10></a> It has been said that he was egotistical; so in a sense he was; but God intended to set forth in him what His mighty power could effect and compass in a man like ourselves.<a name=456:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important in the first instance that we should find the Christian circle, those who are delivered from the present course of things down here.<a name=456:12></a> Our obligations to the Christian circle are foremost; social obligations are secondary.<a name=456:13></a> There are no special obligations of the Christian in regard of his business; a Christian goes through the world to provide for his household, but there are but two spheres where Scripture recognises him, first, in the Christian circle, and secondly, in the social circle; but the Christian circle is to have the precedence and the social is secondary.<a name=456:14></a> The one is eternal, the other for time.<a name=456:15></a> God may break in upon you if you give the social the precedence.<a name=456:16></a> If you have found the Christian circle, you fulfil the obligation to love, to let your affections out to Christ and to the saints.<a name=456:17></a> If you have reached

	<div class="paragraph">
		that, then in coming out from that circle you run a race.<a name=457:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The race is connected with the calling, the calling is on high in Christ; there is something to pursue, and when the calling has obtained complete possession of the soul, you have obtained the prize.<a name=457:2></a> I turn you now to Ephesians to show you what the calling is; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a> - 5.<a name=457:3></a> We have there the calling.<a name=457:4></a> It is very simple; the scene of it is heavenly places; the character suited to it, "holy and without blame before God in love"; then the relationship, "predestinated to sonship to God".<a name=457:5></a> These are the three great thoughts: (1) heavenly places; (2) the divine nature; and (3) relationship -- sonship.<a name=457:6></a> Now the calling never can be consummated down here, because it belongs to heaven.<a name=457:7></a> The calling being set before us as a prize is to take complete possession of the soul.<a name=457:8></a> We have to be where Christ is, to actually reach the goal; but we can be in the light and power of it now.<a name=457:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a race puts a man to the test.<a name=457:10></a> There are three things necessary in a race -- patience, purpose, and training -- this is true even in natural things.<a name=457:11></a> Many start well, but patience is essential; it is not enough to begin, nor to go on spasmodically.<a name=457:12></a> The point is to have an end in view, and not to be diverted from it.<a name=457:13></a> Thus purpose is very closely connected with patience.<a name=457:14></a> We do not get tired, and weary, and jaded, the grace of Christ sustains us.<a name=457:15></a> Anyone not in the light of the calling gets jaded.<a name=457:16></a> Justification and the grace of God in bringing a man out of Egypt may lose their freshness in our souls if we do not go on to God's purpose.<a name=457:17></a> We have to keep our eye on Christ, for He is the Forerunner; He has got there, and is the pattern of those who are following.<a name=457:18></a> He is the leader of our salvation; the shepherd, like Joshua; and purpose means to keep your eye on Him.<a name=457:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Training, too, is very important; we must have the flesh in subjugation.<a name=457:20></a> I would ask, What do you

		feed upon?<a name=458:1></a> Some feed upon Christian literature; that will not train you.<a name=458:2></a> God's discipline will train you.<a name=458:3></a> We should not deprecate God's discipline, but rather invite it; God's chastening is our training, that we may "be partakers of his holiness".<a name=458:4></a> The flesh is thus held in subjection.<a name=458:5></a> If we continue in the race in power, patience and purpose show that we are in training.<a name=458:6></a> We are maintained in these by the power of God working in us.<a name=458:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle puts as the first great point, "that I may know him" (verse 10).<a name=458:8></a> This is a crucial point; I may know about Him, but here it is to know Himself.<a name=458:9></a> Some Christians are more spiritual than others, and it is a real pleasure to know a spiritual Christian; still, no one can come up to Christ; He is perfect in every way, and we have the opportunity to know Him just as the disciples did who companied with Him when here upon earth, and that is more than knowing any saint.<a name=458:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing to know is "the power of his resurrection", that by which God will overturn the whole course of things in this world.<a name=458:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The calling means complete likeness to Christ, according to all Christ is; He was unique when here; but many will be like Him as He is, and God would have this thought to take possession of our souls, "that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus".<a name=458:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more -- you do not indulge in reminiscences.<a name=458:13></a> You forget the things behind.<a name=458:14></a> Some bemoan the past, the good times that have been; but we have to do with the present, and it is a great thing not to look at the things behind, but to the things which are before.<a name=458:15></a> There is no behind with the Spirit; the brightness of the church at the beginning will be eclipsed yet by the brightness when she comes down from God as the bride, the Lamb's wife, out of heaven.<a name=458:16></a> There are thus greater and brighter things before us

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can say that this is a chapter which is impracticable, or unavailable; it is available for us, and therefore let the truth have its place with us.<a name=459:5></a> Christianity is a great thing down here, but the consummation is in heaven, and therefore we look for complete conformity to Christ in glory; we look for the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour from heaven, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is able to subdue all things unto Himself.<a name=459:6></a> That is the end.<a name=459:7></a>

		I think that it is worth while to draw attention to the intensely individual character of what is presented to us at the end of this epistle.<a name=460:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two parts in the epistle: (1) chapters 1 and 2, in which we have the apostle's desire that the saints should fulfil his joy; that these Philippians might be here, morally a divine generation, children of God, in principle occupying the place that Christ had occupied down here.<a name=460:2></a> Christ was to be seen in the little company at Philippi.<a name=460:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second part, chapters 3 and 4, all is individual.<a name=460:4></a> The apostle had had every element of religious distinction, but he was now running a race, and getting farther and farther from what had lent distinction to him as a man, and nearer and nearer to the calling of God, which is the only real distinction.<a name=460:5></a> What sort of distinction would that of an archbishop be in the presence of the calling of God!<a name=460:6></a> Death is upon all worldly distinction.<a name=460:7></a> I thank God that in His providence I have neither been placed in degraded poverty nor high up in the social scale, for all in this world is dung and dross, and nothing worth, all ends in death.<a name=460:8></a> The bitter waters of Marah, of death, are here; things being as they are and Christ absent, it must be so.<a name=460:9></a> Our true distinction is the calling of God.<a name=460:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>it is said, "We groan .<a name=460:11></a>.<a name=460:12></a>.<a name=460:13></a> awaiting sonship .<a name=460:14></a>.<a name=460:15></a>.<a name=460:16></a> the redemption of the body"; in this you get what the calling is, namely, sons of God, and the effect of the light of it.<a name=460:17></a> That is the distinction of Christians, sonship to God; I do not covet distinction in this world, where death is upon everything, I would prefer obscurity.<a name=460:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The calling is that which God has prepared for Himself, and if you bear that in mind you will readily

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the apostle in the race -- the race is in a sense in a man's spirit.<a name=461:9></a> The apostle's soul, his whole energies, were bent upon grasping, that is, apprehending, that for which he had been apprehended of Christ Jesus, and he became in mind more distant from where he had started.<a name=461:10></a> But I pass on to the end of the chapter; the apostle speaks there of a class, of whom it could be said, "whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things"; the apostle seems here to reach the climax of what he could say of those who began as enemies of the cross.<a name=461:11></a> Earthly things may be politics, and many think that something is to be effected for God by politics, but nothing will be effected morally that way.<a name=461:12></a>

		I want to give an idea of the thought of "our citizenship is in heaven".<a name=462:7></a> A city in Scripture is symbolical of rule.<a name=462:8></a> Babylon has ruled, and the heavenly city will rule, and the effect will be that two great things are brought into this world, that is, liberty and light; the nations will walk in the light of the city.<a name=462:9></a> When the heavenly city is displayed it will bring with it liberty and light for the earth.<a name=462:10></a> Our privileges are connected with that city.<a name=462:11></a> "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother".<a name=462:12></a> Liberty is connected with it, for it brings in the light of God, and there is liberty only in the light of God.<a name=462:13></a> People are in bondage because they are not in the light of God.<a name=462:14></a> The heavenly city is full of the light of God, and therefore it is free; there is no bondage there.<a name=462:15></a> Our privileges are properly connected with heaven; our citizenship is not of any city on earth.<a name=462:16></a> A Roman would have understood what the apostle meant by citizenship, for great privileges attached to Roman citizenship.<a name=462:17></a>

		So we have in chapter 4: 1 the exhortation, "Stand fast in the Lord", and if we do so we shall "rejoice in the Lord".<a name=464:1></a> There is a power at the right hand of God which will bring about the mighty change I have spoken about in regard to things down here.<a name=464:2></a> I do not expect anything from man or his actings, all my expectation is from the Lord; He only can bring liberty and light into this world.<a name=464:3></a> No one could stand fast in the Lord unless as seeing the importance of the coming of the Lord.<a name=464:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4 is the life and conduct of a man who is running the race; it gives the marks of such.<a name=464:5></a> The first is that he has much concern and exercise about individuals, he cares for the Lord's people.<a name=464:6></a> The more you are in the reality of the calling, the more you are concerned about the progress of individuals; the apostle was so here.<a name=464:7></a> "I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord" (verse 2); then he refers, too, to those who had laboured with him in the gospel.<a name=464:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second mark is freedom from cares; we may not be free of trial, but there is a way by which the mind of the saint may be free of anxiety; the way is, "Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God".<a name=464:9></a> The heart of the believer is established in the goodness of God, so that he can go to Him in everything, and the answer he gets is divine peace.<a name=464:10></a> We are often fretted by trifles.<a name=464:11></a> The "little foxes" spoil the vines; one often does better in great tests than in small ones.<a name=464:12></a> It is a great point to take everything to God, "your requests", though sometimes God is too good to give us our requests.<a name=464:13></a> Progress is often hindered by saints being corroded by cares here.<a name=464:14></a> There is a way out of it in the peace of God keeping the heart.<a name=464:15></a>

		the apostle speaks of "my Lord", "the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord"; here in chapter 4 he speaks of "my God", "But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus".<a name=465:1></a> The apostle had ups and downs, he was not callous, not unaffected; if he abounded, he was exercised; if he suffered need, he was exercised.<a name=465:2></a> If he had not been exercised he could not have said, "I know both how to be abased", etc.<a name=465:3></a> God has not appointed things to be even for us, and for this reason, that we might be exercised by them.<a name=465:4></a> With the apostle there was not indifference, but superiority.<a name=465:5></a> He did not falter either in need or in abounding.<a name=465:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the fourth mark is rejoicing in the ministration of the saints; the apostle did not look for anything, "not because I desire a gift" -- it is morally low to do so -- but he valued their ministrations as fruit for God, and therefore acceptable to the apostle.<a name=465:7></a> Any effect of grace in saints is fruit for God, and acceptable to the servant.<a name=465:8></a> The apostle was appreciative of everything that was moral in the saints.<a name=465:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If you study this chapter you will see that these are the marks that come out in one who is running a race.<a name=465:10></a> The apostle was doing so; he was getting away in spirit from all that gave man religious distinction, while his soul came more and more under the power of God's calling.<a name=465:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God graciously exercise us in this way.<a name=465:12></a> Things are not much altered from what they were in the apostle's day, they are in many ways analogous.<a name=465:13></a> In such a state of things we get the mind of the apostle, that we might follow him (chapter 3: 17), to apprehend the calling of God, what God has prepared for Himself.<a name=465:14></a> People often labour to find out what God has purposed for man, and never get the consciousness of it, because they fail to lay hold of what God has prepared for Himself; in seeing this you enter consciously into what God has prepared for men.<a name=465:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 12 we see how the persecution produces exercise; and prayer as a result is made by the church without ceasing for Peter, because he really was bound up with God's testimony, and so Herod is foiled in his plans, and Herod himself comes to a most ignominious death.<a name=466:6></a> Herod was a crafty Idumean, and yet he pandered to the Jews (chapter 12: 3), making nothing of the testimony of God, and God interferes in the matter Himself.<a name=466:7></a> It is a dangerous thing to interfere with God's testimony, and Peter represented God's testimony; it was, as it were, bound up with Peter.<a name=466:8></a> It is a remarkable expression at the close of chapter 12, "the word of God grew and multiplied" -- God took care of His testimony; the heart of the Christian should be bound up with God's testimony.<a name=466:9></a> Prayer was made for Peter, but the reason was that God's testimony was bound up with him.<a name=466:10></a> The testimony of God is always bound up with individuals as we get in 2 Timothy: "the same commit thou to

		I desire to say a word or two as to the way in which the completeness of the believer's justification comes out in this passage.<a name=470:1></a> I have no idea of entering into what is presented to us in the passage as to the purpose of God, for you get an unfolding of the purpose of God here in relation to saints (verses 28, 29).<a name=470:2></a> "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are the called according to his purpose", etc.<a name=470:3></a> But what I wanted to say a word about is as to two thoughts which are found in what follows: the one is, "Who also maketh intercession for us"; and the other, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=470:4></a>" I want to bring before you, on the one hand, the way in which the believer is represented; and on the other hand, the <i>love</i> of the One who represents him.<a name=470:5></a> Believers are represented before God; Christ makes intercession for us; that is representative; but there is another point of all moment and that is the love of the One who represents us.<a name=470:6></a> We are supported by His love: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=470:7></a> shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<a name=470:8></a> .<a name=470:9></a>.<a name=470:10></a>.<a name=470:11></a> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loveth us".<a name=470:12></a> The love of Christ is the real support of saints down here in the conflict to which they are exposed as in the wilderness.<a name=470:13></a>

		Well, now, what I see is this: If I look at Christ risen, I see my justification.<a name=472:6></a> Supposing there was such a thought in the mind as that a believer was justified in himself, it would be very possible to bring a great many charges of inconsistency against him; and no doubt many Christians are greatly troubled by the sense of their own failure.<a name=472:7></a> They measure their acceptance before God by their own state, and so get into bondage.<a name=472:8></a> As long as that is the case you expose yourself to a certain extent to the power of the enemy.<a name=472:9></a> What I see that God has done is this, not only has Christ been delivered for our offences, but that we might be conscious that we are completely justified in the eye of God.<a name=472:10></a> He was raised again for our justification, and we are justified with respect to the judgment of God that was upon us.<a name=472:11></a> We are justified as completely under the eye of God as Christ is risen, not only as to the offences, but as to the judgment of God that was upon us.<a name=472:12></a>
