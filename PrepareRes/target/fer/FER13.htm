		JOSEPH: TESTIMONY BEFORE EXALTATION

		No part of the Bible probably has so fastened itself upon the imagination of the young as the history of Joseph; many would account it almost the most interesting part of Scripture.<a name=1:1></a> But I do not believe that the history of Joseph was given to us as an interesting story, but because Joseph serves to set forth the truth concerning Christ; he comes before us as a figure of Christ as connected with Israel.<a name=1:2></a> Now it is in that way that I take up his history, not at all with the idea of expatiating on the history, save as in some way presenting to us the truth as to Christ.<a name=1:3></a> And I am justified in using the history in this way, from the allusion made to Joseph by Stephen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>; the latter there shows that those raised up of God for the deliverance of His people had always been first rejected, whoever it might be -- Joseph, or Moses, or even Christ.<a name=1:4></a> This was just the perversity of the people against the sovereignty of God.<a name=1:5></a> That is the principle against which man constantly rebels, and such rebellion is the spring and source of infidelity in the present day.<a name=1:6></a> I think that it is intelligible, that if man has a will of his own, he is pretty certain to rebel against a will stronger than his.<a name=1:7></a> It is not only that God has a will, but God's will is sovereign, and God will work out His own will; and it is against the sovereignty of God's will that man kicks.<a name=1:8></a> Now that was illustrated in Israel; they invariably rejected and refused the vessel raised up of God before the deliverance came.<a name=1:9></a> It is in that sense I take up a few incidents in the history of Joseph in our particular chapter, bearing in mind that the history is a setting forth, figuratively, of what comes out in <i>Christ</i>, almost in every part of it, though I could not say in every detail.<a name=1:10></a>

		Now in Israel the birthright is connected with Joseph.<a name=2:1></a> Birthright is looked at in Scripture as a privilege from God, and in old times it was customary to attach a good deal of importance to birthright.<a name=2:2></a> Esau despised his birthright, and though afterwards he sought the blessing carefully with tears, he found no place of repentance.<a name=2:3></a> As I said, the birthright in Israel is connected with Joseph, though lineally Christ was descended from Judah; the genealogy is Judah's.<a name=2:4></a> We do not find in Scripture Judah ever looked at as a type of Christ; on the other hand, Joseph is a striking type of Christ, and it is the more interesting because of the birthright being connected with Joseph.<a name=2:5></a> It will not be very difficult hereafter for Israel to trace their genealogy, for they will trace it through Christ, and in <i>Christ</i> the birthright of Israel is secured.<a name=2:6></a> When Christ was born into this world He was the security to Israel of their birthright, and He had a due sense of the importance of the birthright of Israel, of what pertained to them according to God.<a name=2:7></a> But we see how the Jews despised their birthright; they said, "We have no king but Caesar"; but the birthright is maintained for them in <i>Christ</i>.<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first point of moment is the testimony of Joseph, a testimony which excited the dislike and envy of his brethren; the more he testified the greater was the dislike, until at last it became boundless.<a name=2:9></a> What Joseph bore testimony to, as I understand it, was the <i>sovereignty of God</i>; that was the point of his testimony.<a name=2:10></a> It was not a question of himself, but God had communicated His mind to him in dreams; and what God had communicated to him was the burden of his testimony, it expressed the sovereign will of God.<a name=2:11></a> His father, his mother, and his brethren were all to do obeisance to him.<a name=2:12></a> This was the sovereign will of God.<a name=2:13></a> And man's will rebels against it, but God will do according to His own good will and pleasure.<a name=2:14></a> Christ in coming into the world says, "Lo, I come .<a name=2:15></a>.<a name=2:16></a>.<a name=2:17></a> to do <i>thy will</i>, O God"; and He taught His disciples to pray, "Thy will be done in earth,

		as it is in heaven".<a name=3:1></a> The will of God is to rule.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of Joseph is remarkable; but I want to pass on to the testimony of the great anti-type, <i>Christ Himself</i>, and would also like to say a word with regard to the church.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that before God gives exaltation He gives the <i>testimony</i> of exaltation.<a name=3:4></a> I see that principle running through Scripture.<a name=3:5></a> God does nothing until He has first given a testimony of it.<a name=3:6></a> He exalts whom He will, but before the exaltation is the testimony.<a name=3:7></a> That is seen here in regard to Joseph.<a name=3:8></a> Even the sun and the moon and the eleven stars were to do obeisance to him, but Joseph has first to be the vessel of God's testimony.<a name=3:9></a> It is not, I am sure, a question of honour and dignity put upon Joseph, but of the sovereign will of <i>God</i>.<a name=3:10></a> <i>He</i> chose that Joseph should be exalted.<a name=3:11></a> But Joseph had to be humbled before he could be exalted.<a name=3:12></a> If he had been taken just as he was, and exalted, it might have been, morally, a poor look-out for him.<a name=3:13></a> He had to be passed through the discipline of God to be fitted for the exaltation that God intended to give him.<a name=3:14></a> In his exaltation he was to be the preserver of his brethren.<a name=3:15></a> God knew that they were to go down into Egypt, and Joseph was raised up of God for the preservation of his kindred.<a name=3:16></a> Joseph had to bear testimony to what was in the mind of God, but I do not think that Joseph was himself yet morally suitable for the exaltation.<a name=3:17></a> But any way Joseph had no part in the evil doings of his brethren.<a name=3:18></a> He was separate from them, and could bear testimony against them, because he was not partaker of their evil deeds.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ, when here, bore witness to the sovereign will of God.<a name=3:20></a> He bore witness, too, to the grace of God and to the condition of the people; but the great point in His testimony was the sovereign will of God, and, in connection with it, His own exaltation.<a name=3:21></a> I refer to an instance: in the parable of the marriage supper He says, "A certain king .<a name=3:22></a>.<a name=3:23></a>.<a name=3:24></a> made a marriage for <i>his son</i>".<a name=3:25></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		marriage was for the king's son.<a name=4:1></a> Then He told His disciples continually what would happen to Himself; He bore witness, too, to the place He would have at the right hand of God.<a name=4:2></a> He witnessed a good confession.<a name=4:3></a> The people were running after evil deeds, but Christ bore testimony to His own exaltation.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is one point to be mentioned in regard to the Lord, that if He bore witness to His exaltation He was morally <i>suitable</i> to it.<a name=4:5></a> Joseph was but a weak man.<a name=4:6></a> We do not find anything as to his moral suitability to be exalted.<a name=4:7></a> There is just one thing about him, and that is he was the object of his father's special affection.<a name=4:8></a> But moral suitability for exaltation is seen in Christ all the way through this world.<a name=4:9></a> He <i>could not</i> stop short of any place but the right hand of God.<a name=4:10></a> I think we can see that from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, "In thy presence is fulness of joy".<a name=4:11></a> He could not find that down here.<a name=4:12></a> He might say, "The lines are fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage"; but it is "in <i>thy</i> presence is fulness of joy".<a name=4:13></a> It is interesting to contrast in that psalm what the Lord could enter into down here, and what He looked for at the right hand of God.<a name=4:14></a> But, whether one or the other, there was moral suitability.<a name=4:15></a> Christ is in the highest place of exaltation as Man, and is perfectly at home there; He came from there, and He is gone back there, and He bore witness to this continually while down here.<a name=4:16></a> "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand".<a name=4:17></a> The Lord bore witness to that.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to speak of the church.<a name=4:19></a> The church is in the place of Christ's rejection, but is going to share His exaltation.<a name=4:20></a> That is the purpose of God in regard to the church, and it is left down here in testimony to that.<a name=4:21></a> The proper testimony of the church is that it does not belong to this scene at all, but to <i>Heaven</i>.<a name=4:22></a> But such testimony comes out very much more in what people <i>are</i> than in what they say, and the church has been left here that, in the power of the Holy Spirit, witness might be borne to its own proper place in heaven.<a name=4:23></a> You get this

	<div class="paragraph">
		in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, Jew and Gentile are quickened together with Christ, and raised up together, and made to sit together in the heavenly places in Christ.<a name=5:1></a> God has raised them up together, and given them a place in heaven in Christ.<a name=5:2></a> But at the end of the epistle you find that the people who have been seated in heaven are left here to meet the power of evil, to stand against Satan, in the <i>consciousness</i> of their place in the heavenlies.<a name=5:3></a> I cannot say why God should have seen fit to give that place to the church, but it is given in the sovereignty of His will.<a name=5:4></a> Now we are in the light of that -- made to sit in the heavenly places for His pleasure.<a name=5:5></a> But while that is so, we are left down here to be in <i>moral suitability</i> to it.<a name=5:6></a> We give no place to the enemy, but stand apart from the influences of the god of this world; we put on the "whole armour of God", and withstand; we do not give in an inch to anything here, but stand in the truth of the sovereignty of God's will.<a name=5:7></a> That is a difficult thing to do today.<a name=5:8></a> If Scripture were simply a book of ethics there would not be antagonism to it, but because it expresses the will of God -- and man hates the idea of the sovereignty of God's will -- there is the effort to set aside the testimony of Scripture.<a name=5:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now security for future blessing is on the ground of the will of God; everything has failed on the ground of creature responsibility, all is now bound up with the accomplishment of God's own will; and everything must be consistent, too, with His nature, and that is <i>love</i>.<a name=5:10></a> But at the same time that everything is consistent with love, there is in all the expression of divine perfectness, righteousness, and holiness, and truth -- every attribute of God is maintained, that all should be to the praise of His glory.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph bore witness, perhaps in a feeble way, to his exaltation, according to the sovereign will of God.<a name=5:12></a> Christ, too, bore abundant witness to His exaltation; He accepted death and rejection down here, but, at the same time, bore witness to exaltation, and He is

	<div class="paragraph">
		exalted!<a name=6:1></a> God has "highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name" -- a name according to the sovereignty of His own purpose, "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow".<a name=6:2></a> In truth, His brethren and His kindred and <i>all</i> will have to do obeisance to Him!<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same principle holds good in the church.<a name=6:4></a> The church shares the rejection of Christ down here, it is identified with Him, as seen in that which He says to Saul, "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=6:5></a>" The church's place is in separation from the world, waiting for Him from heaven: "From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself".<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next point I notice is the effect that Joseph's testimony had upon his brethren.<a name=6:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:9">Acts  7:9</a> we read, "And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him".<a name=6:8></a> The motive that actuated them is thus plain enough, "they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him", their hatred intensified.<a name=6:9></a> Now the truth is this, their ways were evil, and Joseph had told their father of their evil deeds, and they hated him.<a name=6:10></a> Their ways were evil; there is the secret of man's perversity, he will not come to the light because his deeds are evil.<a name=6:11></a> There was light with Joseph, and they cast him out, but it was God's way for their preservation.<a name=6:12></a> Joseph was to be their preserver, if they had only known it.<a name=6:13></a> No one can suppose that envy and hatred spring from good works.<a name=6:14></a> But Joseph's brethren were short-sighted in what they did to Joseph, for previous to their selling Joseph they were strong and united, but now they lost what I might, in a sense, call divine strength; they were strong before, but not after.<a name=6:15></a> It is remarkable to see this in those twelve brethren, but we find the same principle true in the Jews in connection with Christ.<a name=6:16></a> Why did not the Jews receive the testimony of God?<a name=6:17></a> Why did they not welcome the light?<a name=6:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord gave abundant proof that He came from God; there was the most complete presentation of God to man: "in him all the fulness .<a name=7:1></a>.<a name=7:2></a>.<a name=7:3></a> was pleased to dwell".<a name=7:4></a> The presentation was complete; the Lord could say, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father", the Father dwelt in Him, and He did the works.<a name=7:5></a> He was a Man, it is true, but He had become a Man that God might come near to man in goodness.<a name=7:6></a> It was God presenting Himself to man in perfect, divine goodness.<a name=7:7></a> All the works of Christ were expressive of divine goodness, of perfect grace; the only miracle which had any other character was the cursing of the fig-tree, and that had of necessity to come to pass, but other miracles were for the relieving of man from the pressure which rested upon him down here.<a name=7:8></a> "Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?<a name=7:9></a>" and they say, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for <i>blasphemy</i>"!<a name=7:10></a> He said that He was the Son of God, but had He not given evidence of it?<a name=7:11></a> There was most abundant testimony that He was the Son of God, but in spite of the testimony of His works, and of the Father's testimony to Him, they saw and hated both Him and His Father.<a name=7:12></a> Why did they hate Him?<a name=7:13></a> Because their own deeds were evil.<a name=7:14></a> Men will justify envy, but do you think that envy ever springs from good?<a name=7:15></a> Could there be such a thing as envy with God or with Christ?<a name=7:16></a> It is totally impossible.<a name=7:17></a> Envy is a work of evil; if evil were not existing there would be no such thing as envy in this world.<a name=7:18></a> A holy angel does not envy, simply because it is a holy angel.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as was the case with the brethren of Joseph, the Jews paved the way for their own weakness; Christ was their strength, if they had only known it.<a name=7:20></a> He had become identified with them in being born among them, "of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came"; He was their strength, but they did not know it, and the consequence was that when they cast Him out they had to prove their own weakness; they fell to pieces.<a name=7:21></a> It is

	<div class="paragraph">
		remarkable with regard to the disciples, that when a traitor came to light among them they became weak, they "all forsook him and fled", they proved their weakness.<a name=8:1></a> I refer to it because it shows that this principle runs through Scripture, and things repeat themselves remarkably.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the latter part of verse 9 we have the significant clause, "but God was with him"; in all the discipline through which Joseph went God was with him.<a name=8:3></a> He had to be humbled, and a man <i>must</i> be humbled, that is certain.<a name=8:4></a> We are told that Joseph was apart from the evil of his brethren, but if Joseph is to be exalted, it is needful that he should be passed through exercise.<a name=8:5></a> Very often we do not know our own motives: even in condemning evil it is difficult to distinguish our motives; we have to be taught the difference between good and evil; many things pass muster as good, but one is not so sure about the motives in them.<a name=8:6></a> But the object of discipline is that we may discern between good and evil.<a name=8:7></a> We see this in the case of Job.<a name=8:8></a> It is great grace on the part of God that He should see fit to pass His people through exercise with this object.<a name=8:9></a> In any study in this world, whether it be art, or literature, or anything else, a man must be trained.<a name=8:10></a> Supposing I am taken to a gallery where there are many wonderful pictures, but among them some that are mere daubs, if I have not my senses exercised I may make great mistakes in my judgment of them: so we must have our moral senses exercised, we must be <i>critics</i>, and criticism must begin with <i>myself</i>; you will never be a good judge of good and evil in others except as you are a good judge of them in yourself.<a name=8:11></a> I am exercised so as to be able to discriminate between the varied motives by which a man may be actuated down here.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Joseph has to learn a very bitter lesson with his brethren, and it must have taught Joseph complete distrust of himself, but Joseph is not soured; when <i>God</i> is dealing with a man in discipline, and the man

	<div class="paragraph">
		accepts it, that man is not soured.<a name=9:1></a> I do not know anything that has a worse effect on people than trials in which God is not with them; but on the other hand, if God is with them they are great gainers, and they have their senses exercised.<a name=9:2></a> Why should anything down here sour a christian?<a name=9:3></a> Supposing I am soured by the treatment of my kindred, or of fellow-christians.<a name=9:4></a> <i>Who</i> is soured?<a name=9:5></a> <i>What</i> is soured?<a name=9:6></a> It proves that there is something in me that may be soured; but we are exhorted, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good"; and the end of discipline is that we may overcome in the power of good.<a name=9:7></a> While trials have the effect that God intends them to have, God sustains the man; as it was with Joseph, so it may be with me.<a name=9:8></a> And God gave Joseph deliverance; it was not, perhaps, the deliverance that Joseph would have chosen, but it was the deliverance that God intended for him.<a name=9:9></a> Reuben and Judah would have liked to bring him back to their father again -- they were more tender than their brethren -- but God's way was otherwise.<a name=9:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I see as a principle in the ways of God is, that if God is going to give deliverance, it must begin from Egypt.<a name=9:11></a> It was so with Israel, and it is so with us; that is the starting-point of every man.<a name=9:12></a> We have to realise that we are in Egypt, where God first begins to deal with man.<a name=9:13></a> Israel had to go down into Egypt, and it was there that they began to multiply; and it is from Egypt that God delivered them.<a name=9:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God delivers Joseph, and puts him out of reach of the machinations of his brethren.<a name=9:15></a> So God has set Christ in a place outside of all the hatred and malignity of men.<a name=9:16></a> God raised Him from the dead, and in resurrection He was set in a wealthy place.<a name=9:17></a> God has set Him in a place where man cannot come.<a name=9:18></a> The brethren of Joseph could do no more against him when he went down into Egypt.<a name=9:19></a> In the case of the Lord, the Jews were restrained for a long time, until the close of His pathway; then certain things were allowed, but God delivers Him.<a name=9:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing which could not be typified in Joseph, that, as being set in that wealthy place, Christ has power to subdue all things to Himself; <i>one</i> Man in resurrection is better than a world of men under death.<a name=10:6></a> Christ in resurrection is not only superior to all as being there, but exercises the power that has been exercised towards Him.<a name=10:7></a> He is vested with the very power that raised Him again from the dead.<a name=10:8></a> So we look for the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven ".<a name=10:9></a>.<a name=10:10></a>.<a name=10:11></a> according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself" -- that is, according to what He is as raised again from the dead.<a name=10:12></a> And what of the Jews?<a name=10:13></a> They have become disunited and scattered.<a name=10:14></a> It was an evil day for Joseph's brethren when they sold their brother into Egypt; it was an evil day for the Jews when they refused Christ, when they said, "This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance".<a name=10:15></a> They never did seize on His inheritance; they were scattered abroad, and are suffering under the penalty of their rejection of Christ to this day.<a name=10:16></a> They will come eventually into their blessing on the ground of the sovereignty of God's mercy, but they will have to recognise Him in resurrection whom they pierced.<a name=10:17></a> The important thing for us is that our souls might be in the light of the glory of the Lord, that we should appreciate the greatness of the place in which God has set Him.<a name=10:18></a> The right hand of God is far above all things; and that is where we are privileged to know Christ.<a name=10:19></a> All the gifts have come down from Christ, at the right hand of God, and we are in the light of Christ <i>there</i>.<a name=10:20></a> He is set down "far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=10:21></a> It is a <i>great</i> place where Christ is set, where what is of sin, and of the flesh, and of Satan's power cannot come; they cannot touch what is of resurrection.<a name=10:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have taken up these few points in the chapter that we may see in them a portraiture of Christ, and I do not think that I have strained the truth at all, for Scripture has given us evidence that Joseph is presented to us as a striking type of Christ Himself, especially in His relations to Israel.<a name=11:3></a>

		May God grant that we may have a true and right apprehension of Christ in the wealthy place in which He now is, and of the power with which He is vested, and by which He will subdue all things to Himself.<a name=11:4></a> As to His people, they are scattered over the face of the earth, having neither true God nor false god.<a name=11:5></a> And why?<a name=11:6></a> Because they were moved with envy, and rejected and refused their Deliverer.<a name=11:7></a> Yet, according to the Scripture, the "Deliverer <i>will</i> come out of Zion and turn away ungodliness from Jacob: .<a name=11:8></a>.<a name=11:9></a>.<a name=11:10></a> this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins".<a name=11:11></a>

		There are few histories or accounts of individuals which are of greater interest than that of Joseph.<a name=12:1></a> But it is not for its intrinsic interest that the Spirit of God records the history, but because it delineates in a remarkable way the truth with regard to Christ.<a name=12:2></a> The passage in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105">Psalm  105</a>gives us the Spirit's commentary upon the history of Joseph.<a name=12:3></a> The psalm itself is a summing up of the history of Israel, of the goodness of God to them, a goodness that they will recognise in a coming day; at the same time you get the commentary of the Holy Spirit upon the course of certain individuals, and especially of Joseph, for the course of Joseph serves to portray the connection of Christ with Israel.<a name=12:4></a> I purpose, if God will, taking that up further on, more especially in connection with Joseph in the land of Egypt, and with the characteristic names which he gives his children.<a name=12:5></a> I think there is interest even in a detail of that kind.<a name=12:6></a> The names of his children are characteristic of his experience in the land of Egypt.<a name=12:7></a>

		We saw in Genesis the circumstances which brought Joseph into Egypt, but in the commentary in the Psalms we find that he was sent down into Egypt of God.<a name=12:8></a> In the history in Genesis he was sold by his brethren to the Ishmaelites, and they brought him into Egypt; but the fact was God sent him thither.<a name=12:9></a> God had regard to the seed of Abraham, and sent Joseph down into Egypt that he might preserve their life in famine.<a name=12:10></a>

		Now we come to his exaltation.<a name=13:11></a> All is step by step (verses 20, 21); "he made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance", etc.<a name=13:12></a> In the land of Canaan he had been one of twelve brethren, not at all a man of distinction, but God meant to give him distinction in Egypt, so the king exalted him; he was to be second to the king; there was to be no one greater than Joseph in the kingdom.<a name=13:13></a> Authority was conferred upon him; Pharaoh gave him a name, and power to "bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom".<a name=13:14></a> All were to bow the knee to Joseph; he was to have unlimited authority.<a name=13:15></a>

		But I pass on to speak of the links which are formed in this present time, in which Christ is hidden from His kindred after the flesh.<a name=17:4></a> In Joseph's case his kindred had no knowledge of him; as far as they were concerned he might have been torn in pieces by wild beasts; he was hidden from them for the time being.<a name=17:5></a> That figures the position of Christ with regard to Israel at the present time.<a name=17:6></a> Christ is dead as to them, they know nothing about Him but His crucifixion; they know that they crucified Him, but they know nothing of Him in resurrection.<a name=17:7></a> Now I want to speak a little of links that are formed in that time.<a name=17:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:45">Genesis  41:45</a>, we see that Pharaoh gave to Joseph a name -- and a name that was symbolic in a way.<a name=17:9></a> He also obtains a wife.<a name=17:10></a> What I understand a wife often to represent in Scripture is a covenant, or system, or order of things.<a name=17:11></a> Sarah, as we see in the epistle to the Galatians, is used to set forth a covenant or order of things come in; and Hagar to show the legal covenant; and in the case of Joseph we see him identified with what was entirely outside of all that was natural to him; it would have been more natural to him to have married a wife from the land of his fathers.<a name=17:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the principle holds good in regard to Christ.<a name=17:13></a> He is identified in heaven with another order of things, represented by the wife of Joseph.<a name=17:14></a> A verse from <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>will make that plain; the law which "made nothing perfect" is set aside -- that is one order of things; but there is "the bringing in of a better hope, .<a name=17:15></a>.<a name=17:16></a>.<a name=17:17></a> by the which we draw nigh to God" -- that is the order of

		But further, a generation has sprung from that link which Christ has formed -- from the system and order of things with which He is identified.<a name=18:8></a> Our souls identify Him with the better hope.<a name=18:9></a> He is the priest of that order of things, and the effect upon us is that we are a new generation, "the children of God, without rebuke".<a name=18:10></a> Was there ever that generation before Christ was here?<a name=18:11></a> There were the children of Abraham, and men of faith, but there was not a generation, before Christ, that understood anything about the Father's love.<a name=18:12></a> Such a generation could not come to light until Christ had been down here.<a name=18:13></a> Christ brought into the world the love of the

		The principle of resurrection is elaborated in connection with God's dealings with Abraham in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>.<a name=24:8></a> It recalls Abraham.<a name=24:9></a> "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness", and it says that he believed in God who quickens the dead; and as to us, it says, "who believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification".<a name=24:10></a> God presents Himself to us in His testimony, on the ground and basis of resurrection, and in regard of this Abraham is our father.<a name=24:11></a> To get a clear thought as to that is important; I do not think you will be able otherwise to understand the ways of God.<a name=24:12></a> God has acted in regard of men in the person of His Son outside of sin and law and flesh, as known in the world, that is the import of resurrection, as the basis of God's ways.<a name=24:13></a> Death has terminated man, but vicariously <i>in the death of Christ</i>; the blood is the witness of death.<a name=24:14></a> "Christ .<a name=24:15></a>.<a name=24:16></a>.<a name=24:17></a> hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God", and God presents Himself to man as acting outside of sin and the law and the flesh; He presents Himself to man in the One who has been raised again from the dead.<a name=24:18></a> God has set forth Jesus as a mercy-seat, through faith in His blood.<a name=24:19></a> God has spoken to us "in his Son", sin, the law, and the flesh, <i>all having for Him come to an end in death</i> -- death is their termination.<a name=24:20></a> And so, too, in application to us, the truth is that "he that is dead is justified from sin", death is the end of the captivity of

		Now, as we have seen, God began to teach this principle of resurrection to Abraham, and the great lesson that he had to learn was the closing lesson with him.<a name=26:3></a> Abraham had had to cast Ishmael out of his house, but the most severe discipline he had to be passed through was the offering up of Isaac.<a name=26:4></a> If we knew Christ after the flesh now, there would be no present salvation for man.<a name=26:5></a> I can understand Ishmael being cast out, but it is much deeper that in the ways of God Isaac must be offered.<a name=26:6></a> Christ in all His perfection as after the flesh must <i>die</i>; all after the flesh must go, even in its perfection, as we see it in Christ down here.<a name=26:7></a> But Abraham received Isaac again, in figure raised from the dead, when typically all after the flesh had gone.<a name=26:8></a> God made plain to Abraham the foundation of His dealings in grace with man in the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=26:9></a> Abraham, perhaps, did not understand it fully; he had not the light of Romans, but I am sure Abraham was a long way on, for he believed in God "who quickens the dead" -- he apprehended that God would act outside of man in the flesh, and God has acted in that way.<a name=26:10></a>

		Then Jacob blesses both the sons of Joseph -- that is remarkable; Joseph had the birthright: he was not the firstborn, but he got the portion of the firstborn -- a double portion.<a name=27:4></a> Elisha desired a double portion of Elijah's spirit, a firstborn's portion.<a name=27:5></a> Here both the sons of Joseph were blessed by Jacob.<a name=27:6></a> This had the effect of making thirteen tribes, thus going beyond the limits of administrative order.<a name=27:7></a> You cannot limit the God of resurrection by administrative order; there are the saints risen together with Christ outside of administration on the earth, they belong to heaven.<a name=27:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I understand the church, it was set up here entirely in the power of the Holy Spirit, I do not think the apostles had anything much of administration before them.<a name=27:9></a> They have a place in administration -- they are to sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=27:10></a> But there is something greater than administration, and that is the church's relation to the Father; the identification with Christ of the many sons that God is bringing to glory.<a name=27:11></a> The church is the seat of perfect administration as the assembly of the living God; but it is the assembly of the firstborn which are written in heaven, and that is morally a greater thought.<a name=27:12></a> If you apprehend the God of resurrection, you cannot limit God to administration, any more than you can limit God's blessing to the line of the flesh, and it is in that way that I understand that Jacob blessed both the sons of Joseph.<a name=27:13></a> That is what he did when this world was fading out of view; and he worshipped, leaning on the top of his staff.<a name=27:14></a>

		There are two things that mark Joseph at the end: he made mention of the departing of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.<a name=28:1></a> Resurrection is the ground upon which God delivered His people out of Egypt; and the fact is this, except God acted on the ground of resurrection, there are questions which God would have to raise with men.<a name=28:2></a> But the blood was the witness of death; God's righteousness had been vindicated, and in the Red Sea God had, as we have seen, acted on the ground of resurrection, apart from the question of sin, or the law, or flesh, to bring His people into His light.<a name=28:3></a> The brightest moment of Jacob's life, if I might say so, was his death; the fathers died in faith, and Jacob's brightest moment was perhaps when he died.<a name=28:4></a> So with Joseph: all his greatness in Egypt was gone, everything had faded from view, and what comes before him was that his brethren were in Egypt, and he makes mention of their departing; God would interfere for them, and deliver them out of the land of Egypt.<a name=28:5></a> And yet Egypt had been the scene of his glory; his children were born there, his links were there, but in the hour of his dying Egypt was gone from him.<a name=28:6></a> My conviction is that if Joseph had lived in the time of Moses, Joseph would have done what Moses did, for Moses carried out that of which Joseph spoke.<a name=28:7></a> Joseph had light to speak about it, but the time was not yet come for action; still, it formed part of the testimony of the God of resurrection, and all of that testimony will be made good in the power of resurrection.<a name=28:8></a> God does not deliver Israel out of Egypt again; it was the God of resurrection who brought them out.<a name=28:9></a> They never understood that, but, nevertheless, He was in that light, delivering His people out of the bondage of Egypt.<a name=28:10></a>

		Taking up this scripture may have the appearance of going back, since last time we had before us the close of Joseph's career.<a name=32:1></a> But it struck me that there was a point which it was of some moment to see.<a name=32:2></a> I do not look upon Joseph as being at all times typical of Christ.<a name=32:3></a> I doubt if here he is typical.<a name=32:4></a> I use the history of Joseph only in the way of an analogy, and you do get striking analogies in Scripture.<a name=32:5></a> The analogy in Joseph is to what Christ is doing at the present moment, to the position and action of Christ; and that is a very important point.<a name=32:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first time we were together the point before us was the beginning of Joseph's history.<a name=32:7></a> He had the <i>testimony of God</i>.<a name=32:8></a> We do not see him at the beginning as the man of faith, but as having a testimony from God.<a name=32:9></a> That testimony was to his own exaltation; his brethren and his father and mother were all to bow down to him.<a name=32:10></a> Now before anybody is exalted according to God, testimony must be borne to it; we see this principle in the case of the Lord.<a name=32:11></a> He bore testimony to His exaltation when He rode into Jerusalem on an ass; He claimed what was His in the way of testimony.<a name=32:12></a> The church, too, is here in witness to its own place in association with Christ -- its moral exaltation.<a name=32:13></a> It is in that way that I understand the epistle to the Ephesians; the church stands to its place of union with Christ, and that testimony precedes the actual exaltation.<a name=32:14></a> You first get moral exaltation, for that is the great thing with God.<a name=32:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Joseph reached in due course the glory of which he had testified; he may have been the greatest man of his time; he was in a peculiar position, second to none but Pharaoh; he had everything at his disposal; the administration of Egypt was committed to him, and his

		brethren had to come down and bow themselves to him.<a name=33:1></a> They did not at first know him, but eventually he makes himself known to them, and he sends by them to his father the tidings of his glory in Egypt.<a name=33:2></a> That is now my point.<a name=33:3></a> Then his father was to come to him in Egypt, for that was the object of Joseph sending; and if Jacob had not come down to Joseph in Egypt, he would have come to want (verse 11).<a name=33:4></a> Joseph was urgent in the matter; he lays stress upon his glory in the land of Egypt, and desires his father Jacob to come down with all his household into Egypt.<a name=33:5></a> Now, as I said, I am not taking this up as typical, but only by way of analogy.<a name=33:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph is no doubt, in a great deal of his history, figurative of Christ; he is spoken of in that way in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>.<a name=33:7></a> We see him there as the deliverer of his brethren, though first rejected of them; he is, like Moses, a figure of the Deliverer of God's people.<a name=33:8></a> But I do not see in what is before us that Joseph was quite a figure of Christ, though you get certain points which illustrate the position and activity of Christ at the present moment.<a name=33:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>Christ speaks of going to the greatest place -- the place of supreme honour and glory; and He would send down here a testimony to His glory; when He goes His way to Him that sent Him, He sends down the Holy Spirit.<a name=33:10></a> The Lord says to them, "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you".<a name=33:11></a> He speaks of the coming of the Comforter, and of what the Comforter will do: "He shall take of mine, and shall show it to you" -- He was to bear witness to the disciples of the glory of Christ, so that their hearts might be attracted to Him.<a name=33:12></a> They were to reach Him in that sense; if they did not act on the testimony that came to them, the effect would be that they would come to spiritual poverty.<a name=33:13></a> So in regard to the present day: if christians do not act on the testimony that has come down to them, they come to spiritual poverty.<a name=33:14></a> Probably the bulk of christians in the present day are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, though one object with Joseph was that his father and his household might escape famine, yet one can see a deeper motive -- the promptings of real affection.<a name=34:11></a> And if we love one another, what we desire is the company of one another.<a name=34:12></a> Do you think that I could believe that a person really loved me, if he did not desire my company?<a name=34:13></a> If I have real affection for christians I shall desire their company.<a name=34:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there is an interesting and important connection between that which Christ effects, or carries out, now from heaven, from the right hand of God, and that which was effected in His work down here.<a name=61:1></a> You will find this presented in a great many ways in scripture.<a name=61:2></a> For instance, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, "It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached <i>in his name</i>".<a name=61:3></a> Remission had been secured by His death, but was to be ministered <i>in His name</i>, and that marks the present time.<a name=61:4></a> It behoved Christ not only to die, but to rise.<a name=61:5></a> The same thing holds good in regard to peace.<a name=61:6></a> Christ made peace by the blood of His cross, and now He preaches it.<a name=61:7></a> Further, in regard to the communication of the Spirit.<a name=61:8></a> It is the One in whom sin was condemned in the flesh who ministers the Spirit; He who takes away the sin of the world is the One who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=61:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is the same in principle as to the new covenant: it was established in the death of Christ.<a name=61:10></a> The death of Christ was, so to speak, the declaration of God's disposition towards us.<a name=61:11></a> And now Christ is livingly the Mediator of the new covenant.<a name=61:12></a> We are said to have come to the Mediator of the new covenant; and He is also the Minister of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man.<a name=61:13></a> It is well the connection should exist in our minds between that which Christ secured by His work and that which He now ministers in power from the right hand of God.<a name=61:14></a> And one can see the suitability of it.<a name=61:15></a> He is the living minister of that which He secured by His work.<a name=61:16></a> I suppose it is true that there is no consequence of His death but what He ministers

		now in living power; that is how we know Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=62:1></a> We know Him as the Mediator of the new covenant, and that undoubtedly introduces us to the line of priestly work.<a name=62:2></a> It is curious that often the Old Testament types fail you; when you have the truth of the New Testament you see that types do not come up to the antitype, they are not the image; when you get into the realities you get beyond the type.<a name=62:3></a> Now in regard to priestly work the first great service of Christ was building the house of God; but in the type of the tabernacle this was the work of Moses.<a name=62:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>.<a name=62:5></a>) He was faithful in God's house as a servant.<a name=62:6></a> It appears to me that in setting up the tabernacle Moses was doing, in a sense, priestly work; Aaron was not consecrated until the tabernacle was set up.<a name=62:7></a> But there was a kind of priestly work carried out by Moses previous to the installation of Aaron as high priest.<a name=62:8></a> I gather that from the Antitype.<a name=62:9></a> According to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>, when Christ went up on high, He "led captivity captive", and "received gifts for men".<a name=62:10></a> This is really in character and principle priestly work.<a name=62:11></a> I fancy we see here the real beginning of priestly work in connection with the Lord Jesus.<a name=62:12></a> He goes up on high, and, having received from the Father the promise of the Spirit, "He hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear".<a name=62:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=62:14></a>) And the apostle in connection with this quotes from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, where Christ is spoken of as a "Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=62:15></a> Thus the beginning of priestly work was in the formation of the house of God, the communication of the Holy Spirit to the saints gathered down here.<a name=62:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another character of priestly work, when the house has been formed, which has to do with sympathy with our infirmities; and in that connection is priestly intercession, and the activities of Christ in regard to the saints down here.<a name=62:17></a> He succours the tempted, and that is made effectual down here in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=62:18></a> Until the Holy Spirit was come you could hardly conceive of that being carried out.<a name=62:19></a> It gives us an idea of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=63>[Page 63]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the activity of Christ's love with regard to His saints.<a name=63:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a great deal of priestly service that we have not been accustomed to connect with priesthood.<a name=63:2></a> I fancy all the little service we can render to one another in the way of sympathy and succour is the fruit of the activities of Christ as high priest above; Christ sets all in motion.<a name=63:3></a> When saints are under trial and pressure of various kinds they get a great deal of sympathy on the part of one and another, but all is set in movement by Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=63:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also the element of intercession, illustrated in the case of Peter.<a name=63:5></a> The Lord, in view of his fall, says, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not".<a name=63:6></a> And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, and that is where the power of the Spirit comes in.<a name=63:7></a> Christ intercedes for us in heaven, but there is activity on the part of the Spirit down here that calls to mind the word of the Lord.<a name=63:8></a> So Peter, instead of being driven to despair is brought to repentance; grace works in him, repentance is the result, and he is restored.<a name=63:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 8 we have a further idea in connection with the priesthood of Christ.<a name=63:10></a> He is "minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord .<a name=63:11></a>.<a name=63:12></a>.<a name=63:13></a> pitched, and not man".<a name=63:14></a> That thought I should connect with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>.<a name=63:15></a> The Jews are to be blessed in the future, and will say, "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=63:16></a> That refers, I judge, to Christ coming out in the power of the Melchisedec priesthood.<a name=63:17></a> The Lord said to the Jews in the past, "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.<a name=63:18></a> For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=63:19></a> That is not quite the thought of Jehovah coming to reign.<a name=63:20></a> That comes out in the fourth book of Psalms.<a name=63:21></a> When you come to the fifth book, it is "Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=63:22></a> That is Christ coming in on man's side, and fulfilling the desires of His people down here on earth.<a name=63:23></a> They say, "We have blessed you out of the house

		of the Lord".<a name=64:1></a> Christ comes, and is welcomed in the very place from which He had been rejected.<a name=64:2></a> He comes in, in priestly grace, to His people as Melchisedec, and in that character will be welcomed by Israel, He will indeed establish Jehovah's throne.<a name=64:3></a> He will be the Jehovah that reigneth, but at the same time He comes in as the priest after the order of Melchisedec, welcomed in the name of the Lord.<a name=64:4></a> But until then their house is left to them desolate.<a name=64:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, <i>we</i> get Christ as the Minister of the holy places; He is welcomed there and we welcome Him.<a name=64:6></a> He is the Leader in all that is connected with the service of God.<a name=64:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point in this chapter is not the service of man; there is that, but that is not the character of the service that is spoken of here; it is the service of God; and in this Christ is the Minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.<a name=64:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I wanted to touch on particularly for a moment is a subject familiar to many, and that is the connection between the Minister of the sanctuary and the Mediator of the covenant.<a name=64:9></a> The suitability of the Minister is dependent on His being the Mediator.<a name=64:10></a> The Mediator is the One in whom the disposition of God towards us is declared.<a name=64:11></a> He is thus suitable to lead us in the praises of God.<a name=64:12></a> These two things are bound to go together.<a name=64:13></a> You see here how the type is defective.<a name=64:14></a> Aaron was not the mediator of the covenant.<a name=64:15></a> He was the minister of the sanctuary and might not be always in accord with the mediator of the covenant.<a name=64:16></a> But in the antitype Christ is the Minister of the sanctuary.<a name=64:17></a> "By how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant".<a name=64:18></a> We need, as I understand it, to know the Mediator of the covenant before we get any true worship of God.<a name=64:19></a> You get the new covenant in the Lord's supper.<a name=64:20></a> In the Supper the Lord is distinctly presented as the Mediator of the new covenant.<a name=64:21></a> It is stated, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood".<a name=64:22></a> You must touch the Mediator of the covenant before you can appreciate the Minister of the

		In the Acts those converted by the apostles' preaching accepted Christ as the door, and they came into the house of God.<a name=82:4></a> (Look at <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:20">1 Peter  3:20</a>, 22.<a name=82:5></a>) I understand the house of God to be a kind of moral correspondence to that which has taken place in heaven.<a name=82:6></a> Christ has gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto Him.<a name=82:7></a> There has been a celebration in heaven consequent on Christ's being received there as man.<a name=82:8></a> It was "peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=82:9></a> The acclamation on Christ's entering Jerusalem pointed on to that moment, and the celebration in heaven is recorded here in Peter.<a name=82:10></a> Now how do we know that He is gone into heaven?<a name=82:11></a> <i>By report</i>.<a name=82:12></a> We could not know it otherwise, nor did the disciples, though they saw Him ascend; but that He is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him, is known by report.<a name=82:13></a> The Holy Spirit has come down to report this, and it is known in the house of God.<a name=82:14></a> There is thus a correspondence to heaven in the house of God.<a name=82:15></a> The festivity on earth is seen in the great supper of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>.<a name=82:16></a> The answer of a good conscience in 1 Peter is through the accepting of the testimony of the resurrection; but the Holy Spirit has brought down the report of what has taken place in heaven, and in the supper we have the good of this.<a name=82:17></a>

		Christendom soon lost all sense of the presence of the Spirit because it refused the first condition, that is, the <i>reproach</i> of Christ.<a name=83:2></a> It is held now that He is in honour here.<a name=83:3></a> In losing the sense of the Spirit's presence they have lost the true idea of the house of God.<a name=83:4></a> The Spirit has brought in the light of what has taken place in heaven, the celebration of righteousness.<a name=83:5></a> And hence <i>grace is commensurate with glory</i>!<a name=83:6></a> The greater the sense you have of the glory of the Lord, the more conscious you are of being a subject of grace.<a name=83:7></a> The second point is the Door, and by Christ, as that, you enter into all that is connected with the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=83:8></a>

		Now the third point is the <i>Good</i> Shepherd, and the <i>Good</i> Shepherd gives His <i>life</i> for the sheep.<a name=83:9></a> Divine <i>love</i> expressed itself in Christ in death, and this love has had effect in the sheep.<a name=83:10></a> "The love of Christ constraineth us .<a name=83:11></a>.<a name=83:12></a>.<a name=83:13></a> that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again".<a name=83:14></a> These verses illustrate the effect of what we get here in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:11">John  10:11</a> - 14.<a name=83:15></a> "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep".<a name=83:16></a> And again, "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine", "as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep".<a name=83:17></a> We have in this the strongest expression of love; but where is love going to find satisfaction?<a name=83:18></a> In those who have accepted the testimony of that love; in these the love of Christ has had effect.<a name=83:19></a> The position of the world has been greatly changed by the testimony of the love of God.<a name=83:20></a> Christ's <i>death</i> was the testimony of divine love, and the testimony of it has made two classes of men in the world, one of which is particularly obnoxious to God, that is, the class that rejects Christ.<a name=83:21></a> On the other hand, there is a class composed of those who have accepted the testimony of the love of God, and in them love has found its satisfaction.<a name=83:22></a> Christ knows

		Now this brings in another point, namely, that of <i>unity</i>, and the secret of this lies in the apprehension of the <i>one Shepherd</i>.<a name=84:11></a> We are exhorted to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; but in order to do this we need to leave human order.<a name=84:12></a> The Lord attached great importance to unity, and was going to send another Comforter to bring it about.<a name=84:13></a> You cannot get the unity of the Spirit unless by leaving human order.<a name=84:14></a> In recognising Christ as <i>one</i> Shepherd and His sheep as <i>one</i> flock you come into the unity of the Spirit, and the obligation to keep the unity of the Spirit is recognised.<a name=84:15></a> The idea that the one flock was to be hidden in a great mass of profession was never in the mind of God.<a name=84:16></a> The

		We come to a further point in verses 27 - 30.<a name=85:6></a> Christ is going to lead His sheep, not to heaven, but to the land of promise.<a name=85:7></a> He says, "I give unto" My sheep "eternal life; and they shall never perish".<a name=85:8></a> Eternal life is found in the land of promise, that is, in conscious association with Christ Himself.<a name=85:9></a> He is it, and you are risen and quickened with Him.<a name=85:10></a> And you will never perish, that is, never apostatise, for you are in the hand both of the Father and of the Son, and this is emphasized by the statement, "I and my Father are <i>one</i>".<a name=85:11></a> Christ leads His sheep into eternal life, that is, into the consciousness that they are in Him outside the wilderness and all that is connected with the individual path, and are secure in the hand of the Father, and in His own hand.<a name=85:12></a> "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we might know him that is true; and we are <i>in</i> him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ".<a name=85:13></a> "He is the true God, and eternal life".<a name=85:14></a> He brings us into the circle of which He is the centre, in the land of promise.<a name=85:15></a>

		There is in the various presentations which Christ makes of Himself in this chapter, a progress, and we have to apprehend Christ in increasing light.<a name=85:16></a> He presents Himself in many lights to us and we apprehend Him as He is pleased to present Himself; and as each is entered into by the soul, it is prepared for the next, for there is advance in each step.<a name=85:17></a> And it is a curious fact that in this chapter the Lord was really speaking to His enemies,

		There are two striking points in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=99:13></a> David is bent on finding a habitation for Jehovah, and Jehovah on the establishment of the throne of David.<a name=99:14></a> David sware, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob".<a name=99:15></a> When Israel was brought out of Egypt we get the thought, "I will prepare him an habitation".<a name=99:16></a> The answer to David's desire is found in the latter part of the psalm, "Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation".<a name=99:17></a> Then follow the blessings consequent on Jehovah's dwelling, "I will abundantly bless her provision: I will

		In the next psalm we see that very momentous consequences follow.<a name=100:9></a> Under David you get the unity of Israel and Judah, the ten tribes and the two.<a name=100:10></a> They were parted in self-will; now in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>they are brought together in the unity, so to speak, of the Spirit, and they get one head.<a name=100:11></a> They have David for head.<a name=100:12></a> They have surrendered their self-will, as witnessed by unity, and then you get the blessing, "There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=100:13></a>

		When self-will on the part of man is surrendered, then it is possible for God to make manifest the removal of the judgment of death that lies on man; then will be brought to pass eternal life.<a name=100:14></a> Sin must be removed in the world before God can come in and remove His righteous judgment, so that blessing may be established.<a name=100:15></a> Such are the ways of God in regard to the earth.<a name=100:16></a> Everything depends on the fact of God dwelling.<a name=100:17></a> David's thought was to prepare a habitation for Jehovah, then David's throne is established.<a name=100:18></a> Israel is brought together under the true head, and the blessing is commanded.<a name=100:19></a> I have said so much as to the literal force of the psalms.<a name=100:20></a> Everyone is probably aware of what great confusion has been brought into the Old Testament scriptures by attempting to introduce the church into them.<a name=100:21></a> Still, Scripture presents to us the great principles from which God never departs.<a name=100:22></a> The principles of divine dealings in the church are also the principles of divine

		There are certain things not exactly discerned in the letter of scripture but which lie underneath the letter, that is, in the spirit of scripture, which are of such moment that one can hardly conceive of people having them brought before them without their being greatly affected.<a name=175:4></a> The study of scripture may be mental, but all that is mental will pass away.<a name=175:5></a> Whatever you are taught by the Spirit you never lose.<a name=175:6></a> In regard to lectures, I am content if a soul take in one point -- a point which comes in to supply a missing link in the chain.<a name=175:7></a>

		There are three things specially before my mind to bring before you, and they are subjects very simple and elementary, but at the same time very profound.<a name=175:8></a> The first is this -- <i>the revelation of God</i>, in other words, the light of God; the second is, <i>the love of Christ</i>; and the third is, <i>the power of the Spirit</i>; and it is by each and all of these things that people are powerfully affected and by the knowledge of them they grow.<a name=175:9></a>

		I take up now the revelation of God -- the form and manner of God's revelation of Himself in the gospel and the effect of that upon us, and with this thought I have read the passage in Hebrews.<a name=175:10></a> There you have three things spoken of, (1) the word of God in verse 12; (2) the great High Priest in verse 14; and (3) the throne of grace in verse 16.<a name=175:11></a> We have to take the points up in that order.<a name=175:12></a> People do not understand the great High

		The great need is for the word of God to be a really burning power in our souls, that we should be profoundly affected by it.<a name=176:16></a> If I hold up a Bible, I could hardly say that it is living, it is the letter.<a name=176:17></a> That is no doubt what the apostle meant in warning those that had the letter of the scriptures about "an evil heart of unbelief".<a name=176:18></a> What is presented as object for faith in the gospel becomes, when received in the christian, the power of life; I live by that which I have believed, "the just shall live on the principle of faith".<a name=176:19></a> My relations with God are formed by the light which God has been pleased to give of Himself.<a name=176:20></a> Scripture is not mere history, it is always intensely moral; the principle in it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that a person properly knows of God (I am supposing the gospel to have been heard and believed), is the truth that Christ has died, and been buried, and raised again the third day, according to the scriptures.<a name=177:2></a> I think the faith of the gospel is founded on what is given at the close of Luke's gospel.<a name=177:3></a> "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day".<a name=177:4></a> This was preached first among the Jews and afterwards among the gentiles.<a name=177:5></a> It was what we might call dogmatic, that is, the announcement of facts.<a name=177:6></a> It is important to preach facts, but what is behind these facts is the revelation of God.<a name=177:7></a> When once the facts are accepted, it is no longer simply the facts, but the light of God which these facts reveal.<a name=177:8></a> It is the power of God's revelation come into the soul.<a name=177:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in God's purpose not only to save man by the gospel, but that He should by it be known in the heart of man.<a name=177:10></a> God has laid Himself out in divine goodness to secure the affections of man, and the work of the gospel is not done in any one of us until one can say, "I love God".<a name=177:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first light we get about God comes out in the death of Christ.<a name=177:12></a> His death is the revelation of the righteousness of God, and God means us to apprehend it in that way.<a name=177:13></a> Some one may say, 'But was not the blood for the forgiveness of my sins?<a name=177:14></a>' I admit that, but there was more than that in the death of Christ -- of which the blood is the witness -- God's righteousness is declared in it, that it may be known in my heart, and this is the moral foundation which God lays in the heart and upon which He can build.<a name=177:15></a>

		God's thought is to deliver me from the power of sin; not only to cleanse me from its guilt, but to free me from its power.<a name=177:16></a> When once the truth of the righteousness of God has taken possession of the heart of man, the power of sin is broken.<a name=177:17></a> The righteousness of God is known in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the next point is the resurrection of Christ, "He rose again the third day according to the scriptures".<a name=178:4></a> What does that fact convey?<a name=178:5></a> It is the display of the power of God, that is, the power of God in reference to man's weakness.<a name=178:6></a> Man is very weak; the real expression of the weakness of man is in death.<a name=178:7></a> Death is very terrible; I may be the centre of a whole circle of affections, with wife, children, and friends around, and if I die all are affected.<a name=178:8></a> I pass powerlessly out of it all, and nothing can really fill the gap.<a name=178:9></a> Death is the expression of man's utter weakness, but God has declared His mighty power in raising Christ from the dead.<a name=178:10></a> What is the moral purpose of that?<a name=178:11></a> That we may have that light of God in our hearts.<a name=178:12></a> I have hope in God that in my utter weakness His power is effectual to raise me up, not for judgment but for life, as in Christ.<a name=178:13></a> "For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=178:14></a> My point is that you may apprehend the wonderful light in which God has made Himself known; in His righteousness in the blood of Jesus, and in His power in the resurrection of Christ, and that is exactly what we want, and we have the light of that in our souls.<a name=178:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of man's believing the <i>facts</i> of the gospel is that the Holy Spirit is communicated to the believer.<a name=178:16></a> Now, what does he gain?<a name=178:17></a> He begins to reason from the death of Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit, and sees that the death of Christ is not simply a witness of God's righteousness, but the expression of His love.<a name=178:18></a> No one can apprehend this but by the Holy Spirit, as we read, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us".<a name=178:19></a> The scripture

		The word of God by the gospel has become a living power in our souls.<a name=179:3></a> All the light that has come to us has come through the gospel; it is a great thing that our hearts should be in the full light of God's blessed revelation.<a name=179:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing you will find, and that is that when the word of God has become real in the soul, it is extremely analytical; you get everything dissected in the believer.<a name=179:5></a> I come to have a sense of everything that is in me.<a name=179:6></a> The word of God searches a man through and through, and finds out all the different elements that are at work in him.<a name=179:7></a> It is a painful experience, but very necessary to the christian.<a name=179:8></a> You may find spiritual dullness coming over you; and the light of God coming in, the will begins to be uncommonly active, for it rebels against the light of God.<a name=179:9></a> The principle of sin and unbelief is revealed.<a name=179:10></a> The word thus dissects.<a name=179:11></a> I can understand people being depressed by the discovery in them of these things.<a name=179:12></a> The fact is that you are finding out the terrible contrariety in yourself -- what the strength of will is, and the working of it is discovered by the light of God in you.<a name=179:13></a> The object is that in being alive to it all you may be maintained in deliverance from its power.<a name=179:14></a> But we have to find out our own weakness, that in our flesh dwells no good thing, that is, that death is <i>in</i> us.<a name=179:15></a> There is death upon me, that is terrible, but death is in me, in the sense of inability for the good that is known.<a name=179:16></a> The only answer to it all is in the heart being sensible of the love of Christ.<a name=179:17></a> Thus are laid bare the flesh and its tendencies; but the Spirit of God emancipates the soul from the control of the flesh.<a name=179:18></a>

		I think there is a certain progression of thought in this passage -- certain things standing in connection one with another.<a name=186:1></a> First, you get the thought on the part of God towards man in connection with salvation and the characteristics of salvation, and the purpose of it, viz.<a name=186:2></a>, that we are not to be here for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.<a name=186:3></a> We get a similar line in Titus: "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=186:4></a> I think it is impossible to be a recipient of the grace of God without looking for the glory, and on the other hand, you want to see the character of God coming out in believers "in this present world".<a name=186:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here in Peter we see that the will of God stands in contrast with the lusts of men.<a name=186:6></a> There is the greatest possible irregularity in lusts, but, in the kingdom of God, we are morally under the rule of God, and in order to be here for the will of God we must not come under the moral irregularities of men.<a name=186:7></a>

		I want to speak a few words, beloved friends, on the steps which lead up to chapter 4.<a name=186:8></a> You cannot take up the fourth chapter without the end of the third -- "the answer of a good conscience toward God", verse 21, "not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ".<a name=186:9></a> A good conscience is the answer to every enemy, it is by the resurrection of

		This passage takes us back to the beginning of testimony on the part of God.<a name=187:8></a> Noah was a preacher of righteousness.<a name=187:9></a> We get a reference to Him who is the spring of all testimony -- the preacher was <i>Christ</i>.<a name=187:10></a> Noah was the vessel, he preached the righteousness of God and the judgment which was impending, but he was only the vessel, the real preacher was Christ.<a name=187:11></a> The testimony was really in the Spirit of resurrection -- it was on that ground that God saw fit to approach man.<a name=187:12></a> He could not approach man as <i>living</i> man, because death was upon all men, but He approached man by the Spirit of resurrection.<a name=187:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look at the passage -- verses 17 to 19.<a name=187:14></a> The Preacher at the present time, even as in the days of Noah, is Christ; the testimony is God's, and the source is God.<a name=187:15></a> There are many vessels down here, but the preaching is in the power of the Spirit, and the Spirit is on the line of resurrection.<a name=187:16></a> The spring and secret of God's ways in regard to man has always been based on resurrection, it was foreshadowed in the testimony of Noah before the flood.<a name=187:17></a> What is very interesting to notice is the consistency and unity of God's ways from the beginning.<a name=187:18></a> Man came under the judgment of death, and when God approaches man, it is in the power of the Spirit which raised Jesus from the dead.<a name=187:19></a> We ourselves have the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<a name=187:20></a> It is not only the death of Christ, but His resurrection, that is important.<a name=187:21></a>

		The apostle now passes on to the flood.<a name=188:4></a> The waters of death became salvation for Noah, and the apostle refers to baptism as a like figure.<a name=188:5></a> Baptism is the door of introduction into the house of God: the house of God is the dwelling-place of God, and the place of salvation.<a name=188:6></a> This afternoon it was pointed out that salvation, in a public way, comes in with the coming of the Lord.<a name=188:7></a> "As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation".<a name=188:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:27">Hebrews  9:27</a>.<a name=188:9></a>) Here we see that salvation is bound up with the coming of the Lord; but salvation comes in, in the meantime, in connection with the house of God, which is the place of salvation because God is dwelling there.<a name=188:10></a> Its foundations were laid in redemption.<a name=188:11></a> Christ took up all that lay upon man -- the judgment, the curse.<a name=188:12></a> He took up our liabilities.<a name=188:13></a> It was not man, but Christ, who built the house of God -- no man had any hand in it.<a name=188:14></a> Then, at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended, and in this way God took up His abode in the house which Christ had prepared.<a name=188:15></a> Every liability of man was taken up by Christ.<a name=188:16></a> He laid the foundations, and gathered the materials to form the house, and God is come to take up His abode there.<a name=188:17></a> It is not a material house -- not made of bricks and mortar -- it is composed of living stones -- souls -- and those who constituted the first presentation of the building were baptised by the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.<a name=188:18></a> The house of God was then, in a sense, perfect and entire in itself, and it has been pushing out in one direction and another ever since,

		Now, as I was saying, Peter takes up baptism as analogous to what happened in the case of the ark, setting forth a salvation connected with and characterised by the power of resurrection -- "not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ".<a name=189:9></a> That is what is characteristic of salvation, the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<a name=189:10></a> We have what God has been occupied with from Noah until now.<a name=189:11></a> Christ Himself was, of course, the actual testimony of resurrection.<a name=189:12></a> God's way in regard to man was to be set forth in Christ Himself, who died, and was buried, and rose the third day, that "repentance and remission of sins should be preached us his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=189:13></a> The resurrection of Christ is God's great testimony to man.<a name=189:14></a> It means that God has come out in Christ in grace.<a name=189:15></a> In the case of Christ Himself, God has broken the bonds of death, and Christ has risen, and the acceptance of God's testimony is that which establishes a good conscience toward God.<a name=189:16></a> It is a great thing that it has been made possible for us to enjoy this, that we should be entitled to the possession of a good conscience,

		Let us look a little at what we get in regard to Christ, who is gone into heaven.<a name=190:3></a> God has given wonderful expression to His appreciation of what was effected by Christ in regard to man.<a name=190:4></a> God has distinctly expressed divine appreciation of what Christ has done.<a name=190:5></a> One who was according to the will of God was made chargeable with what lay upon man.<a name=190:6></a> Where is He gone?<a name=190:7></a> Into heaven.<a name=190:8></a> Stephen saw Him there, standing at the right hand of God.<a name=190:9></a> He was received into heaven.<a name=190:10></a> Think of that!<a name=190:11></a> A <i>man</i> received with acclamation into heaven!<a name=190:12></a> It was the expression, on the part of God, of divine and infinite satisfaction.<a name=190:13></a> The great supper in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>is the answer to it down here, and the great supper comes to pass in the house of God, and in this house the witness is brought by the Holy Spirit that Christ "is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him".<a name=190:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wonderful to me to see how God's house was built by Christ, established on the foundation of redemption, and indwelt by the Spirit of God, and how it has pushed out from the beginning of christianity until now.<a name=191:3></a> The house is composed of those who have a good conscience toward God, and have no fear of any enemy.<a name=191:4></a> This is the sphere on earth where God dwells.<a name=191:5></a> If I am conscious of being brought into God's house, I have no fear of any enemy, and can dwell in peace where God dwells.<a name=191:6></a> I dwell where God dwells, and how could I do this if I had not a good conscience toward God?<a name=191:7></a> I can dwell in peace and security and salvation where God dwells.<a name=191:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may say this is not at all profound.<a name=191:9></a> No, dear friends, it is very simple; what people want is to be established in first principles, and the recognition of being able to dwell in peace where God dwells is one of the most important of them.<a name=191:10></a> When Christ comes, everything here that man has built will go down like a house of cards -- every authority and power will come to nothing.<a name=191:11></a> In the meanwhile, what God is effecting for the present time is expressed in the words of Christ, "Compel them to come in, that my house may be filled".<a name=191:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will say just a few words about the exhortation at the beginning of the next chapter.<a name=191:13></a> What I want you to remember is this, beloved friends, that Christ took flesh simply to suffer in; it was perfect in Him, untainted, holy, unlike any other man.<a name=191:14></a> He took part of flesh and blood, "that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death .<a name=191:15></a>.<a name=191:16></a>.<a name=191:17></a> and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage".<a name=191:18></a> Therefore scripture is perfectly explicit that He took the flesh simply to suffer in it.<a name=191:19></a> His entire pathway in the flesh was suffering.<a name=191:20></a> He "endured" the "contradiction of

		sinners against himself".<a name=192:1></a> We are to arm ourselves with the same mind, the flesh is to suffer, not to be gratified.<a name=192:2></a> Suffering is the opposite of self-gratification -- we are to suffer in the flesh, instead of to gratify it.<a name=192:3></a> "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin".<a name=192:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved friends, if I gratify the flesh, I go on in sin; if I suffer in the flesh, I cease from sin.<a name=192:5></a> Christ has suffered for me in the flesh, so now there is no room for me to gratify the flesh; I arm myself with the same mind to suffer in the flesh, and I cease from sin.<a name=192:6></a> I may say I would not like to gratify the flesh.<a name=192:7></a> I would not like to be a glutton, for instance, or to please the flesh in many other ways which might be mentioned, but, beloved friends, that is not enough.<a name=192:8></a> It is he who has suffered in the flesh who has ceased from sin.<a name=192:9></a> The connection between myself and the world is severed by suffering in the flesh.<a name=192:10></a> I might attempt to shut my eyes to the world, but that is no good; the only way is to arm myself with the same mind as Christ -- we suffer in the flesh, and cease from sin.<a name=192:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved friends, there are two great principles presented to us in the world.<a name=192:12></a> First, there is the will of God, and we read of Christ, "Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God".<a name=192:13></a> Christ put the will of God into presence down here, and not all the forces of evil can rout or set aside the will of God here, it is established on foundations which are immovable.<a name=192:14></a> Man tried to build a tower whose top should reach to heaven, but it came to nothing; everything that God builds is built on stable and immutable foundations, and nothing can dislodge that which is established according to the will of God.<a name=192:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The lusts of men are also in the world on every hand.<a name=192:16></a> The system pervaded by them comes close home to you, you cannot get clear of it, you cannot shut your eyes to it.<a name=192:17></a> But, beloved friends, "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing, I would just refer again to the beginning of God's testimony in the world.<a name=193:10></a> He testified through Noah.<a name=193:11></a> Christ is the testimony now, and Christ is also the preacher.<a name=193:12></a> Not only is Christ the preacher, but He is God's testimony to man, "To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins", and it is in view of that testimony that we have no more conscience of sins, but we have a good conscience toward God.<a name=193:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, dear friends, if Christ suffered for us in the flesh, it is only fitting that we should arm ourselves with the same mind.<a name=193:14></a> Is it not only just and right that as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, our part should be to suffer in the flesh also?<a name=193:15></a> We are here not for the lusts of men, but for the will of God, and it is a very great thing that God should have His place, and that His will should be the governing principle over my heart and life.<a name=193:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		May God give us to understand that we have a good conscience toward Him by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that we are to be here, not for the lusts of men, but for the will of God!<a name=193:17></a>

		There are three names under which God has been pleased to make Himself known, first as "Almighty" to Abraham, then to Moses as "Jehovah", and now, sending forth His Son, He is, of necessity, revealed as "Father".<a name=194:1></a> The basis of Israel's relationship was "Jehovah", just as the basis of ours is the name of "Father".<a name=194:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the names are successively presented, we never lose the value of those which precede.<a name=194:3></a> In "Jehovah" they had all the value of the name "Almighty", and, in regard to the basis of <i>our</i> relationship, we have the gain of the previous names, Almighty and Jehovah.<a name=194:4></a> We see this in scripture from a quotation in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>, 18.<a name=194:5></a> "I .<a name=194:6></a>.<a name=194:7></a>.<a name=194:8></a> will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".<a name=194:9></a> "Lord", in the New Testament, is generally equivalent to "Jehovah", so that, in such a passage as this, we see that, although the special name and foundation of our relationship is "Father", we get the value of each name previously given -- "Almighty" and "Jehovah".<a name=194:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will just look at these names a little in detail.<a name=194:11></a> The significance of the name "Almighty" is, I do not doubt, the power of God to quicken out of death.<a name=194:12></a> There is no hope for man except in God, who quickens out of death into life.<a name=194:13></a> That is the real force of "Almighty".<a name=194:14></a> Abraham, to whom the name was given, thus becomes, as it were, the starting-point in the line of promise, i.<a name=194:15></a>e.<a name=194:16></a>, he has to do with One "who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=194:17></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:17">Romans  4:17</a>.<a name=194:18></a>)

		In the ordering of nature, to which the mind of man is accustomed, we are continually brought back to the idea of a beginning.<a name=245:1></a> We are not habituated to think of the recurrence of the seasons simply as a fixed and unvarying order, but have the idea that a year has run its course, and that in entering on another year we are beginning a new epoch of life.<a name=245:2></a> It is impossible for man to get this impression out of his mind.<a name=245:3></a> And thus there is the continual reminding of a beginning.<a name=245:4></a> It has been a great occasion of exercise to many active minds to seek to fathom the outset of all that we see around us, and man has of himself been unable to solve the mystery.<a name=245:5></a> Of old, the mind of man would entertain the idea of the eternity of matter, but there are few in this day who would be prepared to adopt this thought.<a name=245:6></a> Men may not know God, and may reject revelation and the light that it affords, but there are few who would not ascribe the origin of things to the action of an intelligent mind.<a name=245:7></a> And the reason of this is that the mind of man goes back insensibly to a beginning.<a name=245:8></a> It is very difficult to evade the thought that there has been a mind at work far superior in intelligence and conception to any mind of man.<a name=245:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to revelation we are at once confronted with the thought of a beginning, not simply with reference to created objects, but with regard to moral considerations.<a name=245:10></a> For instance, we read that the devil sins from the beginning.<a name=245:11></a> Here we have the consideration that there was a beginning of sin.<a name=245:12></a> So, too, we find that by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, so that there was a moment when sin came into the world, and death had a beginning.<a name=245:13></a> But previously to this there was a moment when responsibility came in, in connection with man, and when that responsibility
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=246>[Page 246]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was accentuated by the prohibition to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<a name=246:1></a> Here again we are confronted with the thought of a beginning.<a name=246:2></a> Further, in this point of view we may bring in the idea of "from the beginning".<a name=246:3></a> It may be said that Adam was the head of God's creation from the beginning.<a name=246:4></a> The thought here would necessarily be from the beginning of the creation of man.<a name=246:5></a> In effect sin came in and hindered Adam from being effectively head, and the line of continuity was broken by the judgment of the flood.<a name=246:6></a> So to speak, another beginning came in.<a name=246:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come to the truth of "Him that is from the beginning" we are compelled to entertain quite another thought as to the beginning.<a name=246:8></a> And a thought which morally takes precedence of every other beginning, for here it evidently refers to the light of God having come in.<a name=246:9></a> The only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, has declared God.<a name=246:10></a> In one sense there was nothing new, for God could never be other than He had been; but as regards the ways of God, and man, it was a point of departure of the most momentous character.<a name=246:11></a> It is the true starting-point of all that which God intends to bring to pass right on to new heavens and a new earth.<a name=246:12></a> And hence in greatness and moral importance the New Testament, and that which it contains, takes precedence of the Old; though it is also true that God was continually foreshadowing that which was in due time to come out.<a name=246:13></a> If we can accustom ourselves to withdraw our minds from the influence of material things, and to look at things in the moral point of view, we shall have little difficulty in apprehending that the declaration of God is the true beginning.<a name=246:14></a> And there it is that we look for God's world.<a name=246:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when there came in light in this way there came in also the One in whom everything in God's world was to be centred.<a name=246:16></a> There must be a head from whom all should take its character, and in whom all should be held together in unity.<a name=246:17></a> Christ has tasted death for everything

		that He might be the Head of all.<a name=247:1></a> Hence we can understand the expression "Him that is from the beginning".<a name=247:2></a> He is the ark of the covenant, and the mercy-seat.<a name=247:3></a> The One who said, long before man came upon the scene, "I come .<a name=247:4></a>.<a name=247:5></a>.<a name=247:6></a> to do thy will, O .<a name=247:7></a>.<a name=247:8></a>.<a name=247:9></a> God: yea, thy law is within my heart".<a name=247:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Christ we have necessarily two thoughts: the first, that He has come out, that is to reveal God; and the second, that He has gone in as Man, in the value of accomplished redemption, in order that in the appointed time all may come forth from God in glory and power.<a name=247:11></a> The second Man is out of heaven.<a name=247:12></a> The Son of man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will reward every man according to his works.<a name=247:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming out of Christ as Apostle to make God known in His thoughts toward man, in His words and works, is necessarily available to all men, because it has come to pass in the presence of man down here.<a name=247:14></a> The Son of man lifted up was the expression of divine love, a testimony to man.<a name=247:15></a> The mediatorship of Christ and the truth of His being the Head of every man stand on the same ground, as all is the necessary consequence of His having borne the liabilities of men down here.<a name=247:16></a> All this became true in resurrection, and the fact of resurrection was announced by many who had been witnesses of it.<a name=247:17></a> We have not so far the thought of Christ going in.<a name=247:18></a> In the commission at the end of the gospel of Luke repentance and remission were to be preached in the name of the One that had died and was risen.<a name=247:19></a> Thus the testimony to man was based on that which had come to pass, so to speak, in the face of man here on earth.<a name=247:20></a> But all this does not exactly refer to the place of Christ as the One from the beginning, that is, from the outset of that which immediately hangs on God having been declared -- the world that is of God.<a name=247:21></a> In this point of view we contemplate Christ as having gone in, as being at the right hand of God.<a name=247:22></a> And there are various lights in which we can apprehend Him there.<a name=247:23></a> He is --

		There are doubtless many other things which are connected with Christ in the place where He is, but the above will suffice.<a name=248:6></a> All these glories, though based on redemption, so that they may stand in relation to man, are connected with Christ at the right hand of God: in other words, with Christ as having gone in.<a name=248:7></a> Hence the scene of interest is changed from Jerusalem to the right hand of God, whence everything is to come forth in the One that is from the beginning.<a name=248:8></a> It is worthy of notice that in the gospel of John the Lord speaks of Himself at least three times as ascending.<a name=248:9></a> He had come here to accomplish the Father's will, and that being done He goes back to the place from which He came, and as we have said, that is now the place of interest.<a name=248:10></a>

		As has been already pointed out, there are certain things which are the necessary consequences of Christ having come out, and of His having suffered, and being the risen One, and these are common to all christians; they are all in the light, as God is in the light; they have forgiveness of sins in Christ's name.<a name=248:11></a> But to enter into the knowledge of Him that is from the beginning is another matter, and demands that the believer should enter in.<a name=248:12></a> The point here is to learn that which Christ is <i>for God</i>, the beginning and centre of the divine system, and this is learnt only in the holiest.<a name=248:13></a> The atmosphere of this world of sight and sense and of moral uncleanness is not suitable for the entering into it.<a name=248:14></a> It brings in a wholly different order of things, to know which the christian has in spirit to leave the world system and its attachments.<a name=248:15></a> It may be asked how is this to be done.<a name=248:16></a>

		The answer is, I think, that we have to learn first that we are not under law, but possessors of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.<a name=249:1></a> To reach this hope we have recognised that the world is subject to the judgment of God, and hence professedly have left it.<a name=249:2></a> There is ever the danger of its again acquiring power over us, and the antidote to this lies in our judgment of its moral character, "all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<a name=249:3></a> And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God abideth for ever".<a name=249:4></a> Then we have come under the ministry of the new covenant, and have been made acquainted with the mind of God toward us.<a name=249:5></a> This is a very important point, as giving us confidence, so that we have liberty of access to God, are not afraid to speak with Him about anything.<a name=249:6></a> The next point is the knowledge that we are set apart to God, by the offering of the body of Jesus, from the old man, and are perfected with regard to conscience.<a name=249:7></a> I judge that these are the conditions necessary to entering in, and the gain of this is very great.<a name=249:8></a> We get the full assurance of understanding to the full knowledge of the mystery of God in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<a name=249:9></a> It is this which leads to stability of soul, so that one should not be shaken in the evil time.<a name=249:10></a> I fear that there are many who think that everything that they read of is theirs simply because they believe texts of scripture; it is possible that all these things are theirs in the purpose of God, but they are not theirs in the present, and this is the point in christianity.<a name=249:11></a> Our object should be to gain now as heavenly light what will soon be our part.<a name=249:12></a> And for this we must certainly find an entrance to the blessed scene of divine love in which these things subsist in Christ.<a name=249:13></a> May God in His grace exercise our hearts in this direction.<a name=249:14></a>

		I read this passage as introducing the thought of retribution in connection with the kingdom of heaven.<a name=255:1></a> The subject of this chapter is the kingdom of heaven; we used to think that it was the church that was in view; but it is not difficult to see that the kingdom of heaven is really the subject of the chapter, and it closes with a parable, which is a similitude of the kingdom.<a name=255:2></a> Now the point to which I call attention is in verse 23, "Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants", and I would say that the moment you get the idea of the kingdom, you find that it is a time of reckoning; you could not quite say that the time of law or prophets was a time of reckoning, but the kingdom is so.<a name=255:3></a> It was in the king's mind to <i>take account</i> of his servants; that comes out at the close of this chapter.<a name=255:4></a> Everything is brought to an issue in the time of the kingdom.<a name=255:5></a> Now I doubt if we take that thought in connection with the kingdom sufficiently into account.<a name=255:6></a> In the servant who owed ten thousand talents you get the element of grace come in -- there was humbling on the part of the servant -- and grace comes in in remission; and the principle and rule of the kingdom is grace, not law.<a name=255:7></a> As the apostle says, "Ye are not under law but under grace".<a name=255:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another thought also comes to light, and that is that this very principle of grace becomes a <i>test</i>.<a name=255:9></a> It is not law, but grace, that is the test for people according to God.<a name=255:10></a> The man who owed ten thousand talents is forgiven, but then grace became the test.<a name=255:11></a> Will he show the same grace to his fellow-servant as had been shown to him?<a name=255:12></a> Now it is the failure of men to appreciate this grace that has come in, that will eventually bring in the judgment of God.<a name=255:13></a> You see this in the case of the

		Gentiles; they are cut out of the tree of promise, because they have failed to appreciate the goodness of God, and thus grace becomes a great test.<a name=256:1></a> The thought of reckoning is clearly in connection with the kingdom.<a name=256:2></a> It has been a time of reckoning ever since the Lord was here.<a name=256:3></a> He came in connection with the kingdom, and from that time on it has been a time of reckoning.<a name=256:4></a> The Jew in one way has already come under the reckoning; but it is still going on, and will not be brought to a close until the Son of man delivers up the kingdom.<a name=256:5></a> But meanwhile this principle of grace has come in, and has become the test.<a name=256:6></a> When Christ came to the Jew, the point was, Would he appreciate the grace in which Christ came?<a name=256:7></a> "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses".<a name=256:8></a> God had come near to man in grace, and everything depended on the appreciation of Christ.<a name=256:9></a> And so too with us everything depends upon our appreciation of grace, and as I said just now, what comes out in the end is that the Gentiles are cut off from privilege, for they fail to continue in the goodness of God.<a name=256:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think this point needs to be apprehended in regard of the kingdom: if a man shows no mercy, then God will deal accordingly with that man.<a name=256:11></a> We are tested by grace as to how far we are under the influence of grace in our dealings one with another.<a name=256:12></a> As to the individual, he may come under the discipline of God for his failure; but in the end the Gentiles will come under the judgment of God because they have failed to abide under the influence of grace.<a name=256:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I desire to say a word as to what God intended by the kingdom.<a name=256:14></a> What it has become was of course all under the eye of God, and the Lord when here spoke of it, but that was not what God intended.<a name=256:15></a> What is infinitely more important is what God's thought was in the kingdom; I want to show you how the kingdom as it is now naturally leads on to the church, but before doing that I just touch on certain things which God never intended should come in, but which yet have done so.<a name=256:16></a>

		God never intended that the kingdom should become a great system upon earth before Him.<a name=257:1></a> If you should ask me to what I allude, I direct your attention to Popery, or even, in a sense, to Protestantism, though Popery is a more distinct example of what the kingdom has become in the hand of man -- a system certainly having the character of a great tree, as the Lord predicted.<a name=257:2></a> But that was not what God intended any more than that it was His thought that the kingdom should be a leavened mass.<a name=257:3></a> The time is coming when the kingdom will be set up in power, and it is to that the Lord is leading up in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, but I repeat that it was not in the thought of God that the kingdom should become a great system here under His eye.<a name=257:4></a>

		Now I will try to bring before you what God <i>did</i> intend.<a name=257:5></a> He intended the kingdom to come to man in delivering power; the thought in the heart of God in connection with the kingdom was that man might be <i>delivered</i>.<a name=257:6></a> I think you see this coming out in the lifetime of the Lord here, in His ministry upon earth.<a name=257:7></a> The spirit and end of His ministry was deliverance for man.<a name=257:8></a> In the presence of Christ here grace took account of man as captive to one thing or another, and there was deliverance for man.<a name=257:9></a> I see three ways at least in which man is captive: he is captive to Satan, and to man, and to the world; these three things no doubt work together, but still it is easy to distinguish them as separate influences.<a name=257:10></a> Now, as I said, the character of the Lord's ministry was to give deliverance to the captives -- He delivered men from their bondage.<a name=257:11></a> Men were in abject bondage when the Lord was here -- not only to the devil, they were in bondage to the scribes and Pharisees, they went in fear of man.<a name=257:12></a> And they were in bondage to the influences of the world; and the influences of the world are extremely subtle, and it is difficult not to be affected by them.<a name=257:13></a> But the object in the ministration of grace was that man might be set free from the bondage in which he was.<a name=257:14></a> The same thing comes out in a fuller way in the

		gospel.<a name=258:1></a> The Holy Spirit came down to substantiate the kingdom here, and that is really to bring man into the enjoyment of liberty.<a name=258:2></a> The gospel brings to him the knowledge of the grace of God, and he learns that he is not under law, but grace; and it is in the apprehension of this that man gets deliverance.<a name=258:3></a> If you look at the world today you will see to what an extent men are in bondage; they fear their fellow-men and public opinion, and are in bondage to worldly influences.<a name=258:4></a> People do not like to be thought singular, and they are thus in bondage to the opinion of men -- they consider what men will say, or think, and all that kind of thing.<a name=258:5></a> And the influence of Satan over the minds and spirits of men is exercised in various ways.<a name=258:6></a>

		But by the influence and effect of grace man was to be delivered from these things; and where redemption is known and the grace of God truly apprehended, that is the proper result -- man is delivered from Satan's power, from the fear of man, and the influence of the world.<a name=258:7></a>

		When the children of Israel were redeemed out of Egypt, and brought through the Red Sea, they were saved from the judgment of God, and they knew too deliverance from the fear of Pharaoh and the Egyptians -- that is Satan and the world typically.<a name=258:8></a> They had been brought out of Egypt, the scene of man's power and of Satan's domination.<a name=258:9></a> And that is what is fulfilled now spiritually in christians -- they are brought into the light of God's grace, they have access by faith into the grace wherein they stand, and in the reality of that, they have deliverance from Satan, and man, and the world.<a name=258:10></a> Then they are prepared to refuse utterly and entirely the influence of man or the world over the soul.<a name=258:11></a> Anyone truly under the sway of grace would refuse the system of priest-craft; and when one sees men in bondage to it, it proves this, that such do not enjoy the privileges of the kingdom, "for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy", <i>in divine</i>

		At the outset of His ministry, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>, the Lord stands up in the synagogue and reads, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord"; and the passage in the prophet goes on to say, "and the day of vengeance of our God", because, as I said, the kingdom brings in the idea of a day of reckoning -- but grace came in first, and the effect of the gospel of the kingdom is to set at liberty those who are captive.<a name=259:3></a> It is often a long time before saints come fully to deliverance.<a name=259:4></a> For myself I am ashamed to think of how much one is affected by the influence of the world and the fear of man.<a name=259:5></a> Deliverance is no light thing; many a brave man physically is dreadfully afraid of man at heart, and I believe that it is that fear which hinders many a christian.<a name=259:6></a> When you come into the liberty of the Spirit you are free from the world, and man, and officialism; and further, it becomes a great day to you when you recognise the presence of the Spirit.<a name=259:7></a> It was the recognition of the presence of the Spirit that brought many of us out from what was attractive to us naturally; we felt that in the knowledge of His presence it was inconsistent to go on with things to which we had been accustomed.<a name=259:8></a>

		Now the thought of children of the Father spoken of in the end of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>conveys to me the idea that there is a generation here which is of the Father, and this constitutes the true character of christianity.<a name=266:17></a> God holds His hand over the world in government, but there is a generation here of which the Father is morally the source, a generation intended to bear the character of the Father.<a name=266:18></a> In the first chapter of John, verses 10 - 12, we read that Christ "was in the world .<a name=266:19></a>.<a name=266:20></a>.<a name=266:21></a> and the world knew him not.<a name=266:22></a> He came to his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God".<a name=266:23></a> This must be understood

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As has been said, the effect of Christ's work was to leave the world outwardly as it was.<a name=272:4></a> The sheep were to be led out of the fold, but the fold remained as it was, only darker.<a name=272:5></a> We are familiar with the fact that when a light is brought into a dark room and taken out again, the darkness seems greater than ever.<a name=272:6></a> Well, it was like that with the Jews.<a name=272:7></a> But other sheep were to be brought to the sheep of the Jewish fold, and there was to be one flock and one shepherd.<a name=272:8></a> To put it in Paul's language, the Gentiles were to become, "fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God".<a name=272:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:19">Ephesians  2:19</a>).<a name=272:10></a> The point with Christ was to place the flock consciously in the hand of the Father.<a name=272:11></a> Christ came from the Father as light into the world, and in a sense the light abides in His people, but His work has placed the flock in the hand of the Father.<a name=272:12></a> When the Lord comes again He will take the saints into the Father's house, but that is future, and I do not think people are very much affected by what is future, but they are affected by what is present, and being in the Father's hand is present.<a name=272:13></a>

		thing.<a name=273:1></a> You see this illustrated in the case of the blind man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>.<a name=273:2></a> I do not doubt that that man had the eyes of his soul opened, and the effect of it was that he came to the conclusion that Christ and His work were entirely exceptional.<a name=273:3></a> He began with an orthodox statement about the Lord, namely, that He was a prophet and then he got further light, until he discovered that Christ was exceptional.<a name=273:4></a> "Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind".<a name=273:5></a> That was something beyond the idea of a prophet.<a name=273:6></a> It is the same now with people when they get their eyes opened.<a name=273:7></a> They realise that the Scriptures are exceptional, and they do not begin to compare them with other books.<a name=273:8></a> It is the voice of the living God which speaks in Scripture, and His voice is totally different from any other voice.<a name=273:9></a> I may say that in Christ God became His own testimony.<a name=273:10></a> He had spoken by prophets, but prophets were not themselves the Word, they <i>had</i> the Word; but Christ <i>was</i> the Word, and thus God became His own testimony.<a name=273:11></a> God spake in the Son.<a name=273:12></a> This is the character of Scripture, it is the living God speaking.<a name=273:13></a> If a man's eyes are opened he will see a character about Scripture wholly exceptional; the Scriptures cannot be ranked with any other book in the world.<a name=273:14></a> This is the effect of having the eyes opened.<a name=273:15></a> It is in this way that the Lord gains man's confidence, and be is then ready to follow Christ out of the world.<a name=273:16></a> This is really what baptism means.<a name=273:17></a> You are prepared to leave Egypt, to pass through the Red Sea to come into the house of God, into the circle of christian fellowship.<a name=273:18></a> Thus the Word of God, or Christ who is the Word, gains the confidence of man.<a name=273:19></a> The Lord put the question to the man, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=273:20></a>" He replies that he believes, and then he worships Him, and is ready to follow the Lord.<a name=273:21></a> This is how grace works.<a name=273:22></a> Scripture is to me the voice of the living God.<a name=273:23></a> The Lord says of the Scriptures, "They are they which testify of me".<a name=273:24></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:39">John  5:39</a>.<a name=273:25></a>) He is the spirit of Scripture,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing I would note in the chapter is that Christ is spoken of as the door of the sheep.<a name=274:2></a> The idea I get from the door is that it leads you into what you have not been in before.<a name=274:3></a> Now there is very great gain in that, and I would like to dwell upon it a little in detail.<a name=274:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first gain is that you are saved.<a name=274:5></a> There is security, and I believe you get this security by being brought into the kingdom of God.<a name=274:6></a> Any foreigner in coming to England soon feels that he is secure, because there is a stable government.<a name=274:7></a> So also the first effect of entering in by Christ as the door is that you come into the security of the kingdom of God.<a name=274:8></a> I believe that anyone who really confesses Christ as Lord is not afraid of anything; he is not afraid of the devil, because Christ will take care of him.<a name=274:9></a> There is light and good government where He is.<a name=274:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second point is, "And shall go in and out, and find pasture".<a name=274:11></a> You come into the liberty of the Spirit.<a name=274:12></a> You have left the world and the fold; you have left the world at its best -- for the fold was the best thing in the world, for it was of God -- or at its worst, and are come to Christ; you are in the kingdom and get liberty; you are admonished to "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free".<a name=274:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, thirdly, you come into pasture, that is, divine teaching.<a name=274:14></a> Your soul is instructed and nurtured in the love of God.<a name=274:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next the Lord says, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly".<a name=274:16></a> I believe life in that verse to mean that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<a name=274:17></a> It is life morally, life in <i>me</i>.<a name=274:18></a> Now it is one thing for life to be in me and another thing for me to be in life.<a name=274:19></a> The point in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>is life in you.<a name=274:20></a> The idea connected with "eternal life"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like to challenge all as to whether all this is fulfilled in us.<a name=275:5></a> Security is a great thing, the kingdom is great gain.<a name=275:6></a> Then liberty comes in.<a name=275:7></a> Very, very many christians are in great bondage, but liberty is secured for them, and whether you are rich or poor, whatever your circumstances may be, it is there for all alike, but I think the poor man is much more likely to enter into liberty than the rich.<a name=275:8></a> I believe it is to this end that you are brought into the kingdom, and it is there that you are instructed in the love of God.<a name=275:9></a> You get holiness and intelligence.<a name=275:10></a> I believe you get remarkable intelligence when you are instructed in the love of God.<a name=275:11></a> You are "able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height"; as it is put in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a>.<a name=275:12></a> The grace of Christ is to me wonderful.<a name=275:13></a> He went to the cross a ransom for all, and now He has sent the Spirit, the promise of the Father, that we might have life abundantly in the scene of death.<a name=275:14></a>

		Purification is evidently the subject of this chapter.<a name=283:3></a> Even the pattern which Moses set up had to be purified by blood; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these, that is, not by typical sacrifices.<a name=283:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thing that I want to draw attention to is Christ appearing in the presence of God for us.<a name=283:8></a> When Christ takes that place as exalted in heaven, the house of God is formed down here.<a name=283:9></a> The "heavenly things" is really the house of God.<a name=283:10></a> The "things in the heavens" are not identical with the heavenly things.<a name=283:11></a> For the former you must go to heaven, but the latter are brought out here on the earth, "heavenly things" are what are peculiar to this moment.<a name=283:12></a> In Old Testament times saints had not heavenly things, nor will they have them on earth in the millennium, but we have them now.<a name=283:13></a> The Lord said, "How shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?<a name=283:14></a>" I believe the expression "heavenly things" refers to the dwelling-place of God down here.<a name=283:15></a> We

	<div class="paragraph">
		The house of God has been formed down here -- God is dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=284:5></a> It is this which has led me to read <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=284:6></a> The advent of the Holy Spirit formed the house.<a name=284:7></a> I am not speaking of the great house, but of the house of God in its own proper character, more what Peter refers to in "ye .<a name=284:8></a>.<a name=284:9></a>.<a name=284:10></a> are .<a name=284:11></a>.<a name=284:12></a>.<a name=284:13></a> a spiritual house", and again in the Hebrews, "whose house are we".<a name=284:14></a>

		Now I come to another point.<a name=284:21></a> The house of God could not, I judge, have been set up down here until Christ appeared as man in heaven.<a name=284:22></a> It is important to see that all God's ways are bound up in two men -- two heads of races.<a name=284:23></a> Christ is the Head of the heavenly race.<a name=284:24></a> We are represented in the presence of God in Him.<a name=284:25></a> The application of this to us is given as a status in the presence of God.<a name=284:26></a> Christ is representative of all the race.<a name=284:27></a> I am not ignoring the question of our individual responsibility, but it is equally a truth that in the ways of God the race is represented in the Head.<a name=284:28></a> When Adam fell the whole race fell, "As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death

		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>, 10: 36 - 38
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A sort of epitome of what is presented in chapter 11 of the Acts will be found in verse 36 of the previous chapter, namely, "The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, <i>preaching peace</i> by Jesus Christ: (<i>he is Lord of all</i>)".<a name=288:1></a> These two points are prominent in the passage in chapter 11, namely, peace and the recognition of Christ as Lord.<a name=288:2></a> There are two parts to the chapter: (1) the account of what took place at Jerusalem; and (2) of what occurred at Antioch; the first part is connected with the preaching of peace, and involves the consequent truth of the <i>one body</i>; and the second part gives the basis of christian <i>fellowship -- namely</i>, that Christ is "Lord of all".<a name=288:3></a> If we were more acquainted with the universality of His lordship, there would be more real fellowship.<a name=288:4></a> Fellowship is a practical principle, and we find it coming out in a practical way at the end of chapter 11.<a name=288:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A student of scripture will attach importance and distinctness to these two parts of this chapter.<a name=288:6></a> When the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost, the effect was the formation of the church as "one body".<a name=288:7></a> The house of God was necessarily formed too, but those who had received the Spirit were by that fact formed, constituted one body, yet at that time the church had not reached the scope which God intended for it; it could not have been said then: "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, <i>whether we be Jews or Gentiles</i>".<a name=288:8></a> Now Peter was used in the case of Cornelius to bring the gentiles into the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=288:9></a> Still the body, although not in the full extent of it, was here from the outset, and it was so truly Christ's body that He could say to Saul: "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=288:10></a>" There

		was the presentation of Himself here in the saints morally; this came out in Stephen, and it was not in the mere fact of unity but in a real setting forth of Christ.<a name=289:1></a> It was this that was hateful to Saul, and he sought to remove it; but the Lord's way with Saul was remarkable; He weakened him when on the way to Damascus, very much as occurred with the Syrians who came to take Elisha, when they were smitten with blindness.<a name=289:2></a> They were weakened, and yet when brought to Samaria the prophet would on no account allow violence toward them, but directed the king to set bread and water before them.<a name=289:3></a> So Saul, when he came to Damascus, where he had intended to be a persecutor, received forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=289:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The one body is the expression of peace; reconciliation is there -- Jew and Gentile were baptised into one body.<a name=289:5></a> This was first brought about in the reception of Cornelius.<a name=289:6></a> Peter gave to him and his friends the light of the scripture and testimony as to Jesus, and the Holy Spirit fell on them, and thus was accomplished what God intended, namely, <i>Jew and Gentile</i> baptised into one body.<a name=289:7></a> Afterwards they were baptised with water, which brought them within the limits of christianity down here upon the earth.<a name=289:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I go on to point out the significance of peace I would just note that there are three towns spoken of in this chapter: Caesarea, where Cornelius was; then Jerusalem, where Peter's defence took place; and then Antioch in Syria.<a name=289:9></a> Caesarea was the seat of the Roman governor, and the place where the Holy Spirit had fallen upon those gentiles who heard the word.<a name=289:10></a> Jerusalem was for the moment the seat of light and even of authority, and that in connection with the church, and it was on that account that Peter went up there to justify to the assembly what he had done in connection with Cornelius.<a name=289:11></a> What he had had grace to do in regard to Cornelius he had grace to explain to the assembly.<a name=289:12></a> This is an important principle in regard of the servant, for he

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Peter's vindication of himself the first point that is noticeable is that people are saved by <i>words</i>.<a name=290:2></a> "Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved".<a name=290:3></a> Cornelius was already a devout man, but salvation was brought to him by words -- the tidings of God's salvation in Christ, and in receiving the light he was saved.<a name=290:4></a> The reception of light from God as to His grace necessarily brings a man into salvation, "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation".<a name=290:5></a> The believer confesses Jesus as Lord, and that means salvation as to his soul.<a name=290:6></a> The light of the Lord means salvation from the judgment of God and from the power of the enemy, as seen in figure in the Israelites when passed through the Red Sea.<a name=290:7></a> Believing on the Lord has a mighty power in the soul, and brings unto salvation.<a name=290:8></a> While Peter spake, the Holy Spirit fell on them that heard, and Peter recalled the word of the Lord Jesus, how that He said: "John indeed baptised with water; but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit".<a name=290:9></a> Who but <i>God</i> could baptise with the Holy Spirit?<a name=290:10></a> That He should baptise with the Spirit was the proof to John the baptist that Christ was the Son of God.<a name=290:11></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:33">John  1:33</a>, 34.<a name=290:12></a>) When Peter saw that the Holy Spirit fell on them, he recognised the <i>act of God</i>: "Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us .<a name=290:13></a>.<a name=290:14></a>.<a name=290:15></a> what was I, that I could withstand <i>God</i>?<a name=290:16></a>" Peter was silenced; Cornelius was baptised with the Holy Spirit, and by the baptism of the Holy Spirit he was brought into the one body.<a name=290:17></a> The moment a gentile was there the body existed according to the mind of God, Jew and Gentile were baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=290:18></a>

		The spirit and character of the Lord's ministry here on earth was <i>peace</i>.<a name=290:19></a> There was no hostility to man; He went about doing good, "healing all that were oppressed of the devil".<a name=290:20></a> He set Himself against the great author of enmity.<a name=290:21></a> When the Lord Jesus was born into this

		When Eve was taken out of Adam, she had no will divergent from his -- I speak of the time previous to sin coming in.<a name=291:10></a> So in the church, Christ's body, there is but one will, and that is Christ's.<a name=291:11></a> Practically there is no way of peace save in the putting off the old man and putting on the new.<a name=291:12></a> Then there is no opportunity for discord: there is one will only, the will of Christ, and that will is <i>love</i>.<a name=291:13></a> When the Lord Jesus gave a commandment (and His commandment is the expression of Himself) it was, "Love one another, as I have loved you".<a name=291:14></a> There is no room for discord where Christ's will rules.<a name=291:15></a> I have been delighted in tracing the continuity of all that comes out in Christ.<a name=291:16></a> We never do fully come to peace until we come to the one body which is Christ's body.<a name=291:17></a> "Let the peace of Christ" "rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body".<a name=291:18></a> The church is taken from Christ, and is ruled by His will.<a name=291:19></a> I believe that is the force of the headship; the various members of my body move at the dictation of my head, and so the will of

		Now another very important point comes out in connection with Antioch, verses 19 - 24.<a name=292:3></a> Mark how the name of the Lord Jesus recurs in this passage.<a name=292:4></a> Verse 20, "preaching the <i>Lord Jesus</i>".<a name=292:5></a> Verse 21, "And the hand of the <i>Lord</i> was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the <i>Lord</i>".<a name=292:6></a> Verse 23, Barnabas "exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto <i>the Lord</i>".<a name=292:7></a> Verse 24, "much people was added unto <i>the Lord</i>".<a name=292:8></a> Now it is important to remember that the work of the Holy Spirit is in the formation of which is unseen (I am referring again to the former part of the chapter) -- the body of Christ is unseen; but when we come to the point of christian fellowship, this is manifest and can be apprehended.<a name=292:9></a> At Antioch people turned to the Lord, and were added to the Lord; all this connects itself with what we find in chapter 10.<a name=292:10></a> Christ "is <i>Lord of all</i>".<a name=292:11></a> Men recognised that He was Lord to the gentile as well as to the Jew.<a name=292:12></a> The truth that He is Lord of all was acted on when men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who had come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord.<a name=292:13></a> The Greeks spoken of in verse 20 were really gentiles, not Greek-speaking Jews.<a name=292:14></a> Peter had recognised that Christ was Lord of <i>all</i>, and these emissaries went out in the faith of this, and the Greeks who received the word were brought into the light of the Lord, and thus into christian fellowship.<a name=292:15></a> The Jews, on the one hand, went to Antioch to bring the good news that Christ is Lord of all; and on the other, these gentiles who believed sent temporal relief to the saints at Jerusalem, and this is the expression of fellowship.<a name=292:16></a> The Lord is the real bond of fellowship.<a name=292:17></a> There may be those who have come into the outward profession of christianity, but fellowship in the true sense of it does not admit of profession, but is possible only in those who have believed in the Lord.<a name=292:18></a> These gentiles

		<a name=293>[Page 293]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		soon shewed their fellowship in a practical way.<a name=293:1></a> It was remarkable for gentiles to be ministering to Jews, and thus giving expression to the truth that Christ is "Lord of all".<a name=293:2></a> Freemasonry is an imitation of christian fellowship in its universality.<a name=293:3></a> Our christian responsibilities are connected with our fellowship, and our bond is the common confession of Christ as Lord.<a name=293:4></a> No one ever understands fellowship unless he recognises that, while owning Christ as Lord, we are in a scene from which He has been rejected; we have to be faithful to His death.<a name=293:5></a> The Holy Spirit maintains us in the fellowship of one Lord and of His death.<a name=293:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The hearts of these gentiles who were in christian fellowship went out to the Jews; they had received the word of God through Jews, and now they ministered to the Jews in temporal things.<a name=293:7></a> All was of God at the beginning.<a name=293:8></a> The great point for us is to get back to that in which the power of the Holy Spirit is displayed.<a name=293:9></a> These are the two things which come out in the chapter: peace brought about by the work of the Holy Spirit, forming one body in Christ; then christian fellowship finding expression in those owning one Lord.<a name=293:10></a>

		Now the kingdom has reference to us individually -- we, of course, come under the sway of grace individually -- but I want to shew you that on the part of God the kingdom subsists for the church.<a name=297:6></a> The kingdom is in that sense subsidiary to the church.<a name=297:7></a> I ask you to read the parables of the treasure hid in the field, and of the pearl of great price: all the early part of the chapter is occupied with the development of the kingdom as in the hand of man; the Lord foresaw what it would come to in the hand of man.<a name=297:8></a> If you want to get an idea of the mustard tree, I would point you to popery; but in the end of the chapter we come to the <i>secrets</i> of the kingdom; the purpose for which the kingdom exists in the mind of God and in fact.<a name=297:9></a> The kingdom is maintained as a bulwark against the flood of evil down here, but its object is for the <i>treasure</i> -- the treasure is the church; the field was bought for the sake of the treasure that was in it.<a name=297:10></a> The following parable is of the pearl of great price, and to buy this the merchantman went and sold all that he had.<a name=297:11></a> Here we have the thought of the church, but it is viewed as a similitude of the kingdom; the kingdom in the mind of God has in view the church.<a name=297:12></a> The final parable is the net cast into the sea which drew fish of every kind, and the good are put into vessels, and the bad are cast away.<a name=297:13></a> At the close of the age there is selection.<a name=297:14></a> My object in referring to these parables is to prove that the kingdom is maintained for the sake

		I pass on now to chapter 16 and here we have another passage connecting the thought of the kingdom with the church.<a name=298:2></a> Peter had a special revelation made to him from the Father, and the result was that he confessed Christ as the Son of the living God.<a name=298:3></a> The Lord gives no ministry to Peter in regard to the church; in connection with that, Peter is simply regarded as a sample stone; the rock was the confession of Christ as the Son of the living God; and it proved that Peter was a stone -- a piece of the rock.<a name=298:4></a> The church here is looked at solely and entirely as of Christ's building.<a name=298:5></a> Peter takes up in his first epistle the thought of living stones; a person comes to the Living Stone, in apprehending that Christ is the Son of the living God, and at the same time that He is disallowed indeed of men.<a name=298:6></a> His resurrection is the expression of one -- He is "declared .<a name=298:7></a>.<a name=298:8></a>.<a name=298:9></a> Son of God with power, .<a name=298:10></a>.<a name=298:11></a>.<a name=298:12></a> by the resurrection from the dead" -- and His death of the other, for death is the extreme expression of man's disallowance.<a name=298:13></a> And until christians are outside the influences of this world, they can hardly be said to have come to Christ as the Living Stone.<a name=298:14></a> As regards the church, as we have seen, Christ alone is the Builder, and Peter in this passage is in regard to it simply a stone; but in regard to the kingdom, Peter had by the Lord's appointment a very important place.<a name=298:15></a> He opened up the sway of grace to both Jew and Gentile.<a name=298:16></a> Peter preached grace in the light of the glory on the day of Pentecost; God answered the people's wickedness and perverseness in the preaching of grace, and on the condition of repentance they received forgiveness and the gift of the Holy Spirit, and three thousand were added to them that day.<a name=298:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The force of Christ's resurrection is accentuated by the fact that He Himself, when here, raised the dead.<a name=298:18></a> The power of resurrection was set forth in Him.<a name=298:19></a> We believe in God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, and more than that, we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ in whom the power of God has thus been expressed.<a name=298:20></a>

		Now the teaching of grace leads us to apprehend love; and thus brings us practically to the assembly, and then we begin to apprehend what God is doing for Himself; He is "bringing many sons to glory" for the satisfaction of His love; the assembly is composed of the many sons whom God is bringing to glory, and who are to be with Christ in the full light of divine love, and to respond to that love.<a name=299:1></a> Grace leads to glory, and God's glory is His purpose, and in apprehending His purpose, we are brought into the truth of the assembly; and it is in that way that we are in company with many more in the presence of divine love.<a name=299:2></a> Aaron and his sons stand as a type of Christ and the church, but we do not get in the type that they went into the holiest in company; but now, the moment you in spirit cross the threshold of the holiest you find yourself in company with many more, and it is the effectiveness of grace that has brought you there.<a name=299:3></a> Grace does not stop at <i>teaching</i>, but leads to glory.<a name=299:4></a> It is in this way that it works as you come under its sway, you are brought into the divine purpose, into the presence of divine love, and are responsive to it.<a name=299:5></a> The assembly is where the Father's love is known, and where we are responsive to that love.<a name=299:6></a> The kingdom is necessarily dependent upon the revelation of God, and when the kingdom is established in the heart of the believer, it leads him into the presence of the Father's love, in association with Christ, and thus we learn what the assembly is, and that grace leads to glory.<a name=299:7></a>

		Now I have previously sought to shew how the revelation of God brings us to the kingdom; I want at this time to shew how you are brought by the kingdom to the church, and by church I do not mean the clergy, nor an ecclesiastical building, nor do I speak of the church even in the sense of an ecclesiastical formation down here -- but of what it is in the mind of God -- the mystery; that is really the thing that is of value to us, not the coming into any external and outward association, but reaching by divine teaching the thought and mind of God in regard to the church.<a name=300:4></a> Indeed in a day of ruin you cannot attach very much value to what is outward, but God helps us in giving us to see the reality of things in the divine thought; and I hope to shew how the truth of the kingdom in its practical working and bearing, leads to the church.<a name=300:5></a>

		God's kingdom is brought in consequent upon His having broken the power of Satan -- the authority of darkness.<a name=300:6></a> The power of Satan was really annulled in the death and resurrection of Christ, for there life and incorruptibility were brought to light, and a deadly blow struck at the kingdom of Satan -- just as at the Red Sea a deadly blow was struck at the kingdom of Pharaoh; it was not annihilated at the time, any more than is Satan's kingdom, but when God's kingdom is brought in manifestly, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss,

		Now I want to speak of God's kingdom as connected with His discipline, the kingdom is characterised by the rule of grace, grace reigning through righteousness unto eternal life -- grace is the great controlling principle of God's kingdom; but there is also discipline.<a name=301:3></a> The parable I read in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>proves this, so also that of the labourers in the vineyard.<a name=301:4></a> If the kingdom is the rule of grace, man can set up no claims nor rights, for the reason that it <i>is</i> the rule of grace.<a name=301:5></a> If you come into the truth of the kingdom, you must be prepared to surrender every idea of claim, because the kingdom is characterised by the <i>grace of God</i>.<a name=301:6></a> The truth is that if God took up the kingdom on any other principle but that of grace, we should have a poor time of it!<a name=301:7></a> There is no room, however, in it for any claim of man; grace reigns, the kingdom is established through righteousness.<a name=301:8></a> The man that was obnoxious to God has been removed in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=301:9></a> The principle of the kingdom is, "is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?<a name=301:10></a> Is thine eye evil because I am good?<a name=301:11></a>" The occasion of discipline is our failing to shew to another the grace in which we have ourselves been acted towards; we may come thus under discipline; the Lord says, so likewise will your "heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every man his brother their trespasses".<a name=301:12></a> We come into the kingdom on the ground of being forgiven, and we have to act on that principle with regard to others, and if we do not, we bring ourselves under the discipline of the Father.<a name=301:13></a> If you take the ground of being under the sway of heaven,

		Now to refer to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:15">John  14:15</a>, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" -- if we keep the commandments of Christ (which is a habit of soul) it is a proof that our will has no place, we are as the apostle says duly "subject to Christ", and when we are so, we are free from our own wills.<a name=303:8></a> The husband is the head of the wife, and thus Christ is to us, we are married to another that we should bring forth fruit unto God.<a name=303:9></a> If we keep His commandments, it is a proof of the will being subjugated, and the evidence of loving Christ is that we keep His commandments, and that means the practical surrender of our will; the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all were dead: "and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves [for their own will], but unto him which died for them, and rose again".<a name=303:10></a>

		The Holy Spirit descended at Pentecost and formed the saints into one body, "by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether .<a name=304:9></a>.<a name=304:10></a>.<a name=304:11></a> Jew or Gentile, whether .<a name=304:12></a>.<a name=304:13></a>.<a name=304:14></a> bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=304:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Connected with this there is another truth, and that is, that the one body is <i>Christ's</i> body, and the idea of that shuts out the notion of pre-eminence in any one member.<a name=304:16></a> It is a body of which Christ is the Head, and this shuts out the idea of any other head.<a name=304:17></a> I refer to what was going on among the Corinthians; they were divided into parties following party leaders, and the apostle asserts that they are Christ's body, and in that <i>Christ alone</i> is pre-eminent, not even an apostle could claim pre-eminence in that body.<a name=304:18></a>

		Now we all learnt these lessons in recognising the presence of the Spirit here, the existence of the one body, and the fact that that body is Christ's body; when we come together, we own that Christ is Head -- He is pre-eminent.<a name=305:1></a> When we speak of Christ as Lord it is as He is presented to us on God's side, in the administration of the kingdom; but as Head, He is on our side, one with us, the Firstborn among many brethren; but there is no more difficult lesson for us, than to give Christ His place as identified with us.<a name=305:2></a> In the assembly where He leads the praises, He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren".<a name=305:3></a> He takes thus a place in identification with His brethren down here.<a name=305:4></a> He, the Sanctifier, and the sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=305:5></a> It is in that light that we have Him in the assembly; in the purpose of God, Christ is the centre of all on our side, He becomes the leader of the praises of the universe.<a name=305:6></a> He has not only the place of Lord and Administrator, but of Head as identified with man, where He can say, "in the midst of the assembly will I sing praise unto thee", "my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation".<a name=305:7></a> Now this is what we apprehend when we are sensitive to the presence of the Spirit, which we are not until the nurture and discipline of the Lord have been effective in us.<a name=305:8></a> The place that Christ has taken in connection with man down here according to the purpose of God is wonderful.<a name=305:9></a> He is the Mediator, but He has the place too of Head, as the Firstborn of many brethren; He is the Leader of our salvation -- our Joshua -- the Good Shepherd who leads His flock in.<a name=305:10></a> Christ is Head to the church, as the husband is head of the wife -- they are one, so Christ and the church are one; now that is what the kingdom leads to.<a name=305:11></a> So long as we are here, we never pass away from under the hand of the Lord; we are under His discipline, that we might give more place to the Spirit and be led into that into which the Spirit leads.<a name=305:12></a>

		RECONCILIATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will tell you the great idea of reconciliation -- reconciliation means the removal of moral distance.<a name=383:1></a> God has by the judgment of sin removed the distance that existed between Himself and man by reason of sin.<a name=383:2></a> He was the only One who knew the distance or could measure it, and He has removed it.<a name=383:3></a> When Adam and Eve were turned out of Paradise, although God clothed them in coats of skin, yet the distance was immeasurable and so far as man was concerned, irremediable.<a name=383:4></a> Man had fallen under the power of sin, and the distance between God and man was infinite.<a name=383:5></a> When I come to the ministry of reconciliation, I find that all that is gone.<a name=383:6></a> It is not that man has bridged the distance, nor has God bridged the distance, but God in grace has removed it.<a name=383:7></a> If you want to know the great proof that the distance is gone, it is that He has raised Christ, who was made sin, from the dead.<a name=383:8></a> There could be no resurrection to life if sin had not been put away -- that is perfectly certain, because resurrection is the annulling of the sentence of death, and the sentence of death could not have been annulled if sin, which brought death in, had not first been put away.<a name=383:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral settlement of the question of sin was upon the cross, where Christ was made sin, and death did not come in till sin had been completely put away as before God.<a name=383:10></a> Christ appeared "once in the end of the world, .<a name=383:11></a>.<a name=383:12></a>.<a name=383:13></a> to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself".<a name=383:14></a> Therefore, when Christ died, the first thing that came to pass was that the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.<a name=383:15></a> It was not that man went in to God, but the wonderful thought is that the distance between God and man was so completely gone that God could come out to man.<a name=383:16></a> It was not man getting back to the garden of

		<a name=384>[Page 384]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eden; man never could get back that way; God placed cherubim and a flaming sword that kept the way of the tree of life.<a name=384:1></a> But in the cross God comes out in grace to man, because He has annulled by Christ the distance that existed between Himself and man.<a name=384:2></a> That is what was done by the cross; that was the effect of Christ being made sin.<a name=384:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having spoken about reconciliation, I want now to convey a general idea of the purpose of it, what the great end of reconciliation as to persons is; and you will see how it connects itself with the thought of man going into the holiest.<a name=384:4></a> The first thought in reconciliation is that God may have His pleasure in man: the other is that man may joy in God.<a name=384:5></a> The apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, "We .<a name=384:6></a>.<a name=384:7></a>.<a name=384:8></a> joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation".<a name=384:9></a> The reception of the reconciliation, the knowledge that God has annulled the distance that stood between Himself and man, enables us to joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=384:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will give you just one illustration of it which is so perfectly simple and familiar that no one can miss the idea; that is, the case of the prodigal son.<a name=384:11></a> He was reconciled outside the house, but he was brought into the house in order that the father might have his delight in him, that he might be there to the father's entire pleasure and satisfaction, and that he might joy in the father.<a name=384:12></a> That is the good and gain of reconciliation, and really that is the great thought of the holiest of all.<a name=384:13></a> The prodigal must have been delighted at the thought of what his father was to him, but his delight was not greater than the father's delight; the father was delighted to have the prodigal at his table.<a name=384:14></a> I cannot press it too strongly that reconciliation means that distance is gone, and the good and gain of reconciliation is first on God's side, that He may have His pleasure in man, and then on our side, that we may joy in God.<a name=384:15></a> You will understand, I think, why I connect it with the thought of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=385>[Page 385]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the holiest of all.<a name=385:1></a> Where reconciliation is apprehended you get a worshipping company.<a name=385:2></a> You could not worship God acceptably unless you first knew that God has His pleasure in you, and your delight is in God.<a name=385:3></a> The Lord lightens up the subject of worship in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=385:4></a> He says, "the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him".<a name=385:5></a> When I know that it has been the Father's pleasure to call me into the place of a child which I occupy before Him, and my joy is thus in the Father, then it is I can understand worship; but I cannot understand worship apart from the holiest.<a name=385:6></a> The holiest is where the glory of God is, where His perfect satisfaction rests.<a name=385:7></a> Heaven is a place, but you cannot talk of the holiest as being a place, it is a moral thought.<a name=385:8></a>

		Reconciliation is God-ward, it is what is effected for God.<a name=385:9></a> The High Priest is toward God; ministry is for God, but the covenant is for man: Christ "hath .<a name=385:10></a>.<a name=385:11></a>.<a name=385:12></a> obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant", that is toward man, but reconciliation is something effected for God in the universe; the saints are looked at as the first-fruits of reconciliation, Christ comes in as the beginning on that line and the church comes in also; but reconciliation goes out wider, it says that He might "reconcile all things".<a name=385:13></a> It is helpful to understand the two terms: in the covenant God gets His place with us; in reconciliation Christ gets His place with us.<a name=385:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this passage <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a> - 23 there are three thoughts: (1) the Head; (2) reconciliation; and (3) the body.<a name=385:15></a> In the beginning of the passage Christ is the Head of the body, then later in the chapter it says "for his body's sake, which is the church .<a name=385:16></a>.<a name=385:17></a>.<a name=385:18></a> Christ in you, the hope of glory".<a name=385:19></a> The effect of reconciliation is this, it brings Christ under the eye of God in the saints.<a name=385:20></a> It really began when Christ was on the earth, "God was in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Christ was here, His presence meant complacency -- "Glory to God in the highest, .<a name=386:5></a>.<a name=386:6></a>.<a name=386:7></a> on earth peace, good pleasure in men", that was really what was in the coming of Christ here.<a name=386:8></a> We see it more clearly at the cross and in resurrection; at the cross the distance was most marked, but in resurrection there is the utmost complacency.<a name=386:9></a>

		What follows on the mention of reconciliation in Romans is that there is one man under the eye of God.<a name=386:10></a> Distance could only be removed by death, the removal of the man.<a name=386:11></a> In principle all is effected in the death and resurrection of Christ (reconciliation brings in what is God-ward, and therefore you get in the next chapter, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>, that the saints are risen together with Christ and quickened with Him).<a name=386:12></a>

		Paul speaks about the <i>word</i> of reconciliation.<a name=386:13></a> Reconciliation was effected for God in the death and resurrection of Christ, now it has to be made good in us.<a name=386:14></a> The word of it is the testimony of it; you have the testimony of what has been effected, and that is what is used to effect the reality of it in the saints, which is "Christ in you, the hope of glory".<a name=386:15></a> When Christ was here it was the <i>ministry</i> of reconciliation, you could not have the <i>word</i> of it then.<a name=386:16></a> When Christ was here the eye of God rested upon Him, and God had perfect complacency with what Christ was.<a name=386:17></a> It was a new departure, the second Man was under the eye of God instead of the first man: God was not imputing trespasses.<a name=386:18></a> In the death of Christ you get the removal of the first man to the glory of God.<a name=386:19></a> The apostle exhorts the Corinthians to be reconciled to God; they had not really

		In the Old Testament we have atonement, in the New Testament we have reconciliation.<a name=387:6></a> In the Old Testament God was dealing with man on the ground of law and responsibility, therefore we get atonement; but in the New Testament God is dealing with state, God goes to the bottom of things, and that brings in reconciliation.<a name=387:7></a> You could not have reconciliation without atonement; we have atonement, but that does not fully meet the case.<a name=387:8></a> In reconciliation one thing is removed that something else may take its place.<a name=387:9></a> There must be atonement, for in all gospel testimony God is dealing with man on the ground of responsibility, therefore you get atonement, and God offering forgiveness of sins; but we know very well that man's state is a great point, and for that we must have reconciliation.<a name=387:10></a>

		was here upon earth, He was here in the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=393:1></a> It was the outset of it: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=393:2></a> The fact is that the very presence of Christ here meant reconciliation.<a name=393:3></a> It meant that God had removed the distance that stood between Him and man, and in the coming of Christ all stood for Him on a new basis.<a name=393:4></a> Man was approached on wholly different ground, and that was in view of the death of Christ; but the fact remains that God was approaching man down here in the Person of Christ.<a name=393:5></a> If God had imputed trespasses, there could not, of course, have been reconciliation; but when Christ was here, God was not imputing trespasses.<a name=393:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the <i>word</i> of reconciliation.<a name=393:7></a> The force of "word" is testimony, and the testimony of reconciliation was, that in the death of Christ the moral distance between God and man had been completely and eternally removed for God's glory in the judicial end of man in the cross; and further, God had made the very removal of man to be the occasion of the expression of His love.<a name=393:8></a> Love has come in where distance was.<a name=393:9></a> That is what the cross meant.<a name=393:10></a> All that was effected, so to speak, in a moment in the death of Christ.<a name=393:11></a> Now, the apostle says, God "hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=393:12></a> In accepting the light of the cross, people received reconciliation.<a name=393:13></a> Now this connects itself with the truth of new creation.<a name=393:14></a> If there was not new creation, one could not be in the full enjoyment of God's love.<a name=393:15></a> But new creation is there, and in virtue of it we are in the enjoyment of reconciliation; conscious on the one hand, that the infinite distance that existed between God and man has been removed in the death of Christ to the glory of God, and that in the place of the distance there is love.<a name=393:16></a> God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=393:17></a> You have to remember that when the

		It is plain that new creation and reconciliation are very intimately connected.<a name=394:3></a> No one could enjoy the thought of reconciliation if there were not new creation.<a name=394:4></a> The christian is thus a man of another order; he is after the order of Christ.<a name=394:5></a> "As the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones".<a name=394:6></a> He is according to God, and, as being according to God, he can enjoy the thought of reconciliation, and this is as being of God.<a name=394:7></a> The apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>"we .<a name=394:8></a>.<a name=394:9></a>.<a name=394:10></a> joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation".<a name=394:11></a> I do not believe that any christian can be in the enjoyment of reconciliation but as being in the apprehension of the love of God.<a name=394:12></a> The very presence of Christ here was the expression of His love.<a name=394:13></a> It shewed that God had no pleasure in the distance.<a name=394:14></a> And there was the blessed testimony, divinely given, down here, of divine love.<a name=394:15></a> The Lord bore testimony that "God so loved the world".<a name=394:16></a> In the cross the distance was removed, and in the place of the distance we find the love.<a name=394:17></a> You get an illustration of it in the parable of the prodigal son in his coming back to the father.<a name=394:18></a> The distance was gone, and the love was there, and that marks properly our relation with God.<a name=394:19></a>
