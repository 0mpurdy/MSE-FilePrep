		It is not a very difficult matter to spell out christianity from the Old Testament, though we could not do this if God had not given to us of His Spirit; but by the Spirit it is not difficult to see in Scripture that God had from the outset all His ways before Him.<a name=1:1></a> Nothing comes unexpectedly to Him.<a name=1:2></a> There was no question with God as to what He was going to do right through.<a name=1:3></a> No plan of God is affected by what men do.<a name=1:4></a> He knows perfectly what they are going to do.<a name=1:5></a> The prophet Isaiah made known that Israel would reject Christ when He came to them.<a name=1:6></a> I have turned to this particular scripture as showing that although the Old Testament is not dealing with christianity, but with things on earth and the people of God -- Israel, and all connected with them, yet undoubtedly by the Spirit you can see that God had other things in His mind connected with Christ when the Spirit of God indited it.<a name=1:7></a> This particular chapter speaks of what Christ is at the present time.<a name=1:8></a> The apostle Paul takes it up in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>to the people at Antioch in Pisidia.<a name=1:9></a> He found the Jews perverse and opposed to all he had to say, then he turned to the gentiles to present Christ to them, and for justification in what he did he takes up the verse in this chapter, "I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth".<a name=1:10></a> And so elsewhere the apostle says, "I heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee".<a name=1:11></a> He quotes that in the second epistle to the Corinthians and gives it a present application, he says, "behold <i>now</i> is the accepted time; behold, <i>now</i> is the day of salvation".<a name=1:12></a> Now it is certain that what is spoken in this chapter in Isaiah had no reference to any then living.<a name=1:13></a> The circumstances predicted had not

		come to pass, when Isaiah wrote, and the chapter could have no reference to Isaiah.<a name=2:1></a> Isaiah was never set for a light to the gentiles or to give salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=2:2></a> He was never employed of God to raise up the dispersed of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel.<a name=2:3></a> He was employed to speak beforehand of the One who would do it.<a name=2:4></a> He predicted what would come to pass, and a vast deal of the prophecy of Isaiah has reference to Christ.<a name=2:5></a> There is scarcely any prophet that speaks so much of Christ as Isaiah.<a name=2:6></a> All the prophets in some way have testified to Christ, but none are so full of the history of Christ as Isaiah.<a name=2:7></a> This part of the book particularly foresaw the great controversy which God would have with His people Israel in regard to Christ.<a name=2:8></a> The Spirit of God foresaw in Isaiah as in Simeon, that Christ would be presented to the people and be rejected, and so we have the controversy between God and Israel in regard to Christ taken up.<a name=2:9></a> I am speaking, supposing that what we get here is prophetic, and refers not to the prophet nor to anybody short of Christ; that is, that God had Christ in view.<a name=2:10></a> We get in the chapter a kind of dialogue.<a name=2:11></a> On the one hand Christ is Himself pleading certain things, and has the answer of Jehovah.<a name=2:12></a> Christ says, "And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me, And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified".<a name=2:13></a> Again in verse 4, "Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgement is with the Lord, and my work with my God".<a name=2:14></a> Then again in verse 5, "And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength".<a name=2:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very terrible thing that the Lord should have had to say that He had spent His strength for nought and in vain.<a name=2:16></a> Outwardly there was little result from the ministry

		of the Lord when He was here, and yet He could retire on this, that His judgement was with Jehovah and His work with His God; that is, He left everything in the hand and judgement of His God.<a name=3:1></a> I suppose all here are more or less familiar with what is recorded in the gospels, that is the ministry of Christ; and so you can understand the language which the Lord employs here as to the outward results of His work.<a name=3:2></a> Men in general, in regard to their work, want to see some great and apparent result.<a name=3:3></a> Man wants something to show, perfectly natural.<a name=3:4></a> Very few of us would like it otherwise.<a name=3:5></a> You do get many people content to labour on diligently and not concerned as to what will be the apparent result.<a name=3:6></a> The thought of reputation undoubtedly has a great place with men.<a name=3:7></a> While men are sometimes content not to get much result in the present, yet they look for reputation.<a name=3:8></a> But we do not find the Lord labouring for reputation.<a name=3:9></a> He was labouring not only for the benefit of man, but for the will of God, and yet, in regard to that, He had to say, "I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain".<a name=3:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will speak a little of the answer that He gets, "And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength".<a name=3:11></a> We know that Israel was not gathered, but scattered; when the Lord was about to suffer He took up a word from Zechariah, "smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered".<a name=3:12></a> That came to pass.<a name=3:13></a> The shepherd was smitten and the sheep scattered, and if the sheep were scattered, in due time the nation was scattered.<a name=3:14></a> God did not intend the sheep to be scattered and the nation gathered.<a name=3:15></a> There was a little gathering, I admit, but it was not the gathering of Israel.<a name=3:16></a> It was the gathering of a few who were brought into a new association, that is into the church.<a name=3:17></a> We find that in the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles -- a little company that the Lord had attracted to Himself -- the Spirit descended on them, for Christ had become

		glorious in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=4:1></a> Christ was at the right hand of God.<a name=4:2></a> When Scripture speaks of the right hand of God it means something.<a name=4:3></a> In a kingdom who is at the right hand of the king?<a name=4:4></a> The queen sits usually at the right hand of the king, because it is the most distinguished place of honour and glory.<a name=4:5></a> Now Christ sits at the right hand of God, and He is glorious, whatever He may be in the eyes of man, and certainly He is not glorious in the eyes of man now.<a name=4:6></a> The world is a place of free opinion, and men have very different ideas in regard of Christ, but whatever men may think, yet He is glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, and His God is His confidence.<a name=4:7></a> The Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost to report the glory of Christ.<a name=4:8></a> Now if He is glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, He is the true Israel.<a name=4:9></a> The fact is that when the Lord Jesus was here upon earth He represented Israel under the eye of God.<a name=4:10></a> When He was born He had to go down to Egypt in order that the prophecy might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=4:11></a> He represented Israel in the eye of God, and hence if Christ be glorious in the eye of God it involves the ultimate restoration of Israel.<a name=4:12></a> It is a great point that He should be glorious, though Israel was not gathered, in the eye of God.<a name=4:13></a> Israel was really hid in Christ, and the work which Christ has accomplished holds good for Israel.<a name=4:14></a> He took up the liabilities under which Israel was, and met them, and, as we read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, all Israel shall be saved; really hanging on the fact that Christ is glorious in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it very important that the church should be distinct in maintaining the hope of Israel.<a name=4:16></a> The Jews are all over the face of the earth, but to a very large extent have given up their hope, they are content to accept things as they are in the world, and to make the best of them; but their hope is maintained by the Spirit of God in christians, that is in those who know that Christ is glorious in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=4:17></a> No greater mistake has been made than for any nation upon earth to assume to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		a particularly favoured people with God.<a name=5:1></a> There is no particular people with God nationally at the present time, except the church.<a name=5:2></a> There may be the claiming of the position of Israel, but I do not think God will allow the claim.<a name=5:3></a> It is not according to truth.<a name=5:4></a> If you look at verse 6, "And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth"; you will see that the early part of this verse is confirmatory of what I have said, viz.<a name=5:5></a>, that the ultimate restoration of Israel is dependent on Christ being glorious in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=5:6></a> The tribes are to be raised and preserved, and Simeon takes that up in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>, when he held the child Jesus in his arms and said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel".<a name=5:7></a> He was content to depart when he had seen Jehovah's Christ.<a name=5:8></a> The very fact of Christ being glorious is the pledge of the restoration of Israel, and the One who will be employed of God to bring that about will be Christ Himself.<a name=5:9></a> It is a great thing to hold by this, and to entirely abandon any false position.<a name=5:10></a> If it was the purpose of God to recognise Israel as His people upon earth, God will hold to His purpose, and will most infallibly bring it to pass by Christ.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we get another thing coming in; God says, I have set Thee a light to the nations, that is, the nations in contrast to Israel, "that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth".<a name=5:12></a> Simeon takes up that thought in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>.<a name=5:13></a> He says, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles".<a name=5:14></a> The apostle also takes it up, as we have seen, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>.<a name=5:15></a> It would be a terrible thing if one could not see the restoration of Israel.<a name=5:16></a> It would be as though God had taken up something, and that something had failed.<a name=5:17></a> We may be quite sure that what God has taken up He will

		certainly bring to result and that although it may be clouded for a moment, yet God will not be baffled in anything which He has contemplated.<a name=6:1></a> Only one word more in regard to it: in the tabernacle, if you remember, there was the golden table and on the table twelve loaves; those twelve loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=6:2></a> The twelve loaves were borne on the golden table, and what does that mean?<a name=6:3></a> It means that instead of Christ being borne by the twelve tribes, the twelve tribes were borne by Christ.<a name=6:4></a> The high priest in Israel bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on the breastplate which covered his heart.<a name=6:5></a> All that involves restoration.<a name=6:6></a> But in the meantime Christ is a light to the gentiles and God's salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=6:7></a> I present these two thoughts because they are extremely important to us.<a name=6:8></a> One great property of light is to bring things into view.<a name=6:9></a> In the darkness of the night you do not see anything, but when the sun rises everything comes into view.<a name=6:10></a> So it was in regard to the gentiles.<a name=6:11></a> The gentiles in a sense had got out of the sight of God.<a name=6:12></a> They were lost in idolatry and darkness, degradation and debasement.<a name=6:13></a> But Christ was a light of the gentiles.<a name=6:14></a> That is, the gentiles were to be brought into the view of God.<a name=6:15></a> It is in that sense that I understand that Christ is a light of the gentiles.<a name=6:16></a> Simeon says, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles" that is to bring the gentiles into view.<a name=6:17></a> We get mercy for us poor gentiles.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point is, Christ is salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=6:19></a> Light stands in contrast to darkness, and salvation in contrast to bondage, and God could present Christ as salvation to the nations because in Christ is an outlet from the bondage in which man is found.<a name=6:20></a> I want to make that point plain.<a name=6:21></a> If there were no bondage there would be no occasion for salvation, but there is bondage and hence there arises the necessity for salvation.<a name=6:22></a> We have an illustration of it in the case of Israel.<a name=6:23></a> They were in bondage in Egypt to Pharaoh and his taskmasters, and because they were in bondage there was necessity for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		salvation.<a name=7:1></a> Hence it was that God came out in the character of a Saviour to Israel, to save them from their bondage.<a name=7:2></a> Now in regard to the gentiles, there were three things that marked them.<a name=7:3></a> One was lawlessness, a second was hatred, and a third darkness.<a name=7:4></a> That is where man really abode.<a name=7:5></a> It was true in regard of Israel when the Lord came.<a name=7:6></a> He found Israel lawless, hateful and hating one another and in moral darkness.<a name=7:7></a> They had not taken advantage of the opportunities God had given them.<a name=7:8></a> But when Christ was here there was an outlet from the bondage and that outlet was Himself, and persons here and there found it.<a name=7:9></a> Zacchaeus found it, the disciples found it, and others, too.<a name=7:10></a> In the company of Christ they ceased to be lawless, they ceased to be hateful and hating, and were not in darkness for they came into the light of the revelation of God.<a name=7:11></a> The same became true in regard to the gentiles.<a name=7:12></a> The Greeks and the barbarians were lawless.<a name=7:13></a> Their minds were blinded; they were idolators; they had no real ideal of a moral being; their gods conveyed immoral ideas; they had no idea of a living God or of righteousness or holiness.<a name=7:14></a> They were sunk in degradation, each nation doing its own will, and debased by idolatry.<a name=7:15></a> It has been said very often that idolatry was a deification of the lusts to which men are prone, and men got religious sanction for the lusts of the human heart, and it had a most fearful effect in regard of man.<a name=7:16></a> Men certainly did not love one another very much.<a name=7:17></a> There was no love to spare in the darkness of idolatry.<a name=7:18></a> In that state of things you might have found traces of natural affection, but in the general relations between men, they were hateful and hating one another, being morally in darkness because they had no light in regard to God.<a name=7:19></a> What has now come to pass is that Christ is light.<a name=7:20></a> The gentiles have come into the view of God and Christ is salvation to the gentiles.<a name=7:21></a> The judgement of God is held back in consequence of Christ having come in.<a name=7:22></a> When Christ came and was rejected, judgement might well have come in when the condition of man was taken into account;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but instead of that, what has come to pass is that Christ is salvation.<a name=8:1></a> Judgement is stayed and, in the place of the judgement of God, what marks the present moment is an acceptable time and a day of salvation.<a name=8:2></a> And the reason of it is that Christ at the present time stands to the gentiles in the position of a light to bring them into the view of God, and there is salvation to them so that they may escape from the bondage in which men are, as the result of lawlessness having come into the world.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is the gain of it to us?<a name=8:4></a> We have to get everything by Christ.<a name=8:5></a> It is only by Christ that the gentiles have come into the view of God.<a name=8:6></a> Had it not been for Christ we had all been idolators to this day.<a name=8:7></a> Whatever course the world might have taken I could not say, but, apart from Christ, as far as we can conjecture, we would be abiding in the darkness.<a name=8:8></a> We would have been hid away from God in the darkness of idolatry.<a name=8:9></a> Judaism never dispersed the darkness, nor philosophy; and my impression is that if christianity had not came in, there would not have been science, for science is an outcome of the liberation of the mind by the light of christianity.<a name=8:10></a> Judgement is stayed and the hand of God held back by the fact of Christ having come in.<a name=8:11></a> Christ is the head of every man.<a name=8:12></a> The present moment is a remarkable moment, an accepted time, a day of salvation, because Christ is an escape from the conditions which are prevalent in the world.<a name=8:13></a> Now I put it to you.<a name=8:14></a> How far have we escaped?<a name=8:15></a> How far are you free from lawlessness?<a name=8:16></a> I will tell you what righteousness means; it means to be bound to Christ, or, to use a scriptural figure, to be married to Christ.<a name=8:17></a> If you are married to Christ, you are no longer lawless but in righteousness, and the proof of that is that you practise righteousness.<a name=8:18></a> We have no proof whatever of anyone being joined to Christ except in that they practise righteousness.<a name=8:19></a> A true wife shows that she is a true wife by doing the works which please her husband.<a name=8:20></a> If she does not, she does not give much proof that she is a true wife; and so in regard of us we prove that we are married

		to Christ by the practice of God's will and not our own will, in this world.<a name=9:1></a> God has left us here to that end.<a name=9:2></a> You will remember the admonition to the Romans in chapter 12, to yield their bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which was their reasonable service; then it adds, "And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God".<a name=9:3></a> I have a question for all here.<a name=9:4></a> Have you been exercised to find out what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God?<a name=9:5></a> You can find it out if you desire.<a name=9:6></a> God will certainly enlighten you if you wish to be enlightened.<a name=9:7></a> Now we have to prove that will.<a name=9:8></a> It is no good talking or speculating about it.<a name=9:9></a> The thing is to prove it.<a name=9:10></a> If it were not possible to know it we could not prove it, but if it be possible to know it we can prove it, and are left here to that end, and in proving it we find that we are no longer lawless but joined to Christ.<a name=9:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Christ is salvation from the hatred that is in the world, for if you come under the influence of Christ the effect will be that you will find yourself in fellowship with other christians and will come into an atmosphere not of hatred, but of love.<a name=9:12></a> The Lord enjoined the disciples that they were to love one another as He had loved them.<a name=9:13></a> He left a little company on earth for that.<a name=9:14></a> Love was the atmosphere of that circle, and when others entered into that circle they found themselves in salvation, that is from the hatred that prevailed in the world; and so too in regard to the other point to which I have alluded.<a name=9:15></a> In coming where the Spirit of God was, that is to the circle which Christ formed, they came into the light of God, for if the Spirit of God were there, the light must be there.<a name=9:16></a> They came into the house of God, and were saved out of darkness, so that Christ had become salvation to the gentiles; salvation from lawlessness, from hatred and from darkness.<a name=9:17></a> It is an accepted time and a day of salvation, and it is a great thing for us if we have found Christ to be all that.<a name=9:18></a> Each one must enter into

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:11">Hebrews  4:11</a> - 13, we have the admonition, "Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.<a name=28:2></a> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=28:3></a> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do".<a name=28:4></a> Here we get the word of God, that is the revelation of Himself.<a name=28:5></a> I take it that in the highest sense Christ is the word of God, but the word of God is in the believer by the Spirit.<a name=28:6></a> The word of God is presented as testimony to all men, but in the believer the word of God is living.<a name=28:7></a> I do not understand the word of God to be living except in the believer.<a name=28:8></a> When it comes into contact with man prepared for it by the work of God, that is, born again, then the word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword.<a name=28:9></a> Nothing can be more vitally important to us than the word of God in us, because it is the revelation of God in His mind in regard to us, and therefore the effect is to put everything in place in us, and you cannot get things put in place in any one except by the word of God.<a name=28:10></a> To begin with, the word of God makes God known to us in His grace, and, therefore, God has a right in regard to us that we should be here for His will.<a name=28:11></a> Then the word of God makes Christ known to us as Head, so that we should be guided by Christ who is wisdom to us.<a name=28:12></a> You get that thought in the last verses of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>, "who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption".<a name=28:13></a> Christ is to us wisdom, that we should be guided by Him.<a name=28:14></a> My point is that when the word of God is living in the believer, the effect is that everything is regulated by it; then there is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=29>[Page 29]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the apprehension of every relationship which God has established, and we seek to walk according to the mind of God; hence one can understand the expression we have in John's epistle, "in him verily is the love of God perfected", that is that everything is put in place in the heart of the believer by the word of God, and the love of God is perfected there; so if the word of God regulates everything in me I love God, and I love Christ, and I love fellow christians, and I love my wife and my children, and am in that way faithful in every relationship in which God has been pleased to put me.<a name=29:1></a> That is a very great point.<a name=29:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I venture to say in any man's mind in whom the word of God is not, things are more or less in confusion.<a name=29:3></a> There is something which has not a proper place with that man; for it is the revelation of God and of His mind that puts everything in order in the heart of man.<a name=29:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another effect of the word of God; it discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart; you will find you will be often put sorely to the proof by the word of God.<a name=29:5></a> I can understand it because we are surrounded by many things which are subtle.<a name=29:6></a> Very often there is a tendency to give undue importance to something which is not of great importance.<a name=29:7></a> That is why the apostle says at the end of John's epistle, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols".<a name=29:8></a> A child may be an idol or a house or furniture or a business.<a name=29:9></a> If they come in to maintain any sort of supremacy in the heart and to displace what is due to God they become idols and we are admonished to keep ourselves from idols.<a name=29:10></a> We are to look to it that everything is regulated by the word of God, and what is not according to God is detected by His word.<a name=29:11></a> If a man is getting on in business there is a danger of business becoming an idol to him.<a name=29:12></a> If a man gets his family too much before him there is a danger of his family becoming an idol to him.<a name=29:13></a> Idols may be found in every direction, and they are detected by the word of God.<a name=29:14></a> It will detect in you all that is contrary to God and His will, and the point is so to

	<div class="paragraph">
		give heed to it as that everything in us may be regulated according to God's mind.<a name=30:1></a> I believe that to be a point of primary importance.<a name=30:2></a> "The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow".<a name=30:3></a> It makes a subtle distinction, "and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=30:4></a> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do".<a name=30:5></a> The word of God would be ineffective in us except by the Spirit of God.<a name=30:6></a> He maintains the word in its power in us, and the word of God is the eye of God upon us, so that we walk here under His eye.<a name=30:7></a> I think we ought to be prepared for that, to be conscious as far as one can be, that we do not cherish anything which would contravene any obligation under which God has seen fit to place us.<a name=30:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to speak of the other means.<a name=30:9></a> It says, "Seeing then, that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession".<a name=30:10></a> It is evident that the object of priesthood is that we may hold fast our profession.<a name=30:11></a> The Spirit of God assumes that we may and will be exposed to one thing and another down here which will test us, and in spite of all, we are to hold fast our profession.<a name=30:12></a> I will give you an instance.<a name=30:13></a> Peter professed Christ, but under pressure he denied Christ, and yet in spite of his failure Peter was to hold fast his profession, and to that end the Lord prayed for him, and the intercession of the Lord on behalf of Peter was efficacious.<a name=30:14></a> Now, the same thing holds good in regard to us.<a name=30:15></a> It has been said that the object of priesthood is that we should not sin; I am speaking of sin in the extreme way, which is turning away from Christ; that is sin in Hebrews.<a name=30:16></a> The word of God would not make so much of sin in the detail of life.<a name=30:17></a> It is a wonderful thing that we are in Christ; we are represented in the presence of God; we have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens.<a name=30:18></a> Where do you think the

		high priest has gone to?<a name=31:1></a> He has gone in to represent His people in the presence of God, just as Aaron bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and his heart, so Christ has gone in to God to represent His people before God.<a name=31:2></a> We in England think it might be a great matter to be represented at Court.<a name=31:3></a> A hackneyed expression is, 'A friend at Court', but the christian is represented at Court, he has a Friend at Court, who has passed through the heavens, gone right in to God to represent His people there.<a name=31:4></a> We were speaking some time ago of the great gain of being married to Him that we might bring forth fruit unto God; if it be true that we are in Him by the Spirit, His Word is in us, and He is our High Priest.<a name=31:5></a> He has gone into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us, and as I said before, you have a representative in the very highest place.<a name=31:6></a> Every christian has the right to claim Christ as his representative.<a name=31:7></a> But in the world I might have a representative at Court in some great person who would patronise me but had never entered into the circumstances, difficulties and trials to which I am exposed.<a name=31:8></a> That might very likely be; a man in comparatively humble position might have a friend at Court, but it is unlikely that friend could enter into the circumstances which surround the humble man in the world.<a name=31:9></a> Now in regard to Christ it says, "For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin".<a name=31:10></a> The fact is, that great as is our representative, and He could not be greater, because He is Jesus the Son of God, He has been in the very humble circumstances in which we are found here; hence He can sympathise with our infirmities having been exposed to the very trials to which we are.<a name=31:11></a> You will find the Lord when here continually suffering; it says, "Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses".<a name=31:12></a> He healed people of every kind of sickness and infirmity, but He was Himself suffering all the time.<a name=31:13></a> We find the Lord weeping at the grave of Lazarus in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A strong word is used in regard of the Lord, He "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin".<a name=32:6></a> I have thought that every miracle the Lord did was a trial to Him.<a name=32:7></a> If you had power to work a miracle it would not be a trial to you.<a name=32:8></a> When He put His hand on the leper and healed him, it was a trial to Him, because He felt what the leper was under; so too when He raised the dead.<a name=32:9></a> He had power to do it, but He felt what it was for man to be under the pressure of death.<a name=32:10></a> So too He entered into the humble circumstances in which we are found that He might be able to sympathise with us, while we are still exposed to trial.<a name=32:11></a> So that he can sympathise with our infirmities.<a name=32:12></a> Now, at the right hand of God, in spite of the greatness of His position and of Himself, His heart can be sympathetic with His people down here.<a name=32:13></a> If I am a husband, my heart is sympathetic with my wife.<a name=32:14></a> Every true husband is.<a name=32:15></a> We are said to be married to another, to Him that is raised from the dead, so the heart of Christ is sympathetic with those who are in Him, and that is an immense point.<a name=32:16></a> The practical bearing of it comes out in the admonition that follows, "Let us therefore come

		boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=33:1></a> This means that there is some point in the universe where grace is on the throne.<a name=33:2></a> I think one's own heart has to find where that is.<a name=33:3></a> Grace is in the ascendant, it is on the throne.<a name=33:4></a> We find in the Old Testament the thought of the throne of iniquity.<a name=33:5></a> That is, there will be a point in the world where iniquity will be on the throne; but there is a point in the universe where grace is on the throne.<a name=33:6></a> As the apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, "that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign", and grace is reigning.<a name=33:7></a> Now we need not to search about for it, but to have the truth in the heart; when that is the case you have not much difficulty in finding the throne of grace.<a name=33:8></a> It is largely connected with the position of Christ at the right hand of God, interceding there for us.<a name=33:9></a> The throne of grace subsists and I come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=33:10></a> That is the proof of the sympathy and intercession of Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=33:11></a> You do not get turned away from the throne of grace.<a name=33:12></a> You do not get your petitions rejected.<a name=33:13></a> Your petition may not be answered at the moment and in the way you expect, and the reason is that God is wiser than we are; but in coming to the throne of grace you are not rejected but obtain mercy, that is consideration of your weakness and of the circumstances in which you are, and find "grace to help in time of need".<a name=33:14></a>

		F.E.<a name=34:1></a>R.<a name=34:2></a> The thought in my mind is that there is one and the same way in which we enter into every blessing.<a name=34:3></a> There are many things presented to us in Scripture as blessings, for instance, forgiveness, salvation, reconciliation, eternal life, sonship, but we enter into them all in the same way.<a name=34:4></a> There are three steps marked out in this chapter; if you want to enter into any blessing the first thing is to find that it is in the mind of God; and the second is to see where it is established; the third is the witness of it.<a name=34:5></a> This must be invariably true.<a name=34:6></a> No blessing could reach us except it be in God's mind; there must be a point where it is established, else it would be unreal, unsubstantial; and in the existing state of things we must have the witness of it, for you enter into the blessing and possess it practically by the witness.<a name=34:7></a> These three are quite intelligible principles.<a name=34:8></a> They appear in the early part of this chapter where we get the will of God, the work of Christ, and not only His work, but Himself sitting at the right hand of God; and the witness of the Spirit.<a name=34:9></a> I mention that to give you an idea of what was in my mind.<a name=34:10></a> If we claim to have a blessing, say sonship or eternal life, or anything else, we should be able to give an account of it.<a name=34:11></a> Where does it lie?<a name=34:12></a> How does it come to us?<a name=34:13></a> Where is it established?<a name=34:14></a> and how do we get the good of it?<a name=34:15></a> These are pertinent questions to raise in regard to anything.<a name=34:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thought that one never really understands the import of anything the Lord Jesus did in His ministry on earth except in the light of His death.<a name=91:1></a> That is what I understand the Lord Jesus to have meant in saying to the disciples, do this, that is referring to the Supper, in remembrance of Me.<a name=91:2></a> By His death they were to call Him to mind in His life.<a name=91:3></a> There are two principles to be seen in the death of Christ.<a name=91:4></a> One is the bringing in of God; that is the first and the greatest by far.<a name=91:5></a> The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.<a name=91:6></a> God was brought out in light.<a name=91:7></a> But then there is another principle, and that is the termination of man as after the flesh.<a name=91:8></a> It has been said that the man that was under judgement was removed in judgement.<a name=91:9></a> Christ took all that lay on man by the judgement of God, and in doing so, on the part of God, He removed that man.<a name=91:10></a> So we get such expressions in Scripture as "our old man is crucified with him".<a name=91:11></a> That man was ended for God in the fact that the judgement that lay upon him was borne.<a name=91:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to bear these two thoughts in mind, because you will get the key to everything the Lord Jesus did.<a name=91:13></a> If you attentively follow the miracles and discourses of the Lord, there were always two things in view; one was to bring God in, and the other to shut man out.<a name=91:14></a> The Lord gave no place to man morally, and wherever man set up any kind of pretension the Lord dealt unsparingly with the pretension.<a name=91:15></a> One principle that prevailed throughout the entire ministry of the Lord was the exclusion of man and man's pretensions; but on the other hand what ruled in the discourses and in the miracles of the Lord was the expressing of the rights of God in mercy.<a name=91:16></a> God had visited man in mercy.<a name=91:17></a> He had the right

		to do it, and availed Himself of the right; the Lord was constantly going about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him.<a name=92:1></a> His ministry had that character; healing the sick, cleansing the leper, giving sight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf.<a name=92:2></a> All was the expression of the mercy of God.<a name=92:3></a> If we see the import of the death of Christ, then we understand the character of all the Lord's service and ministry.<a name=92:4></a> I make that remark because I think it will help in that which I have to bring before you.<a name=92:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter shows us a complete change in regard of everything; it is to that I want to draw your attention.<a name=92:6></a> The Lord revealed Himself in a new position; that is, as a centre of gathering, and that is what He came to be.<a name=92:7></a> He came here not simply to minister to man in mercy, but He became man that He might become the centre to which everything of and for God should be gathered.<a name=92:8></a> That is one great thought in connection with the Lord which comes out in this chapter.<a name=92:9></a> Now I want to enlarge a little on how different classes of people were affected by it.<a name=92:10></a> There are three classes of people that come before us in the early part of the chapter.<a name=92:11></a> The first is the friends of Christ; another class is the scribes from Jerusalem, and a third is His brethren.<a name=92:12></a> Everything is dependent on the position the Lord assumes in the early part of the chapter, that is, as a centre of gathering.<a name=92:13></a> What immediately led to it was the Pharisees and Herodians taking counsel to destroy Him.<a name=92:14></a> Evidently that had an effect on the mind of the Lord; consequent on that we have the Lord revealing Himself in a position which He did not assume in the beginning of His ministry.<a name=92:15></a> He was occupied in the two previous chapters with giving testimony.<a name=92:16></a> Do not suppose that the Lord came here to be a climax of or crown to anything that existed.<a name=92:17></a> He came truly according to the promises of God, of the seed of David and of Abraham; but He was a great deal more than that, He was the Son of God in whom God was revealed, the last Adam.<a name=92:18></a> And if He was the last Adam, then of necessity He was the Head

		and centre and point to which everything for God must be gathered.<a name=93:1></a> We find that brought out abundantly in the epistles; for instance, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, we are told that God has made known to us the mystery of His will to gather up in one all things in Christ.<a name=93:2></a> That involves that Christ is the gathering point, and is to a large extent the accomplishment of the truth which comes out in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, that is, all things put under the feet of the Son of man.<a name=93:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I call your attention to two verses, 13 and 14, "And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.<a name=93:4></a> And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach".<a name=93:5></a> You get two distinct things in the verses.<a name=93:6></a> The first is, that the Lord reveals Himself as a gathering point.<a name=93:7></a> What the Pharisees and Herodians did becomes the occasion for revealing the real purpose for which Christ came.<a name=93:8></a> I think many have very inadequate thoughts of Christ.<a name=93:9></a> They have the idea that He was the Messiah of the Jews and came to sit on David's throne; but to get an adequate thought of Christ as man, you must go back to the beginning, for Adam was a figure.<a name=93:10></a> Adam was in position far greater than Abraham or David, but he was only a figure.<a name=93:11></a> The One to come having now come and being the Head of every man, must be the point to which God would gather everything that was for Himself; and that begins to come out here in the place the Lord takes on the mountain.<a name=93:12></a> He leaves the multitude and calls unto Him whom He would and they came to Him.<a name=93:13></a> There was a point of irresistible power and influence in Christ.<a name=93:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we get another point in the next verse, that is, He chose twelve who were to be the vessels of His administration.<a name=93:15></a> There is the principle of administration in Scripture, and it was to be carried out through the twelve.<a name=93:16></a> They were to be with Him, that is, to come morally under His influence and that He might send them forth to preach.<a name=93:17></a> They were to preach under His administration.<a name=93:18></a> That is the position which comes out in this chapter and

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=94>[Page 94]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is important to apprehend it.<a name=94:1></a> It was premonitory of what has come to pass now, for at the present time, at the right hand of God, Christ is constituted the point of gathering.<a name=94:2></a> Everything is to be gathered to Christ; the church, the Old Testament saints, Israel, the nations, everything will be gathered to Christ.<a name=94:3></a> He is the great point of gathering, not now on the mountain, for He has gone up a great way above the mountain to the right hand of God; a power of attraction was in Him; He called unto Him whom He would; there was sovereignty in that way, and they came unto Him.<a name=94:4></a> We can throw now the light of Christ's death upon His life, and see how every act of His life was in view of His death.<a name=94:5></a> One point I may say in regard to that is, that for the Lord to take up such a position as the point of gathering for man, necessitated redemption, because man was under liabilities by the judgement of God, and it would have been impossible for the Lord to gather to Himself those who were under liabilities, save in view of redemption.<a name=94:6></a> The Lord had everything before Himself, and it could only be in view of that the Lord could take up such a position on the mountain, just as now redemption is accomplished, and Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=94:7></a> What is being effected is that men are being gathered to Him by divine power, and they come to Him.<a name=94:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak of the three classes I have referred to.<a name=94:9></a> There are in fact four classes, the multitude is one.<a name=94:10></a> "And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread"; the multitude, His friends, the scribes and His brethren.<a name=94:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable that everybody would entertain their own opinion in regard to Christ, as in the present day people all entertain their idea of christianity.<a name=94:12></a> You may say there are the friends and the enemies of Christ; the scribes were the enemies of Christ.<a name=94:13></a> They wanted to discredit all that He did, and therefore put His work down to the agency of Beelzebub.<a name=94:14></a> Then there is the multitude.<a name=94:15></a> The multitude had no particular opinion.<a name=94:16></a>
	</div>

		<a name=95>[Page 95]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were prepared in a way to be swayed one way or the other, like people in the present day.<a name=95:1></a> The great mass have no judgement of their own.<a name=95:2></a> Then the fourth class comes in, that is His brethren, "whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother and my sister and mother".<a name=95:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to give a present application to these things, not simply to dwell on what took place then.<a name=95:4></a> We have not Christ on the mountain but at the right hand of God, the blessed point of gathering.<a name=95:5></a> Every person converted in the present day is really gathered to Christ, that is what the Holy Spirit is come down for.<a name=95:6></a> He is the point of gathering for individuals.<a name=95:7></a> Hereafter He will be the point of gathering for companies.<a name=95:8></a> All will be gathered to Christ.<a name=95:9></a> Well, now you get His friends coming in, and I think I see the class of His friends in christianity.<a name=95:10></a> You get those who assume to be His friends at the present day, those who would claim Christ for man after the flesh.<a name=95:11></a> One of the greatest dangers is an effort to claim Christ for humanity.<a name=95:12></a> The great truth in regard of Christ is that He is for God.<a name=95:13></a> He died the just for the unjust to bring men to God.<a name=95:14></a> He never came to be an ornament for humanity.<a name=95:15></a> In the same way great preachers are claimed for humanity just as Shakespeare and great minds are regarded as a credit to humanity.<a name=95:16></a> The truth is that Christ came to die that by His death He might open a door to God, and every one who comes to God has to come in by the door that Christ has opened.<a name=95:17></a> There is no way to God except by the death of Christ.<a name=95:18></a> When people were converted in the early days of the Acts of the Apostles they were baptised, and baptism meant burial.<a name=95:19></a> They were buried with Christ, that is, they died to the world and were buried, but at the same time they emerged, so to speak, on the other side, were brought to God.<a name=95:20></a> That is the purpose for which Christ came, that man might accept death, because man was under death, but that he might rise in the power of the Spirit, and in that way be brought to God.<a name=95:21></a> That was the reason for the coming of Christ,

		Now I go a point further.<a name=99:8></a> It is not simply that He has attracted us, but has attached us to Himself.<a name=99:9></a> I use the word "attached" in a sense which is strictly right, but not in the conventional sense.<a name=99:10></a> We use it often in the sense of affection.<a name=99:11></a> I use it in the sense of a bond, as the earth is bound to the sun, or a wife to her husband.<a name=99:12></a> Our attachment to Christ is a great point, it is in order that we might be recovered from lawlessness.<a name=99:13></a> If the earth were to get out of attachment it would become lawless.<a name=99:14></a> Every man who is not in attachment to Christ is lawless because God has appointed Christ to be the centre and sun of the moral universe.<a name=99:15></a> Everybody ought to allow that.<a name=99:16></a> Lawlessness is the ruin of this world, the existing system.<a name=99:17></a> It is on account of lawlessness that God will set aside and judge it, for lawlessness is intolerable to God.<a name=99:18></a> You may have man moral and intelligent and refined, but none of these will subdue lawlessness.<a name=99:19></a> Nothing can set aside lawlessness except the fact of our being in attachment to God's centre, and that is Christ.<a name=99:20></a> He attaches us to Himself by the Spirit.<a name=99:21></a> The Spirit is the bond between Christ and the believer, so that we are recovered from lawlessness.<a name=99:22></a>

		treasures".<a name=150:1></a> If you follow me, you will see how the application of wisdom is very different for God to what it is for man.<a name=150:2></a> The point with God was to accomplish the purposes of His goodness, and Christ was His resource to that end; on the other hand, Christ is wisdom to man, because man being lawless and alienated from God, needed what would direct him into the way of righteousness, what would bring him into the recognition of Christ as Lord.<a name=150:3></a> Now if Christ is wisdom to us, then what appears to me is that He must be accessible to man and that at every step, that is, that He should come within the reach of our appropriation.<a name=150:4></a> If He were not accessible to us, He would not be within the reach of our appropriation.<a name=150:5></a> Now this has all come out in Christ down here, and gone up.<a name=150:6></a> There are three points at which Christ is available to us; the first is in incarnation, the second is in death, and the third is as ascended up where He was before; at every one of those points Christ is wisdom to us, for He is available to us at each, and He furnishes exactly that of which man stands in need.<a name=150:7></a> It would not be any particular wisdom to give man what man does not need.<a name=150:8></a> If a man were to bestow on me a million of money there would not be any wisdom in it, because I do not need it and it would not be any real benefit to me.<a name=150:9></a> Christ has become available to every kind of man to supply to man exactly that of which man stands in need, and therefore He is wisdom to man.<a name=150:10></a> Wisdom is available to us as we apprehend Him at every point, and you see the wonderful grace of God that has made Christ wisdom to us.<a name=150:11></a> The apostle says, God hath made Christ "unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption".<a name=150:12></a> The first point is wisdom because, as I said, the point of wisdom in regard to us is to lead us in the way of righteousness.<a name=150:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now just a word in regard of these three points.<a name=150:14></a> The first point in which Christ is available to us is in that He has become man, to bring into the view of man all the grace that heaven could devise.<a name=150:15></a> That is, the grace that

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ presents to you as become man, if your eyes are opened to apprehend Him as living bread from heaven.<a name=151:1></a> If I say 'all', there is nothing left out.<a name=151:2></a> There is no grace which heaven could devise in regard to man but was presented to man in the living bread come down from heaven; therefore the Lord Jesus said, "he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst".<a name=151:3></a> The manna that came down to the children of Israel in the wilderness was the expression of God's grace to them, but that was only figurative; the Lord says, "Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.<a name=151:4></a> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world".<a name=151:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men had the opportunity of seeing, when the Lord Jesus was here on earth, the disposition of God toward man.<a name=151:6></a> He was like the sun in heaven.<a name=151:7></a> He was the covenant of God, the witness to man of what the thought of God was toward him, and it was goodness and grace beyond all bound.<a name=151:8></a> You get that idea in the miracle with which <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>opens, that is, the feeding of the multitude.<a name=151:9></a> The five loaves and two fishes sufficed not only for the feeding of the multitude, but there was an abundance over.<a name=151:10></a> Now we all know Christ in that light.<a name=151:11></a> I am sure every heart delights in the thought of incarnation, the living bread come down from heaven as witness to man of the grace of heaven.<a name=151:12></a> While man was as perverse and corrupt and contrary as he could be, serving lusts and pleasures, the Lord Jesus Christ became man that He might be available as food to man.<a name=151:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is He gives His flesh for the life of the world.<a name=151:14></a> I have spoken of His being the expression of the grace of God because man needed grace.<a name=151:15></a> The law was no use to man, "the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ".<a name=151:16></a> Man in the condition in which he was wanted grace, and that came by Christ.<a name=151:17></a> But man was also under liabilities by the judgement of God, and needed not only to get light as to the mind of God in

		regard to him, but to be relieved of the liabilities under which he was; and therefore the Lord Jesus says, "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world".<a name=152:1></a> He was about to take up the liabilities under which man was, in order that man might be delivered, and that is the second point at which Christ is available to man.<a name=152:2></a> We eat His flesh and drink His blood, that is, we appropriate in that way the grace which is manifest in the death of Christ.<a name=152:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I go onto another point.<a name=152:4></a> What I have said did not meet the case entirely.<a name=152:5></a> There is another thing which man wanted, and that is, living water, the Spirit, that he might live.<a name=152:6></a> So we get the third point.<a name=152:7></a> The Lord Jesus said, "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?<a name=152:8></a>" Why does He go up where He was before?<a name=152:9></a> He adds immediately, "It is the Spirit which quickens".<a name=152:10></a> It was to give the Spirit to man, that man might be quickened.<a name=152:11></a> There is no good in the flesh, and Christ bore man's liabilities not to set man up again in the flesh, but that He might go on high to impart the Spirit to man.<a name=152:12></a> I trust you will be able to discern how perfectly Christ is wisdom to us.<a name=152:13></a> Read that verse in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, in which the Lord says, "wisdom is justified of all her children".<a name=152:14></a> The woman of the city who was a sinner was an example.<a name=152:15></a> Wisdom became available to her because Christ was there, was the expression of the grace of God, and she availed herself of wisdom, and was a child of wisdom.<a name=152:16></a> She availed herself of the resource that was there.<a name=152:17></a> Simon the Pharisee was not a child of wisdom.<a name=152:18></a> He began to entertain fears and misgivings in regard to the Lord.<a name=152:19></a> Christ was as accessible to him as to the woman, but Simon never availed himself of the wisdom that God placed within his reach.<a name=152:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have all this knowledge of Christ incarnate, the living bread come down from heaven, to express to us the grace of heaven.<a name=152:21></a> We have eaten His flesh and drunk His blood; that is, we have appropriated the One who was offered to take up our liabilities that we might be

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is not one of these points that you can do without.<a name=153:2></a> They go to make up perfect wisdom.<a name=153:3></a> You could not do without an incarnate Christ because if you had not an incarnate Christ, you would not have the light of heaven.<a name=153:4></a> You could not do without the death of Christ because without it you will still be under liabilities; and you could not do without the Spirit, because without Him you would still be in moral death.<a name=153:5></a> Therefore in regard to each point at which I have attempted to present Christ He is an absolute necessity to us, but then He is available at each point, and we have all learned to appropriate Him in that way.<a name=153:6></a> Now I understand the object of it all is to bring us to the Lord.<a name=153:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now I will speak a word or two about the Lord, as the end for which Christ is wisdom to us is to direct us to the Lord.<a name=153:8></a> We confess Christ as Lord with the mouth.<a name=153:9></a> Christ as Lord presents to us the thought of kingdom; that is, I take it, the idea connected with Him as Lord.<a name=153:10></a> As Lord He brings before us the authority of God.<a name=153:11></a> Now I am going to say a word or two about the kingdom.<a name=153:12></a> I dare say people in this country do not know very much about kingdom, but you may get kingdom under the name of a republic.<a name=153:13></a> Kingdom really means government.<a name=153:14></a> In a country where we have a kingdom we have a king.<a name=153:15></a> Where there is a republic they still have a government.<a name=153:16></a> The object of government is this: on the one hand, to provide security for life and property within, and on the other to protect from enemies without.<a name=153:17></a> Of course there may be other things that come within the function of government, but these are the two main objects in establishing kingdom.<a name=153:18></a> Now in the kingdom of God the same principles hold good.<a name=153:19></a> Christ is Lord at the present time, because there is a tender plant down here, and that plant has to be sheltered and secured from evils

		I could not tell you how many times the expression "Lord" occurs in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>.<a name=154:3></a> It is the Lord from beginning to end, and the Lord was providing for the security of His tender plant.<a name=154:4></a> He had it in view.<a name=154:5></a> In the beginning of the chapter we see the power of the Lord, that is, His subduing power; there are two things which mark Christ as Lord; that is, He supports and at the same time He subdues.<a name=154:6></a> Now I think you will find that in human kingdoms.<a name=154:7></a> Human kingdom really means support.<a name=154:8></a> There is support in any well-ordered kingdom for everything that is right.<a name=154:9></a> Kings are not a terror to doers of good, but a support to what is right; and another object in kingdom is to subdue enemies.<a name=154:10></a> Now these two things come out in the Lord: He subjugates and He supports.<a name=154:11></a> You get an instance of it in this chapter in regard to the apostle.<a name=154:12></a> Saul was a great enemy of the tender plant and would have rooted it up if he could.<a name=154:13></a> He hated it, and did all he could against it.<a name=154:14></a> He was the apostle of persecution.<a name=154:15></a> But the Lord did not intend that that plant should be rooted up.<a name=154:16></a> All that was here in the power of the Holy Spirit was very precious in the eye of the Lord, and the Lord protected it, and the way He took to protect it in this instance was in the subjugation of the greatest enemy.<a name=154:17></a> The power of the Lord comes out in subjugating Saul.<a name=154:18></a> The Lord speaks to him from glory and Saul is subdued in a moment.<a name=154:19></a> Very wonderful to think of the power of the Lord.<a name=154:20></a> There are many powers in the world that we regard as being wonderful.<a name=154:21></a> You get a great navy well equipped; it could do wonderful things in the way of destruction: ships sunk and thousands killed and men filled with wonder and admiration at the power that man has; but do you think all the armies or all the navies of the world would ever have subdued Saul?<a name=154:22></a> I do not think they would.<a name=154:23></a> He was a man fearless of death.<a name=154:24></a> But the Lord did in two or three words, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=154:25></a>" There

		Now I was saying the Lord is using the power and authority which belongs to Him to shelter the tender plant that has been planted here.<a name=155:13></a> If you will look at <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:31">Acts  9:31</a>, "Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit were multiplied".<a name=155:14></a> The Lord had allowed persecution to come in to a certain extent.<a name=155:15></a> There had been a great persecution in connection with Stephen, and it had been allowed to go on to a certain point, but persecution is limited.<a name=155:16></a> In speaking to the church at Smyrna the Lord says, "ye shall have tribulation ten days".<a name=155:17></a> Ten days meant a limited period; that is, there was a limitation to the period of persecution; and here the persecution was only allowed to go to a certain extent, and then the Lord comes in in a most extraordinary way to stop it by subduing the persecutor.<a name=155:18></a> You would hardly have thought the Lord would act in that way.<a name=155:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We all want the apprehension of the Lord in that way; and there is another point, and it is this, there is an application of the Lord to us individually.<a name=156:9></a> The Lord comes in, individually subjugating, because He will not tolerate anything in you and me that is contrary to Himself.<a name=156:10></a> The Lord's work is to subjugate every high thought in us, everything which resists Him.<a name=156:11></a> But then, we can be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might; He watches over and strengthens everything in us which is of Himself and we can confront everything down here in the power of the Lord.<a name=156:12></a> You have no reason whatever to be afraid of anything.<a name=156:13></a> There never was a man who was brought face to face with such difficulties as the apostle Paul.<a name=156:14></a> He had to stand in the most difficult and trying circumstances, to meet all the power of the world; at the end of his course he could say, "Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear".<a name=156:15></a> The Lord was here for the sake of the testimony and strengthened the apostle that by him the preaching might be fully known.<a name=156:16></a> The apostle

		My conviction is this, that we are sheltered by the Lord, and not only sheltered but strengthened.<a name=157:2></a> He knows how, in the most unexpected way, to subjugate the power of evil, in our experience we have been brought face to face with the power of evil, I mean collectively, as seeking to walk together in the truth of the church, to difficulties which we could not surmount, and it has been remarkable how the Lord has interfered and has brought down difficulties which appeared to be sometimes insuperable.<a name=157:3></a> The Lord watches carefully over that which is for Himself down here.<a name=157:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:1">Ephesians  2:1</a> - 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=179:1></a> You made a remark in Chicago, that in most of Paul's epistles the way in which Christ is presented is the key to each epistle.<a name=179:2></a> Does that hold true with regard to Ephesians?<a name=179:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=179:4></a>R.<a name=179:5></a> I have no doubt that the light in which Christ is presented in Ephesians gives its character to the epistle.<a name=179:6></a> He fills all in all.<a name=179:7></a> He has "ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=179:8></a> So you get in the prayer in chapter 3, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".<a name=179:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=179:10></a> Would you say that the great thought in Ephesians is the opening up of the counsels of God connected with Christ?<a name=179:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=179:12></a>R.<a name=179:13></a> Yes.<a name=179:14></a> But it is that the church may be here in testimony; the Spirit of God has in view that there should be here a living testimony to God, that what came out in Christ should come out in the church.<a name=179:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=179:16></a> So it is, "Be ye therefore imitators of God".<a name=179:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=179:18></a>R.<a name=179:19></a> It is all on that principle.<a name=179:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=179:21></a> I was going to say if God gives light it is that it might shine out and not be simply for our enjoyment.<a name=179:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=179:23></a>R.<a name=179:24></a> Quite so.<a name=179:25></a> It is for testimony.<a name=179:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=179:27></a> Do the words, "quickened us together with Christ", point to that?<a name=179:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=179:29></a>R.<a name=179:30></a> All is in view of that.<a name=179:31></a> There are three points that come out in the second chapter, the first is salvation, the second is unity, and third is that God is dwelling.<a name=179:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saints are brought into salvation, that is the first point, and is seen in the early part of the chapter.<a name=179:33></a> Then, in connection with that comes in the thought of unity, and, at the same time, God is dwelling here.<a name=179:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=180:1></a> You mean unity in the new man.<a name=180:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=180:3></a>R.<a name=180:4></a> Yes, through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.<a name=180:5></a> "Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God".<a name=180:6></a> And Jew and gentile are builded together for an habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=180:7></a> You cannot get the blessing until you get unity, and you cannot get unity without salvation.<a name=180:8></a> I do not know whether all would quite apprehend this.<a name=180:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=180:10></a> I do not think all do.<a name=180:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=180:12></a> It is very evident from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>that unity comes, and then blessing.<a name=180:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=180:14></a>R.<a name=180:15></a> I think the psalm helps.<a name=180:16></a> In verses 13 to 18 of the previous psalm it says, "The Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation".<a name=180:17></a> We have the thought of habitation.<a name=180:18></a> Then it says, "I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy".<a name=180:19></a> Then you get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>, "Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=180:20></a> .<a name=180:21></a>.<a name=180:22></a>.<a name=180:23></a> for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=180:24></a> I think you can see the line.<a name=180:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=180:26></a> We could not have unity without salvation.<a name=180:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=180:28></a>R.<a name=180:29></a> No.<a name=180:30></a> The thought of God dwelling comes in, and then clothing Zion's priests with salvation.<a name=180:31></a> David had prayed that her priests might be clothed with righteousness, but God says, "I will also clothe her priests with salvation".<a name=180:32></a> So in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, "by grace ye are saved", and then unity, "to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby".<a name=180:33></a> The point is Jew and gentile are one, gentiles are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God.<a name=180:34></a> Then it is you can realise the thought of God dwelling.<a name=180:35></a> "There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore".<a name=180:36></a> The blessing is consequent on Jew and gentile being built together for an habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=180:37></a> That is the line.<a name=180:38></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:2></a>R.<a name=181:3></a> I think so.<a name=181:4></a> Chapter 2 is the testimony.<a name=181:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.W.<a name=181:6></a>H.<a name=181:7></a> So I suppose you reach a higher point in the first chapter.<a name=181:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:9></a>R.<a name=181:10></a> God has made known to us the mystery of His will to head up in one all things in Christ.<a name=181:11></a> Then you get the bearing and application of that in the present time in the second chapter.<a name=181:12></a> That is salvation has come to pass in a very distinct way, "by grace ye are saved".<a name=181:13></a> Stress is laid on that; and then you get the thought of unity, and of God dwelling, Jew and gentile builded together for an habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=181:14></a> That is, <a href="../bible/Psalms.htm#132">Psalms  132</a>and 133 are in a sense fulfilled.<a name=181:15></a> The Psalms close with that.<a name=181:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:19></a>R.<a name=181:20></a> I think it is in God dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=181:21></a> When God dwells here by the Spirit the blessing is commanded.<a name=181:22></a> Everything depends on God dwelling, so the exhortation following on that in the beginning of chapter 4, is to all lowliness and meekness, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=181:23></a> Because God is dwelling you have the blessing brought in.<a name=181:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=181:25></a> It gives the church a wonderful place at the present time.<a name=181:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:27></a>R.<a name=181:28></a> It is all on the principle that we have had so much before us, that everything which comes out in the epistle to the Ephesians is anticipative.<a name=181:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=181:30></a> And it still further confirms what you have often said, that before God brings anything to pass there is always a testimony, and so before there is the accomplishment of these wonderful counsels literally, there is the testimony in the church.<a name=181:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:32></a>R.<a name=181:33></a> Yes, what comes out in the second chapter is that the church has been taken to heaven in order to fulfil the will of God down here.<a name=181:34></a> You are taken to heaven in order that you may understand salvation here.<a name=181:35></a>

		F.E.<a name=182:3></a>R.<a name=182:4></a> I do not think you are fully in salvation until you are taken out of the scene.<a name=182:5></a> Salvation, as I understand it in Scripture, comes out in three connections.<a name=182:6></a> I think it is first in regard of enemies, then in regard of association, and then in regard of place.<a name=182:7></a>

		F.E.<a name=235:12></a>R.<a name=235:13></a> Quite so; but the position of Christ as Head, although it is the security for all that God has done in a way, it is to us secondary to the display of God Himself, His revelation, because the first great thing is the revelation, that is, that God has revealed Himself in righteousness and power.<a name=235:14></a> His glory has so shone out and it is according to that that we have the privilege of knowing God.<a name=235:15></a> I say I know His righteousness in redemption, and His power in raising from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=235:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=236:1></a>R.<a name=236:2></a> I think the object of the epistle to the Romans is the teaching of saints, that is to put things in order in our minds.<a name=236:3></a> It is not something written to those who do not believe.<a name=236:4></a> It is not a kind of gospel preaching, but it is the setting forth of the truth in an orderly kind of way, so that it may take proper shape in the minds of believers, so that you could not exactly base gospel preaching on what you find in the epistle to the Romans.<a name=236:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=236:6></a> Because as you say it is not the setting forth of the gospel to the unconverted.<a name=236:7></a> It is addressing the saints in Rome.<a name=236:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=236:9></a>R.<a name=236:10></a> And intended no doubt by the Spirit to put things in order in their minds.<a name=236:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=236:12></a> I suppose you would say it is great gain to us as believers when we get things put in order in our minds.<a name=236:13></a>

		F.E.<a name=236:14></a>R.<a name=236:15></a> I think we must come to it some time or other.<a name=236:16></a> It may take a long time.<a name=236:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=236:18></a>A.<a name=236:19></a> I suppose that accounts for the way in which baptism is presented in this chapter.<a name=236:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=236:21></a>R.<a name=236:22></a> Quite so.<a name=236:23></a> You see chapters 3 to 5 take up the divine side; then chapters 6 to 8 take up our side.<a name=236:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=236:25></a> I think you said that in chapters 3 and 4 we get the knowledge of God in the way in which God has come out in righteousness and power.<a name=236:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=236:27></a>R.<a name=236:28></a> Quite so.<a name=236:29></a> But then all that is in a Man, and therefore you can understand chapter 5 coming in to show that that Man is the one Man.<a name=236:30></a> I think it is perfectly intelligible, because if God has come out in righteousness and power, revealing Himself that way in redemption and in the resurrection of Christ, of necessity that must give place to the one Man in whom that has all been accomplished, and the latter part of chapter 5 really sums it up

	<div class="paragraph">
		in that way, and shows the place which that Man occupies.<a name=237:1></a> This has to be taken into account; and that is where the gospel has been really very deficient, I mean the preaching of the gospel has been very deficient.<a name=237:2></a> There has been far too much tendency to preach the benefits of the work of Christ, instead of preaching Christ Himself, because really after all, everything depends on the place which that Man occupies.<a name=237:3></a> The truth of God's righteousness and power have come to light, but the secret depends on the introduction of that one Man.<a name=237:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=237:5></a> The second division of chapter 5 makes that very plain.<a name=237:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=237:7></a>R.<a name=237:8></a> Very plain.<a name=237:9></a> The whole moral universe which is before God depends entirely on that Man.<a name=237:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=237:11></a> I suppose the gospel is more the presentation of Christ in His official relationship to man.<a name=237:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=237:13></a>R.<a name=237:14></a> Yes.<a name=237:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=237:16></a> And I can see the force of what you say because in setting forth so exclusively the benefits of the work of Christ we really occupy people with themselves largely, but if you set <i>Him</i> forth you will occupy people with Him.<a name=237:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=237:18></a>R.<a name=237:19></a> Yes, because everything depends on Him, just as in the solar universe everything depends on the sun.<a name=237:20></a> Apart from the sun we get no fertility; everything depends on the influence of the sun and rain; and if there were no sun there would be no system.<a name=237:21></a> It all depends on the sun.<a name=237:22></a> So it is in the moral universe.<a name=237:23></a> Christ is the Sun and centre, and hence it is everything depends on Christ.<a name=237:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=237:25></a> You were saying chapters 6 to 8 are on our side; what do you mean by that?<a name=237:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=237:27></a>R.<a name=237:28></a> Because they take up the question of how we are brought into relation to Christ.<a name=237:29></a> We apprehend the righteousness and the power of God set forth in Christ; that is a question of faith; that is, we apprehend the righteousness of God in redemption, and the power of God in the resurrection of Christ.<a name=237:30></a> That becomes the

		foundation, the knowledge of God in that way.<a name=238:1></a> Now the point comes of the relation in which we stand to Christ.<a name=238:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=238:3></a> So it is no longer a question of faith in Christ.<a name=238:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=238:5></a>R.<a name=238:6></a> No.<a name=238:7></a> Of course the apprehension of God's righteousness and power is a question of faith.<a name=238:8></a> Now we want to understand the relation in which we stand to Christ who is the Centre, the one Man, because there is no other man.<a name=238:9></a> The resurrection of Christ has left every other man in death.<a name=238:10></a> I think we can understand that.<a name=238:11></a> "If one died for all, then were all dead", and the effect of that has been to leave every other man in death.<a name=238:12></a> Really before God there is only one Man.<a name=238:13></a> Till the death of Christ God was dealing with men in a certain sense on the ground of living; that is, He was testing man, but when the death of Christ came in, the death of Christ proved that all were dead, and the resurrection of Christ has left every other man in death except Christ.<a name=238:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=238:15></a> I think it is wonderful if we can get hold of that.<a name=238:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=238:17></a>R.<a name=238:18></a> I think all these chapters, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>to 8, are based on that.<a name=238:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=238:20></a> So it is now altogether a question of our relationship to that one Man.<a name=238:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=238:22></a>R.<a name=238:23></a> But the first thing is what we get in chapter 6, we reckon ourselves alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=238:24></a> We are out of death.<a name=238:25></a> We have gone into death in baptism, but we have come out of death and we reckon ourselves alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=238:26></a> I think the basis of everything is really one Man out of death.<a name=238:27></a> But then He is the appointed attraction to bring a great many more out of death.<a name=238:28></a> "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=238:29></a>
