		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> It is important to apprehend the light in which Christ is presented in this epistle.<a name=1:3></a> Each epistle takes its character from the peculiar light in which Christ is presented in it.<a name=1:4></a> This is very important.<a name=1:5></a> The epistles are quite different from the gospels.<a name=1:6></a> The former give us the light of what Christ is where He is now on high (especially in Paul's epistles); but in the gospels it is what Christ was here on earth.<a name=1:7></a> Testimony is to what is about to be displayed.<a name=1:8></a> The testimony of the Christ is what Christ is in relation to the "all things" -- Christ is Head in Colossians.<a name=1:9></a> He is Head of creation, for He created all, and all were created in view of that; and therefore, if He became man, He must be pre-eminent.<a name=1:10></a> He has creation rights; but there is another ground on which He is Head -- He takes all up on the ground of redemption.<a name=1:11></a>

		We get the same two Headships in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>and 5.<a name=1:12></a> He is Head on creation ground, and also on redemption ground.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The reconciliation of the world is based upon the fact that man is taken up in the Head.<a name=1:21></a> The judgement of God will be brought in because man sets up a rival head instead of accepting the divinely-appointed Head.<a name=1:22></a>

		Express injunctions were given as to how the tabernacle was to be carried, and the arrangement of the people was connected with the tabernacle.<a name=110:16></a> The people could not move an inch without the tabernacle, and if they wanted a resting-place, everything depended on the tabernacle; if they were to go out in conflict, everything depended on the ark of the covenant.<a name=110:17></a> The whole life of the people was bound up now with

		The people could not fail to get the greatest gain from the fact of God dwelling among them; but God dwelt among them, not for their pleasure, but for His pleasure.<a name=111:3></a> That is an immense point to apprehend in regard to God dwelling with men.<a name=111:4></a> I believe it is the pleasure of God, in result, to dwell in the universe.<a name=111:5></a> The universe is to be the house of God; where God will dwell for His pleasure.<a name=111:6></a> The universe will derive the greatest possible gain from this; it will get experience of all the goodness of heaven; but the fact remains that God will dwell there for His own pleasure.<a name=111:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one more point I want to touch upon in regard to the children of Israel: and that is, that though they had the ark of the covenant, they never saw it.<a name=111:8></a> The only people that saw the ark of the covenant were the priests.<a name=111:9></a> It was carefully covered up even before the Levites came forward to carry it.<a name=111:10></a> The people never saw it; they had not boldness to enter into the holiest -- not even the high priest had.<a name=111:11></a> I do not think the priests went into the holiest at all.<a name=111:12></a> The high priest went in once a year; but the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest.<a name=111:13></a> The ark of the covenant sought a resting place for them and led them against their enemies; but at the same time, they never saw it.<a name=111:14></a> There, in a way, the type fails.<a name=111:15></a> I am going to show you how the detail of this chapter is fulfilled in regard to us; but then, we get a great deal more than comes out here, and that is what led me to read the passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>.<a name=111:16></a> We have "boldness to enter"; and the moment you enter the holiest you come into the presence of the ark of the covenant.<a name=111:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak of these things because they indicate steps in Christian experience.<a name=111:18></a> We begin with redemption, being delivered from the power of the enemy and brought into the enjoyment of salvation.<a name=111:19></a> Then we go

	<div class="paragraph">
		on to the recognition that God is dwelling here by the Spirit, that He has a dwelling place in the midst of the assembly in the wilderness; then we go on to another point: we enter the holiest, and there contemplate the ark of the covenant.<a name=112:1></a> That is a great point to come to.<a name=112:2></a> When you come there, you have understanding, and are intelligent according to God.<a name=112:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an important point in the experience of a Christian when he recognises the fact that God is dwelling here.<a name=112:4></a> This fact is clouded to a very large extent in Christendom.<a name=112:5></a> The great bulk of Christians have no idea of the presence of the Spirit.<a name=112:6></a> Evangelical Christians have little idea connected with the Spirit, beyond an influence.<a name=112:7></a> The knowledge that God is dwelling here by the Spirit is limited to a comparatively small number of Christians.<a name=112:8></a> It is sad that it should be so, but the reason of it is intelligible.<a name=112:9></a> Men have tried hard to make Christianity a religion of the world, and the Spirit of God will not connect Himself with the world.<a name=112:10></a> When man came into prominence in Christianity, the Spirit of God was virtually displaced, and men lost the idea of God dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=112:11></a> Men use still the expression, "the house of God"; but the common thought of it is that of a material dwelling place.<a name=112:12></a> The house of God in the true sense is almost entirely lost sight of, and the presence of the Spirit practically ignored.<a name=112:13></a> Do you think that if Christians believed in the presence of the Spirit they would have such things as ordered divine service, clergy, or appointed ministers?<a name=112:14></a> All that belongs to the rudiments of the world, and it goes in a moment when the fact is recognised that God is dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=112:15></a> The recognition of that truth has had the effect of bringing many of us out of the various religious associations in which we were found in the world.<a name=112:16></a> It was a fact of such immense import that we were prepared to break with associations, friends, and even relatives, because of it.<a name=112:17></a> But the

		greater part of us were converted long before we recognised the truth, that God was dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=113:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to point out how the presence of the Spirit is bound up with all our wilderness life.<a name=113:2></a> The assembly is in the wilderness, and the Spirit of God is present, dwelling here, and the Spirit's presence affects every detail of a Christian's life.<a name=113:3></a> In the case of Israel, as we have seen, the arrangement of the tribes was determined by the tabernacle of the congregation; their whole wilderness life and order had reference to the tabernacle of the congregation.<a name=113:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all our order down here is determined by the presence of the Spirit, for Jew and Gentile are builded together for a habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=113:5></a> You can see what the effect of that must have been in early days.<a name=113:6></a> Think of a Jew with a family in the early days of Christianity, and a Gentile with a family, both brought into Christianity -- justified by the faith of a risen Christ and indwelt by the Spirit, they were brought into unity.<a name=113:7></a> Suppose for a moment that the family of the Jew were not converted, yet the Jew had to consort with the Gentile and to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; just imagine what a deadly offence that may have been to the family of the Jew!<a name=113:8></a> And yet, the life of the Jew and the life of the Gentile were determined by the fact that God was dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=113:9></a> The Jew and the Gentile had to regard that, and in spite of family associations and everything else, had to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=113:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same thing holds good in the present day.<a name=113:11></a> In a worldly family one member may be brought into the light of the truth, the recognition of the presence of the Spirit of God, and that person takes a certain course in consequence, that is, can no longer go on with worldly religious associations, but is in fellowship

	<div class="paragraph">
		with people who are to a large extent despised in the world.<a name=114:1></a> What deadly offence that will often cause!<a name=114:2></a> You will see thus how the recognition of the Spirit's presence determines the course of a person here in the world, just as the tabernacle determined the order of Israel.<a name=114:3></a> I suppose the first obligation under which we are in the world is to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=114:4></a> A wife may have to do violence to the feelings of her husband because of that.<a name=114:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I bring these things forward to show that what is set forth here in the type is fulfilled now in the church; our course is ordered in reference to the Spirit, and we have to regard His order.<a name=114:6></a> Just as the twelve tribes were arranged in regard to the tabernacle of the congregation, so we are arranged in reference to the fact that God is dwelling here.<a name=114:7></a> A white man and his slave -- a black man -- may both be converted and brought to recognise the presence of God by the Spirit.<a name=114:8></a> They are to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace -- but what deadly offence that may cause in the world!<a name=114:9></a> The world is framed on a totally different order -- on the order of the pride of man.<a name=114:10></a> Christian life, rightly understood, is framed on the recognition of the presence of God -- God dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=114:11></a> Hence our first obligation is to carry out the order which is consequent upon that.<a name=114:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we are continually in movement, because the wilderness is a place of movement.<a name=114:13></a> In the book of Chronicles David speaks in regard to the Levites that there had been a time when they were occupied in carrying the tabernacle, and now they had come to a place of rest.<a name=114:14></a> David found a resting place for Jehovah, and God saw fit to accept that place; but in the wilderness, the ark of the covenant was rarely quiet -- it was continually in movement.<a name=114:15></a> You could not get a greater expression of divine grace than in

	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust <i>we</i> are continually in movement.<a name=115:3></a> It is a bad sign if we are not.<a name=115:4></a> If there is not continual exercise here, we are settling down into complacency with what is in the world.<a name=115:5></a> The influences of the world are extremely subtle, and where people are successful in, or have adaptability to the world, they are in the greatest danger of succumbing to the influences of the world.<a name=115:6></a> There ceases to be exercise; they settle down on their lees; they have everything their heart can wish.<a name=115:7></a> They forget that the bridegroom is taken away, and that the present time is one of fasting, and not of feasting.<a name=115:8></a> What is suitable to the wilderness is not rest; it is a place of exercise, and almost everything that comes in, in regard to our life down here, if we are at all faithful, tends to bring about exercise.<a name=115:9></a> In endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace many things come before me in my individual path which tend to cause exercise, because they raise the question of fidelity to the Lord.<a name=115:10></a> A possible marriage, an engagement in business, anything down here, will tend to raise the question of fidelity to the Lord in the mind of the saint.<a name=115:11></a> In the detail of Christian life I do not think the Lord will make known to people that He has a particular mind in regard to this detail or that.<a name=115:12></a> People are often exercised as to where they should go to live.<a name=115:13></a> I do not know that the Lord has any particular will in regard to that.<a name=115:14></a> If you want guidance from Him you must have no reservations in your mind; you must not say that a certain place would be prejudicial to health; you must go to Him with your mind as a clean sheet if you want His guidance.<a name=115:15></a> But I think these details are left to Christians, and they are tested by them in fidelity to the Lord.<a name=115:16></a> If we seek to order our way down here with reference to the Lord, I think we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to these things to indicate how true it is that the wilderness is not a place of rest, but of continual exercise; and yet, after all, remember this: God is going before the assembly.<a name=116:2></a> The great point is that we should recognise the presence of the Spirit of God, maintaining us in fidelity to the Lord.<a name=116:3></a> God is going before us now, to find a resting place.<a name=116:4></a> It is a great thing when we come now and again to a resting place.<a name=116:5></a> The idea of a resting place is that exercise ceases for the moment, and we come together to recognise God and His goodness -- that He is amongst us.<a name=116:6></a> There could not be worship while the people were in movement; everything was disturbed; but when the ark came to rest, then there was the opportunity for the service of God, and that is what I understand by the tabernacle resting.<a name=116:7></a> The people got the opportunity of recognising what was due to God in the way of worship.<a name=116:8></a> It may be with us that, during the week, all is exercise; but the Spirit of God leads us to a place of rest.<a name=116:9></a> We cease from exercises, and come into the blessed sense that God is amongst us, to make us conscious of His goodness and the fatness of His house.<a name=116:10></a> It is a point of great moment, in the history of Christians, that we come together in assembly, recognising the fact that God is here of a truth.<a name=116:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is also the testimony of God in the world.<a name=116:12></a> The ark goes forward -- "Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee".<a name=116:13></a> That was one thought connected with the ark of the covenant -- the leading out in conflict that the enemies of the Lord might be confounded.<a name=116:14></a> You will not suppose that I am referring to conflict with men -- it is with spiritual enemies; they are to be confounded, and to flee before the ark of the covenant when Christ leads in the power of His testimony.<a name=116:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now take into account these few simple thoughts.<a name=117:1></a> The fact that God is dwelling here by the Spirit determines our order, and the keeping the unity of the Spirit is of paramount importance.<a name=117:2></a> Then, by the very fact of the Spirit of God being here, we are in continual exercise, and He will keep us in exercise; but at the same time, we are furnished with a moment of rest now and again, and then we follow the ark of the covenant going forward in conflict against the enemies of God.<a name=117:3></a> This is all fulfilled to those who recognise the truth that God is dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=117:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go a point farther.<a name=117:5></a> I want to draw attention to the fact that the people of Israel never saw the ark of the covenant.<a name=117:6></a> There are a great many Christians now who understand the exercises of the wilderness; have had the enjoyment of the resting place; and have an interest in the testimony of the Lord; but it may be that they have never contemplated the ark of the covenant.<a name=117:7></a> I am almost afraid to speak of it, because boldness to enter the holiest is such a wonderful thing.<a name=117:8></a> I read the verses in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>to indicate what we well know, that we have that boldness -- it is open to us to meditate on the ark of the covenant.<a name=117:9></a> Evidently the Hebrews had not got that far, else the apostle would not have spoken to them in the way in which he did, for after making known to them that they had boldness to enter into the holiest, he says, "Let us draw near".<a name=117:10></a> They had not drawn near.<a name=117:11></a> The entering the holiest is to contemplate that which is there.<a name=117:12></a> Now I want to indicate what is there.<a name=117:13></a> So long as the first tabernacle was standing, the way into the holiest was not manifest.<a name=117:14></a> While the first tabernacle was standing, those who served were taken up with the things connected with the future glory of Israel.<a name=117:15></a> The table of shewbread, the candlestick, and the incense altar probably set forth the future glory of an earthly people in connection with Christ.<a name=117:16></a> So long as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=118>[Page 118]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		these were in view, the thought of entering the holiest was not present; but now that the first tabernacle has no standing, all that remains is the holiest of all, and in the holiest of all is the ark of the covenant.<a name=118:1></a> What I understand by the ark of the covenant is the secret of divine ways.<a name=118:2></a> The ark of the covenant conveys to my mind the idea of the great Head out of which the whole system of the world in which God will be glorified is to be evolved.<a name=118:3></a> It is no small thing to contemplate that.<a name=118:4></a> It is the holiest, and you have to be holy according to God in order to contemplate the breadth and length and depth and height of that vast system.<a name=118:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will make that idea a little plainer if I can.<a name=118:6></a> Just contemplate what Christ is.<a name=118:7></a> He came here, the righteous One, who could perfectly glorify God on the earth, and set forth the principles of the kingdom.<a name=118:8></a> He could draw a perfectly defined line between good and evil; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=118:9></a> The position of Christ here upon earth was, that He was establishing the great principles on which the throne of God would be based.<a name=118:10></a> Then He took up at the cross every liability of man, in order that, in His death, He might abolish the lawless man, the man in whom God had been dishonoured, and Himself come in as the Sun of righteousness.<a name=118:11></a> He accomplished redemption, and in doing it abolished that man.<a name=118:12></a> But then, He glorified God, and was raised again from the dead and carried to the right hand of God, far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.<a name=118:13></a> The thought which that brings before us is this, that the whole universe of bliss is to be evolved from Christ, out of the Head.<a name=118:14></a> If He fills all things, there is no room for anything else.<a name=118:15></a> The whole solar universe is filled with the light and heat of the sun, and there is no room for any other light.<a name=118:16></a> The electric light is very poor in the face of the sun.<a name=118:17></a> The only light I know of superior to that of the sun is the light of the Sun of righteousness.<a name=118:18></a> Paul

		first principle of the kingdom undoubtedly is righteousness, and righteousness means dispersion.<a name=122:1></a> There is a remarkable passage in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#112:9">Psalm  112:9</a>, quoted by the apostle in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9:9">2 Corinthians  9:9</a>, as marking the righteous man.<a name=122:2></a> "He hath dispersed; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness endureth for ever".<a name=122:3></a> Now if we are affected by the reality that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom, we shall lay up treasure for ourselves in heaven, not on earth.<a name=122:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going to take up a few details which come out in this chapter, to show what should characterise the friends of Christ down here.<a name=122:5></a> That is the position in which, at the beginning of the chapter, the Lord recognises the disciples: "I say unto you my friends".<a name=122:6></a> The disciples were His friends.<a name=122:7></a> I suppose the meaning of it is that He made known to them His mind.<a name=122:8></a> A man gives his confidence to his friend, and that is exactly what Christ had done to His disciples; He had not treated them as servants, but as friends.<a name=122:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord unfolds, in the beginning of the chapter, the position which they were to occupy in testimony down here, and in the latter part, the conditions which are suitable to those in the place of testimony.<a name=122:10></a> It is one of the most lovely chapters you can find in the Scriptures, as marking out the conduct and bearing and deportment which is according to the mind of the Lord for those in the place of His friends down here.<a name=122:11></a> I think we may accept that place, as the friends of Christ.<a name=122:12></a> I quite admit the application to those who were round the Lord at that time, and who were to be the first to come into the place of testimony; but I do not think you can limit what comes out in the chapter to them, and I should suppose that it would be quite according to the pleasure of Christ that we should accept the place in which He puts His disciples as His friends, in the interests of the testimony.<a name=122:13></a>

		Now I want to go back a little to indicate to you how, in the tenth chapter, we have an entirely new point of departure.<a name=123:1></a> I do not think you will understand the succeeding chapters if you fail to apprehend that.<a name=123:2></a> The parable of the good Samaritan, as it is commonly called, presents to us an entirely new departure: it is the introduction of a neighbour.<a name=123:3></a> There never had been a neighbour before, and it is the beginning of God's real ways in regard to man.<a name=123:4></a> There had been the priest and the Levite; but the law never was a neighbour, nor was it intended to be.<a name=123:5></a> It was impossible for the law to show mercy, or to take account of the real condition of man.<a name=123:6></a> Moses was not a neighbour; the priest and the Levite pass by; and the real outset of divine ways in regard to man is undoubtedly the introduction of a neighbour.<a name=123:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The earlier part of the gospel is taken up pretty much with the kingdom.<a name=123:8></a> Now we get an additional point in regard to the kingdom, that is, the introduction of a man.<a name=123:9></a> That is the place which Christ came here to fulfil.<a name=123:10></a> Everything that had been, whether it were law or what not, in the dealings of God, was in anticipation of the introduction of a man; and this was the point of departure in the accomplishment of what was according to God's mind in regard to men.<a name=123:11></a> One point as to the neighbour is that he comes in from without.<a name=123:12></a> He is not regarded as arising from what was previously recognised.<a name=123:13></a> He is not raised up in connection with the pre-existing system; he is a Samaritan, coming from without; but the point of his coming in is to act the neighbour, to show mercy.<a name=123:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a few words in regard to the one to whom mercy is to be shown.<a name=123:15></a> The moral condition of man is deplorable.<a name=123:16></a> To begin with, he is weak.<a name=123:17></a> The proof of his weakness is that he has to come down to death.<a name=123:18></a> In a sense, man is already half dead, for from the time he comes into the world death lies upon him.<a name=123:19></a> The strongest man -- a Samson -- must come down to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=124>[Page 124]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		death.<a name=124:1></a> Samson in his end slew a great many Philistines, but he had to die himself.<a name=124:2></a> Then, too, man is without righteousness.<a name=124:3></a> The man that fell among thieves was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho.<a name=124:4></a> Jericho was not the place to find righteousness.<a name=124:5></a> Man is without resources and afflicted of thieves.<a name=124:6></a> Satan has really stripped man, and left him without righteousness, without resources, half dead, with death upon him.<a name=124:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is not the condition of man at his worst, but at his best.<a name=124:8></a> Now the neighbour has come in to show mercy not simply to the Jew, but to man.<a name=124:9></a> He has come in from without, in the unconditional goodness of God.<a name=124:10></a> Every Christian is conscious at the beginning of his history that he has received blessing from Christ.<a name=124:11></a> It is, I suppose, our first impression in regard of Christ.<a name=124:12></a> Who, then, do you think has any claim upon you like the One who showed mercy to you?<a name=124:13></a> If it had not been for the mercy of Christ, we should have been in heathen darkness.<a name=124:14></a> He has come near to us in order that He might make us acquainted with God.<a name=124:15></a> This is the beginning of our acquaintance with Christ; but it is only the beginning.<a name=124:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point, then, is the apprehension of the neighbour, the relation in which Christ now stands to man, the new departure.<a name=124:17></a> All previous to that had been probationary dealings on the part of God, and when we come to the neighbour we come to the real point of departure.<a name=124:18></a> But the man who is the subject of mercy has to be formed, to be renewed; he is to be changed in the very texture of his moral being, and that comes to pass in regard to everyone to whom Christ has shown mercy.<a name=124:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two principles by which this is effected: one is by being riveted to Christ, so that the ear is entirely attentive to Christ, and the other is in having access to the Father by the Spirit.<a name=124:20></a> I have no doubt that those are the two principles by which the man who is the subject of mercy is formed according to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=125>[Page 125]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God.<a name=125:1></a> He becomes "according to God" the new man, created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=125:2></a> What marked Mary was, that she was riveted to Jesus: she sat at Jesus' feet.<a name=125:3></a> Martha, too, had affection for Jesus, but she was not riveted to Jesus.<a name=125:4></a> Mary was; she had no ear for anyone else except Jesus: she heard His word, that is, the expression of Himself, so that He became known to her in that which He is; and she was affected and formed by it.<a name=125:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord indicates thus the first great principle which affects the one to whom mercy has been shown.<a name=125:6></a> My impression is that many people allow other things to come in between them and Jesus.<a name=125:7></a> Even service, on the part of Martha, might come in between herself and Jesus; but a great many things which are not service at all may come in, and hence it is that the soul is not riveted to Jesus, and does not get the full benefit of His word.<a name=125:8></a> The Son of God is expressed in His word, and it ought to be an exercise with every one of us that we are coming to the clear knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=125:9></a> The effect of the mercy of Christ is to that end.<a name=125:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point comes in, and that is, that such enjoy access to the Father.<a name=125:11></a> We learn what Christ is, but at the same time, through Him, we have access to the Father.<a name=125:12></a> If you have access to the Father, it is impossible to enjoy that without being very greatly affected by it.<a name=125:13></a> Even in human things we understand that if a man has access to great people in the world, he will undoubtedly be more or less affected by them.<a name=125:14></a> If a man keeps bad company, he will be affected by that company; but if a man keeps company morally superior to himself, he will be affected by it.<a name=125:15></a> So it is in regard to the Father: we enjoy access by Christ to the Father through the Spirit, and if this becomes a reality to us we cannot fail to be greatly affected by it.<a name=125:16></a> The practical result is that we are conscious not only of the mercy of Christ, but are formed according to

		<a name=126>[Page 126]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God by the knowledge of the Son of God, and by the enjoyment of access by the Spirit to the Father.<a name=126:1></a> I think those are the two great principles by which believers are formed according to God.<a name=126:2></a> God intends that we should take our character from Himself, as made known to us in the Son of God: the new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=126:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to apprehend God's point of departure in the One who has come in to show mercy.<a name=126:4></a> It is a great thing to turn your back on other things, and to have your attention taken up with the blessed One who has come in as the vessel of God's mercy to act the part of neighbour; and the next step is that we sit at His feet to get the knowledge of Himself, and enjoy our privilege, by the Spirit, of access to the Father, that we may be formed in affections according to God.<a name=126:5></a> In enjoying access to the Father, you enjoy access to One who loves, and then you get the blessed response to this love on the part of the Christian, "We love Him because He first loved us".<a name=126:6></a> That is the way in which the friends of Christ are formed, and there is no other.<a name=126:7></a> His friends must be according to Himself, or He would not care about them: if Christ condescends to have friends, it is clear that they must be according to Himself, otherwise they could not be in the secret of His mind.<a name=126:8></a> Even in worldly things, I do not think that any man will be my intimate friend unless there is something in common between my mind and his; and if I am not morally according to Christ, I doubt if I can be His friend; but our privilege is to be in the place of friends of Christ.<a name=126:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the twelfth chapter.<a name=126:10></a> We have seen how the friends of Christ are formed.<a name=126:11></a> The twelfth chapter, verses 4 to 12, contemplates them in the place of testimony.<a name=126:12></a> The first thing is, that you should not be afraid of man.<a name=126:13></a> And you can understand this: If you are afraid of man, you are in danger of playing

	<div class="paragraph">
		the hypocrite.<a name=127:1></a> A hypocrite is a person who does not come out in his true colour, and I think that would often apply to myself, and to many a Christian: he does not come out in his true colour.<a name=127:2></a> His true colour is that he is a friend of Christ.<a name=127:3></a> You will come out in your true colour some day, but the point is that in this world we should not act the part of hypocrites, but come out as Christ's friends.<a name=127:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point is that we confess the Son of man.<a name=127:5></a> That means a great deal.<a name=127:6></a> I do not fear man -- man is about me; all his power and glory are in the world, and in spite of that I do not fear him.<a name=127:7></a> The secret of that is that I expect nothing from him.<a name=127:8></a> I believe many of us are hampered by having expectations from man, and are thus kept in bondage to man.<a name=127:9></a> The friend of Christ does not fear man: but fears God, and confesses the Son of man.<a name=127:10></a> In the eyes of the world at the present time the Son of man is simply nothing.<a name=127:11></a> In the politics of the world the idea of the Son of man does not enter; and yet, after all, God has put all things under His feet, and He is going to overturn everything in the world.<a name=127:12></a> His rights are in abeyance for the moment, while He is at the right hand of God; but He has rights in regard to the world here.<a name=127:13></a> Everything is put under His feet, and we are not ashamed of the Son of man: we confess Him.<a name=127:14></a> It is a great thing for us to apprehend the reality to which the Spirit witnesses -- a Man in heaven, under whose feet everything is placed.<a name=127:15></a> That Man is known to us.<a name=127:16></a> He is not ashamed to call us friends, and we are left here for a moment for the confession of that Man.<a name=127:17></a> When I see people prepared to accept the glory of man and to do homage to man in the world, the impression produced upon me is that they do not think much of the Son of man.<a name=127:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to another point.<a name=127:19></a> The same Spirit by whom we enjoy access to the Father is the real power of our witness down here.<a name=127:20></a> The disciples were not to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=128>[Page 128]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be preoccupied with what defence they might make; they were dependent on the Spirit of God for their testimony.<a name=128:1></a> I think the Lord marks out simple guides and guards for the pathway.<a name=128:2></a> Do not be afraid of man; confess the Son of man.<a name=128:3></a> I do not think that means exactly that you should speak of Him to everyone you meet in the street: you can confess Him in a silent way -- by separation from the world, its glory and power and tinsel.<a name=128:4></a> Then there is entire dependence on the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=128:5></a> How can you talk about a Man in heaven except by the Spirit of God?<a name=128:6></a> A Man in heaven is contrary to all human experience.<a name=128:7></a> If you speak to me about the Duke of Wellington, or some great man who lived here, I have no difficulty in receiving that; but when you tell me about a Man in heaven, it is another matter.<a name=128:8></a> Who can enable me to speak about the Son of man in heaven except the Spirit of God?<a name=128:9></a> I do not think people know how dangerous it is to take up the things of God in natural ability.<a name=128:10></a> You can only know these things and testify of them in the power of the Spirit of God, who has come down to bring the witness to us of the Son of man in heaven.<a name=128:11></a> You get an example of this in Stephen: he was full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus.<a name=128:12></a> He was called before magistrates and powers, and confessed the Son of man, by the Spirit of God, before men.<a name=128:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the one true thing for the moment.<a name=128:14></a> The fear of man is morally a low thing.<a name=128:15></a> Under the influence of it many a person has done wrong things.<a name=128:16></a> The fear of man is ever dangerous, and when divine things are in question it is particularly so.<a name=128:17></a> If you are to be kept from it, you must be kept in the power of God, in confidence upon God.<a name=128:18></a> It is a blessed thought to me that the Witness to the Man in heaven is as great as the Man, and the Man as great as the Witness.<a name=128:19></a> What came to pass in the case of Stephen might in a certain

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is, you must not expect Christ to interfere in the affairs of this life.<a name=129:3></a> If you do you will get the answer on the part of Christ, Who made me a judge or a divider over you?<a name=129:4></a> The Lord will say to you, Beware of covetousness.<a name=129:5></a> Men want to get their rights: the man who appealed to Christ wanted to get rights which possibly belonged to him in the providence of God.<a name=129:6></a> A man may have a debtor, and go to law to recover his debt.<a name=129:7></a> All right enough according to man; but what is the spring and root of that in man?<a name=129:8></a> Where did his rights come from?<a name=129:9></a> The spring of all man's rights is the confusion which sin has brought into the world; and when men set to work to recover their rights they really are in danger of covetousness.<a name=129:10></a> The Lord goes to the root of the matter.<a name=129:11></a> What I understand by covetousness is the love of proprietary possession.<a name=129:12></a> It is a very common failing; all would admit that.<a name=129:13></a> I do not suppose there is anyone who is entirely free from it.<a name=129:14></a> When man was simply as God made him, he enjoyed the benefits which God had placed within his reach; but there was not proprietary possession.<a name=129:15></a> When the Lord came here, He had nothing; Peter too could say, Silver and gold have I none -- I have no possessions.<a name=129:16></a> The Lord says, Beware of covetousness.<a name=129:17></a> All that comes out in the remainder of the chapter (verses 22 - 36) is the contrast of that.<a name=129:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The contrast to covetousness is dependence on God; and not only that, but confidence in God; the great point in it is that God is to us a reality.<a name=129:19></a> Every man is dependent on the care of God.<a name=129:20></a> God is the preserver of all men; all are dependent on Him.<a name=129:21></a>

		Do you think we cannot count on the care of God?<a name=130:1></a> If a raven can count on His care, surely I can; and if a lily is decked in a form with which the glory of Solomon was not comparable, cannot I count on the care of God for my clothing?<a name=130:2></a> That is what the Lord brings out.<a name=130:3></a> Whatever may be our pathway here, the circumstances into which we have been born, it is a great point that the heart should be free from the love of money, and that the spirit of one's mind should be that of confidence in God, in the blessed sense that God is a reality, and that He has special regard for those who believe.<a name=130:4></a> I have no doubt that God knows perfectly how to order the path of His people who wait upon Him; and though they may not escape exercises, "your Father knoweth that ye have need of such things".<a name=130:5></a> My conviction is that if a man has grace to give himself up to seeking the kingdom of God in this world of man's influence, God will not fail in His care of that man.<a name=130:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is because people are half-hearted, partly seeking the kingdom of God and partly other things, that they do not prove the care of God in the way they might.<a name=130:7></a> If we are to seek the kingdom of God, we are to seek nothing else.<a name=130:8></a> It is not that I may not have to take up a business; but business is not my pursuit: it is incidental.<a name=130:9></a> My pursuit is the kingdom of God, and God will not fail me.<a name=130:10></a> If we are set on the kingdom of God down here, God will be set on our care.<a name=130:11></a> I have no doubt that God has endowed us with a large measure of intelligence; but I am sure of this, that if our piety is not according to our intelligence, God will not be well pleased with us.<a name=130:12></a> I am not the one to undervalue intelligence; but I want to see piety commensurate with our intelligence.<a name=130:13></a> The more intelligent we get, the more simple and confident we should become, and not be carried away by the pursuit of other objects in this world.<a name=130:14></a> I do not look for expansion in the world: I want contraction in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have endeavoured to point out, in connection with the tenth chapter of this gospel, that we get there a point of departure in the ways of God, that is, in the introduction of another Man, for I think that the neighbour in the parable of the good Samaritan presents to us another Man coming in, and that Man the point of departure for God.<a name=134:1></a> Adam was but the figure of "the One to come"; and the One to come having now appeared, He is of necessity the starting point.<a name=134:2></a> Then in the twelfth chapter we see that there were those who, having been benefited and having received mercy at the hands of Christ, became His disciples or friends, and were to come out in the way of testimony.<a name=134:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show, in connection with this chapter, how that Christ has become of necessity the test of all here.<a name=134:4></a> If you study the chapter attentively, you will find that from beginning to end it is full of tests.<a name=134:5></a> All men were tested by Christ.<a name=134:6></a> There was a test in the beginning of the chapter, when the Lord went into the Pharisee's house; He was a test in regard to the Supper; and in the close of the chapter the Lord speaks of Himself definitely as a test, that is, as to whether a man would follow Christ at the cost of every natural tie.<a name=134:7></a> The Lord puts the matter very strongly in the latter part of the chapter (verses 26, 27, and 33).<a name=134:8></a> The question is whether we are prepared to prefer Christ to our own life.<a name=134:9></a> What I understand by this is that a man has in spirit to forsake everything that attaches to him as a man; all that is distinctly of man, I mean morally, has to go completely.<a name=134:10></a> You have to be prepared to part company with all that tends to distinguish man, because of the sense of the value of Christ, and so Christ has become the test.<a name=134:11></a> No man

		would or could have invented such an idea.<a name=135:1></a> Men may have propounded systems of religion; but it is not in the capability of any man upon earth to present to us One, a Man, who has become the test, morally, to every man.<a name=135:2></a> The character of the test is, not that I am to try and imitate that man, but that I am prepared to surrender myself and everything else for the sake of that Man: that Man is to be preferred to all!<a name=135:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the first part of the chapter you will see there is the idea of a house, and again in the latter part (verses 1, 23).<a name=135:4></a> Roughly speaking, we have the idea of two houses.<a name=135:5></a> The house of the chief Pharisee -- man's house, that is where man orders; and in verse 23 God's house, where God orders according to His mind.<a name=135:6></a> I want you to bear that contrast in mind; you will see how it works out.<a name=135:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point I touch upon is this, that in coming into man's house Christ becomes the test or standard of conduct there.<a name=135:8></a> Then, as we shall see presently, the supper, too, becomes a test to man.<a name=135:9></a> I think the house of the chief Pharisee is a kind of picture of the world, where man orders things according to his mind.<a name=135:10></a> Now Christ came into this world, and, coming into it, of necessity became the test of everything.<a name=135:11></a> In becoming Son of man, He put Himself in relation to man; and in that fact, of necessity became the standard of man.<a name=135:12></a> It is impossible to avoid this.<a name=135:13></a> People might say, Is it right to set up such a standard for man?<a name=135:14></a> But it was inevitable; the Son of God becoming Son of man becomes the standard.<a name=135:15></a> In fact, all must be of Him.<a name=135:16></a> When the Lord comes into the house of the Pharisee, He really judges everything by Himself (verses 7 - 14).<a name=135:17></a> He was that which He spoke.<a name=135:18></a> When Christ came into this house He had come, not to abide there, but as a guest.<a name=135:19></a> But He had come too into the world as a host; He could invite, gather to Himself, and He had good things to dispense.<a name=135:20></a> He could make a feast, in a certain sense, could give deliverance to the captives,

		sight to the blind, raise the dead; and hence the Lord acted the part, not simply of a guest, but of a host.<a name=136:1></a> He could be in the midst of hungry thousands and provide for them all.<a name=136:2></a> He did not there act the part of a guest, but of a host.<a name=136:3></a> So the Lord could gather about Himself a crowd of sick and afflicted people, and heal them all.<a name=136:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in coming into the world as a guest, Christ took the lowest place; He was laid in a manger, because there was no room for Him in the inn.<a name=136:5></a> He had nothing whatever of this world's glory or attention.<a name=136:6></a> The circumstances in which He was brought up, were of the lowliest description.<a name=136:7></a> When He was brought to the temple, they brought for Him a poor person's offering.<a name=136:8></a> There was nothing magnificent in connection with Christ in the world.<a name=136:9></a> He came into man's house and took the lowest place.<a name=136:10></a> I believe that was because it was morally the suitable place.<a name=136:11></a> It was impossible for Christ in any way to touch the glory of this world; everything that was in this world was polluted.<a name=136:12></a> He was content to have part in the baptism of John: "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=136:13></a> He identified Himself with the repentant and the poor of the people that were of no concern in Israel.<a name=136:14></a> That is the place which the Lord took, but it was morally the right place.<a name=136:15></a> It is impossible to understand any Christian in the present day taking advantage of anything whatever in order to secure for himself prominence in the world.<a name=136:16></a> There is nothing for us -- the world being what it is -- except to take the place that Christ took, the lowest place.<a name=136:17></a> He fulfilled in Himself what He laid down here: "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted".<a name=136:18></a> For Christ had regard to exaltation by God.<a name=136:19></a> The Lord brings that out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:31">John  13:31</a>, 32.<a name=136:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to touch on the other side for a moment, that is, that Christ acted the part of host.<a name=136:21></a> He dispensed benefits which were at His hand.<a name=136:22></a> Though in one sense

	<div class="paragraph">
		That was the standard, and the Lord brings it forward here as such.<a name=137:10></a> He first speaks to those who sought the highest places, and puts before them conduct of which He was the expression.<a name=137:11></a> He speaks also to the one that bade Him, and puts forward His own course as the standard.<a name=137:12></a> What a serious thing it was for the chief Pharisee to have asked Christ into his house!<a name=137:13></a> The man did not understand at all what he was doing, any more than Simon the Pharisee; but he never did such a serious thing before, for he brought into his house the divine standard and test of every man.<a name=137:14></a> In the presence of Christ every man found himself tested.<a name=137:15></a> Nothing short of that man could now suit God.<a name=137:16></a> But no one answers to the test.<a name=137:17></a> God had applied other tests until Christ came; but after that, all was over, and man after the flesh was practically superseded by the presence of Christ.<a name=137:18></a> From that point, the real question is whether man is prepared to accept his supersession by Christ.<a name=137:19></a> This ought to be very real with us.<a name=137:20></a> It is no use accepting it simply in term; we have to accept it in reality, so that Christ alone should be seen, and man set aside.<a name=137:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust I have made my meaning plain.<a name=137:22></a> It was the necessary consequence of Christ coming into man's house -- man's world -- that He superseded man and became the standard for man down here.<a name=137:23></a> I could understand the Pharisee saying to Him, I cannot act in the way you propose.<a name=137:24></a> The Lord says, I cannot help that; it is the way in which I act.<a name=137:25></a> I am not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt the Pharisee had been attracted by Christ, and thought to do honour to Christ; but he did not understand the gravity of bringing that standard for man into his house.<a name=138:4></a> I wish we could apprehend the immense import of the fact that Christ has become man, has come into man's world, and that man has been superseded.<a name=138:5></a> At the present moment the real standard of man in the presence of God is Christ.<a name=138:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we may pass on to the next point -- verses 15 - 24.<a name=138:7></a> And I pray the Lord to enable me to give an idea of what the Spirit indicates in the great supper, and how great the test there is.<a name=138:8></a> At the beginning God gave man a wife; and then, later on, when He took up a people, He gave man a piece of land and five yoke of oxen.<a name=138:9></a> God did all that for man.<a name=138:10></a> Now the fact is that God was looking in a way that there should be some recognition of Himself in it, that His goodness might be recognised, so that man might thank Him.<a name=138:11></a> God looked for fidelity to Himself, and for thankfulness.<a name=138:12></a> The things spoken of were given to man for man's benefit.<a name=138:13></a> God gave Eve to Adam, and land and possessions to Israel.<a name=138:14></a> But did God get what He looked for?<a name=138:15></a> Did man remain faithful to Him?<a name=138:16></a> Man became an idolater; he took what God had given to Him, and if he worshipped anybody he worshipped Satan, and gave no thanks to God.<a name=138:17></a> This is what came to pass with the benefits that God had conferred upon man.<a name=138:18></a> The man that got the wife got away through her from God, became the beginning of an evil world; and in Israel, endowed with land and possessions, the history was repeated; they became idolaters like the rest of

		Christ is the great test, and is intended to be that.<a name=144:4></a> I cannot conceive a truth more pregnant, or of greater import, than that Christ came as man into man's house.<a name=144:5></a> Man was superseded by the Man that tests everybody; and men have to answer to that test, or to give up all that they have.<a name=144:6></a> But it is blessed where grace is given to accept Christ, and in appreciating Him to become His disciple, so that in the day of His glory one will be glorified with Him.<a name=144:7></a> It is a comfort to think that the Spirit of God is bound to be faithful to Christ.<a name=144:8></a> If anything depended on my faithfulness, I should soon go aside; but Christ has given us living water, to maintain us in fidelity to himself; and if we are disposed to be unfaithful, the Spirit of God never can be unfaithful, but will recall us by self-judgement to faithfulness.<a name=144:9></a> Christ is everything: if He is not everything, He will be nothing.<a name=144:10></a> He will have the one commanding place, and whatever we hold must be entirely secondary to Christ.<a name=144:11></a> If we are formed in Christ and Christ formed in us, all becomes uncommonly simple.<a name=144:12></a> May God work in us, by the mighty power of His Spirit, so that we may prove that of which Christ spoke, "the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=144:13></a>

		THE INFLUENCE OF HEAVEN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have drawn attention to the parable in the tenth chapter, which we are accustomed to call the parable of the Good Samaritan, as presenting a starting point in God's ways in grace, in the introduction of Christ as a neighbour to man.<a name=145:1></a> There could be nothing antecedent to that as the full expression of grace.<a name=145:2></a> The beginning of all help for man was in the introduction of One who was capable of showing mercy, that which man really needed.<a name=145:3></a> In order to prove the condition of man, God saw fit to give the law; but God knew from the outset that that could not be of any avail to man: what man really needed was mercy.<a name=145:4></a> We never should have made any movement toward God if He had not shown mercy to us.<a name=145:5></a> Nothing could bring man one point nearer to God except the mercy of God, and it is on that ground that the neighbour comes in.<a name=145:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see after that, the training or education of the disciples, and the character of the new witness, which comes out in the twelfth chapter.<a name=145:7></a> Then, in the fourteenth chapter, Christ having come into man's house, is of necessity a standard for man, however man may fail of it.<a name=145:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters are very important: they bring to light the influences which are at work here in the world.<a name=145:9></a> On the one hand, in this chapter, we see the influence of heaven; and in the next the influence of hell.<a name=145:10></a> These are points of great moment, because no one can doubt that men are acted upon by influences from without: there is not enough in man, as a matter of fact, to account for his conduct.<a name=145:11></a> That is the conclusion to which a thoughtful person must come.<a name=145:12></a> Man is a battleground between
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=146>[Page 146]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		influences.<a name=146:1></a> Wherever the influences come from, there are such abroad in the world, and men are affected by them.<a name=146:2></a> I can remember to have seen a nation carried away almost to destruction by a kind of frenzy.<a name=146:3></a> I do not think the influence lay in the people, but it was there, and the people were acted upon by it.<a name=146:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the fifteenth chapter the influence is from above; in the sixteenth it is from beneath.<a name=146:5></a> I refer to the rich man in the sixteenth chapter.<a name=146:6></a> The rich man paid no regard to Lazarus at all.<a name=146:7></a> Where did that come <i>from</i>?<a name=146:8></a> We read that he died and was buried, and in hell he lifted up his eyes.<a name=146:9></a> In a sense, it was a kind of natural descent.<a name=146:10></a> It was not the idea of a man cast violently into hell, but descending to it, so to speak, naturally.<a name=146:11></a> The man simply went to the place by which he had been influenced whilst on earth.<a name=146:12></a> What came out in the rich man was a selfish disregard for others, under an influence which came from another scene.<a name=146:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But my object now is to speak of the influence of heaven, and it is a great thing to apprehend that there is such an influence in the world, producing certain results, and, I may say, an answer to itself.<a name=146:14></a> Heaven is a long way off morally.<a name=146:15></a> But the Lord invoked heaven very frequently.<a name=146:16></a> One supplication which He enjoined was, "thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven".<a name=146:17></a> I think I could pray that any time; it is a very good prayer.<a name=146:18></a> The Lord said a great deal about heaven.<a name=146:19></a> He taught the disciples about their Father in heaven, and brought the light of heaven in continually.<a name=146:20></a> Heaven was not, I suppose, a thought foreign to the mind of a Jew.<a name=146:21></a> In this chapter the Lord opens up in a remarkable way the influence of heaven down here.<a name=146:22></a> It is felt here in the world, and produces results, and in a sense is to be reflected in man here in the world.<a name=146:23></a> When the prodigal was with the father, in the best robe and with the ring on his hand, I cannot

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=147>[Page 147]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		doubt that he reflected the joy of heaven.<a name=147:1></a> I suppose it is what properly should characterise God's house -- the joy of heaven reflected here upon earth.<a name=147:2></a> Christians are not looking for earthly joys; if they are, I am afraid they will be grievously disappointed.<a name=147:3></a> They may get them for a moment, but they will fail; all find how evanescent they are.<a name=147:4></a> But God would not have us to court earthly joys.<a name=147:5></a> God may give us mercies, and comfort our souls with them, for He is a God of mercy, and favours us; but I do not think He would have us to be looking for earthly joys: He would have us to drink into the spirit of heaven, and in that way to reflect the joys of heaven.<a name=147:6></a> But we must first apprehend the influences of heaven which are felt in the world.<a name=147:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think that reconciliation is the effect which the influence of heaven is intended to produce down here.<a name=147:8></a> The ministry of reconciliation is really an influence of heaven at work here, to produce a result that will cause joy in heaven, and that joy is to be reflected in those who are the objects of that ministry.<a name=147:9></a> The practical result of that is that you get communion between heaven and earth.<a name=147:10></a> I believe that was prefigured in the feast of tabernacles and is brought to pass in the present time.<a name=147:11></a> God gives us to understand something of the joy of heaven, and that is the result which God has intended to bring about.<a name=147:12></a> Another thing is seen in the seventh of John following upon it, viz.<a name=147:13></a>, that out of the belly of the believer flow rivers of living water.<a name=147:14></a> This is because he is connected with the scene where Christ is; his mind is set on things above; he participates in heavenly joys and understands heavenly influences.<a name=147:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to turn again to the fifteenth of Luke.<a name=147:16></a> The beginning of the chapter is connected with the end of the preceding one.<a name=147:17></a> Evidently the Lord had something special to communicate, because He made an appeal to him that had ears to hear.<a name=147:18></a> The publicans and

		sinners drew near to hear Him, and that becomes the occasion of all that is related in the chapter.<a name=148:1></a> The Lord, through the chapter, vindicates Himself by showing that He was in a line with the influences of heaven (verses 4 - 6).<a name=148:2></a> Evidently the neighbours and friends had been in sympathy with the man in seeking the lost sheep; he would not have appealed to them had it not been so.<a name=148:3></a> In the face of verses 8 to 10, no one could gainsay that the influence of heaven is at work in the world, and the result is to cause joy in heaven, and that joy is reflected in man here upon earth.<a name=148:4></a> Supposing earth were left to itself, without any influence of heaven, where would man have been at this present moment?<a name=148:5></a> I do not know whether the world would have gone on; but if so we should have been in the darkness and degradation of idolatry.<a name=148:6></a> There was nothing in the world that ever delivered it from idolatry.<a name=148:7></a> Philosophy never did; the philosophers were idolaters themselves.<a name=148:8></a> Whatever they wrote was powerless with the people; it produced no effect.<a name=148:9></a> What they wrote was read and considered by a very limited circle; it produced no moral effect, because it never brought God to man.<a name=148:10></a> Whatever cobwebs they might spin from the rudiments of the world or the traditions of men, philosophy was powerless to affect man, for nothing does affect man radically except the light of God.<a name=148:11></a> The world was incapable of delivering itself from the bond and power of evil in which it was bound.<a name=148:12></a> Had it not been for the influence of heaven, we should still have been in the darkness of idolatry.<a name=148:13></a> What is it that has emancipated the mind of man, so that he should be active in the investigation of natural laws?<a name=148:14></a> It is the light which has been brought in by Christianity, so that the mind has acquired great activity.<a name=148:15></a> Whatever deliverance there has been for man's mind from debasement and degradation has been the effect of the revelation of God.<a name=148:16></a> My point is that it is the influence of heaven.<a name=148:17></a> If earth had been

		left to itself, and man had only been affected by the influences of earth, he would have remained degraded to a degree.<a name=149:1></a> There was the influence of hell in the world from the time that sin came in, and the condition of things in the world would have been appalling had the earth been left to itself, and unaffected by the influence of heaven.<a name=149:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord was the expression of the influence of heaven down here, and that is the way in which He vindicates Himself.<a name=149:3></a> He said, as it were, 'I am here in perfect concert with heaven.<a name=149:4></a> I am not here simply as a benefactor of man; I am here in concert with the mind of heaven, and heaven is in perfect sympathy with Me'.<a name=149:5></a> That was His vindication in regard to the charge of eating and drinking with publicans and sinners.<a name=149:6></a> If He did eat with publicans and sinners, it was no very great degradation if He had heaven in sympathy with Him; there was then no moral reproach in being found amongst publicans and sinners.<a name=149:7></a> If all heaven could have been here upon earth, it would have been found in the company of publicans and sinners.<a name=149:8></a> Do you think heavenly beings could find much delight in Scribes and Pharisees?<a name=149:9></a> When a heavenly being came to earth, he went wherever there was a possibility of entrance for the influence of heaven.<a name=149:10></a> The publicans and sinners were less averse than Pharisees to these influences, and the Lord had come here, in the mind of heaven, to seek the lost sheep.<a name=149:11></a> The lost sheep refers, I suppose, to the Jew.<a name=149:12></a> There were ninety-nine that had not gone astray -- or at all events that did not think they had -- but there was one that had, and the shepherd goes to seek that one.<a name=149:13></a> The Scribes and Pharisees did not concern themselves about the one that had gone astray, but the Lord does.<a name=149:14></a> He virtually says, 'The ninety and nine are able to take care of themselves; I will go after the one that is lost'.<a name=149:15></a> It was the blessed influence of heaven which was concerning itself to recover that which was lost on earth.<a name=149:16></a>

		Then we get the parable of the lost piece of silver.<a name=150:1></a> The house is being swept to recover the lost piece.<a name=150:2></a> The light of the gospel has been brought into the world; and the object is to bring into view the lost piece of silver.<a name=150:3></a> There is something in the world which has been lost for God, on which He sets a value, and that has to be brought to light by the gospel.<a name=150:4></a> We cannot avoid the truth of election.<a name=150:5></a> If there were no election, there would be no sovereign mercy.<a name=150:6></a> There is that, for God will maintain responsibility.<a name=150:7></a> God will not do anything upon earth that sets responsibility aside.<a name=150:8></a> It is essential to the glory of God to maintain responsibility, in order that He may be just in His judgement all round.<a name=150:9></a> Angels came under the judgement of God, so did the world before the flood; God maintains for His own glory responsibility all round, and hence mercy must be sovereign.<a name=150:10></a> If mercy were universal, there would be no maintenance of responsibility; but God maintains responsibility and acts in the sovereignty of mercy.<a name=150:11></a> Hence you get the elect of God, the subjects of sovereign mercy.<a name=150:12></a> Though the number of Israel should be as the sand, it was a remnant that should be saved.<a name=150:13></a>

		Now I pass on to the latter part of the chapter.<a name=151:7></a> What I want to point out is, that the prodigal was being acted upon by the influence of heaven.<a name=151:8></a> There is hardly a greater comfort to my mind than that this world is subject to the influence of heaven; it is not left to itself.<a name=151:9></a> There is an influence of heaven here acting upon man.<a name=151:10></a> It does not do to make too much of man's work.<a name=151:11></a> God may use men to enlighten others, but you must not make too much of that; what is really operative here is the influence of heaven, eventuating in the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=151:12></a> That ministry is committed into the hands of man; but behind it all is the influence of heaven.<a name=151:13></a> The prodigal was up to a certain point held in by the providence of God.<a name=151:14></a> In God's providence he was allowed to go into the far country and waste his substance, and then to be in want.<a name=151:15></a> It is pretty much a picture of the Gentile, who had been allowed to go far away from God and to drop down into every kind of debasement; he had come to a condition of moral dearth.<a name=151:16></a> What is presented to us in a material way here, is really a picture of where man has got to by reason of sin.<a name=151:17></a> The Jew had a measure of light, but the Gentiles were in complete moral dearth.<a name=151:18></a> Why do people in the world

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next thing is, that the man came to himself.<a name=152:7></a> That is the effect of the influence of heaven acting silently and underneath the surface.<a name=152:8></a> Elihu explained to Job the activity of God in regard of men.<a name=152:9></a> People are awakened in a most extraordinary way: and this is the influence of heaven at work in the world.<a name=152:10></a> I thank God that influence is at work.<a name=152:11></a> Were it not for it, no one would come to himself.<a name=152:12></a> Not all the preaching in the world -- even apostolic preaching -- could ever bring man to himself.<a name=152:13></a> That is the first great step: repentance is wrought.<a name=152:14></a> Now that the prodigal is awakened, he is enlightened more or less.<a name=152:15></a> He has come under the evangelist, or someone who has enlightened him; then he comes to the father, and is welcomed by him.<a name=152:16></a> The father has pleasure and satisfaction in receiving him.<a name=152:17></a> God delights in recovery.<a name=152:18></a> The Scribes and Pharisees did not delight in recovery: the publicans and sinners might have gone to the worst so far as they were concerned; but God delights in recovery.<a name=152:19></a> You may blame God if you like, but there is mercy with God.<a name=152:20></a> Hence it was that the prodigal, when he returned to the father, was welcomed.<a name=152:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to give you an idea of reconciliation.<a name=152:22></a> I think the object of reconciliation is that there might be a point of complacency for God.<a name=152:23></a> It has originated with God Himself.<a name=152:24></a> God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself; but the point in it is that in the very scene of distance there might be a point of complacency for God.<a name=152:25></a> Had there never been distance,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there could not have been reconciliation.<a name=153:1></a> Reconciliation is a relative term, dependent upon a previous condition of alienation.<a name=153:2></a> When Christ came to earth, there was for God a point of complacency in man.<a name=153:3></a> But that point of complacency was limited to Christ, though it could not remain so, because reconciliation which was in view had reference to those who had been morally away, like the prodigal, and the point was that the complacency should be found where there had been the distance.<a name=153:4></a> How was that to be brought about?<a name=153:5></a> There were two simple things necessary: one was that the old man must be removed, and the other than Christ must be in his stead.<a name=153:6></a> That is reconciliation.<a name=153:7></a> Both are effected by Christ.<a name=153:8></a> One was effected in the cross -- where the old man was crucified, and the other is effected by the communication to man of living water.<a name=153:9></a> That is where reconciliation is brought into effect, the practical result being that the one who receives living water appreciates Christ, and hence he furnishes a point of complacency to God: where the distance was, the complacency is.<a name=153:10></a> That is a wonderful thing to be brought to pass.<a name=153:11></a> The prodigal is divested of all that marked him.<a name=153:12></a> He is the same person, but divested of all that characterised him.<a name=153:13></a> He was clothed in the best robe: he furnished a point of complacency for the father.<a name=153:14></a> That is what the influence of heaven has brought about down here on the earth.<a name=153:15></a> Numbers of us can say our old man has been crucified with Christ: that is one side; but Christ has made us to partake of living water, and that has brought about in us the appreciation of Christ.<a name=153:16></a> If anyone were to ask me as to that in which I differ from people in the world, the only point I could mark would be this, that I appreciate Christ, and I would be prepared to let everything go for the sake of Christ.<a name=153:17></a> I greatly prefer Christ to myself, and I feel very much ashamed of everything in myself, in the light of Christ.<a name=153:18></a>

		It is plain enough that there is a connection between the thoughts in these two passages.<a name=158:1></a> In the first of Colossians the apostle Paul speaks of the Father having delivered saints from the power or authority of darkness -- idolatry was the expression of that -- and translated them into the kingdom of the Son of His love.<a name=158:2></a> Peter also refers to the kingdom when alluding to the vision which they had seen on the holy mount: what they saw in vision there was the kingdom of the Son of God's love.<a name=158:3></a> In verse 17 we have the record of what had passed on the holy mount, the voice which came to Jesus, saying, "This is my beloved Son".<a name=158:4></a> Therefore in this chapter Peter evidently refers to the same thing to which Paul refers in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>; in the mind of Peter it was based on the vision which they had seen in the holy mount.<a name=158:5></a> The peculiarity of Paul is that he gives the kingdom a present application to us.<a name=158:6></a>

		I want to bring before you, if I can, the great importance of the kingdom.<a name=158:7></a> I am sure it has not been sufficiently apprehended.<a name=158:8></a> If you want to go on in divine things, you must begin with the kingdom.<a name=158:9></a> What I understand to be the gain of the kingdom is, that God has been pleased to set us in rest and security, in order that He may teach us.<a name=158:10></a> What He proposes to teach us is, in principle, the force of the new covenant; and the object of that is, that we may come out in the character of the heavenly city, the bride of Christ, here upon earth.<a name=158:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My main object is to show you the great gain of entering into the kingdom.<a name=159:11></a> It means a great deal more to people than they have been accustomed to think.<a name=159:12></a> But first let me say a word in regard to the ministry of Peter.<a name=159:13></a> Peter's ministry is peculiar in a way; it leads on to the heavenly city.<a name=159:14></a> In the holy Jerusalem, in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, we find that the names of the twelve apostles are in the foundations.<a name=159:15></a> The city is built up, not exactly on the testimony of Paul, but on that of the twelve.<a name=159:16></a> Paul's testimony comes in and gives a peculiar character to the church; but, as to the fact, the foundation of the church was really formed by the testimony of the twelve.<a name=159:17></a> Hence,

	<div class="paragraph">
		when the holy city comes down out of heaven in connection with the kingdom, we find in the foundations the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=160:1></a> Paul's name is not mentioned, for the reason, I suppose, that when the church was founded he was persecuting.<a name=160:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the chapter before us there are two great points which come out; one is, the apostle looking that the character of God may be expressed in the saints, and the other that an entrance may be ministered to them abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<a name=160:3></a> The general principle of Peter's testimony is that the saints were to be partakers of the sufferings; and if they were, they would be partakers also of the glory.<a name=160:4></a> I have no doubt the testimony leads on to the holy Jerusalem.<a name=160:5></a> It is as forming the holy Jerusalem that we shall be partakers of the glory of Christ.<a name=160:6></a> But the condition preceding that is, that we suffer with Him; and in the meantime, while the saints are suffering, the object of the apostle Peter was that they might be partakers of the divine nature.<a name=160:7></a> If we become partakers of the divine nature -- love -- then it is that we are apart from the world of lust; the two things cannot possibly go together.<a name=160:8></a> If you want to come to separation, the point to reach is the divine nature.<a name=160:9></a> You cannot mix the nature of God and the fallen nature of man.<a name=160:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What Peter looks on to is an entrance being ministered to them abundantly.<a name=160:11></a> It is, possibly, an allusion to the holy Jerusalem coming down from God: they would come into the kingdom in a glorious way.<a name=160:12></a> The great principle by which the church has been formed as the bride, the Lamb's wife, is by the testimony of Peter, which involved that the saints would suffer with Christ and be partakers of His glory.<a name=160:13></a> That will be to us a time of abundant joy.<a name=160:14></a> The saints are obscure and hidden now; but they will come out then, from God, out of heaven, as the holy Jerusalem,

		One word more about the kingdom in Peter's connection with it.<a name=161:3></a> Of the three evangelists who record the vision on the holy mount not one was present.<a name=161:4></a> The only reference to it on the part of anyone who was present is here in the epistle of Peter.<a name=161:5></a> In the latter part of the chapter I have read, Peter gives a present application to the vision; and that brings before us the kingdom, not as future, but as present.<a name=161:6></a> I think verse 19 is extremely important.<a name=161:7></a> The vision of the kingdom was the confirmation of prophecy.<a name=161:8></a> The prophets all looked forward to the kingdom; it was their theme.<a name=161:9></a> Therefore we can understand that when the disciples were permitted to see a vision of the kingdom on the mount, Jesus receiving from God the Father honour and glory, the word of prophecy was made very sure to them.<a name=161:10></a> The kingdom was there: that is what I want to press.<a name=161:11></a> It is not that the kingdom to them was future; its prophetic application was future, but they came under the power of the kingdom in the holy mount.<a name=161:12></a> Now the apostle says, you do well to take heed to prophecy up to a certain point: until the day dawn.<a name=161:13></a> What do you think the day is?<a name=161:14></a> It is the day of the kingdom.<a name=161:15></a> The day-star is Christ.<a name=161:16></a> It does not say you do well to take heed to it till the Lord comes; that is not the idea; it is till the day dawn, and the day-star arise, not publicly, but in your hearts.<a name=161:17></a> We have thus entered into the thought of the kingdom, not as future, but as present.<a name=161:18></a> It means that, in a sense, we have left the world.<a name=161:19></a> In heart the Christian is separated from the darkness of the world by the fact of the day having dawned, and the day-star having arisen in his heart.<a name=161:20></a> You can well understand that the kingdom of the Son of God's love has no connection with this world,

		but with the world to come; only I fear that, in saying that, some might entertain the idea that I refer the kingdom to the future.<a name=162:1></a> I do not, because the world to come is already spoken of in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=162:2></a> If it is spoken of, it is present in a sense.<a name=162:3></a> It has yet to come in the way of display; but if you speak of it, it is there.<a name=162:4></a> The difficulty of the kingdom is this, that the mysteries of the kingdom really take place in this world, while the kingdom itself belongs to the world to come.<a name=162:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we anticipate the display of the kingdom.<a name=162:6></a> We have an apprehension of the glory of God's beloved Son, and in the light of that we have come into the kingdom.<a name=162:7></a> I think many people make a mistake in occupying themselves too much with future things.<a name=162:8></a> I quite admit there are things which are future; but the attention of the saints is to be taken up with present things.<a name=162:9></a> The moral effect of future things upon people is not great; but the effect of present things is very great indeed.<a name=162:10></a> If you apprehend present things, which have come to you as light, they will exercise the greatest possible influence over you.<a name=162:11></a> We have not to wait for the kingdom; it is there, and God has translated us into it.<a name=162:12></a> There are other features of the kingdom which have to come to pass; in the time to come there will be the dominion of the Son of man, and the throne of David.<a name=162:13></a> These are in abeyance for the moment, and in the meantime the character which the kingdom has is the kingdom of the Son of God's love.<a name=162:14></a> That is the vision which was seen on the holy mount.<a name=162:15></a> What preceded it was that Christ forbade the disciples to say any longer that He was the Christ, and then He passes on to speak of the sufferings of the Son of man.<a name=162:16></a> That makes it clear to me that, for the moment, you cannot look for the dominion of the Son of man, nor the throne of David.<a name=162:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the gain of that to us?<a name=163:7></a> I think the two first principles of the kingdom are spoken of in the second verse of this chapter: grace and peace.<a name=163:8></a> If you enter into the kingdom, and apprehend the glory of the Lord, the effect upon your soul is that you come into the enjoyment of grace and peace.<a name=163:9></a> Grace and peace are multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=163:10></a> You come under the light and influence of heaven, of the glory.<a name=163:11></a> These are great things to enjoy.<a name=163:12></a> It is a great thing to enjoy grace -- to apprehend God's attitude towards you -- and peace in the sense of security.<a name=163:13></a> They are the first principles of the kingdom.<a name=163:14></a> The more we are acquainted with God and with the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God, the more familiar our souls become with grace and peace; and if there is grace and peace on the part of God, you have security from the power of evil.<a name=163:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will tell you another thing you get in connection with the kingdom: that is the benefit of the "neighbour".<a name=163:16></a> I refer to the parable of the good Samaritan: you are carried and cared for.<a name=163:17></a> That is one great idea in the kingdom.<a name=163:18></a> Priesthood connects itself properly with the kingdom; we get carried and cared for at the charges of the neighbour.<a name=163:19></a>

		One more point: you are carried and cared for, you have Christ's succour and sympathy; but there is another thing: unfailing support in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=164:2></a> Authority is at the right hand of God; but the Holy Spirit has come in order to make the kingdom effective upon earth, in the hearts of the saints, so that they may have a sense of rest and security in regard to everything down here.<a name=164:3></a> I am not alarmed at anything, because "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world".<a name=164:4></a> Let the forces of evil at work down here be as powerful and subtle as they may: the Holy Spirit is greater, and the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=164:5></a> These things are maintained in divine power that you might not be afraid of anything here.<a name=164:6></a> Why is government maintained in this country?<a name=164:7></a> There is no country in the world so well governed as England; government is not much seen, yet there is government; you go about the streets with a sense of security, and people in the main are at rest and quiet from fear of evil: that is the effect of good government.<a name=164:8></a> So it is, spiritually, in regard to the kingdom of God.<a name=164:9></a> You have security against the power of evil, so that you can be at rest and in peace.<a name=164:10></a> The great object of it is that God may take you in hand and make you the subject of His teaching.<a name=164:11></a> You cannot come under the teaching of God unless you are perfectly secure and at rest in regard to all the power of evil.<a name=164:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First let me say that I think the great thing for saints at this moment is to be an apprehension of the world to come: it will tend to deliver them from a great many things.<a name=166:2></a> No one ever got deliverance from the present world except by the apprehension of the world to come.<a name=166:3></a> Moses got deliverance from the present world by the apprehension, so far as it could then be apprehended, of the world to come.<a name=166:4></a> He had as fair a prospect in regard to this world as most men could have; but he gave up the present world, because God gave him a ray of light in regard to the world to come.<a name=166:5></a> He rejected the world, and the powers of the world, and preferred the reproach of Christ, esteeming it greater riches than the treasures in Egypt.<a name=166:6></a> The reproach of Christ has reference to the world to come; I do not mean to say that in the world to come Christ will be in reproach, but I think it stands in that relation.<a name=166:7></a> Christ would not take any place in connection with the system of this world; if He had, there would not have been reproach: it was because He would not accept this world, or its prince, that He came into reproach.<a name=166:8></a> I think the world to come was early in view, and it is the light of that world that has determined the path of God's people in this world.<a name=166:9></a> Abraham had the light of the world to come.<a name=166:10></a> I have no doubt that the promise to Abraham implied eternal life: it was the light which God gave him in regard to the world to come that determined his pathway in this world.<a name=166:11></a> This is a principle that is seen throughout the whole

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was dwelling in the previous lecture upon what I may call the first principle of the world to come -- the kingdom; now I am going to take up another point -- the house.<a name=167:6></a> This follows upon the kingdom.<a name=167:7></a> If God rules, it involves that He dwells -- God is not content with ruling: He dwells; and He dwells in order that He may bless.<a name=167:8></a> The kingdom does not in itself bring the blessing in: it paves the way for blessing; but the necessary accompaniment of ruling is dwelling.<a name=167:9></a> And then grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life.<a name=167:10></a> God has established the reign of grace; but the great end in view is the blessing -- eternal life.<a name=167:11></a> God intends to make manifest the greatness of His triumph over everything which the devil has brought in, hence the introduction of the blessing, that is eternal life.<a name=167:12></a> It is a pleasure to me to see the moral relations of divine things; to learn that everything has a proportion of its own, and every truth stands in relation to some other truth.<a name=167:13></a> There is no such thing as truths; there is such a thing as truth.<a name=167:14></a> You may see truth in part or in detail; but at the same time truth is one complete whole.<a name=167:15></a>

		In the first two chapters of Hebrews the point is, as we have seen, the throne, and the glory of man in Jesus; in the third, the house of God is in view, "whose house are we", and then it immediately adds, "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith".<a name=169:6></a> You have come to the house of God, where God speaks.<a name=169:7></a> The kingdom is there for those who apprehend it, the house is the necessary consequence of the kingdom.<a name=169:8></a> You get the idea in the song of triumph in the fifteenth of Exodus, "I will prepare him an habitation".<a name=169:9></a> As far as I understand it, when once a soul apprehends the kingdom of God, is brought under the sway of grace, the next thing that soul wishes to do is to serve God.<a name=169:10></a> I could not understand a person being truly converted without that person having a certain desire to have to say to God.<a name=169:11></a> In the expression, "Behold, he prayeth", there is the anxiety to have to say to God: in principle that means, I will prepare Him an habitation.<a name=169:12></a> I do not think the habitation is the end: eternal life is the end; but the habitation follows upon the kingdom, and the kingdom introduces God's habitation: God comes in to reign in order that He may dwell.<a name=169:13></a>

		I doubt if anybody is prepared for the house of God that does not understand the kingdom.<a name=169:14></a> The first point on the part of God was to bring man to righteousness.<a name=169:15></a> God could, so to speak, very well take care of His own righteousness; but the difficulty was to bring man to righteousness: He could not have to say to him otherwise, except in judgement.<a name=169:16></a> In the day of

		The present form of the house is that Jew and Gentile are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit, and in connection with that you get the idea of Christian fellowship.<a name=171:2></a> Christians partake in common of the Holy Spirit, and the fellowship of the Spirit is connected with the house of God, with the blessed fact that the Holy Spirit is dwelling here.<a name=171:3></a>

		The next point I wish to touch upon is sanctification.<a name=171:4></a> You get the expression very frequently in the New Testament.<a name=171:5></a> The Holy Spirit came to dwell, to establish the kingdom; but at the same time He came in the power of sanctification, that there might be the setting apart here of a company from all that is contrary to God; from sin, the world and Satan's power, for God, that they should be no more of the world than Christ is of the world.<a name=171:6></a> The first expression of that separation was baptism: the house of God was entered at the first by baptism.<a name=171:7></a> The force of baptism was dissociation from the world, in order that saints might be set apart from all that was not of God.<a name=171:8></a> I know the difficulty of the present moment: things are very much changed outwardly; the world has become Christian, hence sanctification has become very much more difficult.<a name=171:9></a> Sanctification cannot have altered in the mind of the Spirit, but we are in the midst of a Christian community; you can hardly say to people today, 'Save yourselves from this untoward generation'.<a name=171:10></a> It is difficult to understand sanctification now unless you look at it from a purely moral point of view.<a name=171:11></a> If sin, the world and Satan's power have part in the Christianity that is current, we have to distinguish between things that differ, between the truth and the form; to purge ourselves from vessels to dishonour.<a name=171:12></a> The path becomes a narrow one; it is a path that can only be discerned morally.<a name=171:13></a> There is a kind of sanctification within sanctification.<a name=171:14></a> Professedly Christendom

		In the two previous lectures we had before us the thought of the Kingdom and the House.<a name=175:1></a> If God sets up a kingdom, which He has done, there is the house of the kingdom.<a name=175:2></a> It is not simply that God has established the reign of grace; but that He dwells, in order that there may be blessing: "there he commanded the blessing, life for evermore".<a name=175:3></a> The Lord Jesus spoke of the same thing: "I know that his commandment is eternal life".<a name=175:4></a> God commands the blessing where He has set up His dwelling place, and that has become true in Christianity; the blessing is connected with God's house.<a name=175:5></a> In the millennium the same principle will hold good; when the world to come is displayed, there will be the house of the kingdom: two thoughts are presented in the Psalms and the Prophets, Jehovah reigns, and Jehovah dwells in Zion.<a name=175:6></a> You find those thoughts connected at the present time with the house of God.<a name=175:7></a> It is plain that blessing cannot be outside of the house of God.<a name=175:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point before me now is divine teaching: that follows on the establishment of the house.<a name=175:9></a> It is a point of great interest to all of us, because divine teaching is that by which we are formed.<a name=175:10></a> We all have to be formed; you may have an apprehension of the grace of God, but you may not be formed.<a name=175:11></a> The fact is that divine teaching comes in so that we may be formed for God.<a name=175:12></a> I cannot insist too much upon the importance of this, for what we are for God is the result of what God has formed; no one is beyond that for God.<a name=175:13></a> Whatever sense a person may have of the grace of God, the stature of no one is a bit beyond what he is by God's formative work.<a name=175:14></a> A person may

		have been really converted and brought into the enjoyment of the grace of God; but the sense of that that may grow old, and it has grown old with a great many people.<a name=176:1></a> If a Christian is to be maintained in freshness, there has to come in that which is produced by the formative power of divine teaching, and one does not grow old in that.<a name=176:2></a> There is nothing more important to us as Christians than to apprehend the formative power of the Spirit of God.<a name=176:3></a> That was God's thought even in regard to Israel: He brought them into the wilderness that He might teach them judgements and statutes; and they were to be formed by them.<a name=176:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage I have read we get a parable and two incidents; they are grouped together, in order, by the grouping, to convey to us a certain picture.<a name=176:5></a> In the parable of the Good Samaritan -- which is peculiar to this gospel -- Christ presents Himself to us under the idea of neighbour.<a name=176:6></a> He is neighbour to the man who has need of Him.<a name=176:7></a> In the following incident, Christ is seen as Revealer.<a name=176:8></a> In the house of Martha, Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and heard His word.<a name=176:9></a> Then in the beginning of the eleventh chapter we see Christ still in another character, and that is as Teacher: He teaches His disciples to pray.<a name=176:10></a> Now I believe the object of it was, that Christ intended to show the means by which the new Man was to be produced -- a new man where the old man was.<a name=176:11></a> It would be easy enough for God to produce a new man; but the point before God was to produce a new man where the old was.<a name=176:12></a> The old man was myself; and what God has set to work to do, in regard to Christians, is to produce a man of a new order in the very place where the old order was.<a name=176:13></a> The truth in Jesus is the having put off the old man, and put on the new.<a name=176:14></a> All that which is brought before us by the evangelist is in order that we may apprehend how the new man is formed.<a name=176:15></a> There are two things about the new man: one is a new susceptibility, and the other a new capability.<a name=176:16></a>

		If I were to take a dog, or any other intelligent animal, I could not communicate to it the susceptibility or the capability of a man.<a name=177:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if God can bring to pass in a man a susceptibility and a capability which never belonged to that man, in principle you have a new or different man.<a name=177:2></a> Whether as regards man before the fall, or after the fall, man as God made him had not the susceptibility or the capability of which I speak.<a name=177:3></a> I go a point farther: if he had remained what God made him, he might never have had this susceptibility and capability.<a name=177:4></a> The object of the passage I have read is to show by what means the new man is formed -- the new man which is after God's nature in righteousness, and holiness of truth.<a name=177:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a wonderful part of the gospel; and it hangs on what the Lord said in the first two verses which I read: "I thank thee, O Father", etc.<a name=177:6></a> I think the Lord introduces that thought because He was about to bring to light Christianity; therefore He speaks of the revelation of the Father, which is the great characteristic truth in Christianity.<a name=177:7></a> In the eighth and ninth chapters you do not get exactly Christianity, but the kingdom.<a name=177:8></a> In the eighth chapter we have the mysteries of the kingdom, and in the ninth, the vision of the kingdom.<a name=177:9></a> Many people have come into the mysteries of the kingdom that never come into the vision of the kingdom.<a name=177:10></a> In order to see the kingdom, you need to apprehend the glory of the Lord.<a name=177:11></a> The kingdom is bound up with Christ, as Lord, at the right hand of God, and the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=177:12></a> The kingdom is for God: it is the sway of God.<a name=177:13></a> But in the tenth and eleventh chapters, the kingdom is no longer the point: we have not what is for God, but what is for man; what is brought to light is what Christ would produce in man; the kind and order of man He would produce, and how He would produce him.<a name=177:14></a> This is what I want to make plain if I can, the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great principle is the neighbour, and the work of the neighbour is to set us perfectly at rest in Christ, and I do not believe that can be until we get the thought of the Priest.<a name=178:2></a> I do not think authority would ever give perfect rest in Christ.<a name=178:3></a> God's authority must be maintained; but authority will not exactly attach the heart to Christ; what will attach the heart to Christ is the knowledge of priesthood.<a name=178:4></a> You apprehend in Him a neighbour; a neighbour is not a lord.<a name=178:5></a> In the kingdom the question is of lordship and authority; a neighbour is one who lives next door to you, one upon whom you can in pressure fall back, on whose services you can count.<a name=178:6></a> The Lord is in the picture showing the transition from law to grace, and grace brings in the thought of the priest, and the neighbour is almost equivalent to the priest.<a name=178:7></a> It is the apprehension of Christ as being on our part, as having come close to us, so that you can always rely upon His service.<a name=178:8></a> If you have not apprehended Christ in that light, you have not the gain of the neighbour.<a name=178:9></a> Many confess Him as Lord who have very little apprehension of Him as neighbour.<a name=178:10></a> His service is effectual so long as you are down here.<a name=178:11></a> The Samaritan took up the man that fell among thieves, relieved him, and then carried him and cared for him as long as he was in want of care.<a name=178:12></a> That is what Christ is to us as neighbour: we are at His charges until He comes.<a name=178:13></a> He is the resource of His people.<a name=178:14></a> If I want succour, or sympathy, or encouragement, I fall back upon Christ: I can come boldly to the throne of grace.<a name=178:15></a> If you are in trouble through bereavement or loss, do not turn in the first place to man: turn to Christ; fall back upon the neighbour, then you will find that grace will work in others, so that you get sympathy on the part of the saints.<a name=178:16></a> You get more good and gain by turning to Christ than by turning to man; for He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the point of the passage which I read in Hebrews is to show us the qualifications of the Priest.<a name=179:2></a> There are three ideas connected with the Priest in that passage: firstly, He delivers from the fear of death; secondly, He has made atonement for the sins of the people; thirdly, He succours those that are tempted.<a name=179:3></a> That is what is ministered to us through the Priest.<a name=179:4></a> I stand no longer in the fear of death, for death is now the gateway that leads to the Lord.<a name=179:5></a> Then there is the sense of forgiveness; He is a merciful and faithful high Priest that has made atonement for the sins of the people; and then the qualification for this office is that, having been tempted, He can succour the tempted.<a name=179:6></a> Everyone will admit that you have an efficient neighbour -- one who can deliver from the fear of death, give the sense of forgiveness, and minister succour.<a name=179:7></a> What marks the present time is the ministration, not of law, but of grace.<a name=179:8></a> Christ has come down to where we were, in order that we might know Him in delivering power, as ministering to us the sense of forgiveness, and as able to succour us when we are tempted.<a name=179:9></a> I do not think people really understand grace if they do not apprehend the efficiency of Christ as neighbour, so that in every emergency and temptation into which we may come, we can avail ourselves of the One who is close to us.<a name=179:10></a> This is all connected with priesthood: priesthood is an essential part of the kingdom.<a name=179:11></a> This is brought out in the Old Testament, and will be made good in the millennium, for Christ will be a Priest upon His throne, and the counsel of peace is between the king and the priest.<a name=179:12></a> You get this thought in Zechariah.<a name=179:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mere authority would not always help us.<a name=179:14></a> The authority of Moses brought the children of Israel under the discipline of God; priesthood had to come in, and Aaron was there: when authority could not

	<div class="paragraph">
		help them, priesthood did.<a name=180:1></a> When we come into trial and temptation, authority alone would not avail us: we have a neighbour who is serviceable and efficient, who can sympathise with us in our infirmities; and that is the priest.<a name=180:2></a> If we laid hold of that, I think we should be restful and quiet down here; for whatever trouble or trial may come along, at all events there is One to whom we can always turn, so that we are never left desolate.<a name=180:3></a> Young people with plenty of health and vigour do not much know what trial is; but we see people sometimes come under overwhelming trial, and one might wonder how they will get on?<a name=180:4></a> The fact is, they do get on; they avail themselves of priesthood, and Christ affects the hearts of others, so that they get an amount of sympathy and support of which they never dreamt.<a name=180:5></a> They get it to a large extent through the saints; we turn to the throne of grace, and Christ, as Priest, affects the hearts of His people towards one another.<a name=180:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Under all circumstances, you may be restful in spirit.<a name=180:7></a> If you are not, you do not rightly come under the light of Christ; when people are like Martha, fussy and unrestful, they do not come under the influence of Christ.<a name=180:8></a> Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and heard His word.<a name=180:9></a> What could the word of the Son be?<a name=180:10></a> I think the word of the Son could be only one, and that is, to reveal God: I cannot understand the word of Christ in any other light.<a name=180:11></a> That was His peculiar testimony.<a name=180:12></a> The law and prophets declared the will of God and spoke of things to come, but they did not declare God.<a name=180:13></a> Who could declare God but Himself?<a name=180:14></a> God became His own testimony in order that He might be declared.<a name=180:15></a> All the way through, that was the testimony of Christ; it went right on to His death, for after all the great declaration of God was in the death of Christ.<a name=180:16></a> The veil of the temple was rent in twain for God was declared.<a name=180:17></a> It was absolutely impossible for the Jewish system to go on any longer.<a name=180:18></a>

		I think Mary was affected by His grace; she had learnt that Christ was neighbour.<a name=181:3></a> If the thought of Christ being neighbour to you has inspired your heart with confidence in Him, the next thing is that you will want to come abidingly under His influence: to be in the position in which Mary was found.<a name=181:4></a> His word is not so many articulations, but it is that which is expressed in Himself, the influence of which He will bring to bear upon you; He would bring the light and love of God to bear upon your heart.<a name=181:5></a> I have no doubt but that is what He brought home to the heart of Mary.<a name=181:6></a> Martha was cumbered about much serving.<a name=181:7></a> It is not simply that she was busy with the common occupations of life, but they distracted her.<a name=181:8></a> If you are in danger of being distracted from the influence of Christ, you ought to look to God for grace that He may deliver you from that which tends to distract you, so that you may be able to attend on the Lord with undistracted mind.<a name=181:9></a> Then you begin to get discernment of the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.<a name=181:10></a> It is amazing that people can be indifferent to the love of God -- to see the thousand and one distractions which find place in their hearts, so that they fail to occupy the place which Mary had.<a name=181:11></a> It is a most blessed place to be in: I think I may say I covet it; I would delight to sit at His feet, to be instructed in the love of God.<a name=181:12></a> No one can really instruct you in the love of God except Christ Himself.<a name=181:13></a>

		In Mary I see a susceptibility which never belonged to the natural man, not even before the fall.<a name=182:3></a> It is the fact of our having fallen under the power of evil which, when God begins to work, really brings about a susceptibility which man, as God created him, never had.<a name=182:4></a> I do not believe it would have been possible for man, as God created him, to have entered into the love of God in the way that we can who have fallen away from God; God uses even the depth to which man has fallen to create a susceptibility to His love.<a name=182:5></a> When I recognise the reality and the greatness of the fall, and see how God has come in to meet it in His grace, I can appreciate the love of God.<a name=182:6></a> I have no doubt that Adam had a great sense of the goodness and beneficence of God; but there was not the susceptibility to the love of God which there is in a fallen man when God has begun to work in that man.<a name=182:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the opening of the eleventh chapter, it is not a question of susceptibility, but of capability: the capability is consequent on the susceptibility.<a name=182:8></a> When you become acquainted with the love of God, you are then taught to cry "Abba, Father".<a name=182:9></a> You have come under the influence of Christ that you may be made acquainted with God's love, and the result is that there is a capability which never belonged to man as God created him.<a name=182:10></a> I do not think that Jews in the millennium will cry "Abba, Father": it is what is peculiar to Christians.<a name=182:11></a> As we appreciate the love of God we can freely address Him.<a name=182:12></a> If you have the capability of calling upon God as Father, it is really through the teaching of Christ.<a name=182:13></a>

		It appears to me to be extremely important for saints to get an apprehension of God's ways.<a name=184:1></a> I think a great many Christians lack spirituality because they do not understand them.<a name=184:2></a> Moses was led into the secret of God's ways, and the Spirit of God would lead us too into the same.<a name=184:3></a> I want to bring before you the order and continuity of the ways of God.<a name=184:4></a> I may say that the whole structure which God is building up with the greatest patience is entirely apart from the present order of things.<a name=184:5></a> God holds His hand over the present order of things -- keeps in check the different principles of evil at work in the world, but that is not the work of God; not even the ways of God.<a name=184:6></a> It is the overruling hand of God, very much connected with His providence, behind which God is hid.<a name=184:7></a> Now God would not be hid from us, and He has been pleased to make known to us the secret of His ways.<a name=184:8></a>

		What has already come before us is the kingdom; then we have had Christian fellowship, that is, the house of God, consequent on the kingdom; then the new covenant, which really means divine teaching.<a name=184:9></a> The covenant is the setting forth of God's disposition towards us, and hence for us is a thing to be learnt; it is that which can only be learnt by divine teaching.<a name=184:10></a> The covenant is that to which God has engaged Himself.<a name=184:11></a> If a man makes a will, he engages himself, as far as he can, to the provisions of the will; so God has engaged Himself to the provisions of the covenant, and the knowledge of that is the result of divine teaching in regard to us.<a name=184:12></a>

		teaching, and that is unity.<a name=185:1></a> It is in connection with unity that we get the idea of our testimony down here: the collective testimony of Christians is bound up with the thought of unity.<a name=185:2></a> It is enforced by the great truth of one body: but it is the unity of the Spirit, a unity expressed in mutual sensibilities, and service one to another.<a name=185:3></a> Whatever God has been pleased to give for service is to be exercised one towards another in unity.<a name=185:4></a> The thought of unity pervades Scripture.<a name=185:5></a> Israel and Judah are to be brought together in the future under one king, bound in one, in the unity, in a sense, of the Spirit; in the meantime, the Christ, the body, has come in, by one Spirit we are all baptised into one body.<a name=185:6></a> After the covenant, unity is the next great point in the ways of God.<a name=185:7></a> In the tenth chapter of this epistle we have the truth of fellowship, which is the principle of the house of God; in the eleventh, the new covenant, as seen in the Lord's supper; and in the twelfth, unity in the Spirit.<a name=185:8></a> If you accept that, you will admit the order in which I have tried to present things to you.<a name=185:9></a>

		Now in the tenth chapter, the point is the table of the Lord -- fellowship, and fellowship tests faithfulness.<a name=186:1></a> I see further that fellowship is hardly a thought connected with heaven, for in heaven you will not have any test of faithfulness, but fellowship down here is a test of faithfulness.<a name=186:2></a> It is true that even the children of saints, are, in a sense, entitled to the benefits of fellowship: they are baptised and brought thus within the sphere of fellowship, and God intends it to be so.<a name=186:3></a> But fellowship on the part of saints is really the test of faithfulness.<a name=186:4></a> Fellowship depends on an existing bond, and everyone in fellowship is under obligation to be true to that bond.<a name=186:5></a> If there is any infringement of the bond of fellowship, we are under responsibility to take notice of it.<a name=186:6></a> Our fellowship is to be maintained suitably to the Spirit of God; and if a person proves himself to be unworthy of fellowship, we deal with that person.<a name=186:7></a> One word in regard to discipline: assemblies have often made the mistake of judging cases.<a name=186:8></a> We are not called upon to judge a case; what we are called upon to judge, in regard of fellowship, is persons.<a name=186:9></a> The church of God is not a legal tribunal where the merits of a case are decided: it may have to judge a person, as to whether that person has proved himself unworthy of fellowship.<a name=186:10></a> The death of Christ is the bond of fellowship; that is the idea of the table of the Lord, hence the death of Christ is the test to us of everything down here.<a name=186:11></a> How could you go on with idolatry in the presence of the death of Christ?<a name=186:12></a> The Christian is to judge every association here by the light of Christ's death.<a name=186:13></a> Christ has died to the whole course of things here, and therefore I could not expect Christianity to be in honour in the world.<a name=186:14></a> Our fellowship involves separation from the world, and we have to maintain faithfulness to the bond.<a name=186:15></a> The great point is to be faithful now, so that we may be entrusted with authority in the kingdom.<a name=186:16></a>

		Now in the eleventh chapter we get divine teaching; for the Lord's supper really means divine teaching.<a name=187:1></a> We have the authority of Christ Himself for saying that the cup is the setting forth or expression of the new covenant.<a name=187:2></a> In the tenth chapter the cup comes first; in the eleventh, the bread; for the object in the tenth chapter is God, in the eleventh it is Christ.<a name=187:3></a> When it is a question of God, the blood comes first -- He has been met; when it is a question of Christ, as in the eleventh chapter, we have the import of His death, as set before us.<a name=187:4></a> It is first His body, our complete setting aside in His death; His body was given for us that we might be put completely out of view as to all that we are after the flesh.<a name=187:5></a> The cup is the setting forth of the love of God; and so it is called the cup of blessing.<a name=187:6></a> The cup expresses to us the new covenant -- the disposition of God towards us, and hence we get divine teaching in the cup.<a name=187:7></a> The death of Christ is the revelation of the love of God, to the end that an entirely new individuality might be stamped upon us, that there might be a complete change of "I" on the part of the Christian.<a name=187:8></a> The Lord's supper is simple in that way; you come to the Supper to call Him to mind, that He may have His own proper place with us.<a name=187:9></a> We call Him into conscious presence; and we are at the same time in moral accord with the lessons to be learnt from Christ's death.<a name=187:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After divine teaching comes unity, and unity is impressed in the fact that by one Spirit we are all baptised into one body (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:3">Ephesians  4:3</a>, 6; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:15">Colossians  3:15</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:16">John  10:16</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:11">John  17:11</a>, 20, 21, 23.<a name=187:11></a>) I have read these passages to show the immense importance which the Spirit of God attaches to unity, and our obligation, as being divinely taught, is to unity.<a name=187:12></a> In unity really lies practically, to a great extent, separation from the world; and there is connected with it another thought -- that of testimony to the world.<a name=187:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There was to be one flock and one Shepherd; testimony lay in unity.<a name=188:1></a> The obligation to unity lies in the fact of our being one by the Spirit.<a name=188:2></a> You get the truth of the body brought out in chapter 12: there is a body on earth the spirit of which is Christ.<a name=188:3></a> I do not here say the Head, for that is not brought out in Corinthians; the thought in this chapter is the body, the complete body is here, and that body is the body of Christ.<a name=188:4></a> Saints had been baptised into one body, and the spirit of that body was Christ.<a name=188:5></a> Hence in the latter part of the chapter the apostle says, you are Christ's body.<a name=188:6></a> But how could the flock subsist without a shepherd?<a name=188:7></a> They were to have the liberty of the Spirit in going in and out, finding pasture, being instructed in the love of God; but there was to be one flock, one Shepherd.<a name=188:8></a> That is what has come to pass.<a name=188:9></a> Jew and Gentile have been made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=188:10></a> There is no true Christian in the world without affection for Christ; for we have all been made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=188:11></a> It is a wonderful thing for God to have brought to pass down here the existence of a body of which Christ should be the spirit and principle.<a name=188:12></a> Hence the peace of Christ is to rule in our hearts.<a name=188:13></a> Bickerings and difficulties are not to be amongst saints; saints are not to be divided in thought and feeling.<a name=188:14></a> Do you think that nine-tenths of the things which trouble us would trouble Christ?<a name=188:15></a> The peace of Christ is to rule in our hearts; that is a first principle of unity -- the uniting bond of peace.<a name=188:16></a> Every one that composes the body has part in the life of Christ.<a name=188:17></a> The failure of man cannot affect what God has brought to pass.<a name=188:18></a> Saints may have failed in regard to fellowship; but the one body cannot fail, and the unity of the Spirit is enforced by the fact that there is one body.<a name=188:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point in the truth of the one body is that there is no such thing as pre-eminence; no member in that body can claim pre-eminence.<a name=188:20></a> No member of

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are under obligation to keep the unity of the Spirit -- to keep out everything that would bring disturbance in.<a name=189:6></a> A little bit of grit will interfere with the unity of the Spirit, the cherishing of a little bit of animosity or envy.<a name=189:7></a> We are called in one body to the peace of Christ.<a name=189:8></a> We have to look to it that we are not ready to take offence.<a name=189:9></a> We are to be thankful, and that is a great test.<a name=189:10></a> If you are offended and your spirit upset, you are not thankful: if you are continually thankful, it proves your spirit is not ruffled.<a name=189:11></a> I do not think there is a greater test to us down here than of abiding thankfulness.<a name=189:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point is mutual sensibility: if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it.<a name=189:13></a> If you see a brother becoming useful in the work of the Lord, you most heartily rejoice with him.<a name=189:14></a> If you see any decline of devotedness in another who has had part in the Lord's work, you suffer.<a name=189:15></a> This is a great principle, illustrated by the human body: there is reciprocal sensibility, because the body is of Christ.<a name=189:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more: unity is our testimony.<a name=189:17></a> Christ intended that there should be a testimony here upon earth which was not of the world, and the testimony of the church to the world was unity.<a name=189:18></a> That is what will be brought to pass in the heavenly city when it comes down from God; then will be witnessed in glory the unity of the church.<a name=189:19></a> The world will have testimony thus that the Father sent the Son.<a name=189:20></a> It is

		I was speaking of reciprocal sensibilities: these sensibilities, and the affections in which they lie, must take precedence of natural obligations.<a name=190:11></a> If God has been pleased to bind saints together in this way, so that there is a body here of which Christ is the Spirit, the obligations connected with that body must take precedence of all other obligations down here.<a name=190:12></a> I am not seeking to make light of these: I am under them myself; but the obligations which lie in the one body have the priority.<a name=190:13></a> If you carry out, by the grace of God, the obligations which properly belong to the body of Christ, you will find yourself greatly helped in carrying out natural obligations.<a name=190:14></a> The person

		If you look at the passage I read from Colossians, you will find that there are in it three thoughts: verse 18, Christ is the Head of the body; verse 21, you hath He reconciled; verse 24, His body, the church.<a name=194:8></a> So that you have first the head; then reconciliation; and lastly the body.<a name=194:9></a> You have to put these three thoughts together.<a name=194:10></a> It is remarkable that the passage does not put the head and the body together.<a name=194:11></a> After speaking of the head, the apostle brings in the thought of reconciliation, and then of the body.<a name=194:12></a> We have to learn things in that order.<a name=194:13></a> First you learn the truth of the Head, then you are able to see that the church is the first-fruits of reconciliation.<a name=194:14></a> Reconciliation is a very large scheme, and involves a great deal; but the church is the only thing at the present time which can be said to be reconciled.<a name=194:15></a> It is the first-fruits of reconciliation, not the completeness of it.<a name=194:16></a> The object in reconciliation is that everything may be for God.<a name=194:17></a> There is this difference between the new covenant and reconciliation: the new covenant

		First as regards the Head.<a name=195:2></a> Christ is not here looked at as being part of the body, but as Head of the body, very much like a husband is of a wife, and much like what Christ is in regard to principalities and powers.<a name=195:3></a> It is noticeable that it does not say here that He is from the beginning, nor in the beginning.<a name=195:4></a> In John's gospel He was "in the beginning", and in John's epistle, "from the beginning"; here it is "the beginning".<a name=195:5></a> If I were to speak of Christ as Lord, I should not speak of Him as the beginning, because the name of Lord presents to us the authority of God vested in a man.<a name=195:6></a> Lord conveys two great ideas, authority and administration.<a name=195:7></a> But when we view Christ as the Head, He is the beginning.<a name=195:8></a> Morally, Christ is as man the beginning of everything for God, and in the great end and issue of God's ways, everything will partake of Christ.<a name=195:9></a> We shall see that God has displaced one man, that every man may be of Christ.<a name=195:10></a> God tried one Man in a variety of ways, and removed him in the cross.<a name=195:11></a> Now He has introduced another Man according to His mind, and in the result of God's ways, everyone will derive from that Man.<a name=195:12></a> We derive from Him now; in the millennium Israel will derive from Him.<a name=195:13></a> You might pursue the subject into the eternal state, when all men will derive morally from Christ.<a name=195:14></a> It means the complete displacement of Adam in order that Christ may occupy his place.<a name=195:15></a> "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself"; that was a completely new departure in the ways of God.<a name=195:16></a> The mark of the moment, when Christ was down here upon earth, was that God was not imputing unto men their trespasses, but was reconciling the world unto Himself in Christ.<a name=195:17></a> He is the beginning.<a name=195:18></a>

		But you have another point: He is the first-born from the dead.<a name=196:1></a> If He had simply been the beginning, that would not have done for you and me.<a name=196:2></a> He was the beginning here after the flesh, the corn of wheat, but He abode alone; there was no real association with Christ after the flesh.<a name=196:3></a> For association resurrection had to come in.<a name=196:4></a> There was no common platform so long as Christ was here after the flesh, so He takes the position of first-born from the dead, that there may be a platform of association.<a name=196:5></a> You are risen with Him: that is the mind of God about you.<a name=196:6></a> In the eye of God you are outside of every order of man here: God has created a platform, in the resurrection of Christ, on which you can be in association with Him.<a name=196:7></a> We see the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of His disciples, so long as He remained with them; John could say, He dwelt among us, and we contemplated His glory, as of an only-begotten with the Father; but so long as He was here after the flesh, there was no association.<a name=196:8></a> In resurrection everything was changed: the Lord says, "I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=196:9></a> Association came in, because He was now the first-born from the dead.<a name=196:10></a> The new departure which marks God's ways is that Christ is the beginning and at the same time the first-born from the dead, in order that there might be a platform on which we can be with Him.<a name=196:11></a> He takes that place in regard to the church.<a name=196:12></a>

		The first principle in regard to the body is that Christ is the mind, the spirit of it.<a name=196:13></a> The moment I regard Him in the light of Head, He is distinct from the body.<a name=196:14></a> He loved the church and gave Himself for it; He is here distinct from the church.<a name=196:15></a> If I regard Him in connection with the body, He is the spirit of it; but to the church He is Head.<a name=196:16></a> No husband is lord to his wife, else he is a bad husband; he is head to his wife.<a name=196:17></a> Two things which the wife gains from her husband are the direction and support

		of affection; that is what Christ is to the church, which is the first-fruits of reconciliation.<a name=197:1></a> I will give you a simple thought of reconciliation: I think the scriptural idea of reconciliation is that complacency has come in where distance was.<a name=197:2></a> In becoming man, Christ brought in complacency in man.<a name=197:3></a> When He was born into the world, the angels were all moved; a multitude of the heavenly host was there, saying "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=197:4></a> There was divine complacency in a man.<a name=197:5></a> You get the confirmation of this in the baptism of Christ: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=197:6></a> Again, on the mount of Transfiguration.<a name=197:7></a> But there was not as yet complacency where distance had been.<a name=197:8></a> It is in the death of Christ that the distance is emphasised and marked.<a name=197:9></a> The One in whom was all the complacency cries on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=197:10></a>".<a name=197:11></a> He entered into distance to remove the distance; now the distance has gone, and the complacency remains.<a name=197:12></a> The distance has all been burnt up, as in the burning of the carcase of the sin offering without the camp, and now there remains nothing but the sweet savour of the burnt offering.<a name=197:13></a> Reconciliation was completely effected in the death of Christ.<a name=197:14></a> You may get the application of it to things; to the church, to us; to principalities and powers, but the great principle of it comes out in the death of Christ; that is what I should call the word of reconciliation.<a name=197:15></a> Before Christ died, in the moment of departure, He says, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"; the distance was gone, and there was complete complacency; but I have no doubt complacency comes out fully in resurrection.<a name=197:16></a> Just as the distance was marked on the cross, so complacency was marked in resurrection.<a name=197:17></a> All things -- principalities and powers -- are to be reconciled; there has been distance in regard to all of them; everything is to be taken up in Christ,

		Now it is said distinctly in regard to us, "And you .<a name=198:3></a>.<a name=198:4></a>.<a name=198:5></a> now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight".<a name=198:6></a> This refers to those that were sometime alienated and enemies in mind; you cannot alter or improve that.<a name=198:7></a> You cannot alter enmity of mind, for the reason that it is enmity of mind: God does not alter it.<a name=198:8></a> If it were a question of a fault or difficulty, I could understand its being repaired; but there is no such thing as repairing enmity of mind.<a name=198:9></a> The fact is, all has been removed, in the body of Christ's flesh through death.<a name=198:10></a> Everything of yourself, as to what you are morally by nature, has to go, and, for God, it has gone in the death of Christ.<a name=198:11></a> The old man has been removed for God, but the old man has to be put off in the case of the Christian; the old man is never amended.<a name=198:12></a> The way for us is the acceptance of the cross.<a name=198:13></a> The apostle Paul had to come to it.<a name=198:14></a> God would not tell you to put off what could be repaired; but if it cannot be repaired, it must be put off.<a name=198:15></a> We have to come to that point, to put off in regard to ourselves that which was put off in the cross of Christ for God.<a name=198:16></a> In human things, enmity means distance; if I nourish enmity against a man, I am distant from that man; and if there is enmity in the heart of man towards God, it implies distance.<a name=198:17></a> You see enmity in families; brother and brother in bitter enmity.<a name=198:18></a> In human things it is extremely difficult to bring about reconciliation; but in regard to God distance lies in will, and there is no such thing as reconciliation possible in that: it has to go.<a name=198:19></a> The Christian has put off the body of the flesh; he refuses and repudiates that which has gone for God.<a name=198:20></a>

		Now I come to the other side: that where distance was, there is complacency.<a name=199:1></a> Supposing it were possible for a man to be made friendly disposed toward God: that would not bring about complacency; it would not bring about that which is suitable to God, so that God could have complacency in it.<a name=199:2></a> God's way is to bring about complacency where distance was, so that His eye may rest upon that which is morally suitable to Himself I venture to say that at the present time, the church is the vessel of complacency.<a name=199:3></a> You may say, I know very little of it; I admit I have travelled very little on that road.<a name=199:4></a> Well, but that is what Christ died for, that where there had been distance there might be complacency.<a name=199:5></a> If we would be well pleasing to God, we ought to accept that, and to covet to be according to God's mind.<a name=199:6></a> You cannot attain holiness by faith; I do not think there ever was a greater delusion than such an idea.<a name=199:7></a> Righteousness is by faith, for the simple reason that it is not your righteousness, but God's; but holiness is partaking in the divine nature.<a name=199:8></a> If you are under the influence of love, you get holiness promoted.<a name=199:9></a>

		The idea of union is being brought to Christ where Christ is.<a name=202:1></a> Two great thoughts come out in Scripture in regard to Christians -- association and union, and the latter is more limited than the former.<a name=202:2></a> Association is connected with the Son of God, while union is with the exalted Man; association is a greater thought than union.<a name=202:3></a> The thought of association comes out in sonship; and then when the inheritance is brought in we get the thought of union.<a name=202:4></a> The practical bearing and meaning of union is that saints share in all that belongs to the Bridegroom; the bride shares with Him as Eve shared all that belonged to Adam.<a name=202:5></a> We do not get the idea of association in connection with Adam, but we do of union.<a name=202:6></a> We are associated with Christ as the Son of God, but we are united to Him as the exalted Man at the right hand of God.<a name=202:7></a> Both thoughts are unique, and belong to the church only; they are not co-extensive, the one is greater than the other.<a name=202:8></a> Rebecca is united to Isaac for His comfort, and she shares all that belongs to Him.<a name=202:9></a> The place of the bride as a faithful spouse is to stand to the truth that all centres in Him.<a name=202:10></a>

		We never have sonship in common with Christ; while we share sonship, we can never be sons of God in the sense that Christ is.<a name=202:11></a> The whole object of God in predestinating us to be conformed to the image of His Son is that He might have the place of pre-eminence -- "that he might be the firstborn among many brethren".<a name=202:12></a> But we share the inheritance in common with Christ.<a name=202:13></a> If we speak of the Son of God, it brings in the thought of what is proper to Him.<a name=202:14></a> But Christ has gone up to heaven, and has carried all

		In the end of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>we get the exaltation of Christ as Man, and then in chapter 2 we get the church exalted -- raised up with Him, and seated in Him.<a name=203:11></a> We have a place above; we have none here; and now the point is, that while we are here upon earth we should be faithful to the interests of Christ.<a name=203:12></a> God has not a single interest on earth connected with earth; every divine interest on earth has been taken up to heaven by Christ, and until He comes out of heaven nothing will be put right here, but meanwhile we are to be faithful to Christ's interests here.<a name=203:13></a> The papal system says, "I am no widow"; but the true place of the church is that of a widow.<a name=203:14></a> It is a time of fasting because the Bridegroom is not here.<a name=203:15></a> It is wonderful to apprehend Jesus as the glorified, exalted Man, and that we have a place where He is; the effect is that out of our inward parts flow rivers of living water.<a name=203:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter corresponds with the early part of <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>, "He was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.<a name=208:1></a> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.<a name=208:2></a> Little children, let no man deceive you; he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous".<a name=208:3></a> That is much akin to being "servants of righteousness".<a name=208:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to get hold of the fact that Christ has accomplished redemption, and become the Centre and Sun of a new system; He is the Sun of righteousness.<a name=208:5></a> This is the first principle we have to understand in order to enter into what it is to be in Christ Jesus.<a name=208:6></a> Being set free from sin, we have become servants to righteousness; we reckon ourselves alive unto God in Christ Jesus, where sin is not.<a name=208:7></a> "In him is no sin"; if we abide in Him we do not sin.<a name=208:8></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>we get Christ as the Head; He has come into the place of Head of every man provisionally, a place which He will occupy in the world to come.<a name=208:9></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>gives Christ's position; chapter 6 gives ours.<a name=208:10></a>

		Redemption is in Christ Jesus; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:24">Romans  3:24</a>.<a name=208:11></a> The purpose of God has been to take up His inheritance, and He takes it up in Christ; He has made Christ the Heir of all things.<a name=208:12></a> Redemption has come in that Christ may take up the inheritance as having removed all the encumbrances which lay upon it.<a name=208:13></a> Being in Christ involves having a link with Christ, and that link is by the Spirit, and a man must be free of liabilities -- he must have received forgiveness -- before he could have the Spirit.<a name=208:14></a>

		Sin is looked at in chapter 6 as a kind of rule; the reign of grace is contrasted with the reign of sin in chapter 5: 21.<a name=209:1></a> Sin in the flesh is taken up in chapter 8, but in chapter 6 it is looked at as the universal ruling principle here.<a name=209:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gift of the Spirit puts a man in Christ.<a name=209:3></a> No one is righteous relatively until he is in Christ; to be righteous relatively you must stand in relation to Christ as the divinely appointed Head, as the earth stands in relation to the sun.<a name=209:4></a> This goes further than justification.<a name=209:5></a> Justification is relative to offences, and is equivalent to forgiveness, but righteousness is relative to sin.<a name=209:6></a> Israel will stand in relation to Christ, and then they will be righteous.<a name=209:7></a> We are in Christ by the Spirit.<a name=209:8></a> By receiving God's testimony in the glad tidings we are justified from offences; then we receive the Spirit and are in Christ, and then we belong to the order of things according to God which is established in Christ.<a name=209:9></a> We are attached to Him in whom is no sin, and "whosoever abideth in him sinneth not".<a name=209:10></a>

		To present every man perfect in Christ is looked at as the effect of ministry, but it takes time to arrive at that, We begin as babes in Christ, and have to go on to be full grown in Christ.<a name=209:11></a> On God's side there is the complete setting forth of all His mind in regard of us in Christ, but on our side we have to grow up into Him in all things.<a name=209:12></a> If you want to know your righteousness, or sanctification, or redemption, it is all set forth in Christ, but we have to be expanded in intelligence, and to grow up into the apprehension of all that is God's will for us as set forth in Christ.<a name=209:13></a> The apostle laboured hard to bring the saints up to that, but there are many obstacles which stand in the way.<a name=209:14></a> Salvation is all perfect to be entered into, but it takes a long time to enter into it fully.<a name=209:15></a> We get liberated from one thing and then another, but God would have us brought into perfect freedom in every respect.<a name=209:16></a> If the Spirit

		Yes; we come under the law of that universe of which Christ is the beginning and Head.<a name=210:8></a> Christ has come into our view in that light, and it is in that way that we become servants of righteousness.<a name=210:9></a> The practice of righteousness is the proof that one belongs to that order of things of which Christ is the Head and Centre.<a name=210:10></a> Righteousness is doing right, it is fidelity in every divinely appointed relationship, and we practise righteousness as standing relatively righteous to the Centre and Sun of God's world.<a name=210:11></a> Under the law of Moses it was a question of God and one's neighbour, but now we have to take account of the divinely appointed Head.<a name=210:12></a> It is the righteous One who has accomplished righteousness, and in virtue of having done so He is the Sun of righteousness.<a name=210:13></a> He could not have done it had He not been God.<a name=210:14></a> The righteous One is divine, and now He is the Sun of righteousness, and we are righteous by standing in relation to Him.<a name=210:15></a>

		Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life.<a name=211:7></a> God intended to bring in eternal life, but there were rights of God to be regarded, and grace came in and took up all the liabilities in order that it might issue in the blessing of eternal life for man.<a name=211:8></a>

		It is moral.<a name=211:11></a> I have the appreciation of God which I had not before; there is the recognition of God in my heart, and hence I count myself to be alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=211:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great thing is to come under law or rule, then everything is right.<a name=211:13></a> The earth is under rule or law to the sun, and then it gets the benefits of rain and sunshine, and consequently it brings forth fruit.<a name=211:14></a> So with us; we are held by a moral bond to Christ, and therefore we are righteous in being attached to Christ the Head by the Spirit; we are bound up with a system of which the rule or law is righteousness.<a name=211:15></a> The result is we have our fruit unto holiness, because we get the benefit of the sun and the rain, and so there is fruit.<a name=211:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fruits of righteousness are by Jesus Christ; we are cleansed from all unrighteousness by getting into the bond of righteousness.<a name=211:17></a> The great thing is to be in the reality of the bond, and not to be content with the mere statement.<a name=211:18></a> Christianity is a system of which God is the Author, and Christ the divinely appointed Head, and we are to be under the rule which characterises that system.<a name=211:19></a> Christianity anticipates the world to

		Everlasting life is the great end and issue of God's way.<a name=212:6></a> The law brought in a ray of light, but it did not bring in what was in the heart and mind of God.<a name=212:7></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>gives us the issue of God's way, but chapters 6, 7 and 8 show how we are brought into liberty of soul in order that we may serve God.<a name=212:8></a> It is proper for the Christian to joy in God, but the question is, how are we to do so: chapters 6, 7 and 8 come in to show us the way of liberty.<a name=212:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God never calls upon us to believe anything about ourselves; we are to believe much about God and Christ.<a name=212:10></a> We take account of ourselves as being dead indeed unto sin; virtually we are free of a lawless world, free from its influences.<a name=212:11></a> Then in chapter 7 we are free from legality; most people think there is something due from them to God.<a name=212:12></a> Then in chapter 8 there is freedom from the flesh.<a name=212:13></a> There is a way by which we can be free from all these things, and until we are free we cannot really serve God.<a name=212:14></a> We must be in liberty in order to joy in God, and to serve Him.<a name=212:15></a> The highest point morally is in chapter 5, because it is the presentation of God to us, but we need what is unfolded in chapters 6, 7 and 8 in order that we may be free.<a name=212:16></a> The three chapters go together, they are not successive.<a name=212:17></a> We are not absolutely free from the three things spoken of -- sin, law, and the flesh -- but we are freed from their domination.<a name=212:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; the work of grace is to put us in Christ, but the great thing is to see what is involved in being "in Christ".<a name=214:3></a> We have to apprehend that Christ is the Centre and Head of the new divine system.<a name=214:4></a> Every family in heaven and earth is named of the Father, and all will be blessed in Christ; Israel will be blessed in Christ, and so will the nations.<a name=214:5></a> All that is connected with Christ's universal headship, but what marks the present time is that the church is in Christ.<a name=214:6></a> Then correlative to our being in Christ is the fact that Christ is in us.<a name=214:7></a> In this chapter it is Christ in us morally; it comes out in the way of character in the saints.<a name=214:8></a>

		I have thought collectively.<a name=214:11></a> The saints are the epistle of Christ, and they could not be so unless Christ was formed in them.<a name=214:12></a> John always takes the subjective side, so that in his writings we get more Christ in us.<a name=214:13></a>

		The point in this chapter is comfort.<a name=214:14></a> In chapter 13 there is every element of disturbance, but in this chapter every element of comfort.<a name=214:15></a> It is a great thing to be here with the heart not troubled, for there are a great many things which tend to trouble.<a name=214:16></a> Every heart knows its own bitterness, and I suppose every Christian knows what trouble and disturbance are in some way.<a name=214:17></a> "Comforter" is not the best rendering of the word; it is rather the idea of 'patron' or 'solicitor'; it is one who takes your cause in hand.<a name=214:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter we get first the thought of a place, and then the thought of access; the Lord speaks of these before He goes on to speak of the Comforter.<a name=215:2></a> If we had not a place we could not have access; the one hangs on the other; no one has liberty of access to the King save those who have the place.<a name=215:3></a> It is because He is there that we have the place and the moral effect of His going to prepare a place is that we have access.<a name=215:4></a> Our suitability as to having access is met in that He is "the way, and the truth, and the life", We get in Hebrews the introduction of a better hope, which we have "as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered".<a name=215:5></a> It is by that hope we draw nigh to God.<a name=215:6></a> If we have liberty of access to the Father it involves our going to the Father.<a name=215:7></a> So in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:18">Ephesians  2:18</a> we get "through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".<a name=215:8></a> That is preceded in verse 6 by "hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=215:9></a> We get the place, and then we have access as the result.<a name=215:10></a>

		It is very important to apprehend that there is such a principle in Christianity as law.<a name=230:1></a> It may seem paradoxical, but I think it has been too much lost sight of.<a name=230:2></a> It is a thought not very difficult to substantiate; a charge of the apostle Paul to the Galatians was, "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ".<a name=230:3></a> So James speaks of the perfect law of liberty.<a name=230:4></a> The Lord Himself speaks about a yoke: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me".<a name=230:5></a> The passages I have quoted are amply sufficient to substantiate the thought that in Christianity we have the principle of law.<a name=230:6></a> I do not mean law in a technical or formal sense, but the principle of law; and it seems to me that it is extremely important to maintain this, because it greatly helps us to understand the first great moral element in Christianity, and that is righteousness.<a name=230:7></a> I should be thankful if the Lord enabled me to bring it out in some little way.<a name=230:8></a>

		I have thought much of late that it is very important to apprehend Christianity in its moral characteristics; not simply as a system of faith, which really means very often a system of dogmatism -- a creed: that is not Christianity.<a name=230:9></a> Christianity is made up of a great many moral elements, which all blend like the colours of the rainbow, and when they are perfectly blended, there is no colour.<a name=230:10></a> The moral elements are there: they are blended in perfection, but we apprehend them in detail, for if we do not apprehend them in detail we cannot apprehend them at all.<a name=230:11></a> We have not yet come to that which is perfect in point of knowledge.<a name=230:12></a> I never feel much troubled at being accused of imperfection in the way of stating things; my answer is,

	<div class="paragraph">
		My subject, then, is law; that is, law in Christianity.<a name=231:2></a> And when I speak of law I do not mean law, as I said, in the technical sense, as it was in the case of Israel; but I mean the principle of rule in a moral sense.<a name=231:3></a> I do not believe God ever turns aside from this for a moment.<a name=231:4></a> I see even in the new heavens and the new earth the principle of rule: righteousness resides there.<a name=231:5></a> Righteousness is the expression of the principle of rule.<a name=231:6></a> I do not know any other term at all which would suffice to take its place: it is the great principle of rule morally.<a name=231:7></a> Righteousness is the law of the moral universe.<a name=231:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we go back to the beginning, in the order of things established in regard to the earth, we see the principle of rule.<a name=231:9></a> When God commanded the light to shine out of darkness, that was not rule, but on the fourth day God set lights in the heavens, the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night; and, as I have before pointed out, life is developed in the presence of light.<a name=231:10></a> You do not get life until the lights were set in the heavens to bear rule upon the earth.<a name=231:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the effect of sin was that man got morally outside of rule.<a name=231:12></a> Adam did his own will in defiance of the commandment of God.<a name=231:13></a> The commandment of God involved abiding in the rule of God.<a name=231:14></a> When Adam acted outside the commandment of God, he got away from rule, and into lawlessness.<a name=231:15></a> That is what the transgression of Adam meant.<a name=231:16></a> It comes out a little more distinctly in the case of Cain and Abel.<a name=231:17></a> Abel was righteous, abiding within rule morally -- he was not lawless; but his brother's works were evil -- Cain was lawless.<a name=231:18></a> Then in Cain's posterity the world became utterly lawless.<a name=231:19></a> They had departed from rule, and the lawlessness of the world brought in the flood.<a name=231:20></a> If you pay attention to Scripture, you will find that

		lawlessness brings in the judgement of God.<a name=232:1></a> The judgement of God came in at the flood because man had become lawless -- outside of rule in any moral sense.<a name=232:2></a> We see the same thing in Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=232:3></a> Men had completely turned aside from rule: they were failing to observe and respect the relationships that God had established down here; they were lawless, and that brought in the judgement of God.<a name=232:4></a> The same thing was true in regard to Israel: they became lawless, and that brought in the judgement of God upon them.<a name=232:5></a> Lawlessness brings in the righteous judgement of God, but not until it has been completely proved.<a name=232:6></a> I might have said the same thing in regard to the Canaanites and the people who inhabited the land of promise; lawlessness had to come to a climax before God interfered to cast out the inhabitants of the land.<a name=232:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the rule of righteousness is very simple; it is the maintenance of the relations in which it has pleased God in His wisdom to place man.<a name=232:8></a> No principle could be more simple.<a name=232:9></a> It has pleased God to set man upon earth in certain relationships, and righteousness is the maintenance of those relationships as God has established them.<a name=232:10></a> If men fail to observe these relationships, it makes manifest the principle of lawlessness: man has got outside of rule in any moral sense.<a name=232:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take up for a moment the dealings of God in regard to Israel.<a name=232:12></a> The position was peculiar.<a name=232:13></a> Israel, when brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, was entirely unlike the rest of the world: it was a little world of its own, completely separated from all the rest of the world.<a name=232:14></a> I daresay most will remember the prophecies of Balaam.<a name=232:15></a> The first was, the people were to dwell alone, and not to be numbered among the nations.<a name=232:16></a> Then they were justified in the eye of God.<a name=232:17></a> There is a description then of their beauty as seen dwelling in their tents, and the last prophecy is of their

		ultimate glory: that is in connection with Christ.<a name=233:1></a> I refer to that in proof of the point which I mentioned, that when God brought Israel into the wilderness, it was a little world of its own with God as its centre.<a name=233:2></a> They were a kind of choice people, the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and God was in their midst.<a name=233:3></a> Almost the first proposition, when they were brought into the wilderness, was that God would set up His dwelling-place among them, and consequently He took from them what was needful for a dwelling-place.<a name=233:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like everyone to seize the importance of that: there was a world having its own peculiar character.<a name=233:5></a> All the great world was going on outside them -- the Canaanites on one side and Egypt on the other -- Israel was in the wilderness, shut off from any other nation; but the dwelling-place of God was there in their midst.<a name=233:6></a> They never dared to move without the tabernacle; and whenever they rested, they did so with the tabernacle in their midst.<a name=233:7></a> They might rest for a day, or a month, or a year; but whenever they rested, the tabernacle was in their midst.<a name=233:8></a> There never was anything on the face of the earth like it: a world of which God was the centre.<a name=233:9></a> When God brought them into the wilderness, He brought them to mount Sinai and gave them a law, because they must be under rule.<a name=233:10></a> I am not now speaking of what might be called the ceremonial law; but a people with God in their midst must be within rule, and therefore God propounded rule to them.<a name=233:11></a> It was the only principle on which it was possible for God to be among them.<a name=233:12></a> How could God be in the midst of a lawless people?<a name=233:13></a> In the very nature of things, if God proposed to dwell among them, He must propose law to them.<a name=233:14></a> God gave them a law, and they were to abide in that law.<a name=233:15></a> They were tested by it, and the continuance of God among them was dependent on the people continuing in the law.<a name=233:16></a> If they did not, God would not continue among them.<a name=233:17></a>

		Well, things went on: the people came into the land.<a name=234:1></a> They did not continue in God's covenant, and God says, "I regarded them not".<a name=234:2></a> God sent many prophets to recall them to the covenant; but the people would not be recalled, and eventually they were cast off because they had broken the covenant.<a name=234:3></a> The effect of God's dealings with Israel was to make manifest the lawlessness of man.<a name=234:4></a> It had come out before the flood; but it never came out in such a way as it did with Israel.<a name=234:5></a> The people before the flood never had the opportunities and privileges which Israel enjoyed.<a name=234:6></a> They never had a law proposed to them; and when lawlessness came out in Israel, it came out worse than in Sodom or Gomorrah.<a name=234:7></a> They would not have God: that is what was proved through the law; they became idolaters, worse than the heathen, and were carried away captive to Babylon because they did not continue in God's covenant.<a name=234:8></a> The law made manifest the lawlessness of man: it may be that God intended it should.<a name=234:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is in contrast to law-giving in this respect: Christianity is not intended to make manifest the lawlessness of man, but the work of God.<a name=234:10></a> In the case of Israel, the question was not of the work of God, because God was testing man after the flesh.<a name=234:11></a> There were individuals in the midst of Israel in whom there was a work of God; but speaking in general, God was testing a people after the flesh, and it was a question of man and his state.<a name=234:12></a> The law was added for the sake of transgressions, that is, to make evident the lawlessness of man.<a name=234:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christianity is morally Christ; and Christ did not come here to make manifest man's lawlessness, but the work of God.<a name=234:14></a> There is, then, a great contrast between the law and Christianity.<a name=234:15></a> In connection with the work of God, you get a race, a company down here upon earth, who are within rule, and that never could be apart from the work of God: man could never

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>.<a name=235:4></a> It says in verse 21, "his deeds are wrought in God"; the work of God is in such an one.<a name=235:5></a> How could a man's deeds be wrought in God if there were not the work of God?<a name=235:6></a> We see in verse 19 that the coming of the Lord made manifest that man's deeds were evil, the light confirmed the law; what the law had proved, the light proved.<a name=235:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first epistle to Timothy, speaking of law teachers, the apostle shows that what was condemned by the law was condemned by sound doctrine according to the gospel.<a name=235:8></a> The light condemned what the law condemned; the light made manifest that men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.<a name=235:9></a> The necessary effect of God coming into the world was to make manifest that there were those who continued in darkness; but at the same time it had another and a much more important effect -- it brought to light the work of God.<a name=235:10></a> That was the purpose of the light coming into the world -- to bring to light the work of God.<a name=235:11></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>the first great point that comes out is the new birth; that is the work of God.<a name=235:12></a> Then the second great truth is the testimony of God.<a name=235:13></a> Then in the fourth chapter you get the gift of living water; that is the Spirit.<a name=235:14></a> That must always be the order: there is the work of God, which ever has been, and is now going on where the testimony is.<a name=235:15></a> The testimony comes in to make the work of God manifest; then there comes in the gift of the Spirit, which is the water that Christ gives, in the believer a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=235:16></a>

		I will say a word or two now in connection with the light.<a name=236:1></a> There are two things which are manifest in connection with Christ: one is that He is light, and the other that He is a gathering point.<a name=236:2></a> The Lord Jesus said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "and I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=236:3></a> He is the centre of the universe of God and the gathering point for man.<a name=236:4></a> But He is also the light: He has brought into the presence of man the light of God's testimony.<a name=236:5></a> We get that very distinctly in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>.<a name=236:6></a> The cross of Christ brought into the presence of man the testimony of God's love, and the love of God never can be learnt except in the cross.<a name=236:7></a> The only begotten Son of God is no longer here upon the earth; when He was here He was the light and the witness of God.<a name=236:8></a> He is here no longer; but what is here is the light of the cross, and the cross is the declaration of the love of God.<a name=236:9></a> The death of Christ was sacrificial as on behalf of man, but it was declaratory on the part of God.<a name=236:10></a> The love of God was declared there and the love of God cannot be learned apart from the death of Christ.<a name=236:11></a> I do not think anyone would dispute this for a moment.<a name=236:12></a> Christ is the testimony of God, and that testimony is brought close to man, into his presence, in the death of Christ.<a name=236:13></a> The One who suffered on the cross was a Man for men, but that Man was God's only begotten Son.<a name=236:14></a> There divine love is brought into the presence of man, and close to man.<a name=236:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire to bring before you in reading this passage, is the thought that the Lord has His mind in regard to the whole state of things around us in the professing church.<a name=246:1></a> I think this is a point of the greatest moment for every Christian to apprehend, and it ought to be the desire of everyone to be in the secret of the Lord's mind.<a name=246:2></a> We get what I may call the whole history of the professing church brought under our notice prophetically in the second and third chapters.<a name=246:3></a> There is no doubt that there were these seven churches existing in Asia when John wrote, and they are taken up as having certain marks and characteristics which enabled the Spirit of God through them, to portray the history of the professing church on earth, from the beginning to the end.<a name=246:4></a> I do not think that anyone acquainted with Scripture can doubt this.<a name=246:5></a> There was a time when we knew but little about the book of Revelation, but it is better understood now.<a name=246:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is a great principle running through the word of God, that is, that whenever God places Himself in relation with a people, He marks the fact that He is God, by foretelling the end of the dispensation from the beginning.<a name=246:7></a> Critics may disdain the idea of prophecy, but facts remain, and God in that way has proved that He is God.<a name=246:8></a> I might go through the Scriptures in detail, and show you how the result has always verified the forecast.<a name=246:9></a> God makes the forecast, and God only can make it.<a name=246:10></a> Men talk about forecasts, and to a certain extent a shrewd man may make such.<a name=246:11></a> I can understand a man putting things together, and discerning the probable operation of

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just give you an example or two, because it is important.<a name=247:3></a> Before Israel entered Canaan God foretold their captivity.<a name=247:4></a> They carried with them into the land, in the book of Deuteronomy, the witness of what would befall them there.<a name=247:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again the prophet Isaiah, before the Babylonish captivity, takes up the subject and shows how God would bring back a remnant from Babylon, and would present Christ to them and that they would reject Him.<a name=247:6></a> I need hardly say that God spoke truly.<a name=247:7></a> Another case is when God gave up His people in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, and committed supreme power to the Gentile.<a name=247:8></a> At that time, God foretold what would be the end of it.<a name=247:9></a> I have heard of wise people, or rather those who think themselves wise, who tell us that the book of Daniel never was written by him, but I prefer to believe on the authority of the Lord that it was written by Daniel.<a name=247:10></a> Daniel did not prophecy of what was to take place in the succeeding few years merely, but he gives us the whole of the times of the Gentiles, and speaks of the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, that should fall upon the feet of the image and break to pieces the whole Gentile power, every bit of it, from top to bottom.<a name=247:11></a> All that goes on to the future.<a name=247:12></a> Now when you come to the New Testament you find the kingdom of heaven set up, and the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>foretells the end from the beginning.<a name=247:13></a> It began with the sowing of the seed, but the end is described in a variety of parables -- tares, mustard seed, leaven, etc.<a name=247:14></a> From the time the seed was sown, the Lord predicts what the end would

		be; that it would become a great conspicuous thing like a tree and the fowls of the air should lodge in its branches; and the Son of Man finally sends His angels and gathers out of the kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity.<a name=248:1></a> Then in the Revelation we get the same principle in the seven churches.<a name=248:2></a> The history is taken up from Ephesus, which was a remarkable church in many ways; its history is largely traced in Scripture, and going on from Ephesus to Laodicea, we get a complete picture of the whole time of the church from the beginning down to the end.<a name=248:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My point is this, to give you an idea that the Lord has His mind, specially and very definitely in regard to the whole state of things by which we are surrounded down here.<a name=248:4></a> It greatly affects me.<a name=248:5></a> I hardly know any thought which has affected me more distinctly than that.<a name=248:6></a> One may have a thought more or less right as to things but if I have the Lord's thought that must be right.<a name=248:7></a> How many would be concerned if they thought that the Lord had a mind about things here?<a name=248:8></a> The fact is that Christendom goes largely on the assumption that the Lord has no mind about it at all, that all is left to man.<a name=248:9></a> If you see that, it leads you to think very seriously.<a name=248:10></a> I know it affected my life very much when the truth was brought home to me, that the Lord was watching with interest all that was going on in His name down here, and it still greatly affects me, and I think many here can say the same.<a name=248:11></a> We want to be in the secret of His mind, to have His thought: "He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches".<a name=248:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I venture to say, that the Lord has not any particular mind with regard to the world; the world is looked upon in Scripture as that which has rejected Him, and in that sense it is left under the hand of God.<a name=248:13></a> Christ will have His mind as to it by and by, but not now; now, He has a thought in regard to the church.<a name=248:14></a>

		There are two ways in which I can speak about the Lord in connection with the church.<a name=249:1></a> One is that He is the Minister of the sanctuary; He orders everything connected with the worship of God; He has to do with those who are true Christians; He leads them in the worship and service of God.<a name=249:2></a> He is the antitype of Aaron, who had to carry on the service of God; he was charged with the ordering of the lamps and the shewbread, and had to do with the vessels of service.<a name=249:3></a> In all this he was a type of Christ.<a name=249:4></a> Christ takes the place of Minister in resurrection.<a name=249:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee".<a name=249:6></a> He is Leader.<a name=249:7></a> We get this amplified in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=249:8></a> He is the Minister of the holy places, of the true tabernacle; the true antitype of Aaron and of Moses too, but the antitype of Aaron.<a name=249:9></a> The priesthood being changed the character of the service is changed.<a name=249:10></a> Christ has offered the sacrifice that can cleanse our consciences; we have purged consciences, but that is not all the truth.<a name=249:11></a> When it comes to serving the living God then it is that He, properly speaking, leads the praises of His people.<a name=249:12></a> He is the Minister of the holy places: He is a great deal more, because He is the antitype of Moses, but He is the true Priest.<a name=249:13></a> The order of Christendom is all against this; there are many priests there, also a great many Christians who have no idea of being companions of Christ.<a name=249:14></a> Every Christian has his part in the service of God, just as each son of Aaron had his part.<a name=249:15></a> I can tell you why things subsist as they do in the common order of Christendom -- ministers, clergy, people, etc.<a name=249:16></a>; it is because all sense of the power of the Spirit of God has been lost.<a name=249:17></a> Order and rule of a human kind came in when Christians lost the sense of the presence of the Spirit.<a name=249:18></a> If they had any sense of the power and presence of the Spirit of God, they would understand what it is to be associated with the High Priest -- who

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=250>[Page 250]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		leads the praises -- in the service and worship of God.<a name=250:1></a> There may be some in every congregation who ought to be taking their part in the service.<a name=250:2></a> In a general way in Christendom, all is entrusted to one official and the others -- many of whom are perhaps qualified by the Spirit of God -- are concealed, and this one man is put over them by the ordering of man: the reason is plain enough, Christians have lost all sense of the presence and power of the Spirit of God.<a name=250:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another character in which Christ stands to the people of God; He is Son over God's house.<a name=250:4></a> When I speak of the house of God, the term covers all those who profess the name of Christ.<a name=250:5></a> There are many in the great mass of profession around, who are really Christians indwelt by the Spirit of God, but then there is the great external system -- and my point is, that Christ has His mind about that in every part of it -- this is a point of importance to understand.<a name=250:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now make a few remarks on the chapter read.<a name=250:7></a> To begin with, it is exceedingly important to notice, that to the angel of the last three churches, the Lord speaks of Himself in titles connected with the millennium.<a name=250:8></a> It shows me this -- that if attentive, we shall find ourselves in the light of the world to come and consequently be discontented with all that is here, as must be the case if our hearts are in the light of the world to come; I will just explain this in detail.<a name=250:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Sardis He has the seven Spirits of God, that is the Spirit in relation to the millennium; the Spirit is not spoken of in this way except in relation to the earth.<a name=250:10></a> In Philadelphia He is the Holy and the True, but there is another point, viz.<a name=250:11></a>: that He has the key of David and opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens.<a name=250:12></a> A key is a symbol of administration, and it is the administration which Christ has in relation to the earth.<a name=250:13></a> When I pass on to Laodicea, I find Him

		there as the Amen; the confirmation of the promises of God; the faithful and true Witness, which is the place that He Himself takes in the millennium, when every other witness has proved unfaithful.<a name=251:1></a> It is well to weigh these titles; they bring us very much into the light of the world to come.<a name=251:2></a> Everything for God is established in Christ, and if you are in the light of Christ you are in the light of the world to come.<a name=251:3></a> Christ has come, redemption has been accomplished.<a name=251:4></a> God has exalted Him and has given Him a name above every name, not simply in this world, but in that which is to come.<a name=251:5></a> He has set Him at His own right hand in heavenly places, and every promise and purpose of God is established in Him.<a name=251:6></a> We are in the light of that.<a name=251:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to speak a few words on what comes out in the addresses to these churches.<a name=251:8></a> There is Sardis on the one side and Laodicea on the other.<a name=251:9></a> I think that each of them depicts a state of things with which we are familiar.<a name=251:10></a> We have a great mass in Christendom in this part of Europe who are marked by having become political and worldly, having a name to live, because what they are connected with (as having started with) was the vindication of the word of God, and escape from the corruption of popery, but spiritually all has become dead.<a name=251:11></a> Of what does the Lord warn them?<a name=251:12></a> I will come on thee as a thief if thou shalt not watch.<a name=251:13></a> One of the characteristics of a Christian is that he watches, and the Lord here says, "If you do not watch I will come as a thief".<a name=251:14></a> That is, He treats them as the world; the Lord comes to the world like a thief in the night, that only tends to show you the moral identification of Sardis with the world.<a name=251:15></a> Protestantism has become political and worldly, and the Lord will come upon it as a thief; they will not know the hour in which He comes.<a name=251:16></a> He does add, "Thou hast a few names, even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments".<a name=251:17></a> That is, they have escaped the corruption of the world.<a name=251:18></a> That is one side.<a name=251:19></a>

		Now I will ask any thoughtful person here, to look abroad and tell me whether that is not the true character of things around us; the savour of the truth, and the idea of the coming of the Lord have been lost, but the Lord is deeply concerned in all that is going on.<a name=252:1></a> I do not point to any particular body, but Protestantism has largely become a vast political machinery, and we can understand the Lord saying, "I will come on thee as a thief".<a name=252:2></a> One of the Lord's last sayings was, "Watch ye, therefore; for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning", and the last word of that passage is: "What I say unto you I say unto all, watch".<a name=252:3></a> Sardis does not watch.<a name=252:4></a> I should not like to be here and not watching, to be overtaken by the Lord as a thief.<a name=252:5></a> People will be; when they say, "Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them".<a name=252:6></a>

		Now turn to the other side, to Laodicea.<a name=252:7></a> What marks Laodicea is the pretension of the human mind, higher criticism and the like.<a name=252:8></a> They are rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; but do not know that they are "wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked".<a name=252:9></a> They do not know the misery of their spiritual condition.<a name=252:10></a> That is what I understand by being rich and increased with goods.<a name=252:11></a> They say, Man's mind is competent for everything; we can trace the sources from which the word of God came and can judge of it all: and yet after all they have not the faintest spiritual idea of what the word of God is.<a name=252:12></a> They deal with the letter only, and that in the most superficial way.<a name=252:13></a> If they were asked to explain what is meant by "The letter kills, but the Spirit giveth life", they could not tell you; nor could they explain the meaning of the expression "The Lord is that Spirit".<a name=252:14></a> They may be very clever and able in oriental languages, and all that kind of thing, and you might pay attention to them as regards the

		Just one word more: He says, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=255:6></a> That is another engagement.<a name=255:7></a> It signifies that they will not pass through the tribulation that is to try all that dwell upon the earth.<a name=255:8></a> This has its application to the whole true church.<a name=255:9></a>

		The Lord says, "I will come to you".<a name=264:3></a> I will minister comfort to you.<a name=264:4></a> Comfort is that we have a place in His affections, and He has His place in ours.<a name=264:5></a> We want to make room for Christ in our hearts, and how is this done?<a name=264:6></a> By being careful that nothing shall contest the supremacy of Christ in our affections.<a name=264:7></a> "If one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again".<a name=264:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You may be sure of this, that when Christ was on earth, the Father was not far off.<a name=265:12></a> The Lord said, "I am not alone, because the Father is with me".<a name=265:13></a> And if the Comforter is here, Christ is not far distant; where there is attachment to Christ, there He makes Himself manifest.<a name=265:14></a> You then find Christ very close to your heart, there is no form seen, and yet the Spirit brings Him home to you; He comforts and strengthens you.<a name=265:15></a> He is the Bridegroom, and we are in the position of the bride; He has attachment for us, and we are attached to Him.<a name=265:16></a>

		THE PERSON OF THE CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While extremely unwilling to enter on the field of controversy, especially on subjects touching the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, I have thought it right, in the interests of the truth and of the Lord's people, to put out a few remarks on two points of importance which have been in question.<a name=268:1></a> In so doing I decline to reply to any attacks which have appeared, based on isolated statements culled from letters I have written, partly from reluctance to notice them, and partly because I see in these attacks the tendency to shift (it may be almost unconsciously) the ground of conflict, in order to gain a point of vantage.<a name=268:2></a> In what I have to say I adhere therefore to two points that have been in question, which are these
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) As to whether Christ is ever viewed in Scripture as man, distinct and apart from what He is as God.<a name=268:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) As to whether the truth of His Person consists in the union in Him of God and man; a favourite formula with those so holding is "God and man one Christ" -- and with this is connected the idea that every title referring to Christ covers the whole truth of His Person.<a name=268:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I affirm that the denial of the first, while claiming to maintain orthodoxy, is destructive of Christianity in its real power; and I would affectionately warn saints against giving up, in zeal for orthodoxy, the blessed foundations of Christianity.<a name=268:5></a> Further, that the assertion of the second is derogatory and dishonouring to the Son; and I proceed to show that both the denial and the assertion are contrary to the teaching of Scripture.<a name=268:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first betrays a singular inability to apprehend the great reality of the incarnation, at all events in a most essential aspect of it, namely, the fact of Christ
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=269>[Page 269]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		having by it a place as man God-ward.<a name=269:1></a> As the Word become flesh He dwelt among men and revealed God, and in Him all the fulness was pleased to dwell; but He Himself filled and still fills a place as man toward God (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>); and the two thoughts are wholly distinct conceptions, which cannot be grasped at one and the same time by any finite mind.<a name=269:2></a> "No one knows the Son save the Father".<a name=269:3></a> As Man He is both Apostle and High Priest.<a name=269:4></a> In other words in the Apostle God has, so to say, come out, and in the High Priest man has entered in.<a name=269:5></a> Now these two thoughts, though realised in one Person, must of necessity be separately and distinctly apprehended.<a name=269:6></a> The one presents God, the other, man.<a name=269:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reality of Christ's manhood in its aspect God-ward is amply presented in the New Testament.<a name=269:8></a> There we have the truth, that Christ, having died to sin once, lives to God; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=269:9></a> The having put off the old man and having put on the new is said to be, "as the truth is in Jesus", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=269:10></a> Christ Jesus before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6">1 Timothy  6</a>.<a name=269:11></a> He sings praises to God in the midst of the assembly; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=269:12></a> He praises in the great congregation; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=269:13></a> He has entered in for us as Forerunner; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>.<a name=269:14></a> He appears in the presence of God for us; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>.<a name=269:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, while fully admitting that morally Christ's manhood had its unique and blessed character from God, for in becoming man He gave character to manhood, yet in the thoughts above presented it is utterly impossible to introduce the idea of Deity in its proper character and attributes, because in every case it is man that is presented, or rather, Christ is viewed in the light of man God-ward.<a name=269:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The refusal of this is destructive of Christianity in its true power, for it is on the side that I have indicated that Christ is placed within the reach of our appropriation, so that we can eat Him and live by Him.<a name=269:17></a> He is,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=270>[Page 270]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as second Man, the pattern of our blessing, the Leader of our salvation.<a name=270:1></a> He draws us to Himself by making known to us His love; and the affection on our part begotten by this appropriates Him as the expression and pattern of what we are according to the counsel of God; and it is in this way that the believer is led into the true sense of the greatness of his portion, and even partakes morally in the life of God.<a name=270:2></a> As "Lord" Christ is the Object of faith, as Head He is held by the believer, who is led by Him into heavenly blessing.<a name=270:3></a> Hence I am entirely at a loss to understand how the truth of Christianity can be maintained in the absence of the apprehension of Christ in His place as man God-ward, distinct and apart from the glory and attributes which belong only to God, and in which Christ has part as Himself being a divine Person.<a name=270:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may observe here that Christians are, as a rule, uninstructed in three important points of Christian doctrine:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) Reconciliation, which they do not know as in the mind of God.<a name=270:5></a> The distance between God and the sinner must have been removed to effect it, and but few know the nature of the distance.<a name=270:6></a> They do not see that the man after the flesh has been terminated judicially in the cross in the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=270:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) Christ as manna.<a name=270:8></a> They do not apprehend in any degree the manner of life of Christ here as Man, "the life of Jesus".<a name=270:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) The mystery.<a name=270:10></a> They have no true conception that the church is the complement of the Man who glorified God here; but while admitting that all saints are united to Christ, they are leavened with the error that they are united to the Son of God, and they thus betray their ignorance of the mystery.<a name=270:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, it is not surprising that many find difficulty in the apprehension of Christ in the point of view which I have sought to make plain.<a name=270:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=271>[Page 271]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second error maintains that the truth of Christ's Person consists in the union in Him of God and man.<a name=271:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this idea arises, I judge, from confusion of thought as between person and condition, and has been fostered by expressions found in hymns, and the like, which have been used simply and devoutly by Christians without any very strict inquiry into their real force; but it involves a thought very derogatory to the truth of the Son, namely, that in becoming Man a change has taken place as to His Person -- He is in Person something which He was not before.<a name=271:2></a> This is not the teaching of Scripture, nor do I think that it can be entertained.<a name=271:3></a> When I come to the word, I find that while in three gospels the truth of Christ in certain official positions is prominent, the fourth (John) is given to us to afford full light as to His Person, that is, "the Son"; and in this respect He is seen in three positions, namely, as eternally with the Father, as come into the world, and as going back to the Father, the same Person unchanged and unchangeable.<a name=271:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further than this, the Person is even viewed as acting in regard to His form or condition, divine or human; "Being in the form of God, he emptied himself and took on him a servant's form, becoming in the likeness of men".<a name=271:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He comes to do God's will in the body prepared for Him.<a name=271:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He raises up the temple of His body.<a name=271:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He gives His flesh for the life of the world.<a name=271:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He lays down His life (human condition) to take it again.<a name=271:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus a divine Person presented, even apart from the question of form, and the idea of the unity of the Person in the sense asserted is not found.<a name=271:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The One who being in the form of God, emptied Himself, and took on Him a servant's form, is the same who, having become Man, humbled Himself,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=272>[Page 272]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and became obedient to the death of the cross, and is now highly exalted.<a name=272:1></a> There is no idea either of unity, or of change, in the Person.<a name=272:2></a> It is the same Person in servant's form, and entering into what that form involved.<a name=272:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of a divine Person assuming human condition, the Word becoming <i>flesh</i>, and in such wise as that He can be viewed objectively as man, I believe; but that is not a question of unity of a Person.<a name=272:4></a> It is a Person in a condition in which He was not previously.<a name=272:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another idea connected with the above appears to be that every title or name inherited by the Son or applied to Him in Scripture embraces or covers, if it does not describe, the whole truth of His Person.<a name=272:6></a> Now I believe this to be a fallacy, and a mistaken way of apprehending Scripture.<a name=272:7></a> Unquestionably the Lord is identified or designated, and designates Himself, by official names or titles, as "the Christ" or "Son of man"; but such titles, though serving sufficiently to identify or designate the Person, do not cover the truth of His Person; and different titles applied to or fulfilled in Christ have to be understood each within its own appropriate limits.<a name=272:8></a> They describe the office, but not the Person that holds the office.<a name=272:9></a> In the same way we commonly use official and acquired titles, as 'The Queen', 'The Colonel', 'The Doctor', to identify or designate a person, but we have no idea that such a title is descriptive of the person, or covers all that is true of the person, though once the person is so designated, many things can be said which refer to the person, and have nothing whatever to do with the particular designation; for instance, I might say, 'When the Queen was a child'.<a name=272:10></a> She was not queen as a child.<a name=272:11></a> It is simply a title used for designation, which has its own particular force and meaning.<a name=272:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus is the anointed of God, that is, the Christ, but not properly so until He was anointed, whatever might be true in purpose.<a name=272:13></a> So too, He was not Son
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=273>[Page 273]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		of man until He became Man, yet He says, "The Son of man came to minister".<a name=273:1></a> "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?<a name=273:2></a>" "The Son of man which is in heaven".<a name=273:3></a> The simple fact is that a title serves to designate the Person, without being descriptive of the Person, or involving any question of the unity of the Person.<a name=273:4></a> The titles "The Christ" and "Son of man" are both official titles which could have had no place or meaning except in the Son having become Man; and it is remarkable that the Lord does not in the gospels use what is, perhaps, the nearest approach to a personal name, that is, Jesus, in the same way.<a name=273:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I earnestly entreat saints to come prayerfully and patiently to Scripture to get their thoughts of Christ formed by the word of God; and not to adopt the creeds or moulds into which men, often with pious intent, have cast the truth in the vain effort to guard against error; and it is significant that those who have of late come forward to expose what they deemed to be error, have shown a tendency in their minds in the direction of a kind of Tritheism.<a name=273:6></a> It is not in this way that the truth of Christ's Person is guarded, or that of the unity of the Godhead maintained.<a name=273:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have received your letter of 10th November, and am glad to reply to it -- I am thankful that you have read the little paper, "The Person of the Christ" -- and have found any profit in it.<a name=273:9></a> Some have found fault with it, but I am more and more convinced that it presents only what is substantially right.<a name=273:10></a> That others might have put the points better is likely enough, but they have not done so.<a name=273:11></a>

		My use of the term "divine Person" in reference to our Lord was not from any lack of faith or sense on my part that He is God -- but to avoid the idea of His being God in such an absolute and exclusive sense as to trench on the unity of the Godhead -- that "God is one" may be said to be the backbone of Scripture -- but in the New Testament we have the additional light that in that unity are three Persons all equally divine -- and I should speak of the Holy Ghost being a divine Person in the same way as I would speak of the Son being so.<a name=274:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that you know something of Greek -- and that in the use of a noun as a predicate it makes a distinction by the use or omission of the article which we cannot so well make in English.<a name=274:2></a> When a noun is used as a predicate and has the article the proposition is reciprocal and the subject and predicate may be reversed -- for instance it says "sin is lawlessness" -- it may equally be said that "lawlessness is sin".<a name=274:3></a> When, however, the article is not directly before the predicate the predicate is characteristic, and the proposition is not reciprocal.<a name=274:4></a> This is the case in the expression "The Word was God" -- there is no article before God -- God is characteristic of the Word -- but the expression is not reciprocal -- for if God were the Word you would exclude the Father and the Spirit from the thought of God, and thus set aside the unity of the Godhead.<a name=274:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is only in this sense that I would apply the term "divine Person" to Christ, in the same way that I would apply it to the other Persons of the Godhead, viewing each in His distinctiveness and yet with the sense in the soul that each is as truly and as characteristically God as the other.<a name=274:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passages in my paper in which the term occurs would not admit of the substitution of "God" in its place.<a name=274:7></a> For instance "we have thus a divine Person presented" -- I mean here the particular Person who

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by "God has been manifested in the flesh" is, that all that God is (Father, Son and Spirit) has been set forth down here in words and works, all the fulness was pleased to dwell in Christ.<a name=275:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think that Deity and Divinity mean the same thing in common language -- the former applies exclusively to God as such -- the latter is often used in a much more general sense as of writings, etc.<a name=275:5></a>
	</div>

		I hear that a "keen critic" of mine takes exception to the idea of God dwelling among men save in the eternal state, in any other sense than that Christ is reigning.<a name=279:13></a> My point was taken from <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>, that the tabernacle remains among the children of Israel on the ground of the blood being carried into the holiest, and we find in the Old Testament abundant testimony to Jehovah dwelling among them.<a name=279:14></a> The last word in Ezekiel is "Jehovah is there", and I think two ideas are continually presented, viz.<a name=279:15></a>, Jehovah their God and David their king.<a name=279:16></a> Jehovah and His Christ.<a name=279:17></a> The two may be in one Person, but they are distinct thoughts, and the association of ideas in each case is distinct.<a name=279:18></a>

		I stuck at the point you refer to in the paper.<a name=280:1></a> My thought is this, that it is of divine perfection that when a divine Person comes into the place and form of a servant obedience is there; but I cannot carry back the idea of obedience to One "existing in the form of God" -- though I see the place relatively of the Father and the Son,<a href="#280:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> and it appears to me in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>the Spirit of God will not bring in obedience and humbling until He had emptied Himself.<a name=280:2></a> There may have been the capability, but I doubt if obedience could be spoken of as characterising a divine Person <i>as such</i> .<a name=280:3></a>.<a name=280:4></a>.<a name=280:5></a>.<a name=280:6></a> It is of all importance to maintain that in order to take a servant's form He emptied Himself.<a name=280:7></a>

		As regards your question as to the distinction between "the kingdom of God" and "the kingdom of heaven", the two expressions strike me as follows, viz.<a name=280:9></a>: the kingdom of God refers to the moral sway of God as such; a man must be born again to see or to enter into it.<a name=280:10></a> Our souls as Christians are under the influence of what God is morally, as revealed in grace.<a name=280:11></a> Hence the Son could say when here, "the kingdom of God is among you", and we read in Romans that "the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost".<a name=280:12></a> These are the portion of a soul under the moral sway of God.<a name=280:13></a> I think the tenth leper (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>) who returned to Jesus to give glory to God in a sense illustrates it.<a name=280:14></a> The kingdom of heaven refers (it appears to me) to <i>constituted</i> authority, as the Lord said, "All power has been <i>given</i> to me in heaven and upon earth".<a name=280:15></a> It seems to carry out the principle indicated in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:17">Genesis  1:17</a>, 18, viz.<a name=280:16></a> that the earth should be in the light and under the rule of heaven.<a name=280:17></a>

		I should not for one moment be inclined to contest the position that the word of Christ in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a> refers to His assembly in its full extent.<a name=282:2></a> It is that which He, rejected of His people, would build on the revelation and confession of Himself as the Son of the living God.<a name=282:3></a> Hence it takes in all saints from Pentecost to the coming of the Lord -- in other words, the whole period during which in our point of view the church has been on earth, and it will come out perfected in glory.<a name=282:4></a> But I cannot think that J.<a name=282:5></a>N.<a name=282:6></a>D.<a name=282:7></a> could have intended that we should find no present status for the assembly in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=282:8></a> On the contrary, I have often heard him identify <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>with <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>, and surely a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, is true of the saints now.<a name=282:9></a> In the same way the whole building, fitly framed together, grows to an holy temple in the Lord; but saints are already God's temple.<a name=282:10></a> They have that status and privilege.<a name=282:11></a> Though statements in Scripture may leave room for what may go on during an extended period, I doubt if it is the bearing in which truths are in general presented to us in the New Testament.<a name=282:12></a> I have heard it said that New Testament scriptures do not usually contemplate things beyond the lifetime of those addressed.<a name=282:13></a> The ten virgins who went forth to meet the Bridegroom are here when the Bridegroom comes.<a name=282:14></a> So the assembly that Christ builds would (as appears to me) have place here consequent on Christ's rejection, and the gates of hell could not prevail against it.<a name=282:15></a> The gates of hell are hardly in heaven.<a name=282:16></a> So that I think we are justified in taking our thought of Christ's assembly from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=282:17></a>

		As regards <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>, I take the passage in its connection with the chapter, and the subject of the chapter seems to me the ordering of conduct in the kingdom of heaven.<a name=283:1></a> In the main the instruction in the chapter refers to individual conduct (see verse 35).<a name=283:2></a> The assembly, as having a voice, is brought in only incidentally in reference to a particular individual difficulty.<a name=283:3></a> The "again" of verse 19 seems to me to take up a point additional to the "moreover" of verse 15.<a name=283:4></a> It refers to two of them agreed as touching anything they should ask in Christ's name, and on this follows the statement that where two or three are gathered together to My name, there am I in the midst.<a name=283:5></a> You may say, that is Christ's assembly, and I should not dispute it, but it appears to me that verse 20 is given as encouragement for those agreed in verse 19, and that the two or three in the former refers to the two in the latter.<a name=283:6></a> I should not like to stereotype the two as the assembly, though surely they must be in the truth of it, for nothing else is really recognised; but I should be sorry for the simplicity of the passage to be marred.<a name=283:7></a> It is a matter of fact in your letter you apply the passage to two or three gathered to Christ's name in a day of ruin, who certainly cannot be said to be the assembly, though acting in the truth of it, and this, in principle is really all that is contended for.<a name=283:8></a> What is of value to us in a day of ruin had its value also when all was in order.<a name=283:9></a>

		In regard to your questions, I think that Scripture speaks guardedly of "Christ in you", though it is what one may call proper Christian state.<a name=284:4></a> In this way it is used in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, "If Christ be in you", and he tells you what then characterises -- "the body is dead", etc.<a name=284:5></a> But it is to the Colossians he speaks of "Christ in you".<a name=284:6></a> In the Galatians He was not formed, but they had the Spirit.<a name=284:7></a> Every Christian has accepted the testimony of Christ as Saviour, but I think it is when they apprehend Him as the only Man before God, the pattern to whom they are to be conformed, that Christ is formed in them.<a name=284:8></a> This may be hindered, as with the Galatians; but till then I doubt if it can be said, "Christ in you".<a name=284:9></a> I do not say it is attainment, for it is the proper starting-point for attainment.<a name=284:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the other question, the thought of Christ living in him is, it appears to me, individualised by Paul.<a name=285:6></a> I admit the title of every believer to reckon himself alive to God in Christ; and in his having the Spirit of Christ, Christ is his life, and in principle it is true that Christ is in him, as he is in Christ; but what I understand by Christ living in <i>Paul</i> is that he was so practically in the realisation of death to all that in which flesh lives, that Christ in the power of the Spirit was the spring in him of affections, thoughts, desires, of all in which life morally consists.<a name=285:7></a> I do not think this is true of every Christian.<a name=285:8></a> I do not think it was so with the Galatians, but it is the proper Christian state.<a name=285:9></a>

		It is no wonder then that the truth of the real human identity of Christ is missed -- the horn of salvation raised up in the house of David -- the vessel of divine grace, so that there could be the anointing with the Holy Spirit and power, the going about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.<a name=299:1></a> Thus it was that the grace of God was presented to man <i>in a Man</i>, all in the pathway of obedience, and it is in Him <i>as Man</i> that the connection is maintained in the line of promise, and that risen and exalted, He (Christ) is given as Head to the church His body, the fulness of Him that fills all in all.<a name=299:2></a> That the One in whom all this was true was Himself in Person divine, the Son revealing the Father, who could while here being Himself divine speak, subject to the Father's will, with the authority of God, and that abundant testimony was borne to Him by the Father and by the works which He did is what every true Christian sees and delights in, but none the less the truth remains that He was come from God and went to God, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself not imputing their trespasses.<a name=299:3></a> It seems to me that the first principles of the truth of Christ have not been learned in the Spirit.<a name=299:4></a> Paul brought out in testimony the truth that Jesus, was the Son of God, but this does not set aside the first testimony of the apostles, and John's gospel is given that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and while I reverently accept the second, I am not going to give up the first.<a name=299:5></a> The greatest proof to one of the deity of Christ is the fact that He was <i>such</i> a Man as could receive the Spirit without measure.<a name=299:6></a>

		It is, I think, clear that the church is viewed in two lights -- as identified with Christ in the presence of the Father (all of one), He being Firstborn of many brethren, and as the vessel in which God sets forth the riches of His grace; and I think it is in this latter line that the thought of the body and the bride comes in.<a name=303:5></a> The church is Christ's fulness, and the vessel (in Him) in which God shows the exceeding riches of His grace.<a name=303:6></a> Jew and Gentile are reconciled to God in one body, but they are also one new man created in Christ Jesus.<a name=303:7></a>

		I maintained that the body was Christ's body, the vessel of the Spirit, and that a true idea of the body did not go beyond the work of the Spirit in saints; that if there were responsibility as to the body it must belong to the Head, and that the light of Scripture as to the body (the mystery) was given us to enable us intelligently to carry out our responsibilities in the house.<a name=308:9></a> Some seem to fear that something is being taken from them.<a name=308:10></a> They have been accustomed to depend on mere statements without apprehending their import.<a name=308:11></a> They divorce the baptism of the saints by one Spirit into one body from the baptism of the saints individually by the Spirit, instead of seeing that the fact of our all receiving one and the same Spirit must of necessity form one body.<a name=308:12></a> They have an idea that by being formed into one body they gain something additional, instead of seeing that it adds nothing, but that the church is thereby subjected to Christ.<a name=308:13></a> My impression is that the real defect lies in want of knowledge of the gospel, hence they are not prepared for the mystery.<a name=308:14></a>

		There is an effort to reconcile what has come into view with that which has been customarily held, and this temper is not one conducive to the apprehension of truth.<a name=320:3></a> The habit of mind to be desired is that of readiness to surrender anything that does not help, so that the truth may be held in divinely given form.<a name=320:4></a> The truth has to be got hold of as that which is part of oneself.<a name=320:5></a> And no one has rightly hold of any truth, until he sees how he is affected by it.<a name=320:6></a> As regards the thought of eternal life, I have no doubt that the idea of it in Scripture is objective, just as all the conditions of life are objective to a newly born child, and yet the child cannot live without them, and when the child is living, all these conditions may be said to be abiding in the child.<a name=320:7></a> What I refer to are the conditions of natural law (rule), atmosphere and light.<a name=320:8></a> These are the necessary conditions of life, and they are all objective, but when the child is living in them, they may be said to be abiding in the child.<a name=320:9></a> The child requires to be nourished with good food that it may live in these conditions, but however well it may be nourished it is never independent of these conditions, they are its life.<a name=320:10></a> So it is spiritually, we may be well nourished by the suitable food of grace, but we are dependent on Christ in whom are found all the necessary conditions of life.<a name=320:11></a> He is life to us.<a name=320:12></a> We find in Him the principle of rule, so that we are kept in the orbit of God's will, we abide in Him, and do not sin; in Him is the love which forms the atmosphere of the Christian circle, and which the lungs of the believer

		There is much that is interesting in the distinction drawn in General H.<a name=323:10></a>'s letters in the Indian extracts, but it seems to me that what I would call the moral element is wanting in the force which he attaches to both the words <i>psuche</i> and <i>zoe</i>, and to the latter he gives, I judge, a too exclusively objective import.<a name=323:11></a> <i>Psuche</i> appears to me to be the actual living principle in a creature which animates the body, and uses it as a vehicle.<a name=323:12></a> Hence it is common between man and the brute creation -- the difference with man being that <i>psuche</i> was in his case derived from the breath of God, and was therefore a living soul with moral elements and characteristics, and hence immortal.<a name=323:13></a> A character of responsibility also attached to it, and inseparable from this is the idea of individuality.<a name=323:14></a> Every man has his own soul, and soul is commonly used for person and to imply individuality.<a name=323:15></a> "The soul that sinneth shall die".<a name=323:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Zoe</i> on the other hand, though employed in more senses than one, is a general idea, not in itself conveying
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the idea of individuality.<a name=324:1></a> We can speak of <i>our</i> life or life in general.<a name=324:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may be mistaken, but my impression is that, like light, life is employed relatively in Scripture, i.<a name=324:3></a>e.<a name=324:4></a>, in actual or implied contrast to death, Now death comes before us in two aspects, viz.<a name=324:5></a>, moral and actual, hence we read "has annulled death and brought to light life and incorruptibility" -- death here meaning distance from God and the power of the devil.<a name=324:6></a> In another scripture we have "Son, thou in thy lifetime".<a name=324:7></a> Here life is evidently the period of a man's natural life on earth, bounded by and closing in death or dissolution.<a name=324:8></a> <i>Zoe</i> is evidently, therefore, used both in a moral and actual sense.<a name=324:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the vast proportion of cases in which <i>zoe</i> is employed in the New Testament its force is undoubtedly moral.<a name=324:10></a> It is unquestionably used for life in the subjective sense, as "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=324:11></a> Men saw One in whom was (morally) the life of God, and those who followed Him had the light of life, Hence I can well understand the thought of life being communicated to a soul: it is quickened, i.<a name=324:12></a>e.<a name=324:13></a>, made to live in the appreciation and enjoyment of another (the Son), and it is said having the Son it has life.<a name=324:14></a> The Spirit is life if Christ be in us, The result is that life is manifested in character, the moral qualities of the life of God are seen in the believer, who, being in the fellowship of Christ's death, is delivered from the flesh and its workings.<a name=324:15></a> And the body will be quickened so that it may be in every way a suitable vehicle for the quickened soul, and when this is the case life becomes an <i>actual</i> condition.<a name=324:16></a> Mortality will be swallowed up of life.<a name=324:17></a> Meantime the body is to be presented a living sacrifice.<a name=324:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But <i>zoe</i> is also evidently used in an objective sense as indicating the conditions, i.<a name=324:19></a>e.<a name=324:20></a>, the relationships and surroundings in which life practically consists, and therefore there is constantly connected with it

		the expression "enter into".<a name=325:1></a> This is more often than not its force in the New Testament.<a name=325:2></a> It is specially the case where an adjective is attached to it, to characterise it, such as "eternal".<a name=325:3></a> Many of Daniel's people that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life -- the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus.<a name=325:4></a>

		A man hates his life (<i>psuche</i>) in this world, and keeps it to life eternal, and the form in which eternal life is now realised is in the knowledge of the Father and His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=325:5></a> The present condition of eternal life is faith, which apprehends the objects in the enjoyment of which that life is realised.<a name=325:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be seen from the above that the senses of <i>psuche</i> and <i>zoe</i> are totally distinct, and that the one in no way displaces the other.<a name=325:7></a> In Christ was <i>zoe</i>, and He took a <i>psuche</i>, which had a moral character from the <i>zoe</i> (though His body was also the temple of God), and He could lay down His <i>psuche</i> (not <i>zoe</i>), and take it again; and further that the two senses in which <i>zoe</i> is employed with a moral force meet in the believer, faith coming in (so long as we are here) in the second sense.<a name=325:8></a>
