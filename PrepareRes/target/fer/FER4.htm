		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> I think Peter carried out the special charge that was laid upon him by the Lord, as given in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>; it must have remained with him and given a character to all his service.<a name=1:3></a> "Feed my sheep"; "Shepherd my sheep"; would I suppose have special reference to the Jewish sheep.<a name=1:4></a> The Lord prepared Peter for His service; his weak point was discovered to him.<a name=1:5></a> It is an instance of the Lord's love.<a name=1:6></a> "As many as I love I convict and discipline"; he was convicted, and then there was discipline; it was shown to him what the end of his course would be.<a name=1:7></a> Morally, discipline follows conviction; the latter is the discovery of the defect, and discipline is the Lord's grace in some way to help the man.<a name=1:8></a> Peter, I suppose, gave himself credit for having more affection for Christ than any of the others.<a name=1:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The burden of the prophets had been the sufferings and the glory of Christ, but Peter was a witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker of the glory to follow.<a name=1:10></a> God has allowed an interval of testing to come in between the two, and Peter takes up that interval; as Paul puts it: "the testimony to be rendered in its own times, to which I have been appointed a herald".<a name=1:11></a> In reading the prophets, we could not have had much idea of an interval between the sufferings and the glory, but seeing an interval of testing intervening helps to the understanding of the character of Peter's writings.<a name=1:12></a> We get in Peter what comes in between the sufferings and the glory.<a name=1:13></a> In a scene from which Christ has suffered, there can be nothing for God except what is in the sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=1:14></a>

		We get in Peter's writings what is more limited than in Paul's.<a name=2:1></a> We do not get the presentation of the grace of God in the same universal application as in Paul's -- the righteousness of God unto <i>all</i>.<a name=2:2></a> There is not the presentation of Christ in the same way that Paul presents Him, the grace of God bringing salvation to all men; what Peter presents is more limited, it is more to the Remnant.<a name=2:3></a> One side of the truth is the thought of God in regard of man as presented in Christ; the other side is the work of God in souls who are drawn and attached to Christ.<a name=2:4></a> It is Paul who presents the former.<a name=2:5></a> The tendency in Christendom has been to take up one side or the other unduly.<a name=2:6></a> The one must not be taken up to the exclusion of the other.<a name=2:7></a> No one writer even in the Old Testament presents the whole of the truth.<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a striking contrast between the beginning of this epistle and that to the Ephesians.<a name=2:9></a> In the latter we are chosen in Christ to be holy and without blame before God in love, to be before Him in the divine nature, and all is connected with heavenly places and our place as sons.<a name=2:10></a> In Peter the election refers to our place of responsibility down here; we are elect unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.<a name=2:11></a> It is the greatest contrast possible: one is our place as sons and in connection with heaven, the other is our responsible place down here.<a name=2:12></a> There is a purpose of God with regard to us down here, as well as in regard to what we are to be in heaven: the value of the truth is got by seeing each part in its own proper setting.<a name=2:13></a> "Obedience and sprinkling of blood" have no connection with our place in heaven.<a name=2:14></a> New creation is what fits us for heaven.<a name=2:15></a> Obedience can only come in in connection with our place down here.<a name=2:16></a>

		the government of God in being scattered abroad, still they could have in a spiritual way all the privileges that Israel had in a national way.<a name=3:1></a> They were a spiritual house, a holy priesthood.<a name=3:2></a> It is not Jehovah and national separation, but it is the light of Christianity which separates; the sanctification is moral -- of the Spirit, not a national separation kept up by a middle wall of partition.<a name=3:3></a> The real sanctifying power is <i>within us</i>.<a name=3:4></a> The epistle is just as true to Gentiles as to Jews, though perhaps it is somewhat more adapted to the Jewish mind.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an unvarying principle in the ways of God that what He has set up on earth can never be set aside.<a name=3:6></a> Take the kingdom and the truth of God's house: they must abide because God has established them here.<a name=3:7></a> Their character may change, things may be set aside in an outward material form, but the saints possessed all in a spiritual form.<a name=3:8></a> That is what Peter brings out.<a name=3:9></a> In reading the Old Testament it might appear that God was defeated.<a name=3:10></a> Certain things had been set up and they broke down; we want an answer to that, and the New Testament furnishes that answer.<a name=3:11></a> Whatever promises there are, in Him is the Yea.<a name=3:12></a> All that in which God has been apparently defeated will be established in Christ.<a name=3:13></a> Even in regard of the church, the very book which threatens the removal of the candlestick shows the church displayed in glory.<a name=3:14></a>

		The obedience is of Jesus Christ.<a name=4:15></a> The truth is, once Christ has been under the eye of God, nothing inferior can be acceptable to God; all must be of that character.<a name=4:16></a> There was no legality in Christ -- you could not conceive it.<a name=4:17></a> He walked in the light of love, and so it is too in regard of us.<a name=4:18></a> There is nothing now for God but the new man; the first man is gone for God though a good deal of it hangs about us.<a name=4:19></a> The moment the Spirit came and took possession of the vessel which Christ had prepared, there and then there was the sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=4:20></a> There was then a company set apart for God, and the great activity of

		The first thing that came into the world was disobedience; the law came to command obedience, but it could not produce it.<a name=5:7></a> Then Christ came in with the law of God in His heart, and that brought in the principle of obedience.<a name=5:8></a> In the sprinkled blood, you have the value of His death upon you.<a name=5:9></a> We must have it in order to be free before God.<a name=5:10></a> It is evident that the passage here (verse 2) does not take us beyond the earth, since the sanctification is to obedience.<a name=5:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>we are sanctified by our extinction.<a name=5:12></a> We are perfected for ever, but we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ -- that is, we are extinguished.<a name=5:13></a> The offering of the body of Jesus did not leave a bit of me, but being sanctified we are perfected for ever.<a name=5:14></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>sanctification is more practical.<a name=5:15></a> The Lord has separated Himself from all here, as a heavenly Man, and that gives us the standard and measure of what our sanctification really is.<a name=5:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between Peter's first and second epistles is that the first connects itself with the truth of the church built by Christ according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, while in the second, what is prominent is the kingdom, which connects itself with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>.<a name=100:1></a> The first is the place of the church -- the saints -- in relation to God's moral government down here, but in the second epistle the apostle seeks to establish the hearts of the saints in the certainty of the kingdom.<a name=100:2></a> Scoffers would discredit this, and that on the ground of the stability of creation; but it is monstrous to refuse all save natural laws, as though God could be bound by His own works.<a name=100:3></a> I do not believe that death is due to natural laws, I believe it is the judgment of God on account of sin.<a name=100:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of the one body is of all moment as affecting our conduct here as individuals.<a name=130:1></a> We cannot possibly be intelligent as to our conduct as individuals unless we recognise that we are one body in Christ and members of one another.<a name=130:2></a> In Romans we have the simple fundamental principle of Christianity, and to a very large extent that which is individual in Christian life.<a name=130:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to remember that each one has an individual path; but on the other hand there comes in this truth, which to a certain extent affects that, namely, that "we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another".<a name=130:4></a> This is the first presentation of the truth of the body.<a name=130:5></a> Then we have an advance in light upon it in Corinthians, Colossians, and Ephesians.<a name=130:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter we have two thoughts as to the Christian: we are here for the will of God, and we are members of one body.<a name=130:7></a> Both act as a check upon independence.<a name=130:8></a> Man naturally does not like being fettered by such bonds; he would prefer to be a kind of Ishmaelite, independent and free of everything.<a name=130:9></a> The Christian has to recognise that he is here for God's will, not his own, and that he is a member of the body.<a name=130:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to notice the expression, "one body <i>in Christ</i>".<a name=130:11></a> It is not that which could be effected by the association of men, it is in Christ.<a name=130:12></a> We all have our individual path in the flesh, as the apostle said, "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=130:13></a> That was his own path, and his individual faith; he does not there look upon

		himself in the light of a member of the body.<a name=131:1></a> So we all have to do with the concerns of daily life, and have to take up a variety of things here, one being a servant, another a master, but all this has nothing to do with our being one body in Christ.<a name=131:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The body is not a religious or outward organisation.<a name=131:3></a> There are such organisations, as Popery, the Church of England, Wesleyans, Good Templars, and the like, but they are in the flesh, they are not "one body in Christ".<a name=131:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of our being members of one body does not add to our privileges, but really depends upon the privileges which are ours, It hangs upon two thoughts, which go together, that is, that Christ is in the saints, and that the saints are in Christ.<a name=131:5></a> If you apprehend these two points you have the basis of the truth of the body.<a name=131:6></a>

		I will turn to two or three passages in Romans: first, the end of chapter 4, "Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=131:7></a> This verse is fundamental, for the great idea is presented to us of One having been raised from the dead <i>representatively</i>; that is, He has been raised for our justification.<a name=131:8></a> No one can understand the truth of being in Christ who does not first understand this.<a name=131:9></a> Just as He was delivered for our offences, so has He been raised for our justification.<a name=131:10></a> The first thing is "faith in his blood"; I can actually meet God by His blood.<a name=131:11></a> The next ray of light is that He was raised again for our justification; I am justified in Him.<a name=131:12></a> He represented His people upon the cross, and He represents His people in resurrection.<a name=131:13></a> I am completely cleared from everything which lay upon me, cleared according to the truth of Christ.<a name=131:14></a> God has not yet liberated me from every effect of sin, but Christ has been liberated.<a name=131:15></a> He was made sin, and died, and God has freed Him from every consequence of sin.<a name=131:16></a> I am not so liberated in my own person, for if

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to chapter 6: 9 - 11, where we have a further point, we pass out of death into life.<a name=132:6></a> We reckon ourselves to be dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=132:7></a> In these verses it is not simply the fact that He is raised, but He lives unto God, and we reckon ourselves alive unto God in Him.<a name=132:8></a> Christ describes what we are in the presence of God.<a name=132:9></a> We cannot know what a believer is in the presence of God except as we find it out in Christ.<a name=132:10></a> If we could suppose that Adam had not failed, a man might have said that he was alive unto God in Adam.<a name=132:11></a> The truth is, "In Adam all die".<a name=132:12></a> We reckon ourselves dead unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=132:13></a> What Christ is describes what the Christian is, and you cannot learn the place and privilege of the Christian except as you learn it in Christ.<a name=132:14></a> He lives unto God for God's eternal satisfaction.<a name=132:15></a> God has found His perfect rest in a Man now.<a name=132:16></a> We learn what we are to God as we see it in Him.<a name=132:17></a> And this is the description of what <i>all</i> Christians are in the eye of God.<a name=132:18></a> I wish you to notice this because I am leading on to the truth of the body.<a name=132:19></a> We are all justified in Him, and we are all alive in Him.<a name=132:20></a> One Man, that is Christ, describes what all are in the eye of God.<a name=132:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 8 we reach the other side of the truth, the subjective, that is <i>our</i> side of the truth.<a name=132:22></a> "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=132:23></a> And if Christ be in you .<a name=132:24></a>.<a name=132:25></a>".<a name=132:26></a> (verses 9, 10).<a name=132:27></a> When it is said "alive unto God in Christ Jesus", it is position.<a name=132:28></a> Christ's position before God belongs to the Christian.<a name=132:29></a> The other side of the truth is that Christ lives in the believer by the Spirit.<a name=132:30></a> He could not live in us except

		by the Spirit.<a name=133:1></a> The two thoughts are brought together in these verses, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his", then, "if Christ be in you".<a name=133:2></a> Christ lives in us.<a name=133:3></a> "Not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=133:4></a> Christ lives in principle in all Christians.<a name=133:5></a> It is only one Christ for our position before God, and one Christ living in all Christians by the Spirit.<a name=133:6></a> There may be thousands of Christians who have part in the Spirit, but there is only one Christ.<a name=133:7></a> This leads up to the great truth in chapter 12, "We, being many, are one body in Christ".<a name=133:8></a> Our being one body does not add anything to the privilege or dignity of the Christian; it is a necessary consequence of our being alive unto God in Christ Jesus, and of Christ living in all Christians.<a name=133:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People take up the body as a distinct truth, but no truth in that sense is distinct or separate in Scripture, because truth is one complete whole, all parts being interdependent.<a name=133:10></a> I am convinced that you must learn the truth of the body on the line I have indicated.<a name=133:11></a> You must first learn that Christ was raised from the dead for our justification; then that we have passed out of death into life, for we have a new position in Him in the presence of God; then that He lives in us in that position.<a name=133:12></a> "The Spirit is life".<a name=133:13></a> What is that for?<a name=133:14></a> For the position we have in the presence of God.<a name=133:15></a> I see that there is a Man there to the perfect satisfaction of God; we are in Him and He lives in us.<a name=133:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that we individualise Scripture too much.<a name=133:17></a> For example, we talk about a Christian being a child of God, but Scripture speaks of the children of God; it is always plural.<a name=133:18></a> The apostle does not say, "Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon the Christian", but, "upon us, that we should be called the sons [children] of God".<a name=133:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 12 I want you to notice two things, the first of which is that the Christian is to be here for God both in body and mind.<a name=134:7></a> He is to present his body a living sacrifice, and he is transformed by the renewing of his mind.<a name=134:8></a> The body is the material part of man, the mind is the intelligent part.<a name=134:9></a> The body is not renewed, it is yielded up, it is devoted, for that is the idea of sacrifice in Scripture, something devoted which cannot be recalled.<a name=134:10></a> The Christian's body is to be offered up as a living sacrifice that cannot be recalled.<a name=134:11></a> Then the apostle speaks of the renewing of the mind, though he could not speak of the renewing of the body.<a name=134:12></a> It flows from this, that God has become a factor, and the most important factor in the Christian's existence.<a name=134:13></a> An unconverted man lives entirely without God.<a name=134:14></a> He may acknowledge God in a formal way, but his soul does not know what it is to have to do with God.<a name=134:15></a> When a man is converted the practical effect of it is that God becomes a great reality to that man.<a name=134:16></a> He comes to know God, not as Adam knew Him before man had departed from Him, but as He has been pleased to reveal Himself in Christ.<a name=134:17></a> He turns to a living God.<a name=134:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Thessalonians turned from idols to serve a living and true God; that is, One who had proved Himself to be living and true, for He had revealed Himself.<a name=134:19></a> I delight in a thought that has been present

		So we have these two great checks upon the Christian; first, he is devoted to God, body and mind; he is given up to Him, and is here for His good and perfect and acceptable will; and then, secondly, he is to think soberly of himself because he can only think of himself according to the measure of faith.<a name=136:8></a> I believe the measure of faith to be the light which God has given me as in the body and as to the function each has to exercise.<a name=136:9></a> If every member of my own body thought something of itself, there would be a good deal of schism; it is because every member naturally keeps its place and does its own work that the body goes on harmoniously.<a name=136:10></a> The truth of the body is intended to have the very greatest influence upon saints down here.<a name=136:11></a> Another time, if the Lord enable me, I will show the place which it has in regard to the saints gathered together; I only speak of it now in regard to the Christian in his individual path in this world.<a name=136:12></a> It is a great thing to know that I have a function in the body, even if it be a very unimportant one.<a name=136:13></a> I have to wait on it and to carry out diligently

		It is important to remember that all the teaching in this epistle is of an elementary character.<a name=138:1></a> The apostle does not unfold to the Corinthians the wisdom of God, but confines his instruction to first principles.<a name=138:2></a> In this chapter the divine thought in the body is not given.<a name=138:3></a> There are only two verses in it which speak of the body: verse 13, "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body"; and the statement in verse 27, "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular".<a name=138:4></a> The intervening verses introduce the natural body in the way of illustration.<a name=138:5></a>

		In Colossians the important point is the revelation of the mystery, which is God's mind in regard of the body.<a name=138:6></a> That is a great advance upon the mere statement that the saints are the body.<a name=138:7></a> The apostle says there, "To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory".<a name=138:8></a> That is the divine idea in the body.<a name=138:9></a> You will never understand the body if you do not get to that point.<a name=138:10></a> The idea in the body is not ecclesiastical, if you understand me, but moral.<a name=138:11></a> It is Christ's body, and in every place in which it is mentioned in Scripture the truth is brought in as light to bear upon the saints.<a name=138:12></a> They had their church formation before the truth of the body was revealed.<a name=138:13></a> They were gathered in fellowship, and had the Lord's supper before they knew anything at all of the body.<a name=138:14></a> They were in fellowship in a sense before the Spirit descended.<a name=138:15></a> There were those in Jerusalem who had been gathered by the testimony of the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit descended and constituted them the house of God;

		Now having been called to the fellowship of the Lord, the truth of the body is brought in as light to those who were thus gathered.<a name=140:23></a> Their ecclesiastical order depended upon the fact that they were called to that fellowship and that the Holy Spirit had constituted those who were in that fellowship the house of God.<a name=140:24></a> In the present day, when the church has become corrupt, there is this modification, that we have to follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=140:25></a>

		The twelve disciples may be taken as an example: they knew a great deal about what Christ was on earth by their own personal knowledge, but they knew nothing about heaven and the place which He has there.<a name=142:3></a> They knew nothing of all that glory which Scripture calls the glory of the Lord.<a name=142:4></a> The Spirit came to them and brought to them heavenly light.<a name=142:5></a> That was then God's assembly, for the Spirit of God was there.<a name=142:6></a> God dwelt there by the Spirit.<a name=142:7></a>

		No member is so exalted as that he can be independent of the Spirit, and no one is so small that he cannot be used of Him.<a name=144:1></a> In taking up the analogy of the human body the apostle shows that the members we think to be less necessary are indispensable, and we bestow more abundant honour upon them.<a name=144:2></a> There may be in the assembly a very uneducated man, and the Spirit uses him.<a name=144:3></a> You would not take him to task about his bad grammar, but you would bestow more abundant honour upon him.<a name=144:4></a> In human arrangement men go to college for the church.<a name=144:5></a> I quite grant that men should go to God's college, but I do not say that human education is indispensable to the church.<a name=144:6></a> Peter and John were perceived to be unlearned men, yet no one can deny that they were the vessels of the Spirit, for they were the first apostles.<a name=144:7></a> A man highly gifted of the Spirit would most readily welcome the manifestation of the Spirit through the most insignificant member, though we have to judge that it is a manifestation of the Spirit.<a name=144:8></a> However uneducated a man might be, if he were a vessel of the Spirit in the assembly and could speak five words to edification, I would be in sympathy with him and simply anxious that he might be enabled so to express himself that the assembly might get the mind of the Spirit through him.<a name=144:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must learn this individually, because sonship is individual relationship to God, as having been brought to Him.<a name=148:14></a> The gospel confers it upon us.<a name=148:15></a> The very fact of our having this place of sonship in Christ necessitates our being one body in Him.<a name=148:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the other side, and that brings in the truth of life.<a name=148:17></a> Christ is in us by the Spirit.<a name=148:18></a> This is the mystery.<a name=148:19></a> The truth of our being in Christ is not exactly the mystery because that marks our position before God, but Christ in the saints is the mystery.<a name=148:20></a> The first time the expression Christ in you occurs is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, where it is said, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<a name=148:21></a> And if Christ be in you.<a name=148:22></a>.<a name=148:23></a>.<a name=148:24></a>".<a name=148:25></a> So Christ being in us is evidently consequent upon the Spirit of Christ being in us.<a name=148:26></a> Christ has been here under the eye of God, and nothing short of Christ can now be according to His mind.<a name=148:27></a> Therefore it must be Christ in the saints.<a name=148:28></a>

		There are two functions which the Spirit fulfils in the saints.<a name=148:29></a> He is in them as life, and also as the Spirit of sonship.<a name=148:30></a> If the Spirit is life in us, the connection between the saints and the Spirit is evidently very intimate.<a name=148:31></a> My conviction is that life is essentially individual, for no one can share the life of another.<a name=148:32></a>

		There are two testimonies in the beginning of Acts to the glory of Christ: the confusion of tongues was in a certain sense set aside by the gift of the Spirit, and man was raised up from the extremity of human weakness by the name of Jesus.<a name=149:13></a> The apostle had none of this world's means -- silver and gold -- but the name of Jesus of Nazareth enabled the man to walk.<a name=149:14></a> I refer to this because it illustrates the power and glory of Christ.<a name=149:15></a> There is no power or glory equal to that of Christ, and if we had a sufficient sense of it we should be continually rejoicing in Him.<a name=149:16></a> This is connected with the truth of the gospel and the place into which we are brought.<a name=149:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness is individual, and the cry of sonship is individual, but the very fact of participating in one Spirit binds us all together as members one of another.<a name=150:12></a> The formation of the body was not any distinct action or operation of the Spirit, but it followed upon the reception of the Spirit by each and all.<a name=150:13></a> The purpose was that there should be a delineation of Christ here in the whole company of the saints.<a name=150:14></a> Then when the body was formed Christ was given to be Head of it, that He might direct it.<a name=150:15></a> The body is subjected to Christ, and He takes the ordering of it, that He may be displayed in it.<a name=150:16></a> The body is for the display of Christ.<a name=150:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then how is this brought about?<a name=150:18></a> I believe the more really we enter into the blessed truth of our individual relationship with God, the more sensible shall we be by the Spirit that we are one body in Christ and members one of another.<a name=150:19></a> I do not think the fact of our being one body is a thought to be

		Evidently the great thought in it is testimony in the world.<a name=151:3></a> It is the fulfilling of the prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:21">John  17:21</a>, "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=151:4></a> The affection formed in the saints one toward another, by the consciousness of the love of Christ, was to be testimony to the world that the Father sent the Son.<a name=151:5></a> "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another".<a name=151:6></a> What a wonderful thing for every one of us to be under the influence of the love of Christ, and so loving one another!<a name=151:7></a> This is the great testimony to the world that the Father sent the Son.<a name=151:8></a>

		The important point to remember in connection with the body is that it is Christ's body.<a name=153:1></a> It is often spoken of as one body in contrast to two.<a name=153:2></a> Previously there were, in a sense, two bodies -- Jews and Gentiles; now there is <i>one</i> body.<a name=153:3></a> "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body".<a name=153:4></a> "There is one body and one Spirit".<a name=153:5></a> But then there is a further truth taught, especially in Colossians and Ephesians, that is, that the one body is Christ's body, and until we apprehend that, we do not get the divine thought of it.<a name=153:6></a> When we do get this, it has a great effect upon us, greatly helping us in carrying out our responsibilities, and accentuating our fellowship.<a name=153:7></a> The basis of Christian fellowship is that we call on the Lord, but the light we get in regard to the body, and the divine thought in it, greatly colours our fellowship.<a name=153:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three principal passages in which we have already seen the body referred to.<a name=153:9></a> The first is <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, where we simply get the statement, "We, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another".<a name=153:10></a> Then in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>we have, "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body .<a name=153:11></a>.<a name=153:12></a>.<a name=153:13></a> and have been all made to drink into one Spirit", and later in the same chapter, "Ye are Christ's body".<a name=153:14></a> Then in Colossians we have the divine thought of it in the unfolding of the mystery.<a name=153:15></a> I do not see any unfolding of the mystery either in Romans or Corinthians; nor is there any allusion to the Head.<a name=153:16></a> You cannot really understand the truth of the body, except in connection with the Head.<a name=153:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>it is said, "He is the head of the body, the church".<a name=153:18></a> What we want is the Head, and when we understand the Head we understand a great deal better the thought of the body.<a name=153:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=154>[Page 154]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must not separate the truth of the body from the gospel, for it is the mystery of the gospel.<a name=154:1></a> I quite admit that the apostle speaks of two ministries, that of the gospel and that of the church.<a name=154:2></a> Yet he speaks of the mystery of the gospel, and asks the prayers of the saints that he may be enabled to make it known, speaking boldly as he ought to speak.<a name=154:3></a> What I understand by the expression is that the truth of the church as Christ's body is involved in the gospel.<a name=154:4></a> It is a distinct ministry, and the apostle so speaks of it, but the thing itself is certainly involved in the gospel.<a name=154:5></a> This makes the truth of the church very much simpler.<a name=154:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the gospel is rightly apprehended it leads to the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=154:7></a> Its end and purpose is that God may be revealed in man's heart, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=154:8></a> The gospel is God's approach to man.<a name=154:9></a> Other ministry comes in with regard to man's approach to God.<a name=154:10></a> God's great purpose in the gospel is the revelation of Himself, according to what He is, in the heart of man, and that does not come to pass until the Holy Spirit is received, for no one knows the love of God except by the Holy Spirit.<a name=154:11></a> The gospel brings us to that point.<a name=154:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then this involves the truth of the body, because it is one Spirit that we receive, we do not each receive a different Spirit.<a name=154:13></a> There was but one baptism of the Holy Spirit, and that at Pentecost.<a name=154:14></a> The Lord told His disciples that they should be baptised with the Holy Spirit "not many days hence", and on the day of Pentecost they received the gift of the Spirit.<a name=154:15></a> He had said to them, "He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you", and the Spirit came and was in them.<a name=154:16></a> That was the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and there was not another.<a name=154:17></a> The reception of the Gentiles, and all that has taken place since, is simply an extension of what took place on that day.<a name=154:18></a>

		came.<a name=155:1></a> Scripture is careful to speak of one Spirit, and in this is involved the truth of one body.<a name=155:2></a> The gospel addresses us as individuals, deals with us individually, and brings us into individual privilege; but the mystery of the body lies hidden in it, and the apostle's effort was to make it manifest.<a name=155:3></a> What he unfolded was what hung upon the fact that all believers received one Spirit, that consequently they were one body, and that body was Christ's body.<a name=155:4></a> The thought of the body is rather that of <i>unity</i> than of union.<a name=155:5></a> The body is formed by the Holy Spirit, and Christ is given as Head to it.<a name=155:6></a> It is on the principle of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:31">Ephesians  5:31</a>, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh".<a name=155:7></a> Christ is cut off from what I might call all natural connections, His connections with Israel after the flesh, and when cut off in that way He is joined in that sense to the church.<a name=155:8></a> The church is His body, and it is a new point of departure and involves for Him a new name.<a name=155:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though we have the body mentioned in Romans and Corinthians, we do not get the Head.<a name=155:10></a> I think the saints in those places needed to know Christ as Lord, and no one can know Him as Head who does not know Him as Lord.<a name=155:11></a> In Corinthians He is spoken of as Lord, even in connection with the assembly.<a name=155:12></a> So we have the Lord's table, the Lord's supper, and other similar expressions.<a name=155:13></a> The gospel presents Him to us as Lord, not as Head.<a name=155:14></a> My conviction is that Christians generally have not sufficient apprehension of Him as Lord; their souls are not sufficiently imbued with a sense of His glory and power.<a name=155:15></a> When we are so, we are conscious that His glory and power are superior to all other, and we are brought into the light of the day.<a name=155:16></a> The day connects itself with the Lord.<a name=155:17></a> He has power to subdue all things to Himself, and if we are in the light of His power and glory we shall not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of

		I want to speak about a very old truth, one that is generally recognised -- that is, Christ as Head.<a name=162:1></a> There is so much of vital importance connected with it that I feel justified in bringing it under attention.<a name=162:2></a> When I speak of Christ as Head, I do not mean Head of the church, His body.<a name=162:3></a> There are three senses in which we find Christ spoken of as Head in Scripture: He is Head of the body, as the husband is head of the wife; He is Head of all principality and power; but then, He is Head of every man, in the same sense in which Adam was head of every man.<a name=162:4></a> Adam brought in sin and death, and their application is universal; Christ, in that sense, is the antitype of Adam.<a name=162:5></a> He fills the place of Adam in a much greater way; and now, towards all men, in connection with His being the Head of every man, there is the grace of God unto justification of life.<a name=162:6></a> I think people have better understood the thought of headship in connection with the body than the bearing of Christ's headship in connection with every man.<a name=162:7></a> The testimony of grace to man is founded on that.<a name=162:8></a> The one important point was the introduction of the Head, and there is not forgiveness of sins or repentance apart from the Head.<a name=162:9></a> Whatever God witnesses to man is witnessed in the name of one Man.<a name=162:10></a> The grace of God, and the gift by grace, is by one Man, Jesus Christ.<a name=162:11></a> In the commission at the close of the Gospel of Luke, repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem: in the name of one Man, in contrast to Adam.<a name=162:12></a> The Son of God has become Man and has taken the place of head of every man according to God's will.<a name=162:13></a> Another time I may speak about Christ as Lord, which involves the kingdom and the authority of God.<a name=162:14></a> A kingdom must convey the thought of sway or authority, and

		Lord is a title connected with the kingdom.<a name=163:1></a> But you could not get "Lord" without "Head": you must have a head in order to have a kingdom.<a name=163:2></a> There could be no kingdom of God without a head; it is part of the ways of God.<a name=163:3></a> All the human race descended from Adam; he was the head of every man; the world stood or fell in connection with a man.<a name=163:4></a> When that man fell, it meant the fall of the world.<a name=163:5></a> The statement in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:12">Romans  5:12</a> recognises that <i>all</i> have sinned; but sin entered into the world by one man, and death by sin.<a name=163:6></a> Now the principle of restoration is by one Man, and the reason is that one Man becomes the fountain of life for men, having died for all.<a name=163:7></a> Without a Head who could be a fountain of life for man the kingdom would be fruitless: there would be no meaning in it.<a name=163:8></a> There might be the authority of God in Christ, but there would be nobody in regard to whom that authority could be exercised.<a name=163:9></a> The kingdom is connected with the living God.<a name=163:10></a> The world as it is could not be a kingdom for the living God, because it is under death.<a name=163:11></a> The kingdom all depends on the introduction of one Man who could be a life-giving spirit to man, so that man might live to God.<a name=163:12></a> The thought of Christ as Head is essential to the thought of Christ as Lord.<a name=163:13></a> But the idea of the Head is much less familiar to people than that of Lord.<a name=163:14></a>

		I will just read again <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:21">1 John  2:21</a> - 23.<a name=163:15></a> I was saying a moment ago that the idea connected with Christ as Head is that He should be a fountain of life.<a name=163:16></a> Now I am going to state a very important principle in connection with that, and that is, that life can only be in the presence of light.<a name=163:17></a> Christ was Himself the light of men, and in Him was life; but in the application of these things to men, as men, life must be in the presence of light.<a name=163:18></a> If you go back to the beginning of Genesis you will see how the principle comes out there; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:16">Genesis  1:16</a> - 20.<a name=163:19></a> In connection with the earth, in the ways of God, life came in consequent upon light.<a name=163:20></a>

		Light had been brought in at the outset; there was the "fiat" of God, and light came out of darkness; but the idea of light in Scripture is more generally of a constituted light.<a name=164:1></a> God appointed the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.<a name=164:2></a> The Lord said, "I am the light of the world"; He was the appointed light of the world.<a name=164:3></a> I think the church has now that place.<a name=164:4></a> The Lord said to the disciples, You are the light of the world; they were the appointed, constituted light of the world.<a name=164:5></a> Consequent upon Christ having come out in that way, you get life.<a name=164:6></a> I am sure of the rightness of the principle; what it means is that life must be in the light of God.<a name=164:7></a> You will see how that works out in connection with the Head.<a name=164:8></a> Light is the revelation of God; He is in the light now, and life is in the light of God.<a name=164:9></a> When you get the light of God in Christ, then it is that you get life.<a name=164:10></a> Christ was the light of the world when in it; He is light still, and at the same time He is Head, because He is the light, and from the Head you get the communication of life.<a name=164:11></a> The last Adam is a life-giving spirit.<a name=164:12></a>

		I desire to bring before you the importance of Christ in that connection, and to speak about His qualifications as Head.<a name=164:13></a> All comes out in the chapter before us; but the first point is, God is revealed, His love is declared, and life now is in the presence of the love of God.<a name=164:14></a> That is where the believer lives.<a name=164:15></a> Morally I do not think that any Christian lives in this world.<a name=164:16></a> If I live at all, it is in the light of divine love.<a name=164:17></a> If one lives in this world, he lives in confusion and darkness; the world where man seeks his own will, and his glory is all confusion.<a name=164:18></a> God has brought us out of darkness into His marvellous light, and it is there that we live.<a name=164:19></a> No man of the world can understand a Christian, because he is not privy to the moral atmosphere in which the Christian lives.<a name=164:20></a> An unconverted man can know

		In the first two verses of <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2">1 John  2</a>and in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:18">Romans  5:18</a>, 19, we have the thought of the righteous One.<a name=165:9></a> You see the Head must of necessity be the righteous One.<a name=165:10></a> You could scarcely have said as much in regard to Adam; he was not the righteous one; had he been the righteous one, he would have maintained righteousness, but Adam failed of righteousness.<a name=165:11></a> He failed to maintain the relationships in which God had set him.<a name=165:12></a> Righteousness is the maintenance of the relationships which God has appointed, and is very intimately connected with faithfulness.<a name=165:13></a> Adam failed in the first of all relationships -- that to God.<a name=165:14></a> Eve failed in faithfulness to her husband; she failed of righteousness.<a name=165:15></a> Adam brought sin into the world.<a name=165:16></a> When God in grace introduced a new Head, you can see that, of necessity, that Head must be in contrast to the first man, and what must characterise the Head thus brought in is righteousness.<a name=165:17></a> The expression, "the righteous One", is frequently applied to the Lord.<a name=165:18></a> Peter testified to the Jews that He was the righteous One.<a name=165:19></a> John continually speaks of Christ as the righteous One.<a name=165:20></a> That came out in the pathway of Christ here.<a name=165:21></a> He glorified God on the earth; He was the true meat-offering.<a name=165:22></a> God was glorified in a Man: a Man in the midst of a scene of sin, maintained in

	<div class="paragraph">
		integrity and who glorified God in regard to every relationship in which man was set.<a name=166:1></a> The Son of God took the place of man down here and revealed God; the very nature of God came out in Christ, for the testimony of Christ down here was not simply in what He said, but in what He was.<a name=166:2></a> The life was the light of men; but distinct from that He took the place of man down here, and having done so, glorified God in every relationship in which man was set.<a name=166:3></a> Therefore the apostle Paul in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>speaks of one righteousness and one obedience.<a name=166:4></a> Righteousness involves obedience; the two are intimately connected.<a name=166:5></a> Adam disobeyed and thus failed of righteousness; Christ maintained in integrity every relationship, glorifying God in all in a perfect obedience.<a name=166:6></a> He could not be holden of death, as we see in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=166:7></a> That psalm is the most beautiful description by the Spirit of God of the righteous One.<a name=166:8></a> He could plead with God to preserve Him, for He had taken the place of man; He puts His trust in Jehovah, and finds His delight in the saints.<a name=166:9></a> Then in the latter part of the psalm we see that though He might enter into death He could not be holden of it.<a name=166:10></a> Peter quotes that psalm in preaching to the Jews, to prove that Christ could not remain in death.<a name=166:11></a> He must come forth by the power of God in resurrection.<a name=166:12></a> The Lord speaks in the same way: He lays down His life that He might take it again.<a name=166:13></a> I think all ought to be able to apprehend that if the righteous One enter into death it is a moral necessity that He should come forth in resurrection to life.<a name=166:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the first point in connection with the Head, that He should maintain in integrity every relationship in which man had failed, so that God might be glorified on the earth; the Lord could say in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "I have glorified Thee on the earth".<a name=166:15></a> When God gave the order of the offerings, we first get the burnt-offering, setting forth the devotion of Christ to

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next point is that the righteous One must bear the liabilities under which men were if He were to be the Head of every man.<a name=167:3></a> The moment He was born He was in a sense the Head of every man; but to take up that position so as to be a life-giving spirit to men must involve that He should bear the liabilities under which men were.<a name=167:4></a> How could He communicate life to men here under liabilities?<a name=167:5></a> He must bear the liabilities before He can communicate life to men.<a name=167:6></a> "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the whole world".<a name=167:7></a> There were the liabilities.<a name=167:8></a> The apostle says, "not for ours only" -- the Jew -- "but for the whole world".<a name=167:9></a> I believe that in the accomplishment of propitiation there was in a sense an end of all men in the eye of God.<a name=167:10></a> Christ terminated the whole world as after the flesh that God might begin again in Him.<a name=167:11></a> I have said sometimes that the moment a man receives forgiveness of sins in the name of the Head it is the termination of that man.<a name=167:12></a> God communicates to a man the knowledge of forgiveness of sins; the liabilities, in regard to which he would have come into judgment, are remitted; but there is an end of that man before God as after the flesh.<a name=167:13></a> There was his end, in one sense, in the death of Christ, but now he has come to it himself.<a name=167:14></a> He is not going to live for God in Adam; he is terminated in order to begin in Christ.<a name=167:15></a> That is a point of moment which ought to be made very plain in connection with the testimony of the gospel, to avoid the idea that man is going to be restored, or a new lease of life given to him; propitiation was the termination of the man for God.<a name=167:16></a> Christ was the righteous One who could not be morally of the order of Adam, the man that sinned; the righteous One

		was another order -- must be, in the very nature of things.<a name=168:1></a> One who could take the place of man and glorify God where man had failed.<a name=168:2></a> Then Christ puts Himself, as He could do, under the liabilities of man, but in bearing these liabilities he terminates vicariously the man to whom these liabilities belonged.<a name=168:3></a> He died for all, that they which live might live to Him who died for them and rose again.<a name=168:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we see that, risen from the dead, Christ takes up the position of Head of every man.<a name=168:5></a> He is the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.<a name=168:6></a> The end of the gospel is not even forgiveness of sins, but to bring souls to Christ, that they may get living water.<a name=168:7></a> No one can get living water without forgiveness of sins; but you may depend upon it, the object of God in the gospel is not simply forgiveness of sins -- that is His announcement -- but the gift of living water from Christ (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a> - 14; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:6">Revelation  21:6</a>).<a name=168:8></a> I think that all this is in connection with Christ as Head.<a name=168:9></a> There is the announcement of repentance and remission of sins in the name of the Head; but the presentation of Christ is in order that man may receive from Him what is the indispensable need of man, and that is living water.<a name=168:10></a> Man is under death; what he wants is the water of life, and it is that which Christ gives.<a name=168:11></a> He has become the Head that He may be the fountain of life for men.<a name=168:12></a> "I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely".<a name=168:13></a> I do not suppose that anyone has an idea that water of life is forgiveness.<a name=168:14></a> Forgiveness is a means to an end; there is the announcement of forgiveness in the name of the Head in order that souls, receiving forgiveness, may get the water of life, that is, from the Head, and it is a well of water in the believer, springing up into everlasting life.<a name=168:15></a> The expression of divine love is in the gift of God's only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but have everlasting life.<a name=168:16></a> Of course no one could have everlasting life if he had not

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just refer again to <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:5">1 John  2:5</a>.<a name=169:2></a> That passage depends on one thing, viz.<a name=169:3></a>, that the One who is the Head of man has brought the light of God.<a name=169:4></a> Hence whoso keepeth His word, in him is the love of God perfected.<a name=169:5></a> The word of Christ is really the revelation of God, and whosoever abides in that, in him the love of God is perfected, that is, by the Spirit.<a name=169:6></a> In the death of Christ we get the revelation of God in love, and the Spirit has sealed the testimony.<a name=169:7></a> The great voice of God was in the death of Christ: there it was that divine love was declared, and in the one who has accepted the testimony of the death of Christ the love of God is perfected by the Spirit.<a name=169:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just repeat what I have said, that the declaration or testimony of divine love was in the death of Christ.<a name=169:9></a> God was there declared; the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; God was in the light; He was there in the presentation of Himself, in love and righteousness.<a name=169:10></a> God has come out, His nature is known; He is revealed in self-sacrificing love.<a name=169:11></a> That is the testimony of the death of Christ.<a name=169:12></a> When the testimony of God has been received in the soul, the Holy Spirit is given, and the love of God is shed abroad in the heart.<a name=169:13></a> The Spirit of God came to seal the testimony that Christ had given.<a name=169:14></a> Christ left nothing to be witnessed: the Spirit sealed a complete testimony.<a name=169:15></a> Now the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given unto us.<a name=169:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But another point comes out in connection with the Spirit.<a name=169:17></a> The same Spirit who sealed the testimony, and by whom the love of God is shed abroad in the heart, connects us livingly with the Head.<a name=169:18></a> It was the Head who communicated the Spirit; the Spirit never came until Christ went into heaven.<a name=169:19></a> Now, it is not simply that Christ is Head to men, but believers are

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what comes to pass?<a name=170:8></a> We know that we are in Him, and the effect is, we come into righteousness.<a name=170:9></a> To begin with, we live in the light of love; there is the beginning of righteousness.<a name=170:10></a> Everyone who lives in the light of love lives to God, and everyone who lives to God lives in righteousness.<a name=170:11></a> Evidently God has the first claim upon my affections, and if I live to Him in the light of His love, righteousness is fulfilled.<a name=170:12></a> There is not only love, and myself in the enjoyment of love, but righteousness too, because I admit God's rights, and I am myself righteous and live to Him.<a name=170:13></a>

		What I am going to speak about now connects itself with what has been previously before us.<a name=173:1></a> I was speaking about Christ as "Head", and now I want to speak about Christ as "Lord".<a name=173:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The terms "Head" and "Lord" are centred in one Person, but they evidently convey two distinct ideas; the two ideas were not realised at the beginning in Adam.<a name=173:3></a> I think Adam had dominion, but I could not talk of him as Lord; but undoubtedly we get the idea of Head in Adam.<a name=173:4></a> In that way he is the figure of Christ, and is employed in that light in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>.<a name=173:5></a> One important point connected with "Lord" is that it represents in a man the authority of God.<a name=173:6></a> We have the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; the authority of God presented in a Man.<a name=173:7></a> You get this thought at the close of the gospel of Matthew; Christ is speaking to His disciples as a Man yet on earth (verses 18 - 20).<a name=173:8></a> So far as I can judge, it presents the authority of God in a Man when God is fully revealed.<a name=173:9></a> I do not think you properly get the idea of Lord until that point: God was fully revealed.<a name=173:10></a> The injunction was, "Baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit", and in that connection the thought of authority comes in; all authority was given to Christ in heaven and upon earth.<a name=173:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I said last time that in the ways of God it was impossible for the kingdom to come in until there was the Head.<a name=173:12></a> The reason was that apart from the Head there was no quickening power.<a name=173:13></a> Man was under sin and death, and hence quickening power needed to come in; but quickening power could only come in by One who could take up the liabilities under

		which man was, and that One was Christ, in the light of Head.<a name=174:1></a> He took up the liabilities under which man was -- death and the curse of a broken law -- that He might become a life-giving spirit to men.<a name=174:2></a> I suppose no one would have any difficulty in seeing that apart from such a Head it was impossible for the kingdom of God to come in.<a name=174:3></a> The kingdom of God would have been fruitless otherwise.<a name=174:4></a> You could not get the kingdom of God in Old Testament times; everything looked on to the kingdom, but the kingdom waited until the Man came.<a name=174:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence you see that the place of Christ as Lord, which is connected with the kingdom, is dependent on the fact of His being the Head.<a name=174:6></a> I look upon Christ as the Head of every man, the pillar of the moral universe.<a name=174:7></a> The whole universe of God is to be filled with Christ; it is upheld by Him, and He fills all.<a name=174:8></a> It has often been said that while He came to remove what was contrary to God, He Himself occupies the ground which he has cleared; He supports all and fills all, "That he might fill all things".<a name=174:9></a> We have to face the great truth of our displacement in the death of Christ that He may fill all.<a name=174:10></a> The displacement is a fact for God; the great thing is when it becomes a fact for us, when we are prepared to let Christ fill all.<a name=174:11></a> We may take up the phraseology, but that is a very different thing from the reality.<a name=174:12></a> The apostle says, "I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=174:13></a> Christ filled the apostle.<a name=174:14></a>

		But to speak of Christ as Lord.<a name=174:15></a> It is simple enough to see that the title "Lord" connects itself with the kingdom; it is that which led me to turn to the passages I have read.<a name=174:16></a> I want to give you a thought or two as to the bearing and importance of it.<a name=174:17></a> The first thought connected with the Lord is that He presents to us the authority of God.<a name=174:18></a> The authority of God at the present time is connected with grace; grace has come out in power; that is what marks the kingdom

		of God.<a name=175:1></a> When the kingdom of God is set up in the world publicly it will be grace acting in power.<a name=175:2></a> This was seen in measure in David in regard to Israel; grace was acting in power for the deliverance of the people.<a name=175:3></a> So in the present time grace has asserted itself in power, and by-and-by this will be in a public way.<a name=175:4></a> Another thing will come in, beyond all manner of question: there will be the puffing down of proved lawlessness, when it has reached its climax in the man of sin.<a name=175:5></a> But at the same time, that is not exactly the kingdom; it is preparatory to the kingdom, and when the kingdom comes in, its character is grace asserting itself in power.<a name=175:6></a> That represents the authority of God.<a name=175:7></a> It is only by the authority of God that grace can assert itself.<a name=175:8></a> Where can grace come from except from God?<a name=175:9></a> Who can be the fountain of grace except God Himself?<a name=175:10></a> If grace asserts itself it is the kingdom of God; hence the present effect of the kingdom is "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".<a name=175:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord foreshadowed this when He was here upon earth.<a name=175:12></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>it is said of Him that He declared God.<a name=175:13></a> How?<a name=175:14></a> He came full of grace and truth.<a name=175:15></a> The law was given by Moses; that was not the kingdom.<a name=175:16></a> "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ"; then it adds, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=175:17></a> The One who came full of grace and truth declared God.<a name=175:18></a> The cross held the same character; it was the declaration of God.<a name=175:19></a> Moses' ministry was law; Christ came full of grace and truth.<a name=175:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in connection with the ministry of Christ upon earth there was power; it was not simply grace.<a name=175:21></a> They who heard Him wondered at His words of grace; but it was not only words of grace proceeding from His mouth: there was power.<a name=175:22></a> At the very outset of His ministry Christ bound the strong man, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		then He set to work to spoil his goods.<a name=176:1></a> The strong man kept his house, and his goods were in peace, but then a stronger had come.<a name=176:2></a> It would be a poor thing to think only of gracious words in the mouth of Christ down here: there was authority and power to command the unclean spirits, and they came out.<a name=176:3></a> That marked His ministry.<a name=176:4></a> He was presenting the authority of God; grace had seen fit to assert itself in power, and authority was there for the deliverance of man.<a name=176:5></a> The gracious words made God known in His gracious thoughts toward man; but there was authority and power which commanded the unclean spirits, and they came out.<a name=176:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a point in connection with that is, that authority and power were not against man; they were against the power of evil, against demons.<a name=176:7></a> You cannot, I think, find an instance in which the Lord used power and authority against man: He used it against that which held man in bondage.<a name=176:8></a> Men and women were bound under the power of evil; Christ cast seven demons out of Mary Magdalene, a legion of demons out of the demoniacs of Gadara.<a name=176:9></a> The unclean spirits obeyed Him; they never resisted.<a name=176:10></a> He commanded, and they came out.<a name=176:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This shows you how that in the ministry of the Lord Jesus here upon earth He was making clear the lines of the kingdom.<a name=176:12></a> The kingdom did not really come in, so long as Christ was upon earth, but at all events the character of it was foreshadowed.<a name=176:13></a> The principle was grace asserting itself in power, and that marks this moment.<a name=176:14></a> The gospel abounds in words of grace; but the gospel is not here simply in words of grace, but in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=176:15></a> It would be but a poor thing for man to be affected by words of grace.<a name=176:16></a> He is to be enlightened by words of grace, but that is not all; the gospel is accompanied by divine power, in order that man may be brought into salvation.<a name=176:17></a> You could not have salvation without power;

		you could not entertain such an idea for a moment.<a name=177:1></a> Grace may, in a certain sense, be conveyed in words; but salvation, though through faith, involves power, and it is impossible for anyone to be brought into salvation except by power.<a name=177:2></a> Salvation is properly connected with the coming of the Lord, with the power in which the Lord comes in the future.<a name=177:3></a> "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation".<a name=177:4></a> In the eye of God man is in bondage to the power of evil, and Christ has come in to make God known to man, so that man may be brought by the power of God into the enjoyment of salvation.<a name=177:5></a> This power is now in the Holy Spirit.<a name=177:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>again in connection with the commission at the close of the gospel of Luke.<a name=177:7></a> Jesus says to Peter, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven".<a name=177:8></a> There is no doubt whatever that the keys are used in Scripture as a symbol of administration.<a name=177:9></a> The Lord had the keys, and He gives them to Peter: He conferred upon Peter the privilege of opening the door into the kingdom of heaven.<a name=177:10></a>

		But in verse 18 Christ had said, "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it".<a name=177:11></a> The kingdom could not be brought in until the church existed, because whoever went out to preach must have behind him a living witness of the grace of God.<a name=177:12></a> The Lord speaks of forming the church first; then He commits to Peter the keys of the kingdom.<a name=177:13></a> When Peter went forth to preach, he preached the kingdom of heaven -- not in words, but in fact -- and in preaching the kingdom of heaven, Peter knew that he could appeal to the living witness of the grace of God upon earth.<a name=177:14></a> The church which Christ had built was the living witness here upon earth of the grace of God.<a name=177:15></a> The kingdom of heaven was not preached until the living witness was

		There are two points before me in connection with this scripture.<a name=186:1></a> One is righteousness, and the other, the seal of righteousness.<a name=186:2></a> We read, "Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works".<a name=186:3></a> Then afterwards it says, in verse 11, speaking of Abraham, "he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised".<a name=186:4></a> We have here what we might call the first principles of Christianity.<a name=186:5></a> What follows upon righteousness is the seal of righteousness.<a name=186:6></a> The idea of seal is the confirmation of a thing, like the seal to a deed: it is a kind of attestation.<a name=186:7></a> The thought was first brought in in regard to Abraham -- he had righteousness and also the seal of righteousness.<a name=186:8></a> I want to come to the latter point because it is very important to apprehend that God has nothing here in the world for Himself outside of the Spirit of God.<a name=186:9></a> There may be a great deal that professes to be for God which will come under the judgment of God.<a name=186:10></a> I admit all that.<a name=186:11></a> People like the ground of Christianity, and will come under judgment on that ground; but if you look at things morally, there is nothing that is for God, or that God can own, outside of the Spirit of God.<a name=186:12></a> I think the special and peculiar ministry of the apostle Paul was to unfold all that was here consequent upon the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=186:13></a> You get things brought out in connection with the ministry of Paul that are not found in that of the twelve.<a name=186:14></a> You get the body of Christ and sonship; and for the reason that the special ministry of Paul was the unfolding of all here consequent upon or involved in the presence of the Spirit.<a name=186:15></a> In that connection I

		want to speak of righteousness.<a name=187:1></a> In Abraham the seal of righteousness was circumcision -- the same holds good in regard to us, circumcision is to us the seal of righteousness.<a name=187:2></a> Righteousness is by faith, but the seal of righteousness is not by faith.<a name=187:3></a> It is circumcision.<a name=187:4></a> Circumcision is not directly connected with faith, it follows upon righteousness, and is the seal, the confirmation of righteousness.<a name=187:5></a>

		There is a great deal into which we can now enter by the fact of everything having been in principle established in Christ for God.<a name=187:6></a> I want to touch upon that point for a moment.<a name=187:7></a> It is a great point that in Christ everything is established for God.<a name=187:8></a> You cannot understand Christianity, or the presence of the Spirit apart from "All the promises of God in him are yea and in him amen".<a name=187:9></a> The Spirit has come down consequent upon the ascension of Christ, to make known to us that everything of God is established in Christ.<a name=187:10></a> We get this brought out in the first two chapters of Hebrews.<a name=187:11></a> In the first you have God's throne, in connection with God's kingdom.<a name=187:12></a> It is that of which the prophets and the Old Testament writers gave witness.<a name=187:13></a> "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<a name=187:14></a> Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness", etc.<a name=187:15></a> It is God's throne established in a man, and established on the foundation of the perfect discrimination of righteousness and lawlessness.<a name=187:16></a> I suppose it was needful in the ways of God that testimony should be given here of the principles upon which the throne would be established, and hence the Lord Jesus came here to this end.<a name=187:17></a> There has thus been perfect testimony of what is according to God and what is contrary to God.<a name=187:18></a> Christ loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.<a name=187:19></a> Everything here was discerned in the presence of the Lord Jesus in its true character, and that has become the moral foundation of the throne of God, but the throne of God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Righteousness is the assertion of God's rights -- lawlessness refuses God's rights.<a name=188:3></a> Lawlessness virtually says, we will not let God in.<a name=188:4></a> Righteousness on the part of man involves the admission of God's rights.<a name=188:5></a> Man's righteousness is in submitting to God's righteousness.<a name=188:6></a> In Christ God came out in grace to assert His rights.<a name=188:7></a> All this was marked in the pathway of the Lord Jesus.<a name=188:8></a> He loved righteousness -- His ministry was in principle the assertion of God's rights, in opposition to Satan, to control the affection of man.<a name=188:9></a> He "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him".<a name=188:10></a> He did not come to condemn, but in grace and goodness ministered in a way which would tend to gain an entrance into the heart of man.<a name=188:11></a> He loved righteousness, but, on the other hand, He hated lawlessness.<a name=188:12></a> You find the Lord continually in contact with lawlessness.<a name=188:13></a> Lawlessness came out in all kinds of people -- in lawyers, scribes -- all the different classes of people with whom the Lord came into contact -- they virtually said, we will not let God in.<a name=188:14></a> There might be a formal acknowledgment of God by man, but men were perfectly determined to keep out the testimony of God.<a name=188:15></a> Now the Lord hated lawlessness; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>.<a name=188:16></a> And you may be confident that when the kingdom is displayed there will be the dealing with lawlessness by a strong hand.<a name=188:17></a> On the other hand, there will be the assertion of God's righteousness, that is, that God will have His own rights in the affections of His intelligent creatures.<a name=188:18></a>

		Now we see that the throne exists.<a name=188:19></a> The throne had to be based on redemption, and righteousness and lawlessness came to an issue in redemption.<a name=188:20></a> And hence the throne had to be established in a Man.<a name=188:21></a> But then that involves another principle, that man is in the place of highest acceptance with God.<a name=188:22></a> The very

		fact of it being needful on the part of God, that, in the place where good and evil were confounded, there should be perfect discernment as between righteousness and lawlessness, brought the Son of God into this scene as a Man; but as the consequence of His having become man, and tasted death for everything, we get man crowned with glory and honour.<a name=189:1></a> That is in the very highest acceptance with God.<a name=189:2></a> We can talk about the throne, we know its basis and its principles.<a name=189:3></a> We know also the place which man has now with God.<a name=189:4></a> The Holy Spirit has come down to report this.<a name=189:5></a> These are unseen things, but very important things for us to enter into.<a name=189:6></a> They are enduring and eternal things.<a name=189:7></a> All that we see around us which tends to connect greatness with man will surely pass away -- the world and its fashion, that is, its form, passes away.<a name=189:8></a> There are not in it elements of permanence; all will have to give place to the throne of God and to Christ.<a name=189:9></a> The throne of God and Christ go together.<a name=189:10></a> Now we should apprehend that, and our hearts be in the light of it -- we are privileged to walk in the light as God is in the light, for God has come out in the kingdom, and has made Himself known in the gospel.<a name=189:11></a> It is that which belongs to every Christian, and I should be inclined to question the Christianity of any person who is not conscious of walking in the light.<a name=189:12></a> It is not a question of conduct, but of where we walk and must walk, because God has been pleased to come out in that way.<a name=189:13></a> First in grace and in the ministry of Christ here upon earth, and now in the truth of the gospel.<a name=189:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next point I want to touch on is the necessity of our acceptance of redemption.<a name=189:15></a> What I understand by redemption is the taking up of an encumbered right.<a name=189:16></a> You can understand this from common things.<a name=189:17></a> One might come into an inheritance with mortgages and liabilities upon it, and to redeem it involves taking up the liabilities.<a name=189:18></a> I believe that to be the idea of

	<div class="paragraph">
		redemption, and it covers another important point, and that is the principle of divine sovereignty.<a name=190:1></a> We get an illustration of redemption in the case of the children of Israel; when they were sheltered by the blood they ate the lamb roast with fire -- they entered in that sense into redemption, and it was preparatory to their being led forth from Egypt; and what was true of the children of Israel is become true of the individual Christian.<a name=190:2></a> God has redeemed His inheritance.<a name=190:3></a> In times gone by, the children of Israel were God's inheritance, and it is equally true at the present time that God has an inheritance down here, and His inheritance is His people, and that involves the sovereignty of God.<a name=190:4></a> God has set to work to take a people out of the Gentiles.<a name=190:5></a> We read that "as many as were ordained unto eternal life, believed".<a name=190:6></a> There is an election from among the Gentiles.<a name=190:7></a> Christianity began with an election from the Jews, and it has gone on to an election from among the Gentiles.<a name=190:8></a> God has an inheritance, a people here upon earth.<a name=190:9></a> I do not want you to confound this with the idea of the gospel.<a name=190:10></a> The gospel is on another ground, namely, that of God's approach to man, and when God approaches man, He approaches every man; the gospel brings in the light of God to every man upon the earth, giving to man the opportunity of being here for God's will.<a name=190:11></a> At the same time we have to accept the truth that God has a people here upon the earth, a people of His choice -- and God's people are His inheritance.<a name=190:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if God takes up an inheritance, of necessity He takes up the liabilities on the inheritance.<a name=190:13></a> You get the idea of this in the case of Boaz -- he took up the liabilities on the inheritance of Elimelech; and that is what God has been pleased to do in grace at the present time.<a name=190:14></a> God has now seen fit to take up an inheritance, and He has taken up the liabilities on the inheritance, and all have been met by Himself in the death of Christ -- Christ is the Lamb of God -- and that

		is what I understand to be the redemption.<a name=191:1></a> It speaks in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>of "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus".<a name=191:2></a> Redemption is effective in Christ, and God can lead His people out and bring them into the promised land.<a name=191:3></a> If you accept that, you will see how important it is for us to enter into the great reality of redemption.<a name=191:4></a> You have to accept that you are of God's inheritance -- you have no longer right and title in regard to the disposal of yourself -- every liability under which you were has been taken up and met in grace on the part of God in Christ.<a name=191:5></a> A moment comes in the history of a Christian when he has to accept the sovereignty of God's mercy, and it is an extremely important moment, for it means that God has entire and absolute right over me.<a name=191:6></a> Redemption has been accomplished, the inheritance in that sense is free in regard to God, and we have to admit God's right to do as He likes with His inheritance.<a name=191:7></a> I do not think I am much more of a Calvinist than other people, but I see the sovereignty of God's mercy.<a name=191:8></a> For instance in a family, one may be saved in the midst of a number; the question may come up, Why should God have taken one up and not others?<a name=191:9></a> I cannot tell, it is a question of the sovereignty of God's mercy, God has been pleased to act in that way, and it may be the case in almost any family.<a name=191:10></a> But if God has been pleased to act thus in the sovereignty of His mercy in regard to me, I have to recognise that I am part of His inheritance, and that God has title to do with me what He will.<a name=191:11></a> I do not see how that can be contested.<a name=191:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that God's people are His inheritance, and His people are for Himself and for the world to come.<a name=191:13></a> And our righteousness is for God and for the world to come.<a name=191:14></a> I think that is the point that is seen in this chapter; the soul is entering into the reality of redemption.<a name=191:15></a> What we come to is that Christ is our righteousness -- the One who on the part of God took up our liabilities is the righteousness of His people;

		and I think that is intelligible, because it is in Christ that God has been pleased to give witness of righteousness.<a name=192:1></a> You get at the end of the chapter, "who was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification".<a name=192:2></a> It was in Him that the liabilities were taken up, and in resurrection God has given witness that these liabilities have been discharged.<a name=192:3></a> God has broken the bonds of death, hence it is that the witness of righteousness is given in Christ risen; and Christ risen is the righteousness of His people.<a name=192:4></a> Now we are justified in Christ.<a name=192:5></a> If any one were to appeal to me as to my righteousness before God, I could only point to the One who met my liabilities, because He alone is out of death.<a name=192:6></a> God has not yet given witness of righteousness in me, I am still subject to death; the Christian is not yet in resurrection, but Christ is in resurrection; and Christ is our righteousness in the presence of God, also in regard to the world to come.<a name=192:7></a> I think you will see the importance of that; in that it is the beginning of the soul's appropriation of Christ.<a name=192:8></a> We then thank God for what He has made Him to us, "wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption".<a name=192:9></a> There are many relationships in which Christ stands to us, but we have to begin with Christ as righteousness.<a name=192:10></a> God has made Him so for the reason that Christ is the One in whom God has given testimony of our liabilities having been met; that is in the fact that God raised Him from the dead.<a name=192:11></a> You cannot press a more important point than the resurrection of Christ, and that the Christian is justified in Christ.<a name=192:12></a> Inconsistencies may be pointed out in the ways of the Christian; but he can ever point to Christ, and say that all his liabilities have been met in Christ.<a name=192:13></a> The purpose of God was to take up His inheritance in His people, and the liabilities were discharged in Christ.<a name=192:14></a> I think the effect of the apprehension of that is the beginning of all attachment to Christ -- Christ is inseparable now from us, and we from Christ.<a name=192:15></a>

		I am thankful to be able to refer to Christ as to righteousness.<a name=193:1></a> If any one were to ask me, how I am justified, I would point to Christ risen, and say that He is the witness from God that every liability has been met, and is therefore my righteousness.<a name=193:2></a> Now I come to the seal of righteousness.<a name=193:3></a> Look at <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:6">Genesis  15:6</a> for a moment, "He believed in the Lord, and he counted it for righteousness".<a name=193:4></a> And in chapter 17: 9 - 13 we get the seal.<a name=193:5></a> It is alluded to in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>, "He received the sign of circumcision", it was not the thing signified, but the sign of it.<a name=193:6></a> "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised".<a name=193:7></a> Now in the ways of God circumcision must hang upon righteousness.<a name=193:8></a> As we have seen, righteousness is in this, that in Christ all our liabilities have been met; and in the meeting of those liabilities there was the end before God of the flesh.<a name=193:9></a> I want everyone to enter into that.<a name=193:10></a> Our liability in the presence of God was death, and for the meeting of that liability, death was essential.<a name=193:11></a> But death was the end of the flesh, therefore it follows of necessity that circumcision, the putting off of the flesh, must follow upon righteousness.<a name=193:12></a> Righteousness was accomplished in the death of Christ, when our liabilities were met; but circumcision necessarily took place there, that is, the cutting off of the flesh.<a name=193:13></a> And the same thing must become true in the Christian.<a name=193:14></a> When we come to application, the one is really the seal of the other.<a name=193:15></a> I think it is most remarkable that it should have been set forth in the case of Abraham -- he was justified, accounted righteous in anticipation of the death of Christ, and he received circumcision, not perhaps in the reality of it, but as a sign; you could not get the reality of it in those days.<a name=193:16></a> Both his righteousness and the seal of it pointed on to what was yet to come to pass; still, Abraham was justified in God's mind.<a name=193:17></a> We now have Christ for righteousness.<a name=193:18></a> And we get circumcision not simply

		as a sign, but as a seal.<a name=194:1></a> Circumcision could not be brought about except by the Spirit of God.<a name=194:2></a> It means that following upon righteousness there is the putting aside of the rule of the flesh, seeing that in the death of Christ, where righteousness was established, the flesh was cut off.<a name=194:3></a> In the epistle to the Colossians, we get the expression "circumcision of Christ", that is in regard to Christians.<a name=194:4></a> We enter into redemption by faith -- Christ is our righteousness.<a name=194:5></a> But though circumcision be accepted, it can only be effectual in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=194:6></a> Hence you may speak of the Spirit being the seal in our case.<a name=194:7></a> But the seal of righteousness is not so much the Spirit as the effect of the Spirit; and the effect of the Spirit is to set aside the rule of the flesh.<a name=194:8></a> The flesh never could come into the righteousness of God, <i>I</i> may come into the righteousness of God, but the flesh never could, it never could come within the rule of God -- "they that are in the flesh cannot please God"; but I come under the rule of God.<a name=194:9></a> How can I come within the rule of God?<a name=194:10></a> By the setting aside of the flesh, and the flesh is set aside in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=194:11></a> We read, "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh".<a name=194:12></a> And I believe that the first sense which follows the reception of the Spirit in the believer is that the flesh is no longer to rule -- thus circumcision comes in by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=194:13></a> You can understand the reality of this, for how can we be near Christ and give licence to the flesh?<a name=194:14></a> There is no doubt that the allowance of the flesh comes in very much between Christians and Christ.<a name=194:15></a> But I do not think it is possible to be practically near Christ and to allow the flesh, the very condition of nearness to Christ being that the flesh has no place.<a name=194:16></a> If Christ is our righteousness, and you want to enjoy your righteousness, it is evident you need to be near to Christ, and the Spirit of God will keep us near to Christ, but on the other hand will not

		We surely want to be near to Christ, for all spiritual progress depends upon the soul's appropriation of Christ.<a name=195:5></a> God has been pleased to place Him within the reach of our appropriation, but appropriation is conditional on the truth of circumcision.<a name=195:6></a> Circumcision follows upon righteousness, and it is practicable now to the people of God in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=195:7></a> Had it not been for the place which the Spirit of God has taken up in the people of God, circumcision would not have been practicable to us.<a name=195:8></a> If you are prepared to accept the rule of the Spirit of God, you will see great gain to be got from it, and that is, that the Spirit will make you conscious of nearness to Christ; and if in nearness to Christ, then you enter into the great reality of Christ being your righteousness in the presence of God, so that you have acceptance with God and for the world to come.<a name=195:9></a> We are in the habit of taking things up too dogmatically, simply resting upon statements in Scripture, which is hardly faith.<a name=195:10></a> So far as I understand faith, it connects itself with divine living Persons.<a name=195:11></a> The Lord Jesus said: "Ye believe in God, believe also in me".<a name=195:12></a> And we want not only to be in the faith of Christ, but in the appropriation of Christ.<a name=195:13></a> He is our righteousness, and if so, we are entitled to be near to Him, and this really involves circumcision.<a name=195:14></a> You have got the power to carry this out, it is practicable since the Spirit came.<a name=195:15></a> I give you one word more, from the epistle to Titus, which will express the idea of nearness to Christ.<a name=195:16></a> "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us"

		Now I come to another very important point, and that is the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=210:14></a> I daresay I shall not do much justice to it, but of the importance of the fact I have no doubt.<a name=210:15></a> The baptism of the Spirit brings us to the truth of the "one body".<a name=210:16></a> We can see the progress of the truth in regard to it.<a name=210:17></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>John the baptist hails Jesus as the One who baptises with the Holy Spirit; and on the day of Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Spirit took place according to

		the word which the Lord spoke to the disciples, "Ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days hence".<a name=211:1></a> And then in the chapter I have read the baptism of the Holy Spirit was extended to the Gentiles in the case of Cornelius.<a name=211:2></a> Then in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>we get the doctrine, "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", etc.<a name=211:3></a>, and afterwards in the same chapter is the statement that the saints were Christ's body; in fact, in the early part of the chapter we read, "so also is the Christ".<a name=211:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My first point is to give you an idea of the meaning of the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=211:5></a> I think this will enable you to see the force of the succeeding passages, where we get the same thing spoken of.<a name=211:6></a> Jesus Himself drew the contrast between John's baptism with water, and His own with the Holy Spirit; and undoubtedly in Christianity the baptism of the Spirit is very distinct from baptism with water.<a name=211:7></a> The baptism with water connects itself with God's testimony down here, and is administered by man, and a great many people are baptised who have no part in the baptism of the Spirit.<a name=211:8></a> Baptism with water connects itself with one order of things, and the baptism of the Spirit with another.<a name=211:9></a> That the baptism of water was incumbent on those who received the testimony is evident from the Lord's word in the last chapter of Mark: the apostles were to preach the gospel to every creature, and "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved".<a name=211:10></a> Baptism was incumbent on those who received the testimony, and it was administered by man.<a name=211:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has often been said, however, that we have no record of the baptism of the first 120.<a name=211:12></a> There was no one to baptise them.<a name=211:13></a> They were baptised with the Holy Spirit; and the testimony went forth from them, and all who received the testimony were baptised with water and brought in that way into Christian fellowship.<a name=211:14></a> It was a work which God was doing down here by means of His testimony, but you must distinguish

		that from the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:1></a> Now if you will just refer to <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:29">John  1:29</a> - 34, you will see two things which John the baptist predicated in regard to Christ.<a name=212:2></a> One was, "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world", and the other, "the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Spirit".<a name=212:3></a> In connection with the Lord Himself you first get the descent of the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:4></a> There had been types of this in the Old Testament, the meat-offering was invariably mingled and anointed with oil.<a name=212:5></a> You get there a figure of the Holy Spirit connected with perfect humanity, for I suppose that the fine wheat set forth pure humanity, untainted by anything which is of man.<a name=212:6></a> It prefigured Christ in that sense, and Christ was anointed with the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:7></a> It was a new departure on the part of God that the Spirit of God should descend upon a man.<a name=212:8></a> It has been pointed out that in our case there is no type of the baptism of the Holy Spirit until the blood is there; but in the case of the Lord it was different.<a name=212:9></a> But there was something almost more wonderful, that there should be One here who could baptise others with the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:10></a> In a sense, it was not wonderful that the Holy Spirit should descend upon Christ when you consider who Christ was, but it was very wonderful that others could be baptised with the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a previous thought in connection with Christ, and that is, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world".<a name=212:12></a> You want to put the two thoughts together, that is, the removing the sin of the world, and baptising with the Holy Spirit.<a name=212:13></a> It has been said that the sin of the world is not yet taken away; but the Lamb of God has been here, "once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin".<a name=212:14></a> The sacrifice has taken place, but the sin of the world is not yet taken away.<a name=212:15></a> The taking away the sin of the world is an act of power, and will be brought to pass by the coming of God into the

		world.<a name=213:1></a> The instant God comes into the world sin will be taken away.<a name=213:2></a> The sin of the world is lawlessness, the spirit that will not have God, it finds its head and development in antichrist, who in the absence of God usurps the place of God; but the moment that God comes in (as He surely will) the sin of the world is taken away.<a name=213:3></a> Lawlessness can no longer be when God sees fit to come in, as He will, in righteous judgment.<a name=213:4></a> I do not think that people quite understand what the sin of the world is.<a name=213:5></a> I believe it to be the working of the principle of antichrist, the principle that shuts God out.<a name=213:6></a> It is the principle of the world at the present moment.<a name=213:7></a> Men will name the name of God and talk about God, but practically they will not have God.<a name=213:8></a> Because the very first principle connected with God is what I might call the law of the moral universe, namely, righteousness, and men prefer lawlessness.<a name=213:9></a> But when God comes in, and takes up His abode, another principle must come in, and that is holiness.<a name=213:10></a> Holiness becometh God's house.<a name=213:11></a> When the Israelites had been brought out of Egypt, they sang, "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness".<a name=213:12></a> Now holiness is what man's mind is entirely unaccustomed to.<a name=213:13></a> Man's mind may entertain the idea of righteousness, as between man and man, but it has no idea of the righteousness of God.<a name=213:14></a> Hence it must be quite unaccustomed to the idea of holiness, and when God comes in He brings in holiness.<a name=213:15></a> This is what the apostle Paul had to impress upon the minds of the Corinthians: "The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are".<a name=213:16></a> How is it holy?<a name=213:17></a> On account of the One who dwells there.<a name=213:18></a> The One who dwells gives character to the house of God.<a name=213:19></a> My point is that the moment God comes in, there must be an end to sin as an active principle in the world.<a name=213:20></a> Infidelity will necessarily be proved in that day to be perfect folly,

		Now I come to the second point.<a name=214:14></a> He baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=214:15></a> Baptising with the Holy Spirit really means a subjective work in regard to man, and the practical result of it is, that man becomes the vessel of the life of God, that is, in a moral sense.<a name=214:16></a> I think that is the idea connected with the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=214:17></a> It is certain that the life of God cannot go one bit beyond the Spirit of God and His work.<a name=214:18></a> And when I talk that way, I do not mean to exalt man to deity, but it is the way of God by the Holy Spirit that man should be made the vessel of the divine life morally.<a name=214:19></a> That is the answer that God has given to the power of evil -- the sin of the world.<a name=214:20></a> The sin

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, do you think the mind of man ever entertained such an idea as that?<a name=215:8></a> I do not know much about other systems, religious or philosophical, Buddhism and the like, but I have heard the idea of the absorption of man into deity.<a name=215:9></a> That kind of idea has been entertained.<a name=215:10></a> I do not think the authors understood what they meant, because they were so profoundly ignorant of deity.<a name=215:11></a> They did not know much about their own deities, or they would have found them to be devils; much less did they know anything about the true Deity.<a name=215:12></a> Men may talk about the absorption of man into deity, but the truth as we have it here, the way of God, is in perfect contrast to that, because the point of God's way is to bring the life of God into man down here.<a name=215:13></a> The Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, but He baptises with the Holy Spirit so that man may be the vessel of the life of God.<a name=215:14></a> It does not matter how degraded man may have been.<a name=215:15></a> Take either Jew or Gentile.<a name=215:16></a> Nothing could be more degraded than the condition of the Gentile, as the result of idolatry, when the Apostle Paul preached to them.<a name=215:17></a> No matter how degraded, man was to become the vessel of the life of God.<a name=215:18></a> You get that thought brought out in what the Lord said to the woman of Samaria in chapter 4 of John's gospel.<a name=215:19></a> The Lord does not say a word about her going to heaven; He says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now think what a contrast that is to every thought of man.<a name=216:9></a> Do you think any philosopher entertained the idea of men -- sinful men down here -- being made the vessels of the life of God at the present time?<a name=216:10></a> Absorption and all such ideas refer to what may take place after death; but the passage I read has nothing to do with death, it is what Christ would do down here upon earth, that is, baptise with the Holy Spirit.<a name=216:11></a> The fact is, John, by the Spirit of God, discerned in Christ a new point of departure.<a name=216:12></a> The Holy Spirit descended and abode upon Him, there never was the like before.<a name=216:13></a> Christ was exceptional to anything that had taken place.<a name=216:14></a> John apprehended this by the Spirit of God, and said, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God".<a name=216:15></a> Now all this is in contrast to anything that ever entered into man's conception.<a name=216:16></a> In the scene of man's sin and ruin and shame, in a person who had been a slave to sin and lust, there, by the Spirit of God, the life of God was to come out, and that was the effect of baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=216:17></a>

		Wisdom and every other possible moral quality are inherent in God, and man only has what God has given to him, and cannot have more than God has given to him.<a name=250:3></a> God has now made known His nature, and that is love; there are many qualities which are inherent in God, which have their source in love.<a name=250:4></a> My reason for saying this is because love is the nature of God.<a name=250:5></a> It is the one thing which God is said to be absolutely.<a name=250:6></a>

		There is this idea in wisdom, it is <i>resource</i>.<a name=250:7></a> You may use the word in a different sense, but what brings out wisdom -- resource -- is difficulties: that is the case in human things, and it is so in regard to God.<a name=250:8></a> Whatever moral difficulty may present itself, with God there is resource.<a name=250:9></a> It is absolutely impossible that God could be baffled by any difficulty, for with God there is inexhaustible resource.<a name=250:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a foundation for what I am going to say, I may remark that it was ever God's intention to reveal Himself: that was one great point in regard to man, and another was that God intended to bless man.<a name=250:11></a> Apart from that you will not enter into what I am about to bring before you.<a name=250:12></a> Now you find all through Scripture that as the purpose and mind of God came to light there were always difficulties to be encountered, and man was no help to God.<a name=250:13></a> There was no assistance to be found in him, and God had to act in every crisis entirely independent of him; and yet in spite of the contrariety of man, evident at every crisis, God carries out His purpose, reveals Himself to and blesses man.<a name=250:14></a> I have no doubt whatever that wisdom means the resource by which God could carry that out, and Christ is thus the wisdom of God.<a name=250:15></a>

		The time afterwards came when God had brought the seed of Abraham, according to flesh, out of Egypt through redemption, and another thought came out in connection with this, namely, that God would dwell here, and He took from the children of Israel the materials to make a dwelling-place among them; but the children of Israel did not want God to dwell, they made a golden calf.<a name=252:1></a> They neither wanted the revelation of God nor the dwelling of God.<a name=252:2></a> The natural heart and perverseness of man came out in them; and yet God intended to dwell among them.<a name=252:3></a> He dwelt in a material tabernacle, but how long was that to last?<a name=252:4></a> It could not last for ever; the tabernacle must perish with material things, and no provision was made for the renewal of the tabernacle, nor was there for the temple.<a name=252:5></a> God's purpose of dwelling could not be carried out according to His mind in that way, and this brings before us again that in God's mind there was resource.<a name=252:6></a> The purpose was to be carried out in man, but the wisdom which was with God had not yet come to light.<a name=252:7></a>

		To go on further, a promise was made to David that God would set his seed upon his throne for ever.<a name=252:8></a> The throne of David was to endure for ever; but do you think that the natural seed of David cared for an eternal throne?<a name=252:9></a> Solomon turned the throne to his own account, and for the sin of Solomon the kingdom was divided; but God had committed Himself to a promise that the throne of David was to endure for ever, and the seed of David was to sit upon it, and it is only too evident that the seed of David after the flesh was no help to God to carry out His purpose.<a name=252:10></a> The fact is, that God had His resource in Himself.<a name=252:11></a> There was wisdom with Him, in which He would be enabled to carry out His purpose.<a name=252:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not that God was unaffected by what came in by man, God was distressed by it and repented that He had made man; but all the way of God was clear before Him, and that way has now come to light, and we see that wisdom is inherent in God, and it could not but be that He should have His way before Him whatever might come in.<a name=254:8></a> In the very nature of things there must be a way before Him, but man could not see that way, and now God had brought it to light.<a name=254:9></a> He had a Man in reserve, the Man of His right hand, who has accomplished redemption, revealed God in love, and in whom every promise and purpose of God is centred.<a name=254:10></a>

		Now just a word as to confusion.<a name=271:2></a> I have no doubt whatever that peace prevailed in Eden, God could look on His work and pronounce it all very good: there was no confusion when God had created all things and placed man in the midst according to His mind.<a name=271:3></a> And when He made the woman and brought her to the man, there was no confusion, such an element was not there.<a name=271:4></a> What brought the disturbance in was sin, the act of will; there was the breach of peace, and confusion became connected, from that moment, with alienation of man from God.<a name=271:5></a> God turned him out of the garden of Eden, and then everything was out of course; righteousness had been broken through and lawlessness was there.<a name=271:6></a> Then there was confusion, for wherever man seeks his own glory there must be confusion.<a name=271:7></a> Man makes himself an object and a centre, and that adds to the confusion: there can be no peace in that.<a name=271:8></a> If the creature gets out of the place of the creature, there cannot be peace.<a name=271:9></a> We can understand that in natural things.<a name=271:10></a> If a servant undertakes the control of a house there is confusion, things are upside down.<a name=271:11></a> If man exalts himself, and pride and arrogance thus come in, he has got out of the place of the creature.<a name=271:12></a> He does not look for the glory that comes only from God, but seeks His own, and there is confusion, the beginning of it being in man departed from God at the outset.<a name=271:13></a> Man was bent on building the tower of Babel.<a name=271:14></a> The meaning of the word 'Babel' is confusion, for there God brought in confusion of language.<a name=271:15></a> Man brought moral confusion in at the beginning, and was adding to it in his purpose to build a city and a tower to make a name for himself, and God came in, confounding their speech.<a name=271:16></a> In result there came into the world national antipathy and all that kind of thing, which has filled the earth with confusion.<a name=271:17></a> God allowed that to come in as a

		check upon the development of evil on earth; but the confusion was not of God, it was on the part of man.<a name=272:1></a> When man arrogates to himself glory which belongs to God, it seems to me that there must be confusion.<a name=272:2></a> There can be no true glory of which God is not the fountain.<a name=272:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the climax of confusion is found in the man of sin.<a name=272:4></a> What will mark his time will be that men say "Peace and safety" when there is no peace, for God will have no peace in that order of things.<a name=272:5></a> We read in 2 Thessalonians of the apostasy, and of the man of sin being revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he himself sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is God; there is the climax of confusion.<a name=272:6></a> There is every possible element of disturbance, and if men say "Peace and safety", God will not allow peace, the whole thing will be blown upon, and it will be a moment of persecution undoubtedly for the people of God, and, as far as man is concerned, it will result in sudden destruction, which will come upon the world as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.<a name=272:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So far I have touched on two or three salient points in connection with moral confusion in the world.<a name=272:8></a> It came in through man becoming alienated from God: it brought trouble into every relationship of life down here.<a name=272:9></a> You get the progress of it in Babel, and the climax in the man of sin.<a name=272:10></a> Not only will God be refused, but there will be a grave breach of the relationships which God has established in the world.<a name=272:11></a> We get striking thoughts of that in the book of Revelation.<a name=272:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have the contrast to that in what is proper to Christians.<a name=272:13></a> God is the God of peace, and the God of peace will bruise Satan under our feet shortly.<a name=272:14></a> God is not the author of confusion but of peace.<a name=272:15></a> He is spoken of many times as the God of peace, and also

		If you refer to the verses in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>again (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:19">Colossians  1:19</a>, 20), you read, "For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven".<a name=273:5></a> That passage makes it plain that the object in making peace was to bring about reconciliation, and reconciliation was to be brought about <i>by Him</i>.<a name=273:6></a> These two little words are often overlooked in the passage.<a name=273:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:13">Ephesians  2:13</a> we get, "But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.<a name=273:8></a> For he is our peace" -- it does not say He made peace, but He is our peace -- "who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.<a name=273:9></a> Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace".<a name=273:10></a> That is not the thought of making peace by the blood of His cross, it is making peace in Himself.<a name=273:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with Christ there are evidently three thoughts as to peace.<a name=273:12></a> The first is, that He made peace; the second, that He is peace; and the third, He gives His own peace.<a name=273:13></a> "My peace I give unto you", He said to His disciples.<a name=273:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to the first, I suppose the reference is to the peace-offering.<a name=273:15></a> There were three offerings which went together -- the burnt-offering, the meat-offering,

		<a name=274>[Page 274]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and the peace-offering.<a name=274:1></a> I leave aside for the moment offerings which were connected with restoration: offerings for sin; they were of a different character; the normal offerings were the three I have named.<a name=274:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meaning and value of the burnt-offering was acceptance with God.<a name=274:3></a> Man by it obtained acceptance with God.<a name=274:4></a> The burnt-offering took account of sin in its consequence of death.<a name=274:5></a> Sin was met, and righteousness established by the offering, and man found acceptance with God in righteousness.<a name=274:6></a> In the meat-offering the point is of pure humanity in the righteous One.<a name=274:7></a> In order to have the series completed, we get the peace-offering, and that sets forth that peace is made, the source of disturbance having been removed.<a name=274:8></a> In the death of Christ, not simply has God been glorified in regard to righteousness, but confusion has been removed, and there is peace both for God and for man.<a name=274:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Most will remember that the burnt-offering was never eaten: it was all, save the skin, burnt upon the altar; it was a question of the establishing and witnessing the righteousness of God.<a name=274:10></a> As to the peace-offering, it was eaten partly by the offerer and partly by the priest.<a name=274:11></a> The offerer came into communion with God in the peace-offering, and there you get the beginning of peace; and, it seems to me, a blessed thought that, whatever we see in the world, the removal of the cause of the existing confusion has been effected before God in the death of Christ.<a name=274:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What do you think is the cause of disturbance in the world?<a name=274:13></a> It is man after the flesh, and man has been removed in the death of Christ.<a name=274:14></a> He has made peace by the blood of His cross, for sin in the flesh has been condemned before God and for God.<a name=274:15></a> Peace subsists for God and for those who eat the offering.<a name=274:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You do not get a type of resurrection in the offerings, and resurrection is not in the victim, for even Christ, as Victim, was not revived.<a name=275:9></a> Sin was condemned in the flesh, and it is in that connection that Christ stood as Victim.<a name=275:10></a> He is revived as Priest in the power of an endless life.<a name=275:11></a> The Victim has gone, and in the Victim is the end of all the moral confusion.<a name=275:12></a> The One who offered Himself without spot to God is revived, not as victim, but as Priest, and that One is our peace.<a name=275:13></a> Peace is made by the blood of His cross -- the disturbance has gone.<a name=275:14></a> It is a great thing to eat the offering and to enjoy it with God, for our souls delight in the way which God has taken to remove the confusion, we can enjoy that even in the midst of this world.<a name=275:15></a> I can retire into communion with God, and feed upon the offering of Christ; and the One who offered Himself by the eternal Spirit without spot to God, is revived from the dead, and is our peace.<a name=275:16></a>

		Now in natural things there are certain laws in operation which are unvarying and there is no confusion; but in things moral I see confusion enough.<a name=282:15></a> The reconciliation of all this I must leave to others.<a name=282:16></a> Whatever insight I might have into the works of God in creation, and as to the operation of natural laws, could not possibly unveil to me the nature of God: and can never make known to me what the relations of man are to God.<a name=282:17></a> There is a good deal of pretension in the present day on the part of man to knowledge, but it is futile and not likely to lead to any good result.<a name=282:18></a>

		Truth is not to be found by the searching of man.<a name=283:1></a> Man has lost God and got into lawlessness and sin, and hence all the searching in the universe can never find out God!<a name=283:2></a> It is impossible.<a name=283:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can speak of truth in contrast to that.<a name=283:4></a> We read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>that "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ", and "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=283:5></a> The declaration of God is truth.<a name=283:6></a> If I were to give a definition of truth, I should say that truth is the expression of right things as they are.<a name=283:7></a> If you want to get at truth you must get at things <i>expressed</i> as they are.<a name=283:8></a> In that light you can understand very simply that truth came by Jesus Christ, that He is the truth.<a name=283:9></a> He is the way, the truth and the life.<a name=283:10></a> It is not simply that He is true; He is true, God is true, but Christ is the truth.<a name=283:11></a> He is the <i>expression</i> of things as they are, whether as to God or man.<a name=283:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One result of this definition is that in the presence of truth every falsehood is exposed.<a name=283:13></a> The antithesis of truth is falsehood.<a name=283:14></a> In his first epistle John says, "I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth", and "Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?<a name=283:15></a> He is the antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son".<a name=283:16></a> The liar and the antichrist are evidently bound up together.<a name=283:17></a> The liar shows the origin of the antichrist and opposes the revelation of God.<a name=283:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You can see these principles abroad today on every hand.<a name=283:19></a> There is the liar, denying Jesus to be the Christ, and there is the antichrist who denies the revelation of God -- the Father and the Son.<a name=283:20></a> There are plenty of people in the world who own Jesus as Man, but the point in Scripture is that Jesus is "The Christ".<a name=283:21></a> And again, men talk about the Fatherhood of God, but the point in Scripture is not the Fatherhood

		Christ is the truth because that in Christ we have the expression of things as they are.<a name=284:5></a> People think that truth is the exposure of the wickedness of the world, but that is not truth.<a name=284:6></a> It is all a lie that is made manifest, but not by truth.<a name=284:7></a> True things may be said about man, and his departure from what is right may be described, but that is not truth: it is not the expression of right things, of things as they are; Christ is the way, the truth and the life.<a name=284:8></a>

		Righteousness in Scripture often stands in opposition to lawlessness.<a name=293:5></a> Sin is lawlessness.<a name=293:6></a> Lawlessness refuses the rights of God, and, in fact, refuses God: that is the spirit of lawlessness.<a name=293:7></a> The Lord Jesus said when here, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin"; that is, they refused God, and the right of God, for Christ had spoken to them in divine love.<a name=293:8></a> Love had been expressed in Him in word and in deed, and they refused His word, and in refusing His word they had sin; in other words, the truth is that man will not have God.<a name=293:9></a> Man will do his best to exclude God, because he is lawless.<a name=293:10></a> If the rights of God were recognised you would have the earth filled with blessing, men would love God with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves; but, instead of this, the mystery of lawlessness is at work, and will culminate in the man of sin, and he will exclude God so far as he can, and the practical result will be that the earth will be filled with hatred and misery.<a name=293:11></a> Righteousness brings in God and love; lawlessness shuts God out and makes way for the pride of man and falsehood and hatred.<a name=293:12></a> You can see the working of it in the present day, and it is very largely helped on by rationalism and semi-infidelity.<a name=293:13></a> In the future it will be rampant, and things will be headed up in the man of sin, and then there will be darkness and hatred filling the world.<a name=293:14></a>

		We are led to apprehend Christ first as the righteous One and then as the Holy One.<a name=296:3></a> We find in Christ perfect accord with the holiness of God.<a name=296:4></a> When Peter was preaching to the Jews, he speaks of the Holy One, saying, "Ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you".<a name=296:5></a> And then in the first epistle of John it is said, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One".<a name=296:6></a> Both Peter and John present Christ as the "Holy One".<a name=296:7></a> Christ maintained righteousness here, but He was characterised by holiness, and we cannot understand the path of Christ on earth unless we take into account the thought of holiness.<a name=296:8></a>

		Holiness is inseparable from love.<a name=296:9></a> You get the perfect expression of divine love in Christ on earth, but it was a holy love, and that is what marked everything in the witness of the Lord Jesus down here.<a name=296:10></a> He went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him.<a name=296:11></a> He relieved man of every ill, but behind all that there was perfect moral accord with God.<a name=296:12></a> He was one with the Father.<a name=296:13></a> There was the expression down here of the holy love of God, so that the Lord Jesus could say in reproach to the Jews, "Now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father".<a name=296:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point connected with light, and that is, we may look at it as brought before us in the Person of Christ.<a name=305:8></a> He could say when here, "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life".<a name=305:9></a> And so He said to His disciples, "Ye are the light of the world".<a name=305:10></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>Jesus said, "I have come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness".<a name=305:11></a> There we have darkness put relatively to light.<a name=305:12></a>

		But there is another quality connected with light, and that is, it makes manifest.<a name=309:4></a> "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God".<a name=309:5></a> I want just to make plain that light is necessarily a test.<a name=309:6></a> The light which had come in, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>, was the revelation of God's disposition towards the world.<a name=309:7></a> Christ's presence brought that to light.<a name=309:8></a> The love of God came into the world in the way of testimony, and Christ was that testimony.<a name=309:9></a> He was the witness of the love of God toward the world, irrespective of Jew or Gentile.<a name=309:10></a> Thus the love of God came into the world in the way of testimony, and in the presence of the light men were all proved.<a name=309:11></a> He that did truth came to light; he was attracted -- there was a power of attraction in the light.<a name=309:12></a> On the other hand, the one who did evil did not come to the light lest his deeds should be reproved.<a name=309:13></a> If anyone came to the light it was the proof of a work of God in him; there is a power of attraction in what is of God.<a name=309:14></a> We see this exemplified in Nathaniel, for instance.<a name=309:15></a> We know pretty much in our own experience that no one could have come to the light except as the result of God's work in him.<a name=309:16></a> "He that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved".<a name=309:17></a> The light came in Christ into many associations and circumstances here.<a name=309:18></a> Take, for instance, the twelve disciples, eleven of them were attracted to the light.<a name=309:19></a> There was a work of God in them.<a name=309:20></a> Judas was very near the light, but after all he

		Again, in the house of Simon the Pharisee the woman of the city who was a sinner was doing truth.<a name=310:4></a> People would have judged her differently, just as Simon did, perhaps would not have taken any notice of her, but still she was so far doing truth, and the light attracted her.<a name=310:5></a> Simon was not doing truth: he was covering up all he was and thought by an unreal appearance.<a name=310:6></a> He was in darkness, and was not attracted by the light, and yet he was only one step from the light.<a name=310:7></a> Christ was a guest in his house; the sinner was attracted by the light, while Simon was in complete darkness, but was exposed.<a name=310:8></a>

		I speak of these things to show the character of the light.<a name=310:9></a> It was an appointed light which shone in its lustre, but it needed that eyes should be opened to apprehend it, because man, like Simon, is covering up everything as to himself with an unreal appearance, doing evil, and not coming to the light lest his deeds should be reproved.<a name=310:10></a> As regards people of today, do you think they would like everything uncovered?<a name=310:11></a> It is very different with the Christian whose eyes have been opened, everything has been uncovered.<a name=310:12></a> Then it is he does truth, and is attracted to the light because he apprehends that in the presence of the light it is possible for man to live.<a name=310:13></a> How gracious of God to send His Son into the world as light in which it is possible for man to live!<a name=310:14></a>

		What I have been saying hitherto has been connected with Christ upon earth, His presence here.<a name=311:10></a> It is very wonderful that Christ has been here on earth, and has brought God to light.<a name=311:11></a> He showed to men, as we have seen, that He had come here to bear the liabilities of man so that in the presence of light man might live.<a name=311:12></a> Now the passages which I have just quoted refer to what is true at <i>this present moment</i>.<a name=311:13></a> Paul began with light from heaven, Christ Himself; He saw a light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=311:14></a> Stephen had looked up stedfastly into heaven, and had seen the glory of God and Jesus, but had to suffer for his testimony, and then Saul sees a light above the brightness of the sun, and hears a voice.<a name=311:15></a> That was the beginning with Saul, and there was a work of God in him.<a name=311:16></a> He could not have borne that brightness for a moment apart from a work of God, and he learned that in the presence of light it was possible for him to live.<a name=311:17></a> Had it not been so, Saul, as being a persecutor and an enemy of grace, would have been withered by the light.<a name=311:18></a> The beginning showed the Lord's mind in regard to Saul in His saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=311:19></a>" How tenderly Christ addressed him, calling him twice by name!<a name=311:20></a> The Lord spoke thus to him, and he learned in his soul that it was possible for him to live in the light of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to point out this consistency in one or two particular points as seen in all the writers in the New Testament.<a name=317:11></a> There is one point on which they are unmistakably consistent, namely, the character of the world.<a name=317:12></a> Another point is the decay and eventual judgment of professing Christianity; and a third is the introduction of another system, of which Christ is Head.<a name=317:13></a> The system of which I speak has its source in God, and is ruled by His will.<a name=317:14></a> That is the principle of righteousness.<a name=317:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to the world, it is not one scripture writer only that gives you its character in the eye of God, and shows what it will end in.<a name=317:16></a> James says, "He that will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God"; here a man is not seen as an enemy by what he does, but in being a friend of the world.<a name=317:17></a> John is emphatic about the world, and says, "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world".<a name=317:18></a> He gives you the principles which rule in the world,

		<a name=318>[Page 318]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		and their end.<a name=318:1></a> "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever".<a name=318:2></a> That must come to pass when God comes in.<a name=318:3></a> Paul speaks of the world in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:4">Galatians  1:4</a>, "Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father".<a name=318:4></a> Peter, quoting Isaiah says, "All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.<a name=318:5></a> The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever".<a name=318:6></a> The consistency of the testimony on the part of all the writers in regard of the world comes out very plainly.<a name=318:7></a> We are living in a world of lust which has not yet passed away, but will pass away most certainly.<a name=318:8></a> The flower of the grass is, to a certain extent, here -- it presents the glory of man for the moment -- but when the breath of the Lord blows upon it, it withers.<a name=318:9></a> Paul speaks of the work of God in delivering us out of the world.<a name=318:10></a> The Revelation gives us detail of the judgment of the world system.<a name=318:11></a> It is couched in obscure, symbolic language, but the world system is set aside to make room for the only-begotten Son of God.<a name=318:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, for God, the world came to an end in the death of Christ.<a name=318:13></a> That is seen in the direction as to the burning of the red heifer in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#19">Numbers  19</a>.<a name=318:14></a> The cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet were cast into the burning, and there was an end of the world system morally for God, though not yet in fact, for God allows it for the moment to go on.<a name=318:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We turn now to another point, to what has occupied God since Christianity was first introduced.<a name=318:16></a> The different writers in Scripture are consistent in regard to the decay of the church and the eventual judgment of the church system.<a name=318:17></a> In 2 Peter you get a sort of prophetic view of Christianity, and what it comes to.<a name=318:18></a> We get the same thing developed by Paul, and also by Jude, who gives us a view of the apostasy of the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=319>[Page 319]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		church, and the end of it, in terms somewhat like those Peter uses.<a name=319:1></a> Peter takes up the failure as unrighteousness; Jude as apostasy.<a name=319:2></a> The defection is traced in the addresses to the seven churches in the Revelation.<a name=319:3></a> Paul gives us the same thing in 2 Thessalonians.<a name=319:4></a> In the epistles to Timothy we get similar witness in regard to the failure and judgment of the great professing system called the church.<a name=319:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now we come to the point of that which is before God.<a name=319:6></a> The different scripture writers are equally consistent in their testimony to another system existing before God.<a name=319:7></a> I would like every one to appreciate the meaning in which the word "system" is used.<a name=319:8></a> We speak of a person being delivered out of system, but I do not use the word in that sense.<a name=319:9></a> I speak of it as we would speak of the system of which the sun is the centre, and in which the different bodies are governed in relation to the sun.<a name=319:10></a> Just as the writers in the New Testament are consistent in their testimony in regard of the world and the professing church -- and indeed I might have said a great deal more as to this, I might have carried the thought through the gospels -- so they are consistent in their testimony of the system which is before God.<a name=319:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That system has its source in God, and is centred in the Sun of Righteousness; and it is going to displace the world that exists.<a name=319:12></a> In that system God is glorified and not man.<a name=319:13></a> I want you to apprehend its source, and the principle which will rule in it.<a name=319:14></a> There will be various companies in that system, but all will be regulated and governed in reference to the Sun of Righteousness, who will arise with healing in His wings.<a name=319:15></a> The system has its source in the revelation of God.<a name=319:16></a> That is the first principle of it.<a name=319:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point is that the revelation of God gives character to all.<a name=319:18></a> It shines out in the face of the Sun of Righteousness, and He fills all things.<a name=319:19></a> Christ has ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill

	<div class="paragraph">
		You might ask me, How can you show that all the writers of the New Testament witness of this system?<a name=320:3></a> Well, take first the Lord's own words.<a name=320:4></a> He said, "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out".<a name=320:5></a> There is an end morally of that system.<a name=320:6></a> But He does not stop there.<a name=320:7></a> He adds: "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto me".<a name=320:8></a> Everything in the solar system is held to the sun by the force of attraction, and so it is with Christ.<a name=320:9></a> He draws all to Himself, and that gives us at once the idea of the introduction of another system of which the One lifted up from the earth is the Sun and Centre.<a name=320:10></a> The Old Testament leaves off with the promise of the Sun of Righteousness rising with healing in His wings.<a name=320:11></a> In the doctrine of Paul Christ is definitely Head and Beginning of another system.<a name=320:12></a> He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.<a name=320:13></a> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.<a name=320:14></a> He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.<a name=320:15></a> John introduces the system.<a name=320:16></a> He brings it out in the Revelation.<a name=320:17></a> The world is judged to make room for Him who comes in as "the Word of God".<a name=320:18></a> John brings in an additional truth in connection with this, the heavenly city, which comes down from God out of heaven having the glory of God and her light like unto a stone most precious.<a name=320:19></a>

		Now in James we get the same principle, and I draw attention to three points.<a name=320:20></a> The first is in verse 18, in which it says, "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures".<a name=320:21></a> The second is in verse 21, "Wherefore laying apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able <i>to save your souls</i>".<a name=320:22></a> The third is

		I touch on these three points, the first-fruits of God's creatures, the implanted word, and the perfect law of liberty.<a name=321:3></a> They give you the idea of how James teaches Christianity, and brings us into the presence of another system which God has before Him.<a name=321:4></a> James will not have the world at any price.<a name=321:5></a> He speaks more strongly of the world than anyone.<a name=321:6></a> He looks upon it as being immoral.<a name=321:7></a> "Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?<a name=321:8></a>" An unholy alliance is formed with the world.<a name=321:9></a>

		I was seeking in a previous lecture to show the concurrence of witness that we get on the part of all the writers of the New Testament.<a name=328:1></a> I referred to this in connection with the world and its end, also in connection with the defection and decay of Christianity.<a name=328:2></a> I dwelt at the same time on another point which is much more important for us; that is, the order of things which is now before God, of which Christ is the Beginning and Centre.<a name=328:3></a> No observant person would fail to notice that this world is wearing itself out; it is not going on as it is for ever, it must come to an end, and Scripture shows what that end will be.<a name=328:4></a>

		The Lord Himself, before ever the kingdom of heaven existed, tells the end of it in its present character.<a name=328:5></a> In the Gospel of Matthew He shows to us the beginning of the kingdom, as small as a grain of mustard seed, but from the outset He foretells its end in the coming of the Son of man.<a name=328:6></a> The latter parables in Matthew's gospel all refer to that.<a name=328:7></a>

		Last time I was referring in chapter 1 to the passage, "The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<a name=329:8></a> Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures".<a name=329:9></a> The first-fruits is evidently a pledge of the harvest.<a name=329:10></a> The harvest has not yet come to pass, but Christians are the first-fruits.<a name=329:11></a> We have the first-fruits of the Spirit, but there must be the harvest.<a name=329:12></a> It is only of us, however, that James speaks.<a name=329:13></a> He speaks also of the implanted word which is able to save our souls, then of the perfect law of liberty.<a name=329:14></a> We are to understand the law of liberty and to continue in it.<a name=329:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to a very important principle in Christianity: the unity of Jew and Gentile.<a name=329:16></a> It is that which is effected in the church, and you do not now get unity anywhere else.<a name=329:17></a> Jew and Gentile will have their distinctive place in the world to come, the Gentile will be blessed through the Jew, who is, as it were, the channel of blessing.<a name=329:18></a> The world will have to confess, "Blessed is the people whose God is Jehovah", but what marks the present time is, that Jew and Gentile are brought into one.<a name=329:19></a> "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=329:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I can understand people of the world professing to believe, but their faith never carries them outside the world.<a name=330:3></a> The devils believe and tremble, people repeat creeds and the like, and if you were to challenge most in this country they would profess faith in the Bible, but their faith is not evidenced by their works.<a name=330:4></a> A man is really justified by works, because they are proof that he is connected with the order of things of which Christ is the Head and Centre.<a name=330:5></a> A man may be orthodox in his creed and take the ground of faith, but he is not justified by faith only, because faith does not in itself form his connection with the world of which Christ is Centre.<a name=330:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure of this, that you could not have works without faith.<a name=330:7></a> Faith is really light in the soul from God, but you may, in a sense, have faith without works.<a name=330:8></a> It is by works that a man is justified, because they prove that he is vitally connected with the order of things of which Christ is the Centre and Beginning.<a name=330:9></a> That is the point which comes out in connection with Abraham and Rahab.<a name=330:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose we have all read <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=330:11></a> It is a chapter of great interest, in which the Spirit of God brings together the many witnesses of faith, and builds up with them a great structure.<a name=330:12></a> The stones are all cut, and fitted into it, Abraham, Noah, Abel and others are stones in the structure which the Spirit rears up.<a name=330:13></a> Two very important persons among them are Abraham and Rahab, the latter so much so that when the Spirit of God comes to her He does not bring forward any other individual case; and He dwells more upon Abraham than upon anyone else in the chapter.<a name=330:14></a> That shows that great importance must be attached to them, they are two very conspicuous and important stones in the structure.<a name=330:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like to touch upon their faith to show the moral connection between the two.<a name=331:1></a> We read in verse 17, "By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure".<a name=331:2></a> Also in verse 31, "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace".<a name=331:3></a> Here you get morally the union of Jew and Gentile on the ground of their faith.<a name=331:4></a> Abraham was tested by God in a way in which he had never been tested before, for Isaac, whom he was called upon to offer up, was the son of promise.<a name=331:5></a> He was the link between Abraham and the promises, and hence, apparently, if he were offered up the link would be broken.<a name=331:6></a> It was a most serious test to apply, but Abraham had to learn this lesson, that no promise of God could be fulfilled in connection with the flesh, not even in connection with Christ after the flesh.<a name=331:7></a> Christ came to Israel with the promises: He was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; but no promises of God involving blessing for men could be fulfilled in connection with Christ after the flesh.<a name=331:8></a> The reason of that is simple, and it is this -- death lay upon man, and the promises could only be fulfilled in connection with a risen Christ.<a name=331:9></a> For He had to go into death, and meet it as God's judgment, if the promises were to be fulfilled and man were to have a part in them.<a name=331:10></a> The promises referred to the nations of the earth, and how were they to be blessed when death lay upon them?<a name=331:11></a> Hence it is that no promise could be fulfilled in connection with Christ after the flesh.<a name=331:12></a> He must needs die if man were to be brought into the promises, and Abraham had to learn in figure that he had to surrender

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now see what an important point that was in regard to Rahab.<a name=332:3></a> The promise was not only that the seed of Abraham should be blessed, but all the nations of the earth.<a name=332:4></a> "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed".<a name=332:5></a> The blessing could not have gone out to the Gentiles in connection with Abraham's seed after the flesh.<a name=332:6></a> If the grace and blessing of God were to reach out to the Gentile it could be only in a risen Christ.<a name=332:7></a> This truth comes out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life".<a name=332:8></a> Christ belonged to Israel after the flesh, and He had to pass through death and take up a new position in resurrection in order that the "whosoever" might come in, that in Him the blessing of God might go out to the Gentiles.<a name=332:9></a> Abraham had to see the principle on which Rahab could be blessed, and she could only be blessed in Christ risen.<a name=332:10></a> In the presence of Christ risen all distinction between Jew and Gentile is gone, and Abraham had to surrender his hopes after the flesh.<a name=332:11></a> The truth comes out doctrinally in the epistle to the Galatians, "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive sonship".<a name=332:12></a> That is a great principle in the ways of God.<a name=332:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham was called to go out into a country which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance, but he never enjoyed the inheritance.<a name=332:14></a> He never had a foot of ground in it, hence he could not surrender that; but what he could not do Rahab did.<a name=332:15></a> She was in the land and had a place there, and what her faith expresses is this, that she surrenders the land, and recognises the right of God to dispose of it as He sees fit.<a name=332:16></a> When

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a way the works of the one bear upon those of the other.<a name=333:3></a> What Abraham apprehended in his work, the God of resurrection, applied to Rahab, and what Rahab recognised, the right of God to dispose of the land, applied to Abraham.<a name=333:4></a> The explanation of it all is that faith and works have reference to the world of which a risen Christ is the Beginning and Centre.<a name=333:5></a> If you do not see that, you will not apprehend the reason for which these two are brought together in this chapter.<a name=333:6></a> We have often read the chapter only with the idea that faith is expressed in works; but if you judge of the works according to man's judgment they were evil works.<a name=333:7></a> Abraham was about to kill his son, and Rahab was a traitress to her country.<a name=333:8></a> You can only rightly judge of their works, in reference to the world of which Christ is the Beginning and Centre.<a name=333:9></a> If you look at them in that light you can understand how the works of both had reference to Christ and to each other.<a name=333:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These two principles are cherished in the church, and we have to hold them in faith, the result being that they govern our conduct.<a name=333:11></a> What governed Abraham was faith in God, and in His ability to raise the dead.<a name=333:12></a> What governed Rahab was God's right to dispose of the land.<a name=333:13></a> The principles of the world to come governed their conduct.<a name=333:14></a> Abraham was a man specially called of God, and Rahab a poor Gentile.<a name=333:15></a> You must lose sight of all question of time, and see that their faith interlocked them.<a name=333:16></a> Abraham's faith was necessary for Rahab, and her faith was necessary for Abraham in connection with the promises.<a name=333:17></a> Abraham's faith in the God of resurrection was of vital moment to her.<a name=333:18></a> She could have no blessing in Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the earth, the nations are struggling to obtain it as a possession, and we see the pride and might of man coming out on every hand; but the great principle to be recognised by us in connection with the world to come is that the inheritance belongs to God, who will dispose of the world as He sees fit.<a name=334:8></a> When the Lord comes again He will entirely ignore any right, on the part of man, to the world.<a name=334:9></a> He takes up the world on two grounds -- first, as its Creator; secondly, that He has effected redemption.<a name=334:10></a> Man claims the earth, and would exclude God: that is the temper of man which will come out fully in antichrist.<a name=334:11></a> But, on the other hand, God claims the earth, and He will have it.<a name=334:12></a> As Creator He is entitled to it and on the ground of redemption.<a name=334:13></a> Christ takes up all things on the behalf of God, therefore the inheritance is disposed of according to the will of God, and we want to be in the light of that: in the light of God as the God of resurrection in a world of death, and in the light of Christ risen: the Beginning, Centre, Sun and Head of the universe of bliss.<a name=334:14></a> Our works are to be in relation to that scene.<a name=334:15></a>

		I see, too, in regard to the right of God to dispose of the world as He sees fit, that one cannot greatly regard those who have a great place and possessions in the world.<a name=335:1></a> They have it in the providence of God (and I do not complain of the providence of God), and they keep it by providential title; but things will be taken up on different ground by the Lord.<a name=335:2></a> The apostle's prayer in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>is "That ye may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing .<a name=335:3></a>.<a name=335:4></a>.<a name=335:5></a> giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light".<a name=335:6></a> And in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, "That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints".<a name=335:7></a> Everything in the world to come is headed up in Christ, and we receive the inheritance in Him.<a name=335:8></a> We are like Abraham, perhaps without a foot of ground in the world; but we get all in Christ.<a name=335:9></a> It is there you see made good the right of God to dispose of all as He sees fit.<a name=335:10></a> But the inheritance is for those made meet.<a name=335:11></a>

		A point which has been before the mind of the author in these lectures has been to draw attention to the consistency of all the writers in the New Testament, and to show that all were engaged in setting forth the features of Christianity.<a name=349:3></a> Each does this from his own particular point of view, but there is in all perfect moral agreement.<a name=349:4></a> Two points in particular have occupied our attention: that is, on the one hand, the testimony to the decay and judgment not only of the world system, but of that great system that calls itself Christian.<a name=349:5></a> On the other hand, there is the keeping in view of that system of blessing which has its beginning, and is centred, in Christ the Sun of righteousness.<a name=349:6></a> This becomes very apparent in the epistle of James.<a name=349:7></a> We saw in the earlier part that we are the first-fruits of that universe of bliss of which Christ is the Head.<a name=349:8></a> Christians are begotten of the word of truth that they may be a kind of first-fruits of God's creatures.<a name=349:9></a> Hence the importance of receiving the engrafted word which is able to save our souls, to give us deliverance from the world system.<a name=349:10></a> And further, to look into the perfect law of liberty, the expression of which is found in the New Jerusalem.<a name=349:11></a> In the second chapter we have further features of the world to come in the faith of Abraham and of Rahab.<a name=349:12></a> It is of great interest to see that their faith had in view another order of things to that in which they were.<a name=349:13></a> In offering up Isaac, evidently Abraham gave up all hope of the promises being accomplished in connection with man after the flesh; he saw that all was to be established on the ground of resurrection, and it is not difficult to apprehend that this must be the case since

		the terms in which James speaks of those that are at home in the world.<a name=351:1></a> He would hardly have spoken thus had not God brought another system into view.<a name=351:2></a> This is of all-importance in the apprehension of saints.<a name=351:3></a> And it is evidence of the consistency of one scripture writer with another, all were inspired by one Spirit.<a name=351:4></a> James singles out two classes for special rebuke, for God never gives up His judgment of men morally, that is according to their works.<a name=351:5></a> The first is, those that are avowedly lawless, acting on the impulse of their wills practically regardless of God.<a name=351:6></a> Such glory in their boastings.<a name=351:7></a> The second class is the rich, who do not know how to show mercy.<a name=351:8></a> They are represented by the rich man in the gospel of Luke, chapter 16, who, while faring sumptuously every day, had no mercy on the poor man daily laid at his gates.<a name=351:9></a> The rich are essentially the men of the world.<a name=351:10></a> Riches give man the opportunity of everything here, and make him in measure the object of the worship that is paid to the mammon of unrighteousness.<a name=351:11></a> A man is hardened in general by the gain of money, and would readily become oppressive as regards the poor, save for restraints which are imposed in the providence of God.<a name=351:12></a> Thus we have had brought together the world and its friends, the devil, its prince, the lawless, and the wanton and oppressive rich.<a name=351:13></a> It is not difficult to find all these in Christendom.<a name=351:14></a>
