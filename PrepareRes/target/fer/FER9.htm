		I want to give you one thought -- namely, that that by which men are enlightened becomes law to them; it is a principle which all can take in -- it is not a difficult sentence.<a name=1:1></a> You see it with people of the world; if a man has been enlightened by philosophy it becomes law to him, or if by science it is the same thing, the principle is true.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want first to say what the light is and then to show how it becomes law.<a name=1:3></a> If that by which we have been enlightened does not become law to us it proves that the light has not been very bright.<a name=1:4></a> The brighter the light the greater the law.<a name=1:5></a>

		In the series of Psalms up to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>you find weakness in the experience of saints, for till you get to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>you have not got a <i>Man</i>.<a name=1:6></a> But when you come to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>you have a Man who of necessity must go to the right hand of God; He was so divinely perfect, earth could not hold Him.<a name=1:7></a> Man was made for earth and earth was good enough for him as so made; but what has come to pass in the ways of God is that a Man has been manifested here on earth whom earth could not contain.<a name=1:8></a> He <i>must</i> go to the right hand of God: "at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore".<a name=1:9></a> I allow that Christ went there, too, on the ground of redemption, so that He might carry others with Him to heaven, which could not have been the case had He gone in only on the ground of His personal perfection.<a name=1:10></a> He came from heaven and went back to heaven -- that is the <i>Man</i> of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=1:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#17">Psalm  17</a>His sentence comes forth from the presence of God.<a name=1:12></a> There were two men,

		the man of the earth and the Man of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, and God had to determine between the two.<a name=2:1></a> You get the same thought in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:25">John  17:25</a>, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me".<a name=2:2></a> The righteous Father had to determine between the world and Christ.<a name=2:3></a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#18">Psalm  18</a>you get the exercises and history of Israel taken up in Christ and carried on to the ultimate glory.<a name=2:4></a> But when we come to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>our mind is carried from earth to heaven.<a name=2:5></a> The thought hid in it is a very great one indeed.<a name=2:6></a> I look at it morally, for if Scripture speaks of phenomena or of what is apparent, it always has a moral thought in view.<a name=2:7></a> It is most important to read Scripture in that light.<a name=2:8></a> Even as to historical occurrences related, they are not related as history, but for the moral point in them.<a name=2:9></a> The earth declares the glory of man -- a very poor glory, a Babylonish glory, but man is content with it.<a name=2:10></a> But earth also declares the dishonour of God: if you look abroad you see moral confusion -- good and evil entangled; God is not the author of confusion but of peace.<a name=2:11></a> The coming in of Christ meant peace, but you never get it established till you get the disentanglement of good and evil.<a name=2:12></a> The works of the devil are seen in the confusion of good and evil, and the Son of God was manifested that He might undo the works of the devil; when that is accomplished there will be peace, not confusion.<a name=2:13></a> Man is content to have his glory in a scene of confusion.<a name=2:14></a> This is true of many a king since Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=2:15></a> Man is not at all particular about moral confusion; in fact, he does not detect it very much, he is so much at home in it.<a name=2:16></a> But if you look up, the heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament shows His handiwork.<a name=2:17></a> God's glory is that in which He is effulgent; no one can carry glory to God; His glory must be the effulgence of Himself.<a name=2:18></a> If I look at the work of God upon earth I see confusion;

		but if I look up to heaven, there is no confusion there.<a name=3:1></a> The more men know of astronomy, the more they see the perfect order there: the heavens declare His glory.<a name=3:2></a> But my point is to look at the thing morally, not simply as a question of God's handiwork.<a name=3:3></a> The heavens declare His glory, and why?<a name=3:4></a> Because you find there the answer to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=3:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>you have glory down here, but in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>Christ is set in the heavens, and so the heavens declare God's glory.<a name=3:6></a> God's glory is the moral effulgence that shines out in Christ: we behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=3:7></a> What we see in Christ is every right of God maintained, and yet light and salvation to men.<a name=3:8></a> I want you to take that in.<a name=3:9></a> Christ in glory appeared to Paul; He was light and salvation for Paul as He is for every one on earth.<a name=3:10></a> The grace of God has appeared -- where?<a name=3:11></a> In Christ: the practical result is that grace reigns through righteousness for the glory of God.<a name=3:12></a> We can understand that; the sun is a figure of it -- it is a light set in heaven to enlighten men on earth, "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun".<a name=3:13></a> Paul was a remarkable exemplification of this, and so, too, the Philippian jailor.<a name=3:14></a> I do not doubt that Paul put before the latter how every right of God was secured in Christ so that He might be salvation to men.<a name=3:15></a> The light becomes law to us.<a name=3:16></a> What is the light we get by Christ?<a name=3:17></a> The light of grace: He has opened to us the heart of God.<a name=3:18></a> I take it no one here is a remarkable person in this world; but in another way we <i>are</i> remarkable, for we know what is in the heart of God towards men.<a name=3:19></a> How did we know the forgiveness of sins?<a name=3:20></a> Because we learned that forgiveness was in the heart of God towards men.<a name=3:21></a> How do we know grace?<a name=3:22></a> Because grace is in His heart; Christ has made it plain and it shines now in Christ.<a name=3:23></a> In His name repentance and remission of sins are preached.<a name=3:24></a> Where were repentance and remission to be known?<a name=3:25></a> In the heart of God

		towards men.<a name=4:1></a> If I apprehend that, I am not one bit afraid of God.<a name=4:2></a> I see the same as to eternal life -- that it is in the heart of God towards men; so in our weakness and poverty we are rich, for you cannot have greater riches than to know what is in the heart of God for men; every right of God maintained that Christ might be for salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will illustrate the principle I speak of: Christ enlightened Paul: he saw a light greater than the sun and he was enlightened by one word from Christ, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=4:4></a>" He knew then very well that there was nothing in the heart of God against him.<a name=4:5></a> But then he says, "To me to live is Christ"; the One who was light to him became his law.<a name=4:6></a> Again, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>the blind man knew who had enlightened him and he did Him homage.<a name=4:7></a> And again, the two blind men to whom Christ gave sight followed Jesus in the way; they might not have been able to tell why they followed Him, but He had become law to them.<a name=4:8></a> In the parable of the good Samaritan (though the lawyer did not follow it out) the lawyer had answered, "He that shewed mercy" was the neighbour, and the Lord said, "Go, and do thou likewise".<a name=4:9></a> If he had had his eyes opened to the apprehension of Christ he would then have done likewise.<a name=4:10></a> You have to look at what you are enlightened by.<a name=4:11></a> Some people think they are enlightened by works of fiction, and if so what they read will be law to them It is a very important thing to be enlightened by true light, for then it becomes law to you.<a name=4:12></a> I will refer now to the latter part of the psalm (verses 4, 5, 6).<a name=4:13></a> "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.<a name=4:14></a> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof".<a name=4:15></a> I will show the reference of that expression to Christ in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:6">Romans  10:6</a> - 8.<a name=4:16></a> The report there
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		referred to is that which the Holy Spirit has brought down from heaven.<a name=5:1></a> A great moral light has been set in heaven -- that is the report.<a name=5:2></a> I trust all here have been enlightened; it is a great thing to walk in the light of God.<a name=5:3></a> We need naturally to be in the light of the sun, the light of this world.<a name=5:4></a> But the light of God shines in the face of Jesus Christ; it is only there you get it, and I cannot conceive anything more blessed than to walk in the light of God's heart towards me, or rather towards men.<a name=5:5></a> I can understand a timid believer hesitating to appropriate it to himself, but God has no two thoughts in regard to men; Christ is His mind towards <i>all</i> men.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up the details of the second part of the psalm -- the law of Jehovah.<a name=5:7></a> You come here to a more limited circle bringing in the thought of relationship, as is evident from the name employed.<a name=5:8></a> It converts the soul; that is the first effect of the law.<a name=5:9></a> If you have not law you are lawless.<a name=5:10></a> We have not now the ten commandments but we have law; it is a great thing to have Christ as law.<a name=5:11></a> All of us have been enlightened by Christ and He is law to us; the effect is that it converts the soul.<a name=5:12></a> If you can think of a woman married to a perfect husband he would of necessity become law to her.<a name=5:13></a> He is not law to her till they are married; there may be attachment before, but there is no true affection of husband and wife till they are married.<a name=5:14></a> Then every thought in her mind is revolutionised, every interest of hers is subordinated to the new interest of her husband.<a name=5:15></a> The law of the Lord <i>is</i> perfect.<a name=5:16></a> No woman has a perfect husband, though she may think it, as every wife does; but our being married to Christ ought to work a perfect revolution in us.<a name=5:17></a> I surrender my own interests and am governed now by the interests of Christ.<a name=5:18></a> That is the revolution that takes place in every one who is married to Christ; then you bring forth fruit to God.<a name=5:19></a>

		"The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple".<a name=6:1></a> I will illustrate this from <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:21">Luke  10:21</a>, 22, 38 - 42.<a name=6:2></a> Christ was revealing the Father; that was His testimony, and Mary sat at His feet and heard His testimony; she had chosen the good part; He Himself was the testimony to her.<a name=6:3></a> It was beautiful to see her sitting at His feet, and what held her was what He was; it made her wise.<a name=6:4></a> She was simple, but she became wise.<a name=6:5></a> You remember how the Lord vindicated her; she was the one person who did the right thing -- the testimony of the Lord made her wise.<a name=6:6></a> She was not at the grave; she knew that Christ would rise again; the testimony of the Lord was sure, and her conduct was the evidence of her wisdom.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart".<a name=6:8></a> If you look at <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:46">Luke  24:46</a> - 53, you will see what were the statutes of the Lord ordained to the disciples.<a name=6:9></a> His name was the statutes; repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in His name: the statutes were right, rejoicing their hearts, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thought -- "The commandment of the Lord is pure".<a name=6:11></a> The commandment is Christ Himself; you will never carry out His commandment except as you have Christ Himself commanding the heart.<a name=6:12></a> "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you".<a name=6:13></a> We are to love one another with a pure heart fervently, and the effect of that is you get enlightened.<a name=6:14></a> Christians are often not very intelligent because Christ is not commandment to them.<a name=6:15></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>.<a name=6:16></a> The first thing here is to be knit together in love; it is about the one thing in the world that is pure, and then not only are you knit together, but you advance to all riches of the full assurance of understanding.<a name=6:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether".<a name=6:18></a> We read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:10">2 Corinthians  5:10</a>: "For

		we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad".<a name=7:1></a> The 'terror' of the Lord should be read 'fear'.<a name=7:2></a> What was the fear of the Lord to Paul?<a name=7:3></a> Christ, and the right that Christ had to judge.<a name=7:4></a> He was not afraid of Christ; he would not be judged of man's day, but he recognised the right and title that Christ had to judge of his conduct down here.<a name=7:5></a> And what is the effect?<a name=7:6></a> It is clean; we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God, we cannot cherish an unclean, unworthy motive.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether".<a name=7:8></a> To illustrate this I refer you to <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:17">John  7:17</a>, 18.<a name=7:9></a> You see there that Christ answers morally to the judgments of the Lord, He tests everything by Himself.<a name=7:10></a> You get the idea of His judgment in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>, "feet like to fine brass": the seven churches are tested and judged by Christ Himself, He is true and altogether righteous.<a name=7:11></a> You can understand that whether it is fear, or statutes, or law, or judgments, all is presented to us in Christ, and He is all these things to us.<a name=7:12></a> It is a great thing to have Him for law.<a name=7:13></a> He says, "Come unto me .<a name=7:14></a>.<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a> take my yoke upon you, and learn of me .<a name=7:17></a>.<a name=7:18></a>.<a name=7:19></a> and ye shall find rest unto your souls".<a name=7:20></a> To take His yoke is to engage in the service of love.<a name=7:21></a> The apostle said virtually to the Galatians, you are desirous of law, why do you not fulfil Christ's law and bear one another's burdens?<a name=7:22></a>

		Mary found the testimonies of the Lord sure, making wise the simple; she surpassed the disciples in intelligence.<a name=7:23></a> The thief on the cross was intelligent above all; he recognised what he was himself, but also what Christ was.<a name=7:24></a> We have all to be tested by Christ.<a name=7:25></a> Let Christ be law to you; love one another with a pure heart fervently and you will get your eyes greatly enlightened.<a name=7:26></a> The fear of the Lord is clean.<a name=7:27></a> It kept

		The longer I live the more I appreciate Scripture, not simply the detail, but that from beginning to end you have a living, powerful voice speaking in strong moral accents -- a voice which is the expression of feeling, the voice of One who is affected by what is passing down here.<a name=8:9></a>

		FELLOWSHIP, PRIVILEGE AND TESTIMONY

		1 John
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea in Scripture connected with children seems to be always that of a company -- 'we' and 'us'.<a name=9:1></a> It is not the idea of the privilege of an individual; it is the common privilege of a company, because the Spirit that bears witness that we are children of God is <i>one</i> Spirit -- the same Spirit in all, and the effect of it is this -- it of necessity leads to the assembly.<a name=9:2></a> It compels saints to come together.<a name=9:3></a> I cannot understand a person choosing isolation and talking of what he gets from the Lord at home.<a name=9:4></a> I am certain that person never enters into the privilege of being a child, because if he did, the craving of his soul would be to get into the company of the children, for the children are all one band.<a name=9:5></a> It is "one flock, and one shepherd".<a name=9:6></a> The children are one band, and stand thus in Christ.<a name=9:7></a> 'In Him we stand, a heavenly band'.<a name=9:8></a> Therefore if you want to realise the privilege of the children of God, you must get into the circle of the children, you must really get into the assembly, for it is in the assembly that we realise the privileges that are proper to the children of God.<a name=9:9></a> They stand there on the ground of sovereign love as the children of God, and it is their privilege to worship the Father.<a name=9:10></a> You have got thus what failure cannot touch.<a name=9:11></a> You have the Father and the children (the Father has sought such to worship Him), and you have Christ in the midst leading their praises.<a name=9:12></a> I do not believe that anyone learns the truth of what belongs to the children of God except in the assembly.<a name=9:13></a> You are brought into it individually, but you can hardly individualise the children because it is one Spirit in them all, and that very fact arouses the craving for the assembly, because the assembly is the band.<a name=9:14></a> Now nothing can deprive

		us of this; even in the ruin of the church there is a fellowship (those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart).<a name=10:1></a> Whatever may be the ruin, you cannot displace the children.<a name=10:2></a> One may be very sorry that the whole company does not come together, and we ought to mourn for that more than we do; but still we can come together in assembly, and if we do, it is as children, nothing less, because that is the calling, the privilege that the Father has bestowed on us.<a name=10:3></a> I am sure we do not sufficiently see how the instinct of the scriptures which apply directly to Christians is unity.<a name=10:4></a> And though the structure, which Paul the architect raised, has broken down and is in ruin, John gives us what is essential, what is vital, and that is privilege, and the tendency of this must be toward the assembly.<a name=10:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The privilege belongs to every Christian, but it is one thing to have a privilege belonging to me, and another thing for me to have entered into the truth and reality of the privilege.<a name=10:6></a> It is in the realisation of our privilege that we more fully understand the true character of the assembly, and you can enter into that apart from any kind of ecclesiastical pretension.<a name=10:7></a> The point is to have the great reality of it in our souls, to accept the privilege, and to be in the light and joy of it, to be found in company with the other children, that is, in the assembly.<a name=10:8></a> If you do not understand the proper privilege of the assembly, and the great blessing which belongs to it, you will fail to present a testimony which is according to God.<a name=10:9></a> It is in the assembly that we properly learn our relationship with the Father and with one another.<a name=10:10></a> You may accept the light of it, but it is in the assembly that you enter into the reality of it.<a name=10:11></a> We all get set in our place in the assembly.<a name=10:12></a> The Lord's supper is the beginning of it, it sets us in our souls rightly in relation toward all; to the Father, to

		All this is suitable to the day of ruin in which we are.<a name=11:8></a> I pray God to grant for myself and for us all that we may be more prepared in spirit to come under the sense of the ruin, and to take our share in it.<a name=11:9></a> May God keep us from attempting to construct anything, from setting up any kind of imitation of the church, but may we recognise that the church is still here, both vitally and responsibly; and though the house is in ruin, it ought to be a very great encouragement for us that all that is essential abides.<a name=11:10></a> There is a true bond of fellowship in which saints can be together here, and true privilege which belongs to them, and which none can deny them, which is made good to them vitally by the Spirit of God.<a name=11:11></a> And if we enter into our privilege, I believe that though the company may be very restricted, there will be a real expression of God in that little company, and thus a testimony for Him.<a name=11:12></a>

		Now there are four landmarks of great interest in the gospel, and no one of them appears in any other gospel.<a name=16:7></a> Two are parables, and two are facts.<a name=16:8></a> The first is found at the end of chapter 7 -- the woman of the city in the Pharisee's house.<a name=16:9></a> The second is in the latter part of chapter 10 -- the parable of the good Samaritan.<a name=16:10></a> The third in chapter 15 -- the parable of the prodigal son; and the closing mark is in chapter 23: 39 - 43, in the Lord's words to the repentant thief.<a name=16:11></a> There is, I judge, a progress in the exposition of the truth in these.<a name=16:12></a> If you read chapter 7: 1 - 42 you will find the beginning.<a name=16:13></a> It unfolds the thought of God in the mission of Christ, and is beautiful in that way.<a name=16:14></a> God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses.<a name=16:15></a> In Christ here dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead, all that was necessary for the full display of God; and God's attitude was that of reconciling the world to Himself.<a name=16:16></a> It was God coming in grace, and finding men all alike, debtors with "nothing to pay".<a name=16:17></a> One might owe five hundred pence, and another fifty, as Simon thought of himself; but if both had "nothing to pay" they were in the same position; and in the eye of God the Pharisee no more than the woman had aught to pay.<a name=16:18></a> This was

		man's state God-ward.<a name=17:1></a> And what was God's attitude towards man in the presence of Christ here?<a name=17:2></a> <i>Free forgiveness</i>: "He frankly forgave them both".<a name=17:3></a> This was the thought of God, and that which Christ came to present: "Thy sins are forgiven .<a name=17:4></a>.<a name=17:5></a>.<a name=17:6></a> go in peace".<a name=17:7></a> Why?<a name=17:8></a> Because the sinner had accepted the light from the Lord.<a name=17:9></a> Faith is light in the soul from God.<a name=17:10></a> God's attitude towards the world in Christ is grace, and free forgiveness for those who have "nothing to pay", and who accept the light of grace.<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will now pass on to chapter 10: 33, etc.<a name=17:12></a> The parable of the good Samaritan brings into prominence, not the great thought of God in Christ's mission here, but the relation of Christ towards those who are the subjects of grace.<a name=17:13></a> It is in principle the declaration of the spirit of the new covenant, the terms on which God is with the believer.<a name=17:14></a> It presents the transition from law to grace.<a name=17:15></a> The priest and Levite passed by on the other side.<a name=17:16></a> The good Samaritan could declare to the soul the terms on which it is the pleasure of God to be with man.<a name=17:17></a> It is not simply forgiveness, but pouring in oil and wine; and more than that, the man set on his own beast, and brought to an inn and taken care of.<a name=17:18></a> This is how Christ comes to be known to us, declaring to us the terms on which God is pleased to be with us; and it is a great thing for the soul to learn it.<a name=17:19></a> He is at peace with us; and more, we are in favour.<a name=17:20></a> It is in the Lord Jesus Christ, the last Adam, that we see declared what God is to the believer.<a name=17:21></a> He is the Head of the family.<a name=17:22></a> In Him we see man's place with God.<a name=17:23></a> "His own beast" refers to the gift of the Spirit.<a name=17:24></a> This is the first real link of the believer with Christ.<a name=17:25></a> "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his".<a name=17:26></a> The soul is taught to look to the Lord Jesus Christ to learn in Him the terms on which God is with us.<a name=17:27></a> All the pleasure of God in regard to man is declared in Him.<a name=17:28></a> That which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third landmark is in chapter 15.<a name=18:3></a> In the parable of the prodigal the feasting goes on <i>in the house</i>.<a name=18:4></a> It was when the elder brother drew nigh to <i>the house</i> that he heard the music and dancing.<a name=18:5></a> The good Samaritan declared the grace in which God is with us <i>down here</i>, but in the prodigal we get, not what God is to us as in the wilderness, but what we are for God's satisfaction before Himself.<a name=18:6></a> Two things are evident -- all distance is removed, and the prodigal is in the best robe for the Father's pleasure.<a name=18:7></a> I am reconciled, and in Christ before God; I can reckon myself dead unto sin, and alive unto God in Christ Jesus -- before God in the "best robe", and that is Christ.<a name=18:8></a> Why "the best"?<a name=18:9></a> Because there could be no better.<a name=18:10></a> Nothing could fit me more absolutely or completely for the eye of God than Christ.<a name=18:11></a> Nothing is for God's perfect satisfaction but Christ.<a name=18:12></a> The best robe is more than acceptance; it is the consciousness of acceptance.<a name=18:13></a> The Father had come out to the prodigal and kissed him; and He fits him to be with Him in common delight for His own satisfaction, and so that the prodigal might feel at home in His house.<a name=18:14></a> This is a point which we are slow to reach.<a name=18:15></a> Many believers know the terms on which God is with them in grace; but it is much more to know that He has us before Himself to His own satisfaction.<a name=18:16></a> And more -- If the prodigal is inside with the Father, it is according to the way in which the Father came out to him.<a name=18:17></a> If God has set us before Himself, it is to enjoy Him as He has been pleased to reveal Himself in the Son.<a name=18:18></a> We <i>go in</i> to enjoy it.<a name=18:19></a> We reckon ourselves dead unto sin, and the Spirit is the One who leads us into the

	<div class="paragraph">
		For the last point we will look at chapter 23: 39, etc.<a name=19:4></a> There could be no greater contrast than between a crucified malefactor and paradise -- the extreme of misery and the greatest height of delights.<a name=19:5></a> Here we get the climax of grace.<a name=19:6></a> A malefactor crucified was "that day" to be with Christ in paradise.<a name=19:7></a> The thief confessed Christ as Lord, when all else had deserted Him, and he believed in His kingdom.<a name=19:8></a> His thought for himself did not go beyond being remembered by the Lord in the kingdom.<a name=19:9></a> Now the point of importance is the Lord's answer, "Today shalt thou be <i>with me in paradise</i>".<a name=19:10></a> It is the height of grace to be Christ's companion in the place of supreme bliss.<a name=19:11></a> It was where Christ was going, and it was where the thief was to be with Him.<a name=19:12></a> Christ had come alone from heaven, and now He went into paradise as Man, but He did not go there alone: one went with Him -- a companion and a trophy!<a name=19:13></a> The thief certainly owed five hundred pence; but when he had "nothing to pay" God freely forgave.<a name=19:14></a> That was the first point we saw; chapter 7.<a name=19:15></a> We could not understand the three succeeding scenes if we did not understand the first.<a name=19:16></a> Then we learn what Christ is as the last Adam.<a name=19:17></a> We are under Him, justified since He is risen.<a name=19:18></a> We have the Holy Spirit, and are cared for in the path here.<a name=19:19></a> Thirdly, we learn that we are for the satisfaction of God.<a name=19:20></a> He has put us in Christ, and we reckon ourselves dead unto sin and alive unto God in Him, so that we may realise His love.<a name=19:21></a> And the climax of all is, that we are to be Christ's companions in paradise!<a name=19:22></a> The whole economy of grace is most marvellous.<a name=19:23></a> Who could have thought of such grace?<a name=19:24></a> We may wonder at the demand that God's love has made upon Him.<a name=19:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to bring under the attention of the readers of the <i>Voice</i> the teaching of the word in regard to the "one body", which I judge all will allow to be Christ's body.<a name=21:1></a> The thought of the body is referred to in four epistles, namely Romans (chapter 12), 1 Corinthians (chapter 12), Colossians (chapter 1), and Ephesians (chapter 1), though in the first two it is only just touched for certain purposes.<a name=21:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before going into the subject in detail I must make one or two prefatory remarks; and at the outset I assume that the truth of the body is "the mystery of the gospel".<a name=21:3></a> Paul refers to this in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a>, 26, and in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:19">Ephesians  6:19</a>, and no one can fail to see the great importance that the subject had in his mind, and the responsibility which he felt to make manifest the mystery.<a name=21:4></a> I do not think that I should go too far in saying that the body is the great end of God in the gospel, and that until our souls are in the truth of it we do not fully answer to the thought of God in regard of us.<a name=21:5></a> It appears to me that many of us stop short at the gospel, and never reach the clear knowledge of the mystery.<a name=21:6></a> And this is the more to be deplored because that while the gospel unfolds the whole extent of our blessing in Christ according to the purpose of God, the mystery shows us what the church is as a vessel for Christ, the body in which He was to be set forth in the world from which He had been personally rejected.<a name=21:7></a> The ministry of the mystery is evidently distinct from that of the gospel (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:23">Colossians  1:23</a> - 26), but the mystery is the mystery of the gospel.<a name=21:8></a> And though we cannot understand the mystery by the gospel, yet it is evident that the mystery is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		involved in the gospel.<a name=22:1></a> The importance of this is that it makes evident that all we receive from God we receive through the gospel, and that the ministry of the assembly as Christ's body adds nothing to the gifts of God, but leads our souls into the light of God's thought in the assembly, as I have said, into what the body was to be as the vessel in which Christ was to be portrayed here, Christ among the Gentiles the hope of glory.<a name=22:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to the teaching of the epistles in detail; and I remark a distinction of importance between the four passages, namely, that in Romans and 1 Corinthians, though the truth of the one body is introduced, there is no allusion to the Head save that it may possibly be involved in the expression "the Christ" in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>.<a name=22:3></a> If we desire to find the Head we have to go to Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=22:4></a> Now it is evident that without knowing the Head no one can possibly have any intelligent apprehension of the body.<a name=22:5></a> And I do not think that such apprehension is supposed in 1 Corinthians or in Romans, for it appears to me that the statement of our being one body by the baptism of the Spirit is introduced in 1 Corinthians simply as a check to clericalism in the assembly.<a name=22:6></a> All the gifts were the working of the Spirit dividing severally to every one as He would, and hence one gift was not to be set against another; doing it would be an offence to the one Spirit; and the truth of the saints being one body by the Spirit is introduced to give force to this.<a name=22:7></a> Many results in the human body flow from that action of the heart, but these consequences are not discordant but harmonious.<a name=22:8></a> The source is one and the body one, requiring the co-operation of every member, and no member is redundant.<a name=22:9></a> Evidently clericalism is the opposite of this, and I imagine that it was to check the tendency to this that the light of the one body is brought into 1 Corinthians.<a name=22:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans the truth of our being one body in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, and every one members one of another, is introduced to give force to the exhortation that every man should think soberly as to himself according as God had dealt to every man the measure of faith.<a name=23:1></a> If the saints had, in the sovereignty of God's will, been constituted one body in Christ, it was evident that any right thought of themselves must be, not according to nature, but according to grace -- the first were last and the last first.<a name=23:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the reference to the body in these two epistles may be said to be by the way.<a name=23:3></a> There is no mention of the Head, nor any unfolding of the divine thought in the body.<a name=23:4></a> The object is to set the saints in their right bearing both in the assembly and in their individual path.<a name=23:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come to the Colossians we learn another truth of the greatest moment, namely, first that Christ is the Head of the body, the assembly, and consequent on this that the assembly is the vessel in which He is to be displayed among the Gentiles, the hope of glory.<a name=23:6></a> This is the mystery of the gospel.<a name=23:7></a> Evidently this display was to be moral in the saints, and thus the body was necessarily co-extensive with the work of the Spirit in them.<a name=23:8></a> But nothing could be more wonderful than that Christ, who had been rejected by the Jew, should be seen in the Gentiles in moral suitability to the scene in which the body is.<a name=23:9></a> Hence the anxiety of the apostle in his preaching of Christ that he might present every man full grown in Christ.<a name=23:10></a> It is in this epistle especially that the truth of the Head and the body are prominent, and the divine idea in the body is reached.<a name=23:11></a> In Ephesians we have the thought of the bride predominant, and in connection with this the truth of union, that is, the setting of the saints in Christ where He is in the heavenlies.<a name=23:12></a> But we have the additional truth as to the body that it is "the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=23:13></a> Christ is set personally at God's right hand far above

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject that is on my mind to bring before you is the special way in which Christ is presented in different psalms; how it is carried through Scripture, and also how the thought connects itself with the church.<a name=158:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with that I will just say, what no doubt all here are well aware of, that you do not get the church in the Psalms; but, though it is not spoken of, yet clearly the place or time covered by the Psalms begins with the rejection of Christ and goes on to His coming again in glory.<a name=158:2></a> The opening psalms start with the fact that <i>He is rejected</i> and the closing psalms with the consequences of His coming: the Hallelujah!<a name=158:3></a> the coming of Jehovah.<a name=158:4></a> Jehovah reigns is the burden of the fourth book; and in the fifth book, especially the close of the book, it is praise to Jehovah; Hallelujah!<a name=158:5></a> From the very fact of the period which is covered by the Psalms being the period of Christ's rejection, room must be left for the assembly; for it is the time of her history upon earth.<a name=158:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get in the Psalms different thoughts of Christ, special traits of His perfection, and you will find how that light is carried into the New Testament, and becomes the groundwork of a great deal there.<a name=158:7></a> For instance, the book of Hebrews; you might say that epistle is built up from quotations of two or three psalms.<a name=158:8></a> You can understand the wisdom of the Spirit of God reasoning with the Jews out of their own scriptures.<a name=158:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>especially are woven into the structure of the book in a remarkable way.<a name=158:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very wonderful, when you think that these psalms were written a thousand years before Christ

		came, that they should give the whole history of things -- Christ's rejection and the state of the people consequent upon it; you see in that way how prophetic they are.<a name=159:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is a kind of basis.<a name=159:2></a> From the very starting-point you begin with Christ and Christ rejected.<a name=159:3></a> It is quoted by the apostles in Acts (chapter 4: 25, 26) and clearly refers to Christ.<a name=159:4></a> First the Lord comes out as Jehovah's anointed; that is, He is Christ.<a name=159:5></a> There is one very important point raised; who is going to have the earth?<a name=159:6></a> That is the great point of the Psalms.<a name=159:7></a> Is man going to have it, or is God going to have it?<a name=159:8></a> The question is solved as you go through the Psalms.<a name=159:9></a> Man claims the earth, but God is going to possess it.<a name=159:10></a> The book does not open up heaven and heavenly things, but gives the answer as to who is going to have the earth.<a name=159:11></a> It is what the apostle John does; he does not carry saints to heaven, he brings heavenly things down here.<a name=159:12></a> In the gospel it is true in the Person of the Son; in the epistle it is true in the saints; and again in Revelation he presents Christ executing judgment according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=159:13></a> As another has remarked, John claims the earth for Christ.<a name=159:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John's testimony is God's love to the world; <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>.<a name=159:15></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son".<a name=159:16></a> You see God's faithfulness to the Jew, but then Christ is "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=159:17></a> That distinctly refers to Christ -- He takes away the sin because the world is to be for God.<a name=159:18></a> He brings God to the earth -- God's King, God's Anointed is going to possess it, and He shall reign for ever and ever.<a name=159:19></a> No doubt it carries us on to the new heaven and new earth.<a name=159:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, as I have said, we have Christ, the Anointed, the Messiah -- all terms which mean the same thing, but He is rejected.<a name=159:21></a> Then comes in verse 7, "I will declare the decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee".<a name=159:22></a>

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was Son of David in a sense as anointed, but after His rejection the great truth comes out, "Thou art my Son" -- God's Son.<a name=160:1></a> I want to give you an idea of the moral importance of that name, because it is a name, and a name inherited, as we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:4">Hebrews  1:4</a>, "He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they".<a name=160:2></a> That is proof that it is not exactly an eternal name.<a name=160:3></a> Son of God according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is a name inherited.<a name=160:4></a> He takes it up in that way as begotten in time.<a name=160:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One great thought I believe to be connected with the Son of God is that He has the power of life and the power of death.<a name=160:6></a> What I think is connected with the thought of Christ is that He is Jehovah's Anointed, the accomplisher of His will.<a name=160:7></a> I refer you to a verse in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>"It behoved Christ to suffer".<a name=160:8></a> He is the Anointed of Jehovah -- anointed with oil to perform Jehovah's will and to rule over Jehovah's people.<a name=160:9></a> When you come to the thought of the Son of God He can open the doors of death and He has the power of life, too.<a name=160:10></a> He can remove the power of death, and eventually He will set it aside; He has, too, the keys of death and of Hades, and He can bring man out of death; <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>.<a name=160:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of those two things in the power of the Son of God -- to set death aside and to bring man out of it!<a name=160:12></a> The most simple instance I know is the millennium, because then man will be conformable to God.<a name=160:13></a> It is the Son of God who will effect this.<a name=160:14></a> He annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel.<a name=160:15></a> In the millennium they will love God with all their heart and all their soul, and their neighbour as themselves.<a name=160:16></a> The Son of God has the power to set aside death and to bring life in, that everything down here on earth may be conformable to God.<a name=160:17></a> This is not true publicly yet, but Christians pass out of death into life.<a name=160:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find another thought connected with Him as Son

	<div class="paragraph">
		of God in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>that is the authority given to Him (verses 8, 9).<a name=161:1></a> Judgment is committed to the Son; <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:22">John  5:22</a>.<a name=161:2></a> It is not simply that as Son of David He rules God's people, but as God's Son He has authority over the nations to rule them with a rod of iron; but that is not the primary thought connected with Him as Son of God, but it is introduced to us in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, because Christ being rejected as God's Anointed becomes the occasion of the declaration of greater glories.<a name=161:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel of John you get the presentation of the Son of God.<a name=161:4></a> At the present time He can only be apprehended spiritually.<a name=161:5></a> When He was here on earth this was equally true -- He could only be apprehended spiritually, and it is so now.<a name=161:6></a> That comes out in chapter 1.<a name=161:7></a> We read the passage which brings Nathanael before us; whatever apprehension he had of Christ was spiritual.<a name=161:8></a> The Lord begins with him: "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<a name=161:9></a>" (verse 47).<a name=161:10></a> Nathanael finds that the Lord knew him, not simply that Nathanael knew the Lord, and it draws from him the confession: "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".<a name=161:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should venture to say that it was by divine teaching that Nathanael thus apprehended Christ.<a name=161:12></a> He was touched evidently in verses 47 and 48, for it brought forth from him the confession, "Thou art the Son of God".<a name=161:13></a> The Man of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>was apprehended.<a name=161:14></a> I should feel that Nathanael accepts even the rejection of Christ; no doubt he felt things down here were not according to Christ, and you cannot conceive that he could have been in concert with the general condition of the people.<a name=161:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In what the Lord says to Nathanael there is a beautiful point; He does not speak of judgment but of the whole system of blessing that is to come to pass in connection with the glory of Christ as Son of man: "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of

		man".<a name=162:1></a> It is interesting to notice that he confesses Christ according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>and Christ answers him according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>.<a name=162:2></a> A thousand years had gone by since David spoke of these things and now here is "an Israelite indeed" apprehending the Person as spoken of in the Psalms.<a name=162:3></a> Christ touches a chord in his heart and he responds to it.<a name=162:4></a> He is rejected, but He is recognised spiritually as Son of God and King of Israel by one divinely taught.<a name=162:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is true of us today; no one has an apprehension of Christ except by the Spirit of God, that is, as taught of God.<a name=162:6></a> There is the pretension in Christendom to know Christ but He can only be known spiritually.<a name=162:7></a> Christ was not here in glory but in testimony.<a name=162:8></a> The same is true today and testimony can only be apprehended spiritually.<a name=162:9></a> In order that a man should receive any testimony from God he "must be born again", as you have it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>.<a name=162:10></a> To apprehend the testimony of a rejected Christ a man must be born again.<a name=162:11></a> If you apprehend <i>that</i>, it will save you from being deceived by what is going on around, and from the pretension there is on every side.<a name=162:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to pass on to the close of Christianity: <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:18">Revelation  2:18</a>.<a name=162:13></a> Here we have the Lord introduced again as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>"These things saith the Son of God".<a name=162:14></a> He comes in here in the character of judgment, His eyes like unto a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass, and has the power of life and death.<a name=162:15></a> He kills with moral death.<a name=162:16></a> An awful thought to me!<a name=162:17></a> "I will kill her children with death"; that is, the children of that awful system that has come into Christianity -- that woman Jezebel.<a name=162:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thyatira, as you have no doubt noticed, closes the connection of Christ with the church as a whole.<a name=162:19></a> The reason is that evil had culminated then and there -- Jezebel had been admitted.<a name=162:20></a> It is a great mercy that you get other states brought in after -- such as Sardis and Philadelphia, for the last four churches run on to

	<div class="paragraph">
		the end, but the public connection of Christ closes in Thyatira.<a name=163:1></a> He takes up there what belongs to Him according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=163:2></a> As long as the public connection of Christ with the church went on the time had not come for the Lord to go back to that -- to ask for the nations: "Ask of me and I shall give the heathen for thine inheritance" -- but when evil is authorised and allowed then He closes His public connection with the church as a whole.<a name=163:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another natural consequence is, the King comes in verses 26, 27.<a name=163:4></a> Two things mark Thyatira -- worldliness -- worldly commerce, and the acknowledgement of the god of this world.<a name=163:5></a> These two things were peculiarly offensive to the Lord.<a name=163:6></a> It was an awful thing to the Lord when the church fell to that level.<a name=163:7></a> There is no mistake about idolatry in Rome, indeed there is a vast amount outside of it -- of a more subtle kind, perhaps -- the love of money and so on.<a name=163:8></a> The overcomer is not carried away by the current; he walks in separation from the state of corruption that has come in; he is one who refuses commerce with the world.<a name=163:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to mark the promise to the overcomer.<a name=163:10></a> "To him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers"; then is added what you do not get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>"even as I received of my Father".<a name=163:11></a> He thus gives the overcomer to share with Him in what has been committed to Him.<a name=163:12></a> Perhaps you may say it is not a very special promise, but it comes in, and is intended to be a great encouragement in a difficult day.<a name=163:13></a>

		The promise to the overcomer is indeed a remarkable promise, "He shall rule them with a rod of iron".<a name=164:6></a> I want it to come home to us as a word of encouragement.<a name=164:7></a> We may be depressed here and find the path difficult, and there are few of us who have not found the temptation to be conformed to this world, but I get great encouragement here.<a name=164:8></a> I would not care to go on with the course of this world when I see the promise of Christ to the overcomer here.<a name=164:9></a> I should find <i>in it</i> the most powerful possible motive for separation from the course of things from which Christ has been rejected.<a name=164:10></a> He has been rejected as God's King: "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his anointed".<a name=164:11></a> That attitude is not given up, it is still maintained.<a name=164:12></a> The kings of the earth stand up still, they will not give Christ His rights.<a name=164:13></a> This is the time of suffering; that is what marks this moment.<a name=164:14></a> The present moment is marked not by our being glorified but by our suffering.<a name=164:15></a>

		I see in the writings of the New Testament as regards Christians two distinct lines of truth: the one connected with the titles of God and Christ, and the other with the names of the Father and the Son.<a name=182:7></a> It is in connection with the latter -- the Father and the Son -- and our place in relation to it, that you get the greatest insight into the grace and love of God.<a name=182:8></a> You come to a point where the love of God can rest without let or hindrance, and with supreme satisfaction.<a name=182:9></a> At the beginning of the Christian career (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>) the love of God is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit; but when you come to the close of chapter 8, you find the persuasion that neither depth nor height nor life nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=182:10></a> The one appears to be in advance of the other.<a name=182:11></a> The Christian begins with the knowledge of the love of God, as He has been pleased to prove it in the death of Christ; but in the close of chapter 8 we find that nothing can separate

		I will just draw attention to the two lines of truth to which I have referred, the one, as I said, in connection with God and Christ; the other, in connection with the Father and the Son.<a name=183:9></a> I own that they are very intimately allied; but I think that it is important for us to distinguish them.<a name=183:10></a>

		If you want to learn what the saints are to God, you learn this in connection with the Father and the Son.<a name=183:11></a> This thought led me to refer to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>.<a name=183:12></a> It is a remarkable passage, as bringing out the truth of the Father and the Son.<a name=183:13></a>

		With regard to God and Christ certain other thoughts come to light.<a name=183:14></a> In the place which Christ has taken as man He has become the vessel of God's pleasure.<a name=183:15></a> All was purposed in Christ -- the promise of life was in Christ Jesus.<a name=183:16></a> Every purpose or promise of God is to have its accomplishment in Christ.<a name=183:17></a> He is the Vessel in whom all these purposes are to be established.<a name=183:18></a> I think the truth of the body and of the bride both come out in this connection.<a name=183:19></a> The body is a vessel adequate for the setting forth of Christ -- "his fulness"; and the bride has the glory of God.<a name=183:20></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>brings before us "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus".<a name=183:21></a> That is a clear proof that the church is the vessel in which the glory of God's grace will be set forth, as in the body the character of Christ will be seen.<a name=183:22></a> The body is taken

		from Him in order to be His bride, as the rib was taken from Adam and built up into his bride.<a name=184:1></a> It is adequate being taken from Him, in order to be united to Him for the satisfaction of His love, and that in it God might show forth His glory.<a name=184:2></a> Thus the point is of what God is going to show forth in the church, rather than of what we are going to enjoy.<a name=184:3></a> In the Revelation the bride is seen <i>coming down</i> from God out of heaven, not <i>going up</i> to heaven -- the blessed vessel in which the glory of God resides, and in which it is displayed.<a name=184:4></a> It comes from God, partakes of the divine nature, and therefore God's glory is set forth there.<a name=184:5></a> There is no temple there, but the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.<a name=184:6></a> The same will hold good in regard to other things, for Christ is the vessel in which all the purposes of God will have their accomplishment.<a name=184:7></a> On that line, I think, as I have pointed out, you get the truth of the body and the bride.<a name=184:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is also the line of the Father and the Son; and there we have a still more blessed idea, for it is in that connection that we learn what the church is to God.<a name=184:9></a> It is not here a question of what comes from God, like the heavenly city, which is what God displays.<a name=184:10></a> Everyone can, I think, distinguish between the thought of display and of what God secures for Himself, for the satisfaction of His love -- what God rests in for His own satisfaction.<a name=184:11></a> The more blessed line for our contemplation is of what the church is for God, for His satisfaction.<a name=184:12></a> Nothing can be more wonderful than this, and it is where the thought of the Father and the Son comes in, and where the truth of sonship is also found.<a name=184:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I have to say is, the moment has not yet come for that, it is a future moment; but I tell you what He does in the interval: if He does not yet bring us to the Father's house, He brings us to the Father's heart; His love is not satisfied with anything else.<a name=294:10></a> He declares the Father's name and makes us know the Father's heart.<a name=294:11></a> He makes us know we are loved of the Father as He is loved; <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:25">John  17:25</a>, 26.<a name=294:12></a> What a wonderful thing that He should declare the Father's name, that is, His love!<a name=294:13></a> (That declaration was completed in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=294:14></a>) He declares it, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<a name=294:15></a> That is what it was for the Lord to conduct them to the Father's heart.<a name=294:16></a>

		No man is fit for the assembly except in proportion to his love.<a name=294:17></a> Faith is no good in the assembly -- you could not be there without faith; but you are only in touch with Christ according to your love.<a name=294:18></a> He is in touch with the Father, and His part is to conduct us to the Father's heart, as it will be His part to conduct us to the Father's house.<a name=294:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I only touch on those three points, but you cannot suppose I could exhaust the subject of the love of Christ.<a name=295:1></a> There is first His claim in death, then the fruit of His love in intercession, then that He may conduct us out of the world to the Father, that the love wherewith He is loved may be in us; that is the climax of His love.<a name=295:2></a> And then you can very well understand the prayer of the apostle which I read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>.<a name=295:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the saints all knew the love of Christ, there would be a present expression of Christ down here in the saints, just as there was the perfect expression of God in Christ Himself.<a name=295:4></a> "No man hath seen God at any time.<a name=295:5></a> If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:12">1 John  4:12</a>.<a name=295:6></a> The same expression is used as to Christ in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=295:7></a> It is the nature and character of God coming out in the saints down here, and that is the great idea of the prayer in the third chapter of Ephesians.<a name=295:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Once Christ had been here in testimony, nothing short of Christ would suit God, and therefore the church was to be filled to all the fulness of God.<a name=295:9></a> But the secret is that you may know the love of Christ.<a name=295:10></a> Nothing else makes people devoted; doctrine and light do not do it; love does it, for the great object of devotedness is Christ Himself, as it was to Mary when she sat at His feet, and to John when he lay on His bosom.<a name=295:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord give us to know His love, so that we may be close enough to Him to get a word from Him.<a name=295:12></a> It is a great thing to be near Him; He draws us close to Himself that He may make us know the Father as He knows Him; "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<a name=295:13></a>

		I do not think that I need make any apology for turning to this well-known scripture, in order to introduce to you the subject about which I desire to speak.<a name=296:1></a> There is a kind of fascination about the passage which makes it difficult to me to leave the chapter alone; and what interests me is that the testimony of God exhibits the true character of the world to come.<a name=296:2></a> And we are allowed to see the witnesses through which the testimony of God has shone out in this world from the time that sin came into it.<a name=296:3></a> The testimony of God came out both before and after the flood.<a name=296:4></a> In considering the passage before us, I desire that we should see also how the testimony of God affected those who are brought before us.<a name=296:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And further, I want to refer to what the testimony of God is now that it has reached its height, as we have come to it.<a name=296:6></a> It gives me the idea of a vast arch built up piece by piece, and now complete.<a name=296:7></a> We have come to the crown of the arch -- to the keystone; we have it in its completeness; we are in the full blessedness of God's testimony, which shines out through faith.<a name=296:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may remark that what is presented in the epistle to the Hebrews is confirmatory of what is presented elsewhere.<a name=296:9></a> We may see there what is to be seen in other parts of the scriptures.<a name=296:10></a> When the Spirit of God addresses Himself to the Hebrews, He presents things in one light, and in addressing Gentiles He presents substantially the same things in another light.<a name=296:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the two points that I wish to bring before you; i.<a name=297:3></a>e.<a name=297:4></a>, the testimony of God, and the way in which the witnesses were affected by that testimony.<a name=297:5></a> No one could have the testimony without being affected by it.<a name=297:6></a> We see how it shone out thus in Abel, Enoch, Noah, and others named.<a name=297:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The interest of the eleventh chapter is in seeing the testimony of God shining out, faith discerning the foundations of the world to come; for God gave expression in detail to what was in His thought.<a name=297:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the attempt to build the tower of Babel we have man's will coming out.<a name=297:9></a> They set to work to build a city for man's glory -- that was man's will and purpose; but at the same time God had His own will, and that shines out from time to time through faith.<a name=297:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will touch on two or three salient points in the eleventh chapter to show what the testimony of God was in detail; then I will endeavour to open out a little what the better thing was that God foresaw for us.<a name=297:11></a> We read that the patriarchs died in faith, not having received the promise.<a name=297:12></a> God had in this a purpose -- <i>viz</i>.<a name=297:13></a>, that they were not to be made perfect without us for whom He had prepared some better thing.<a name=297:14></a> I should like that we might see a little more clearly what the better thing is, and how saints are properly affected by it.<a name=297:15></a> How far we have been <i>actually</i> affected by it may be another question, but it is well to see what is its proper effect.<a name=297:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reverting to the patriarchs, the testimony of God to Abraham was, that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed.<a name=297:17></a> There was here the light of a distinct purpose on God's part of blessing to all the nations of the earth.<a name=297:18></a> The promise was given

		<a name=298>[Page 298]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to Abraham, but I take it up in connection with the seed, because that is really the important point, for my impression is that God intended to intimate how blessing would be secured to all the families of the earth in a risen Christ.<a name=298:1></a> That was His testimony, and faith apprehended it.<a name=298:2></a> The true idea of faith is of divine light in the soul.<a name=298:3></a> God gave to Abraham His testimony, and Abraham believed it, and thus had light in his soul and was affected by the light.<a name=298:4></a> God does not intend light to be ineffective.<a name=298:5></a> Abel and Enoch had light, and they were affected by the light.<a name=298:6></a> As to the latter "he was not", for God took him.<a name=298:7></a> The church is now in the light of translation, and if saints were in the power of it, man as such would not be seen in it.<a name=298:8></a> That was the practical bearing of the testimony which Enoch had.<a name=298:9></a> Noah had the testimony of the way of salvation through impending judgment; he had light from God that judgment was coming, but that there was a way of salvation.<a name=298:10></a> In Abraham, as I have said, the point was "In thee .<a name=298:11></a>.<a name=298:12></a>.<a name=298:13></a> shall all the families of the earth be blessed"; and this was confirmed when in figure Isaac was raised from the dead.<a name=298:14></a> Every attribute of God had been met, typically, in the sacrifice, and then the promise that all the families of the earth should be blessed, was confirmed to Abraham's seed.<a name=298:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect on Abraham was, that his aspirations went beyond the testimony, i.<a name=298:16></a>e.<a name=298:17></a>, he sought two things -- one was a city, and the other a country.<a name=298:18></a> And on the other side, he became a stranger and a pilgrim here.<a name=298:19></a> "He looked for a city", and he sought a country; he saw that God was even greater than His testimony, i.<a name=298:20></a>e.<a name=298:21></a>, God was not limited by His testimony; and in fact a city and a country were necessary to His promise.<a name=298:22></a> A city is the symbol of rule, and a country I might speak of as an expanse for liberty and enjoyment.<a name=298:23></a> That was what Abraham foresaw.<a name=298:24></a> The city that he looked for was one that "hath foundations, whose

		builder and maker is God"; and the country he sought was heavenly.<a name=299:1></a> He looked for a city and country having these characteristics, and in that way he traded, so to speak, on the goodness of God; and it is added, "Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city".<a name=299:2></a> It is our privilege to know that we shall have our part in that heavenly country where there will be full expanse and liberty, and we shall form part of the city, of which Abraham does not form part, though he will have the good of it.<a name=299:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to Moses.<a name=299:4></a> The testimony of God which Moses apprehended was, that God had a people here.<a name=299:5></a> The first principle of God's purpose which we have seen was that all the families of the earth should be blessed in a risen Christ, and then we have the fact that there is a people of God here on this earth.<a name=299:6></a> Moses "was a proper child" himself, his parents "were not afraid of the king's commandment"; and when he came to years he discerned and was affected by the testimony of God.<a name=299:7></a> This so touched Moses that, seeing God's people in reproach, he chose to be identified and to suffer affliction with them rather than to be separated from them for the pleasures of sin.<a name=299:8></a> I understand from the fact of God's people being in reproach that they were not favoured by the providence of God; had they been thus favoured, they would not have been under the oppression of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.<a name=299:9></a> The resolve of Moses was to share in their reproach and not to be countenanced by the world.<a name=299:10></a> I need not say that when Christ was here He too was in the place of reproach.<a name=299:11></a> There was no reproach for Moses in the house of Pharaoh; but he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter because he would not disown his people for the kindness of the world, and "he had respect unto the recompense of the reward".<a name=299:12></a> That was the way in which things worked with Moses.<a name=299:13></a>

		But there came a crucial moment in Egypt, a night to be much observed, when the destroying angel passed through the land.<a name=300:1></a> God's people had been in reproach, and now the judgment of God was to fall upon the oppressor, while those under the shelter of the blood were secured from the judgment.<a name=300:2></a> And a further moment of the same kind occurred at the Red Sea, when the people of God passed safely through as on dry land, and the waters overwhelmed the Egyptians.<a name=300:3></a> In our case, we have seen God's testimony in Christ's going into death; God's love has reached us in the place of death, and we have passed through in triumph to receive assurance of that love by the Holy Spirit.<a name=300:4></a> Thus the people who had been in reproach were completely vindicated.<a name=300:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point that I notice in the testimony of God is the falling down of the walls of Jericho, after they had been compassed about for seven days.<a name=300:6></a> Those who went round them became pretty well acquainted with the walls by the seven days' survey.<a name=300:7></a> The truth is that the foundations on which the power of the enemy rests are rotten.<a name=300:8></a> Satan trades on man's ignorance of God.<a name=300:9></a> When the strongholds of the foe are reached, they need only to be compassed about, like the walls of Jericho, and they will fall down flat.<a name=300:10></a> The heart of Rahab did not fail, her faith was firm; she took in the situation, and could say, "I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you"; and thus we have in result the intervention of God in the salvation of a Gentile and her family.<a name=300:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We pass over a long period until the times of the Judges, and then we get some striking examples of the energy and patience of faith.<a name=300:12></a> There was a testimony of God still bound up with Israel; God had not ceased to regard or care for His people, although a point in their history is reached when their state

		In Samuel's time the links of relationship with God were broken, for the ark of God was taken by the Philistines, and Israel's glory was departed; but the ark was recovered in God's mercy, and under David was brought to Mount Zion.<a name=301:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A point I would notice is this: that no testimony of God is lost in a subsequent testimony -- no succeeding testimony swallows up a previous one.<a name=301:3></a> Can we suppose that God will give up any part of His purpose -- for instance, that in the seed of Abraham all the nations of the earth are to be blessed?<a name=301:4></a> Nothing can set that aside.<a name=301:5></a> Again, have not the walls of Jericho fallen down?<a name=301:6></a> Depend upon it that the one who attempts to build them again will bring on himself destruction.<a name=301:7></a> The word of the Lord abides for ever.<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we come to now is this: that all the detail of the past converges in the testimony of this moment, and it is that which I wish here to bring before you.<a name=301:9></a> The testimony of God in our day is of a glorified Christ; and that, I think, is the better thing which God has foreseen for us.<a name=301:10></a> It is the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ that is now presented.<a name=301:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All will probably remember the word of the apostle in 2 Corinthians, at the end of chapter 3, and the beginning of chapter 4, where we read: "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost; in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them.<a name=301:12></a> For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake.<a name=301:13></a> Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=301:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I understand that to be the light of God's testimony at this moment.<a name=302:1></a> The apostle speaks of it in 1 Timothy as "the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God, with which <i>I</i> have been entrusted".<a name=302:2></a> It was not entrusted to him merely for himself, but to make known to the saints; it shone out in Paul, and the apostle preached the gospel not merely to sinners, he preached it for the building up of saints.<a name=302:3></a> If you approach unconverted men, you must approach them with the light of the gospel; but the saints have also to be built up in the gospel of the glory of God.<a name=302:4></a> It is a purpose that is served to a large extent by the faithful evangelist.<a name=302:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by the gospel of the glory is, God's satisfaction in the complete bringing to pass of His will and purpose of blessing in the hands of One in whom He is perfectly revealed.<a name=302:6></a> The will of God is all that which is in His heart to bring to pass; all is centred in the One in whom God is effulgent, and there only is God fully revealed.<a name=302:7></a> Where did God shine out in all His fulness?<a name=302:8></a> I believe it was in the death of Christ.<a name=302:9></a> He went into death to bring into it the testimony of God's love.<a name=302:10></a> God is effulgent in Christ; the glory of God shines in the face of the One to whom is committed the full accomplishment of God's purpose.<a name=302:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish I could say a little more about the glory of God.<a name=302:12></a> I feel for myself how little I am affected by it.<a name=302:13></a> God has been revealed, and every attribute of God magnified.<a name=302:14></a> The love of God was revealed in Christ, but it was made effulgent at the cross.<a name=302:15></a> The Son of God came here to make God known, and He did this; and as the Man who glorified God, He has now gone up to God.<a name=302:16></a> He came out that God might be effulgent; and, on the other hand, as the Man who has glorified God, has gone in to God -- one and the same blessed Person, but viewed in two distinct lights.<a name=302:17></a> That is what faith apprehends.<a name=302:18></a> Faith is now the light of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many have been affected by the grace of God, but I do not think we have been so much affected by the love of God.<a name=303:3></a> God has come out in love that He may secure man's heart for Himself.<a name=303:4></a> He will have the love of man, He has set Himself to gain the heart of man -- but how?<a name=303:5></a> By making known His love.<a name=303:6></a> "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=303:7></a> The believer is in the light of the glory, and he rejoices "in hope of the glory of God".<a name=303:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to say a little about the way in which we are affected by this.<a name=303:11></a> I judge there are two special ways set forth -- one in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, and the other in chapter 12.<a name=303:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I understand it, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>runs parallel with .<a name=303:13></a>the epistle to the Ephesians, and chapter 12 with that to the Philippians.<a name=303:14></a> They bring before us the ways in which we are properly affected by the light of the glory of God.<a name=303:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first way in which, as seen in chapter 10, we answer to the light of the glory of God is in our acceptance of the calling which God has given us.<a name=303:16></a> As sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, we have, as sons, boldness to enter the holiest by His blood -- the new and living way which He hath dedicated through the veil, that is to say, His flesh.<a name=303:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will say a word about the "new and living way".<a name=303:18></a> Christ made that way by coming out from the heart of

		God to the cross, to bring the light of God's love.<a name=304:1></a> We travel the same way in our souls, only in the opposite direction, i.<a name=304:2></a>e.<a name=304:3></a>, from the cross to the heart of God.<a name=304:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We enter the holiest; but let us remember that we go in as priests, not as common people, nor even as Levites, but as risen together with Christ.<a name=304:5></a> We are sanctified -- but how?<a name=304:6></a> By our extinction; by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all -- that involves your extinction after the flesh.<a name=304:7></a> You go into "the holiest" as priests, i.<a name=304:8></a>e.<a name=304:9></a>, as formed by the love of God.<a name=304:10></a> It does not follow that because you go to the meeting, you go into "the holiest".<a name=304:11></a> You must not think that "the holiest" is synonymous with the meeting.<a name=304:12></a> True, it is the privilege of every Christian to enter "the holiest", but you must enter as priests, in conscious association with Christ.<a name=304:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I very much doubt whether anyone who fails to apprehend the calling of God enters "the holiest".<a name=304:14></a> I do not say that such have not a title, but as priests you must of necessity be on common ground with Christ; you are risen with Him -- delivered from the rudiments of the world; and not only that, but you are formed in the divine nature by the Holy Spirit, so as to be fit companions for Christ.<a name=304:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians you apprehend the calling of God.<a name=304:16></a> We are said to be raised up together, and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ; but the "heavenly places" are not exactly the idea of "the holiest".<a name=304:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 12 there is another effect of the light, viz.<a name=304:20></a>, you are running a race -- you run to the place where Christ is; and that is the idea which we find in chapter 3 of Philippians.<a name=304:21></a> And in running the race

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And let me draw attention to what appears so strikingly in chapter 3 of Philippians, <i>viz</i>.<a name=305:4></a>, purpose.<a name=305:5></a> This is a point of very great importance with saints, and one in which I doubt not we are defective.<a name=305:6></a> The apostle writing to Timothy says, "Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, <i>purpose</i>, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience".<a name=305:7></a> Many a saint is lacking in purpose, though at the same time wishing to go right; and the purpose of the heart does not come out so much in the acceptation of the calling as in running the race.<a name=305:8></a> There are certain things here in which one may have been glorified as a man, but there is a goal now presented to the saints, and that is Christ in glory; He is the end before us, and to reach Him means complete and eternal happiness.<a name=305:9></a> When we reach Him we shall have left all that is earthly behind us, and it will be unfailing satisfaction to the soul.<a name=305:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has come to us in grace to make known His love to our hearts, that they may be full of confidence in Him; and one effect is, that, severed in spirit from all here, we run to where Christ is, and with the object of finding what God has found, <i>viz</i>.<a name=305:11></a>, His glory -- complete satisfaction for our hearts.<a name=305:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is that you have to run the race "with patience".<a name=305:13></a> There is this admonition connected with it, to which we need to give heed -- we are called to lay aside every weight, and sin which doth so easily beset us, and to run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus.<a name=305:14></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that what we have of this world's goods, though ours providentially, may like many other things be possibly a weight.<a name=306:1></a> A rich man's wealth may be a weight.<a name=306:2></a> If a man is running a race, every weight would be an encumbrance.<a name=306:3></a> To a man who is settling down in this world things here are not weights; but when you start in the Christian path, then they become weights.<a name=306:4></a> I can understand a Christian being a rich man -- the Scriptures contemplate such a thing; but in such a case it needs much grace and wisdom to know how to use riches, so that they may not be weights.<a name=306:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And besides this there is "sin which doth so easily beset us".<a name=306:6></a> I understand sin to be the activity of the human will; and all that has to be firmly put aside -- it is so close at hand, that it soon gets hold of us.<a name=306:7></a> Every working of your own will must be unsparingly refused; if you allow it you will be greatly hindered in running the race, and the race has to be run with patience.<a name=306:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What makes a man impatient is that he cannot compass his will.<a name=306:9></a> If I see impatience in a man, I know it springs from his inability to give immediate effect to his will, and impatience is a sure sign of moral weakness.<a name=306:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two great principles seen in the epistle of James are, patience and no will.<a name=306:11></a> "Let us run with patience", and then there will be the acceptance of God's will -- "Looking unto Jesus".<a name=306:12></a> He accepted the will of God here in the fullest possible way, and He is now "set down at the right hand of the throne of God".<a name=306:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a blessed thought that we are running to the place where Christ is; He has reached the goal, and our happiness will be found in reaching in spirit the place where Christ has gone.<a name=306:14></a>

		THE PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a> - 18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is on my mind, is to seek to open out what is found in the early part of this epistle on the subject of Priesthood; both as to the fact of it, and its character.<a name=308:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were two parts in the provision of God for His people in the wilderness -- one was priesthood, the other the water of purification.<a name=308:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My desire is to speak on the subject of priesthood and the bearing of it, so that we may have a better and truer sense of its application to ourselves -- that is, of what Christ is to us as High Priest.<a name=308:3></a> The fact of Christ being connected with us as High Priest is so practical, that it is most important that we should have a true intelligence as to it.<a name=308:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two sides on which we can regard Christ in relation to man, <i>viz</i>.<a name=308:5></a>, as Mediator and as Priest; the one is a contrast to the other.<a name=308:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mediator covers all that He is on God's side towards men; Priest, on the other hand, covers all on man's side towards God -- a very simple thought to take in.<a name=308:7></a> It is in the Mediator that God has approached man.<a name=308:8></a> It is not a question here of man approaching God, for it would be impossible for man to approach God unless he has first learned how God has approached man.<a name=308:9></a> The Mediator is brought in in this connection -- "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>, 6.<a name=308:10></a> We have here God approaching man in grace.<a name=308:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, priesthood is connected entirely with man's approach to God.<a name=308:12></a> The one is the consequence of the other; the Priest could not be without

		the Mediator -- the Mediator and the Priest are combined in one divine Person.<a name=309:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, having completed His work as Mediator in giving "himself a ransom for all", goes back to God and takes up the position of Priest on the behalf of those who are the objects of God's purpose.<a name=309:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With a view of making the subject plain, I will just touch upon the Psalms, and open out a little their scope.<a name=309:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They begin with a rejected Christ, and end with the establishment of the Kingdom; anyone may readily see this.<a name=309:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>brings before us a rejected Christ, who is declared to be the Son of God; and in the closing Psalms we have the hallelujahs consequent on the establishment of the Kingdom: this was all prophetically recorded long before Christ came.<a name=309:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point of moment in the Psalms, and to which others have called attention, is, that they bring in (and they are the first part of Scripture which does distinctly bring in) the idea of "a remnant".<a name=309:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be a church remnant, or that which is the nucleus of the church, or the remnant of Israel in the future.<a name=309:7></a> But the thought of a remnant is a very important one in the Psalms, and in connection with Priesthood.<a name=309:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>we have a very distinct reference to a remnant in "I will declare thy name unto my brethren"; and also that which will eventually become "the great congregation" is first a remnant; it becomes that, but is a remnant.<a name=309:9></a> In Isaiah we read, "Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah".<a name=309:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the thought of a remnant an interesting question suggests itself -- i.<a name=309:11></a>e.<a name=309:12></a>, how could the Gentiles come in in the character of a remnant?<a name=309:13></a> The answer is that an election from the Gentiles is identified with a remnant saved out of Israel.<a name=309:14></a> There was a remnant of Israel who received Christ, and the Gentiles became fellow-citizens with the saints and of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=310>[Page 310]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's household.<a name=310:1></a> The thought of a remnant brings in the purpose of God; God reserves a remnant to Himself; the apostasy of Israel is foretold, and a remnant is left, and an election from among the Gentiles joined with them.<a name=310:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The High Priest is identified according to the thought of God with the remnant.<a name=310:3></a> I do not here refer to the priesthood in Israel, because the high priest there and the whole order of things was after the flesh; but speaking of priesthood as in the mind of God, it is identified with a remnant, it is on their behalf.<a name=310:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I can see there are two ideas taken from the Psalms on which priesthood is built up in Hebrews, <i>viz</i>.<a name=310:5></a>, sonship and a place at the right hand of God.<a name=310:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a>, we read, "I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee".<a name=310:7></a> And <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>opens with the words -- "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool"; and in verse 4 -- "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=310:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>we have the Christ rejected by man, and the same thought appears also in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>.<a name=310:9></a> Now I will ask you to look for a moment at <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:4">Hebrews  5:4</a> - 6 and I refer to this passage because that in it the passages I have quoted from the two Psalms are brought into conjunction, and we see that the truth of priesthood in Hebrews lies in the identification of sonship with priesthood, a point of the last moment.<a name=310:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth holds good also in our case, that we are priests because we are sons -- the priests are now the many sons whom God is bringing to glory.<a name=310:11></a> The truths of sonship and priesthood are thus very closely connected, both with regard to Christ and to us.<a name=310:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The value of being a priest is, that you have access to God; and how could you have such access if you did not know His love?<a name=310:13></a> It is the knowledge of God's love that gives you that freedom.<a name=310:14></a> Confidence is a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=311>[Page 311]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		most essential element of Christianity, and what do you think that it springs from in the Christian?<a name=311:1></a> I should say confidence is rather the effect of love than of faith.<a name=311:2></a> That is brought out in John's first epistle.<a name=311:3></a> Perfect love casteth out fear, and then we have confidence.<a name=311:4></a> It is in the apprehension of the love of God that we have access to Him.<a name=311:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already said that priesthood is closely connected in the divine mind with the idea of a remnant, and that thought is very important in connection with the Psalms.<a name=311:6></a> We have the same principle in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:17">Hebrews  6:17</a> - 20, in which we read, "Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=311:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here the thought of a remnant of Jews, who, in the general defection of the nation, had fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before them.<a name=311:8></a> And that remnant was secured for God Himself.<a name=311:9></a> I think that passage is amply sufficient to identify the priesthood with the thought of a remnant, who are "the heirs of promise", and who are identified by faith with a rejected Christ.<a name=311:10></a> Christ could not be a Priest on earth, though there were in Him all the moral qualifications for a Priest.<a name=311:11></a> He could not be a Priest on earth, He was made perfect for such an office through sufferings; and it is when He is exalted to the right hand of God that He enters properly upon His priestly function.<a name=311:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will enter into some detail connected with priesthood as referred to in the earlier part of the epistle.<a name=311:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2: 17, 18 we have, "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people".<a name=312:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The important point to remark in connection with this passage is, that the work of offering is no proper part of Christ's High Priesthood.<a name=312:2></a> It is true that in the work of offering He fulfilled the type of an offering priest, but in His work He was properly the victim -- He offered <i>Himself</i> by the Eternal Spirit.<a name=312:3></a> The basis on which priesthood rests is righteousness.<a name=312:4></a> The righteousness of God was fully vindicated and established as a basis for acting, before Christ entered on the office of High Priest.<a name=312:5></a> You find in this passage the qualification of Christ as High Priest -- "For, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted".<a name=312:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will endeavour to give you an illustration of this succour in the history of Paul.<a name=312:7></a> He was placed in a great variety of circumstances, and now and again you will even find him brought into such as the Lord would have spared him from: an instance of this is when he went up to Jerusalem and was seized by the people, and afterwards taken out of their hands by the Romans.<a name=312:8></a> He put himself into those circumstances in his affection for, and desire to reach in testimony his own people, the Jews.<a name=312:9></a> Still, at the critical moment the Lord appears to Paul to succour him.<a name=312:10></a> If a man gets into a false position he is in danger, and very liable to depression, and no one but the Lord can help him.<a name=312:11></a> So in the case of Peter: he had not faith to go into the palace of the high priest.<a name=312:12></a> He did not go there in the way of testimony as Christ did; and having signally failed, what he needed at that moment was succour; and the Lord had prayed for him, and his spirit is saved from being overwhelmed within him, "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not".<a name=312:13></a> The

		care of the Lord is <i>seen</i> in His looking on Peter; and further, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>the Lord takes the priestly place in restoring him.<a name=313:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These examples I think show how graciously and effectually the Lord can succour His saints, even when, through want of watchfulness, they are brought into unhappy circumstances.<a name=313:2></a> We may be allowed to be greatly tried, but then it is that the Lord is able to come in in priestly service to succour, lest the spirit of His saints should be overwhelmed.<a name=313:3></a> And He comes in that there may be restoration, though the circumstances of trial may be unchanged.<a name=313:4></a> Paul had still to suffer in the circumstances, but his spirit was succoured.<a name=313:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we pass on to the last three verses of chapter 4, we get a little further light; we have here not simply the qualification of the Priest, but that He has passed through the heavens, and that, I think, confirms what I have said with regard to the contrast of Priest and Mediator; you would not speak of a mediator passing through the heavens.<a name=313:6></a> The point is, that Christ has gone up from the lowest place of humiliation here, through the heavens, to the throne of God.<a name=313:7></a> It is not a question of His having come out to present God to man, but going from the lowest place here to the highest place in heaven; and one result of that is the establishment of the throne of grace.<a name=313:8></a> Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=313:9></a> The Lord came down from heaven and was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death; descended into the lowest depths of shame, but He has now passed through the heavens to the throne of God; He has travelled that course in the interests of man; there is righteous ground for the inauguration of the reign of grace.<a name=313:10></a> We have consequently a High Priest who can sympathise with our infirmities, and we have the encouragement now to come "boldly unto the throne of grace".<a name=313:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should like to show the working of this.<a name=313:12></a> There

		are three things that at one time or another press upon us all down here; three kinds of pressure that are incidental to human life; one is bereavement; another bodily weakness; and the third is trial in circumstances.<a name=314:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me ask if every one has not more or less been touched by one and perhaps all of these three things: it is hardly possible to pass through life here without experiencing something of all three.<a name=314:2></a> Well, it is a great thing to know that in all three we have the sympathy of Christ, and that sympathy encourages us to go to the throne of grace to find help and mercy.<a name=314:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The One who is now as man at the right hand of God is the same blessed Person that stood with Martha and Mary at the grave of Lazarus; He came into full contact with human sorrow, so as to sympathise.<a name=314:4></a> He has not lost ability for that, now that He is at the right hand of God; there were qualities displayed in Him when here in the flesh which belong to Him still.<a name=314:5></a> Could we suppose that the heart of Christ is changed?<a name=314:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are permitted, too, to see Him on earth in resurrection, in order that we may appreciate the fact that He is not changed, and we have the very same Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=314:7></a> The pressure of bodily weakness is understood by Him; and we have a throne of grace where we can obtain mercy, everything connected with us in our path here being taken into account.<a name=314:8></a> These are the effects of having a High Priest who has passed through the heavens.<a name=314:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now go on to chapter 5: 7 - 9: "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him".<a name=314:10></a> I desire to say a word as to two thoughts in this passage.<a name=314:11></a> One is, He learned obedience.<a name=314:12></a> We must not confound that with the idea
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=315>[Page 315]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of learning to obey; we have to learn to obey because we have wills.<a name=315:1></a> Such could not be supposed of Christ; His meat was to do the will of His Father; but in His path down here He learned everything which obedience involved.<a name=315:2></a> The other point is, "being made perfect".<a name=315:3></a> This must be limited to His qualification for entering upon priestly functions.<a name=315:4></a> We have the same thought in chapter 2 there He is made perfect as leader of our salvation.<a name=315:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you come to the application of the passage, "He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him", I understand eternal salvation to be in contrast with temporal deliverance.<a name=315:6></a> God effected temporal deliverances for Israel, but now Christ has secured 'eternal' salvation.<a name=315:7></a> In their case deliverance was material; for us salvation is in a sense moral -- the emancipation of the soul from all that would hold it from God.<a name=315:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that the Lord was bent upon this in His dealing with the woman of Samaria at the well of Sychar.<a name=315:9></a> He says, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life".<a name=315:10></a> My thought is, that what the Lord effects for the soul of the Christian, is the communication to him of an entirely new spring, which shall in result emancipate him from the power of all that is of sin in him.<a name=315:11></a> This, I think, is seen in His words to the Samaritan woman.<a name=315:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect and evidence of sin in man is largely in that the affections go out in all sorts of irregular directions.<a name=315:13></a> Christ gives that which shall form and regulate the affections of the soul, in order that they may take the channels of God's appointment.<a name=315:14></a> It is in that way that a person is truly emancipated from the law of sin; the secret of liberty lies in the affections.<a name=315:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God in the believer directs the affections into their proper channels, and they flow out
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=316>[Page 316]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		first to Christ and then to saints.<a name=316:1></a> Christ has thus become "the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him".<a name=316:2></a> The well of water in the believer springs up into eternal life; and the believer is thus not only in the power and result of what Christ has given him, but free of the law of sin and of death.<a name=316:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would now ask you to pass on to chapter 6: 20.<a name=316:4></a> And here it is very interesting to see that the Priest is "the forerunner", who has entered into that which is within the veil.<a name=316:5></a> The idea I have of a veil as a figure employed in Scripture is, that it is anything that conceals God.<a name=316:6></a> When Christ was here, the fulness of the Godhead was here, but hidden behind the veil of flesh.<a name=316:7></a> My impression is that in chapter 6 God's providence is the veil.<a name=316:8></a> God is hidden behind His providences.<a name=316:9></a> If you attempt to judge of God by His providences you will not have a true idea of Him.<a name=316:10></a> I do not doubt for one moment the wisdom of God in His providences; but the providence of God stands in the strongest contrast with the revelation of God; and it would be a great mistake to confound the two thoughts.<a name=316:11></a> Now Christ has entered as Forerunner; He has gone within the veil of providences, and we go in, while we accept God's providences: for He can turn these to account in the way of discipline.<a name=316:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might add this in regard to providences, that they may misguide, if by them you judge of God's thoughts of His people.<a name=316:13></a> If you recall the voyage of Paul as narrated in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27">Acts  27</a>, you must see how the providences of God appeared to be all against him.<a name=316:14></a> We cannot think for a moment that he was bound in spirit by the providence of God.<a name=316:15></a> No; he knew he had access to where the Forerunner had gone, and so he got the mind of God as to the shipwreck and the preservation of all.<a name=316:16></a>

		If you have followed me, you will see the progress we have made in opening up the subject.<a name=317:3></a> Christ has become the Author of eternal salvation.<a name=317:4></a> Then, as our Forerunner, He has entered within the veil, and so has opened a way for us to go in.<a name=317:5></a> Now I would suggest that two further thoughts are brought before us here -- the one is, attachment to the Priest, and the other, that we draw nigh to God by Him.<a name=317:6></a> If you have not attachment to the Priest, I doubt if you will have much liberty to draw near to God; and I think that not only is this brought out in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>, but that you will find the same idea in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=317:7></a> The point in both passages is that one system of things has been set aside in the death of Christ: "There is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before", as stated in this chapter, while in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>you are said to have "become dead to the law, by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God".<a name=317:8></a> Of old we have the principle that the death of the high priest ended one order of things; and thus the legal order of things has been ended in the death of Christ, with the intent that you might be attached to Him as risen, to bring forth fruit to God.<a name=317:9></a>

		Before closing I would like to touch on what I regard as the <i>proper</i> function of the Priest, "For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens .<a name=318:7></a>.<a name=318:8></a>.<a name=318:9></a> We have such an high priest .<a name=318:10></a>.<a name=318:11></a>.<a name=318:12></a> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man".<a name=318:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you have come to chapter 7 you have reached the limit of the relations of the Priest to, what I might term, our individual experience here.<a name=318:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Henceforward it is no longer a High Priest having regard to our infirmity; that subject is left, and we are called upon to apprehend the Priest in another light, i.<a name=318:15></a>e.<a name=318:16></a>, in His <i>proper</i> function.<a name=318:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What are we, that it should be said, "Such an high priest became us"?<a name=318:18></a> It is, I judge, that the saints are viewed in the light and height of God's calling, and He alone who is "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens", could properly be High Priest for such, all the offering work having been done.<a name=318:19></a> "The law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which is after the law, a Son perfected for ever".<a name=318:20></a>

		May the Lord give us to realise practically what the service of the High Priest is.<a name=319:7></a> I would wish that each one might look into the subject prayerfully for himself, so that we might rightly value all the good of the present priestly service of Christ which God has appointed for us.<a name=319:8></a> Thus you will get attachment of heart to Himself, and so bring forth fruit to God.<a name=319:9></a> It is a great thing to know Him as the Minister of the holy places; it is not only that He serves, but He has put Himself in the midst of the worshipping company.<a name=319:10></a> The Sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=319:11></a> I feel how imperfectly I have brought the subject before you, but I hope that you will look at the scriptures we have read, and that God in His grace will give you to understand the great work that He has set Christ apart as Priest to carry out.<a name=319:12></a>

		THREE TITLES OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:33">Matthew  21:33</a> - 46; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:1">Matthew  22:1</a> - 14; <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very remarkable to see the titles which belong to Christ and to see too how they are interwoven in the gospel, not in the gospel of Matthew simply, for the same thing is found in the other gospels; in John, for instance, you get three names or titles of Christ.<a name=320:1></a> The three to which I refer are 'Christ', which is equivalent to Messiah, the one being Greek and the other Hebrew, as you all perhaps know, but the terms are equivalent; then the other two are 'Son of David' and 'Son of man'.<a name=320:2></a> Now I want to point out to you the significance of them.<a name=320:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When everything breaks down at the hand of man -- there are certain titles in which Christ is presented to man and everything breaks down on that ground -- God is not baffled, but He accomplishes everything in Christ.<a name=320:4></a> Take the second Psalm, for instance, though you must first remember the period taken in by the Psalms.<a name=320:5></a> The Psalms were compiled by very many people, and they consist, as you all doubtless know, of five books, in which there is a certain progress.<a name=320:6></a> They were written very many years before Christ came, yet the period covered by the Psalms begins really with His rejection, and they close with the establishment of the Kingdom; you get the restoration of Israel and Judah and the establishment of the Kingdom.<a name=320:7></a> The books close with the great Hallelujahs consequent upon the establishment of the Kingdom.<a name=320:8></a> Here in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>we get the rejection of Christ, it commences with that all are found to be in organisation against Jehovah and against His Christ, yet has He set His King upon His holy mount.<a name=320:9></a> Then He is not simply 'Messiah' but Jehovah's Son -- "Thou art my Son", and then connections are formed for Him, that is the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=321>[Page 321]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		consequence of His rejection by His own people.<a name=321:1></a> But I will not dwell long upon that.<a name=321:2></a> The second Psalm gives us the thesis or groundwork for very many of the Psalms, in fact, I might almost say for all the Psalms.<a name=321:3></a> Now the effect of the presentation of Christ in the flesh was this, "Let us .<a name=321:4></a>.<a name=321:5></a>.<a name=321:6></a> cast away their cords from us".<a name=321:7></a> Not only the nations but God's own people reject Him.<a name=321:8></a> Then in verse 4 you get the response, "the Lord shall have them in derision", etc.<a name=321:9></a>, in spite of all their disturbance God will accomplish His purpose.<a name=321:10></a> There are two things, God sets His King "upon his holy hill of Zion", and at the same time He is declared to be God's Son; it is another light in which He is presented, and then connections are formed for Him.<a name=321:11></a> You get part of this Psalm taken up in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:18">Revelation  2:18</a>, 26, 27; the title under which He here speaks to the churches -- "Son of God" -- is beautiful taken in connection with what we get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=321:12></a> Christ comes in as the Son of God, and He gives to the overcomer authority over the nations -- it is the new connection formed for the Son of God.<a name=321:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will just revert to what I said as to the three titles -- first you get Christ the anointed; secondly -- Son of God; and then thirdly -- Son of man.<a name=321:14></a> Now just look at <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:13">Matthew  16:13</a>, Jesus asks His disciples, "Whom do men say that I the <i>Son of man</i> am?<a name=321:15></a>" Then in verse 16 you get Peter's confession, "Thou art .<a name=321:16></a>.<a name=321:17></a>.<a name=321:18></a> the Son of the living God"; then in verse 20 He charges them that they should tell no man that He was "Jesus the Christ"; then again in verse 27 you get Him as Son of man.<a name=321:19></a> It was just at the point when the Lord's rejection comes before Him, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=321:20></a>" Then we have Peter's confession, "Thou art .<a name=321:21></a>.<a name=321:22></a>.<a name=321:23></a> the Son of the living God", and immediately upon that the Lord forbids them to say anything more; and judgment comes in consequent upon that.<a name=321:24></a> He comes out in a new light and in connection with that the new connections come
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=322>[Page 322]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in; that is really what comes before us in these scriptures.<a name=322:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These parables come in in connection with the Lord's coming up to Jerusalem to suffer -- as we have it in the parable the husbandmen said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours".<a name=322:2></a> In the beginning of this chapter (21) He comes into Jerusalem as the Christ, and He claims the inheritance, the way in which He claimed it was by the testimony, and had they been in intelligence as to the mind of God or as to Scripture they would have been quite contented that He should have had His inheritance.<a name=322:3></a> The Lord Jesus Christ comes into Jerusalem under the title of Son of David, and claims the inheritance according to His proper line after the flesh, He claimed what was His properly as after the flesh.<a name=322:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You must take all these chapters in conjunction, so if you will look on to chapter 24: 29, 30, we get "the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory", then in chapter 25: 31 again, "The Son of man shall come in his glory", etc.<a name=322:5></a> These two chapters are taken up with the coming of the Son of man, "They shall see the sign of the Son of man", etc.<a name=322:6></a>, the kingdom of heaven comes in between but still the great subject of the two chapters is the coming of the Son of man; then in chapter 25 in regard of Christendom you have the "Son of man shall .<a name=322:7></a>.<a name=322:8></a>.<a name=322:9></a> sit upon the throne of his glory", and all nations are gathered before Him.<a name=322:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, my beloved friends, we have two things in these chapters -- Christ entering Jerusalem as the Son of David -- and as such His title was rejected, they disowned Him at once; in chapter 21 from verse 12 onwards the Lord gave a twofold testimony not only by His testimony claiming the inheritance but in the healing of the blind and lame.<a name=322:11></a> What I read all these scriptures for is really to prove to you that Christ coming as the "Son of David" His testimony is rejected in spite of the testimony He gave; then
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=323>[Page 323]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		again in chapters 24 and 25 you get the judgment He executes on the nations and the power and glory that He will establish; in these chapters you get the substance of what we find in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=323:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will take up the two parables, turn to chapter 21: 38, 39, that brings us to the end of God's dealings with the responsibility of the husbandmen; they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance", now the Heir was God's Son, though presented as Son of David, and they had rejected and refused God's Son.<a name=323:2></a> He came to them with adequate testimony and they had refused Him and they were responsible for killing Him -- the Son of God -- that brings everything to an end on that line.<a name=323:3></a> This parable is very plain and their own answer to the Lord's question as to what shall be done with those wicked men is, "He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen".<a name=323:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, we will turn to the other parable which brings another thought before us -- chapter 22 -- the first point is it is a similitude of the kingdom of heaven, it fills up the interval between the rejection of Christ and goes on till Christ comes again -- it is a similitude of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=323:5></a> There is another thing, too, you do not get anything about husbandmen in this parable; in the previous one they occupy a very conspicuous place, but here all that is seen is God's Son.<a name=323:6></a> In spite of all that is contrary God will accomplish everything in His Son -- He will accomplish all in His own Son; it is a marriage supper made and the central figure of it all is the king's son.<a name=323:7></a> What is intended to be set forth in this figure is what is true of marriage according to the thought of God -- "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife".<a name=323:8></a> It is Christ entering into connections outside his natural connections with Israel, He has left father and mother and all that, and other connections are formed for Him -- the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connection of Christ and the church.<a name=324:1></a> I am quite aware that it does not come out very plainly but still what you really get in the marriage is a man separated from all his natural connections, that he may form new ones.<a name=324:2></a> The first testimony that goes out to the Jew is this, "God has made him, Jesus whom <i>ye</i> have crucified, both Lord and Christ" -- that was the apostles' testimony to the Jews, then too there were festivities in connection with His exaltation; the apostle in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>urges them to repent, it was a time of festivity at the exaltation of Christ -- God had made Him both Lord and Christ; He had made a marriage supper for His Son and they were invited to come in and share His good things.<a name=324:3></a> The Jews who had killed God's Son were invited to come in and share His good things.<a name=324:4></a> The whole ground of God's dealings was changed, it was no longer a question of His testing the husbandmen, but He sets forth His Son in a scene of festivities, and invites man to partake of the good things -- other connections had been formed for God's Son -- He was separated from the natural kindred.<a name=324:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All Christianity hangs upon the fact that God's Son has been rejected here but accepted up above; Christendom wants to blind the eyes of people as to Christ's rejection -- look at the church steeples they set up, they want to pretend that Christ has been accepted here; but the truth remains that He has been rejected here, and man is invited in to enjoy all that has come in in consequence of His exaltation to the right hand of God.<a name=324:6></a> When Christ comes again people will not be invited to come in, for Christ will bring salvation with Him, but now God is inviting people to come in and enjoy all that is consequent upon God having been glorified -- there is forgiveness of sins for man -- and the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=324:7></a> If Christ is the central figure for God -- it is of all importance, beloved friends, that He should be the central figure for us.<a name=324:8></a> Everything now as established

	<div class="paragraph">
		in Christ is in accordance with and consequent upon the love of God, "Thou art my Son".<a name=325:1></a> I ask all here tonight, is God's Son to you what He is to God?<a name=325:2></a> Is He your central figure?<a name=325:3></a> If we have come into the marriage supper, we have come in at God's invitation, to do honour to God's Son, and He is to be the central and commanding figure in our souls.<a name=325:4></a> He has "translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love".<a name=325:5></a> Beloved friends, a great many things come in to divert our hearts, and to conflict the ground with the Son of God, but the very ground on which we have come in to the supper is to do honour to His Son.<a name=325:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one word as to the wedding garment, verses 8 - 14, the only possible title that we can have to come into the supper to share the festivities is this, that Christ is our righteousness -- there is no other ground on which God could possibly approve us.<a name=325:7></a> Abraham will have his part in the world to come because the Lord is his righteousness.<a name=325:8></a> The only title we have to enjoy the good things of God is that Christ is our righteousness, it is, as I said before, the only possible ground on which God can approve us.<a name=325:9></a> We have no title to be in the kingdom of heaven other than as having Christ for our righteousness; suppose a man should say, 'I am quite fit to go in, I can read chapters and I can take part in divine worship, I do not see any particular need to go through exercise of heart': the wedding garment is a proof of this, that I have gone through exercise of heart, the only ground on which I can come into the kingdom of heaven is as having on an approved righteousness -- and Christ is that righteousness.<a name=325:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the servants gathered together all, both bad and good, people come into the outward profession of Christianity, but mark this -- there comes a moment when the King comes in to inspect the guests; that moment is coming.<a name=325:11></a> He looks to see the guests and He sees one man who has not on the wedding garment;

		that man is a representative man, the wedding garment was provided for that man but he has not it on.<a name=326:1></a> The garment is this -- I have no righteousness of my own, but Christ is my appointed righteousness; there is a way of justification for those who own that they have no righteousness of their own, Christ has been "raised again" for their justification.<a name=326:2></a> If a man has not Christ in that sense, he is not fit to be in the kingdom of heaven.<a name=326:3></a> The man we get here is a representative of very many more.<a name=326:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now suppose I have the wedding garment -- Christ as righteousness now, then I can come into all the festivities of that scene, in which Christ is the object and the central figure; He is to be as much an object to your heart as He is to God; He has made Him the central figure; He has formed connections for Him outside of Israel, and He is the only figure in that scene.<a name=326:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Does every heart here rejoice that in spite of the contrariety of all here, Christ has found an adequate object for His own heart.<a name=326:6></a> And in that object God has been pleased to establish all the purposes of His will.<a name=326:7></a> I see that when Christ was born into this world the announcement of the angels was "on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=326:8></a> That song was changed when He came into Jerusalem, it is taken up by the children, but what they sing is this, "Peace in heaven", He is the Object, supreme honour, and there is peace in heaven, and the reason that there is peace in heaven is because He was going to be honoured there, and because He is there, there is peace there.<a name=326:9></a> The apprehension in the soul of the place that Christ has is a most wonderful thing.<a name=326:10></a> He is coming again in judgment, to establish things in the kingdom according to God; but meantime He is known to us as the Son of God's love, and the church is His fulness -- that is what God has made known to us.<a name=326:11></a> We bow to the righteousness of God, and to the sentence of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have in Christ the wedding garment -- there is no garment of ours that God could approve; everything of you -- every miserable shred of you is to be set aside if Christ is your righteousness, another thing comes in and that is Christ is to be your life, in connection with the "New man .<a name=327:3></a>.<a name=327:4></a>.<a name=327:5></a> where there is neither Greek nor Jew .<a name=327:6></a>.<a name=327:7></a>.<a name=327:8></a> but Christ is all, and in all".<a name=327:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Only one word more -- it is a solemn thing to think of this Christendom, it will all come under the inspection of the King, and as sure as anything there will be a man there who has not on a wedding garment, "many are called but few are chosen".<a name=327:10></a> Oh, to see what is suitable to the King, and to recognise that we are there in no fitness of our own, but as having Christ for righteousness.<a name=327:11></a> If I were invited to a feast I should not only try to be in suitability to it all, but my eye would be on the One who is the central object of the feast.<a name=327:12></a> Beloved friends, the Son of God is to be the supreme and commanding object of our hearts even down here.<a name=327:13></a>

		The coming in of the King to see the guests brought out one thing in regard to the man, he had not on the wedding garment; he had never recognised that the judgment of God was upon him, and the man who has that resting upon him cannot stand before God; if you are going to stand before God it must be in virtue of another's having borne that judgment, Christ "was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=329:6></a> I cannot stand before God on the ground of my own fitness, but Christ has given me a place in the presence of God.<a name=329:7></a> Now that question had never been raised in that man's soul, he had not on the wedding garment: it is so with thousands and thousands today, they have never realised that it is only another who can give them a place in the presence of God.<a name=329:8></a> It is "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness" and it will be so with Israel in the millennium, the Lord must be their righteousness; He gives them a place, as He does us in the presence of God.<a name=329:9></a> Christ has glorified God, and raised from the dead, He gives us a place in the presence of God.<a name=329:10></a> We have to stand in the righteousness of another; in the parable of the marriage supper they were tested in that way; it is a great thing to know on what ground you stand in the presence of God; I can stand there because Christ is there, if He is in the presence of God in resurrection, I can stand there, too: He has become "the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth".<a name=329:11></a>

		We know very well that the Lord left His servants here in the time of his absence, and what comes in between that and His kingdom is the "coming of the Son of man".<a name=330:1></a> He comes to take up the kingdom under the name in which He suffered; if He takes that name as suffering it is under that name that he will reign, "the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father"; the truth that is concealed is that He is <i>Son of God</i>, but He takes up the kingdom as the Son of man, because that is the name under which He suffered, it is the kingdom of the Son of <i>Man</i>; we wait for the coming of the Son of man; and it is His absence that gives opportunity in a way to faithfulness or unfaithfulness on the part of the servants, faith comes in in that way, they did not hold down their hands.<a name=330:2></a> Now we ought to be occupied as those were who were faithful, in ministering to the needs of His household.<a name=330:3></a> If people were to be busybodies, I should not say that they were waiting for the coming of the Son of man; but you are to recognise the presence of His house here, and you seek to minister to that house.<a name=330:4></a> We should each seek to be doing that; it may not be in very great ways, but still each in our way we should be seeking to meet the needs of His household.<a name=330:5></a> Ecclesiasticism sets to work to trade on His absence, and priest-craft comes in, domineering over the servants and eating and drinking with the drunken.<a name=330:6></a> For myself I would very much like to be in the rank and file of those who were seeking to meet the needs of His house.<a name=330:7></a> It might not be in any great way, perhaps, but still if it might be said as it was to the church of Philadelphia, "thou hast a little strength"; I would like to be little, and in the company of little people, but those who are seeking to minister "Meat in due season", to His household.<a name=330:8></a> I think it might well be an ambition of every soul; and on the other hand I would like to steer clear of everything like priest-craft, that would domineer over the servants; popery is the expression

		Now I just pass on to the parable of the virgins -- the great point that comes in in the marriage supper is the man's suitability to the King; it is in reference to God, and that raises the question of righteousness; here, it is more a question of suitability to the Bridegroom.<a name=331:2></a> What I understand by a Bridegroom is it points to One who has rights; I do not want to raise a thought as to a bride, but simply of what is to be conveyed in the word 'bridegroom'.<a name=331:3></a> Now we recognise that Christ has rights, and He is coming again to take up those rights; the Son of man is coming again to take up the kingdom that He has received by divine appointment.<a name=331:4></a> He has not yet come, but He is coming to take up that which belongs to Him by right.<a name=331:5></a> We are going out to meet Him, we are going to leave the world and we are going forth to meet the Bridegroom; and that is a point of very great moment as to our attitude of soul.<a name=331:6></a> Are you quiescent here, just content to enjoy things here in His absence?<a name=331:7></a> Then you are not waiting for the Bridegroom; I would just like to turn you to one passage of scripture to confirm this -- <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:11">Titus  2:11</a> - 14; that chapter greatly confirms to me the thought of the bride going forth to meet the Bridegroom; you will find there was the sense of salvation, they were free from God's judgment and the power of Satan, and then there was a certain teaching inherent in grace; what I understand by the 'teaching' of grace is that if you have that in your heart, it must have a corresponding effect upon your practice; and then we get something more, "looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ", in spirit and affection you go forth to meet the Bridegroom; now another point -- you are in that sense to be a "peculiar people, zealous of good works", it is that He might have a claim on a people here; that is the proper attitude of Christians --

		Now, beloved friends, I come back to the ten virgins -- it did not take long for the mixture to come in -- five were wise, and five were foolish; five went out in the consciousness that only the Spirit could maintain anything like a spiritual testimony here; and with them were five foolish virgins who trusted to their profession.<a name=332:5></a> Now if you go forth to meet the Bridegroom you must be in spiritual accordance with the Bridegroom, and the very first idea in a virgin, is one who is uncontaminated by the world; you have to be purified from the world -- that is the first point, then you are in accordance with the Bridegroom; no one could be in touch with Christ except by the Holy Spirit; He is the "Spirit of Christ" and if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of His; it is that which puts you in touch with the Bridegroom.<a name=332:6></a> Now, beloved friends, I cannot be waiting here for Christ unless I love Him, it must be "the love of Christ that constrains", it is only by the Spirit of Christ that my heart can go forth to the Bridegroom.<a name=332:7></a> How can you maintain the testimony if your heart does not go out to Him?<a name=332:8></a> He does not care for it at all unless it is the result of affection to Himself; your heart will not go out to Christ except by the Holy Spirit, but if your heart goes out to Him where He is, then you will have something to maintain the testimony down here.<a name=332:9></a> I am purified from the world and my heart goes out to Him; I cannot get the full measure of my happiness until He comes, but my heart goes out to Him where He is, and so I await His coming again.<a name=332:10></a> Do you think you <i>could</i> be looking for the coming of Christ unless you had a link with Him?<a name=332:11></a> If your heart goes out in affection to Him, then you will be looking

		The Bridegroom comes -- there is delay in His coming, and that gives the opportunity for all ten virgins to go to sleep, they become insensible to the coming of the Bridegroom; they fell under the power of the influences here; but there is one thing -- the wise virgins never lost the Spirit, He at least remained with them.<a name=333:2></a> Even in the very darkest days of the church's history, the Spirit remained here, there never would have been a revival at all in the church if the Spirit had not remained here.<a name=333:3></a> Now we come on to the close -- the cry goes forth, "Behold the Bridegroom" -- the word 'comes' is omitted by the best authorities -- "then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps" -- then there are those who feel that there is no power to maintain a continuous testimony; there was no continuous power to sustain the testimony, they had no oil in their lamps.<a name=333:4></a> If there is no outgoing of heart to the Bridegroom, there will be no power to maintain the testimony down here.<a name=333:5></a> If you are to be a devoted people down here, it is only affection to Him that can be the spring of that -- the "love of Christ" constraining.<a name=333:6></a> Christ came into death to make manifest His love to us, He has not only expressed to us the love of God, but His own love.<a name=333:7></a> If you are constrained by His love, it will be very easy for you to be waiting for the Bridegroom down here; and while you are waiting for Him to be seeking to minister to His household.<a name=333:8></a> Well, the cry went out, "Behold the Bridegroom", and "they that were ready went in with him to the marriage", their readiness was simply that they had oil in their lamps.<a name=333:9></a> I quite admit that the oil is a type of the Spirit, but what marks a person who has the Spirit is affection for Christ.<a name=333:10></a> The testimony for Christ must have its own peculiar character, it is the fruit and result of affection for Christ.<a name=333:11></a> It will

		Beloved friends, I would like to be in the company of those five virgins; I would like to be uncontaminated by the world, and, too, that there might be more outgoing of heart by the Spirit to Christ in His absence; it is not that I do great things, or that I make a testimony, but I am attached to Christ; neither is it that I have any rights here, but the Bridegroom has, so I make my yieldingness known to all men -- the Bridegroom has rights.<a name=334:10></a> Man has begun to think that the world belongs to him, and the end of that will be the antichrist, but what the Christian is doing is he is waiting for the one who has rights, the One who has a perfect right to control everything because "He tasted

		BLESSING AND CURSE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The relation in which these principles stand to one another, and to man, in Scripture, is a point of deep interest, and may profitably occupy attention for a moment.<a name=336:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When in the thought of building a city and a tower man had shown his purpose to make for himself a centre and name on earth and thus to pursue his own glory, and not God's, then the God of glory called Abraham out of country, kindred and father's house, that is, every association in which a man is naturally, and made known to him His own purpose to bless.<a name=336:2></a> Man's purpose was for the time frustrated in the confusion of tongues and the scattering abroad, and God had revealed His own purpose of blessing in the man that answered to His call.<a name=336:3></a> The principle of calling became important as showing that God was not in the things out of which He called Abram, or He would not have called him out of them.<a name=336:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The promise made to Abraham was of blessing and inheritance, but the point on which I dwell now is the blessing, which is described in Galatians as "the blessing of Abraham".<a name=336:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before inquiring as to what the blessing consisted in, I remark that blessing stands in Scripture as the antithesis to curse, and it is of vital importance to see that God anticipated curse by blessing.<a name=336:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To return to Abraham.<a name=336:7></a> The nature of the blessing does not appear to me to come to light until <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, where we find the statement that Abraham "believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness".<a name=336:8></a> In respect of God and of the world to come Abraham was held or estimated for righteous; he was cleared in the eye of God of all reproach that had attached to him in connection with this world.<a name=336:9></a> This

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We pass on now over a period of four hundred years or more, to the time when the seed of Abraham in the flesh, after having proved the delivering power of God, was tested by law.<a name=337:3></a> This was a retrograde movement, and had the children of Israel understood the meaning and effect of it they would have deprecated the testing and claimed the blessing of Abraham.<a name=337:4></a> But they had no faith, they knew neither God nor themselves.<a name=337:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of law on fallen man could only be to put him in a worse position than he was in before.<a name=337:6></a> He was already under death, now he came under curse, and so far as he himself was concerned hopelessly so.<a name=337:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next great point in the history of Israel is, I judge, the brazen serpent, when the experience of the wilderness had shown the perverseness and contrariety of the flesh, even in Abraham's seed, as tested under law, and we find here how in divine wisdom the matter is met.<a name=337:8></a> Reading it in the light of the New Testament, we see, in the lifting up of the Son of man, the condemnation of sin in the flesh -- the sin is put away with the life to which it attached.<a name=337:9></a> The man that was under condemnation went in the condemnation, nothing of the flesh remains in the eye of God's purpose; but God was glorified in the Son of man, and in resurrection another Man brought in -- the last Adam, a life-giving Spirit.<a name=337:10></a> What now takes the place of flesh here is the springing well in the believer, the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, thus the curse which the law brought in is gone in the condemnation of the state that was under it, and in the place where it was another man now lives in the power and liberty of the Spirit.<a name=337:11></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=337:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we find very soon after the brazen serpent and the springing well, that God allowed the question of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the blessing and the curse to be again raised, but this time by the enemy.<a name=338:1></a> Balak, king of Moab, proposed to Balaam to curse Israel; and God takes occasion of that to give us a view of His people as in the vision of the Almighty.<a name=338:2></a> If the brazen serpent, and the springing well, be borne in mind, it will be apprehended that Balaam saw Israel not as after the flesh, but as in the light of divine purpose, in connection with Christ and the Spirit; and he is unwillingly compelled, to the irritation of Balak, to announce that there is no curse, but that the blessing of Abraham is there.<a name=338:3></a> God has not beheld iniquity in Jacob nor perverseness in Israel.<a name=338:4></a> Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.<a name=338:5></a> The application of this to our souls is sufficiently simple.<a name=338:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed for saints when they can take account of themselves as no longer in the flesh, dead to sin, but alive to God in the risen Man -- free from curse and condemnation, because no longer in the man that was under it; but enjoying the stability of God's purpose of blessing first made known to Abraham, and then confirmed in his son raised in figure from the dead.<a name=338:7></a> It is then that we apprehend the truth of justification, not simply in its application to us as guilty sinners, but as the called according to God's purpose: "whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified".<a name=338:8></a> And again, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?<a name=338:9></a> It is God that justifieth.<a name=338:10></a> Who is he that condemneth?<a name=338:11></a> It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us".<a name=338:12></a> The man under curse has disappeared, and Christ intercedes for those blessed in Him.<a name=338:13></a>

		I would like to draw attention to the life of faith down here, and to the deliverance which is connected with this life of faith as its necessary accompaniment.<a name=339:1></a> I shall dwell a little upon the various features of this life as presented here, and upon the deliverance accompanying each feature.<a name=339:2></a> I am quite sure that the two things which we have already had before us, namely, association with Christ and the hope of the coming of the Lord, are of all moment in the apprehension of the Christian.<a name=339:3></a> It has been said that the coming of the Lord is not as much before the minds of saints as in earlier days, but I cannot say that I think so.<a name=339:4></a> It is not perhaps before their minds as a prophetic event, and it may not be so much spoken of, but I believe it may have as much or more place in the hearts of the saints in its moral bearings.<a name=339:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to speak of faith as personified, that is, to look at the various features or expressions of faith recorded in this chapter as though they were all recorded of one person; there are many illustrations of faith, but if you can take them up as if they applied to one person they present one life of faith.<a name=339:6></a> What should be expressed in the Christian down here is the life of faith.<a name=339:7></a> Faith does not come out now in one and another in the way of some particular testimony, but every testimony finds its place in Christ, and thus every trait of faith is to characterise the Christian.<a name=339:8></a> I purpose to dwell upon two or three leading points in the chapter.<a name=339:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point presented is the first great principle in connection with man in regard to the world to come.<a name=340:5></a> On the ground of sacrifice Abel had acceptance with God, he obtained witness that he was righteous.<a name=340:6></a> The first trait of faith which characterises the Christian is in that he has the witness that he is righteous with God, and as a consequence of this there is the acceptance of death here; that is the beginning of deliverance.<a name=340:7></a> If we are accepted through death, necessarily we have to accept death.<a name=340:8></a> How can we righteously live here if we have acceptance for the world to come through death?<a name=340:9></a> We have to accept death in this world -- it is the drinking of the bitter waters of Marah.<a name=340:10></a> Abel had to experience this in a very bitter way, but if death is in itself bitter, the Son of God has come into it, and the testimony of divine love has made it sweet, and now death has become the way of deliverance.<a name=340:11></a>

		Enoch prophesied of the coming of the Lord, "the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints".<a name=340:12></a> He believed not only in the existence of God but in His being a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.<a name=340:13></a> Reward is more than acceptance, and the reward is God Himself.<a name=340:14></a> Enoch sought God, and he had the answer to it, that is, he got God Himself.<a name=340:15></a> He was not, for God took him, and that is really the portion of the church.<a name=340:16></a> There will be a company who seek God, and when the Lord comes they will be with God.<a name=340:17></a> Then there is the deliverance that accompanied Enoch's faith; He <i>was not</i>.<a name=340:18></a> He disappeared.<a name=340:19></a> I wonder if that applies to us.<a name=340:20></a> We accept death when we realise the

		We now come to Noah, and you need to bear in mind that we are looking at each example as if all were true of one person.<a name=341:3></a> In Noah we get the same person coming as it were into the world after having, as in the case of Enoch, gone to God.<a name=341:4></a> Consequently he is occupied with God's work -- the building of the ark.<a name=341:5></a> When I come to the application of this to us it raises the question, What are we occupied with?<a name=341:6></a> Well, what I do is first to look after myself.<a name=341:7></a> I am to take heed to myself and to the doctrine.<a name=341:8></a> In so doing I save myself and those that hear me.<a name=341:9></a> If we go on this line we shall condemn the world.<a name=341:10></a> I believe that judgment is coming on the world, and if occupied with saving myself and others, necessarily in so doing I condemn the world, without having any definite intention as to it.<a name=341:11></a> We see thus how deliverance comes in: first, we have accepted death; (2) we have got out of sight; and (3) we are apart from the course of things here.<a name=341:12></a> I am thankful to be apart from the current of this world, and as I go on I feel more and more that the only man effective for God here is a Nazarite.<a name=341:13></a> He does not come at the things of death; he does not give himself up to earthly joys and proprieties, not even to those things to which he might be naturally entitled.<a name=341:14></a>

		This is not strictly a doctrinal epistle, it is more occupied with the mind and spirit of the saints.<a name=347:1></a> We do not find in it the unfolding of divine counsel; it supposes people to be in the light of that, and speaks of the experience down here answering to it.<a name=347:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Had anything special called it out?<a name=347:3></a> -- Yes, the fellowship of the Philippians with the apostle in the gospel.<a name=347:4></a> There was a great contrast between the Philippians and the Corinthians in relation to Paul.<a name=347:5></a> One thing that shewed where the Corinthians were spiritually, was their lack of sympathy with the Lord's work; they were too much taken up with themselves and their own importance.<a name=347:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was not the way in which the Philippians looked at Paul a great mark of their state?<a name=347:7></a> -- Yes, and we are tested to a large extent by our appreciation of those who are specially the vessels of God's testimony down here.<a name=347:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it because the men are identified with their teaching?<a name=347:9></a> -- Yes, with Paul it was remarkably so.<a name=347:10></a> Paul does not exactly take the ground of apostle here; he and Timothy were servants or saints.<a name=347:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is that so that we should not feel what is here to be beyond us?<a name=347:12></a> -- Paul was putting himself before the saints as an example, identifying himself with them on what was common ground, so that they might go on with him.<a name=347:13></a> Apostles were not very ecclesiastical as far as I can see.<a name=347:14></a> God-ward, they had the sense of what was committed to them, but they had much more pleasure in identifying themselves with the saints and

		the saints with them, than in being looked on as a distinct class.<a name=348:1></a> It was a trial to them to exercise authority, they had no pleasure in it: "We are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong".<a name=348:2></a> It is so contrary to the spirit of priest-craft, though they had the sense of their responsibility to be faithful and true in what was committed to them.<a name=348:3></a> I am certain that the New Testament, including all that was written to the churches, is much less ecclesiastical than we are accustomed to think.<a name=348:4></a> We on our part have been affected by habits of thought around us -- all that we have been brought up in.<a name=348:5></a> Naturally, we like ecclesiastical form; it is something in the eye of man that can exist apart from the spiritual condition that composes it.<a name=348:6></a> It suits man to have something to shew, but it is not the idea of Scripture; this epistle does not fit into it.<a name=348:7></a> Yet it recognises church order -- bishops and deacons.<a name=348:8></a> I think the point in those offices is not so much of office held, as moral and spiritual qualifications that fitted the holders for them.<a name=348:9></a> Christian fellowship is a most important principle in this world; it has its force in a scene where there are contrary elements.<a name=348:10></a> I do not think the idea of fellowship would come in if there was nothing to hinder or oppose.<a name=348:11></a> The greater the opposition, the stronger the fellowship.<a name=348:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In what way does this epistle follow Ephesians?<a name=348:13></a> -- You get the marks in it of a person who has entered into Ephesians, having one object -- the practical setting aside of oneself, having no selfish interests to serve.<a name=348:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Should we have more fellowship if we were more firmly established in the truth of Christ's rejection?<a name=348:15></a> -- Yes, and if we felt more the strength of Christian bonds we should be more conscious of the contrariety.<a name=348:16></a> Organisation is man's work, fellowship is of the Spirit.<a name=348:17></a> The Philippians had ministered to Paul, shewing practically their fellowship in his service and testimony, and what they had done calls forth what the apostle says here.<a name=348:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Does not spiritual life in a Christian involve fellowship?<a name=349:3></a> -- Yes, I think so.<a name=349:4></a> In Old Testament times there was no fellowship exactly, or at all events in a very limited sense, as in Malachi; fellowship came in with the gospel.<a name=349:5></a> Christ was rejected, and certain people who believed in Him were bound together in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.<a name=349:6></a> Christianity has become nationalised, and the idea of fellowship thoroughly lost.<a name=349:7></a> That which was national rejected the Holy Spirit, the only true bond of fellowship.<a name=349:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is not verse 6 sometimes used of people who have been born again to shew they will be brought into the full light of the gospel?<a name=349:9></a> -- I do not think it refers exactly to that, for the Philippians were Christians who had made some progress; the expression applies to advanced Christians, and is connected with their going on well.<a name=349:10></a> It was a delight to the heart of the apostle to see saints identified with the testimony.<a name=349:11></a> Every Israelite was connected with the tent of the testimony, and this is what marked the Philippians.<a name=349:12></a> You get the same idea in 2 Timothy: "Be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel".<a name=349:13></a> The gospel was not in prosperity then.<a name=349:14></a> There had been a time when, in a sense, it was so, as at Ephesus; but now the apostle was bound, and it was the time of the afflictions of the gospel.<a name=349:15></a> At Ephesus the power of the testimony seemed to be carrying all before it, but at the time the apostle was now writing the gospel had come into reproach.<a name=349:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is the reproach known today?<a name=349:17></a> -- I think so.<a name=349:18></a> The signs and wonders had in measure passed away, and so the advantages to man were in that sense gone.<a name=349:19></a> If the Philippians were identified with the suffering, they had the grace, too (verse 7).<a name=349:20></a>

		Is the connection in verse 9 that they might understand the state of things?<a name=350:1></a> -- I think so; some were preaching Christ out of contention.<a name=350:2></a> It supposes a mixed state of things that called for the exercise of spiritual judgment on the part of saints.<a name=350:3></a> There are a great many things that seem plausible enough at first sight, but when you get a little deeper you find you cannot go with them.<a name=350:4></a> We have to approve the "things that are more excellent"; but love is to abound.<a name=350:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Does this shew that the affections being right is a great matter in testing things?<a name=350:6></a> -- Yes; love, or what is often called love, might pass over many things, but in the things of God this cannot be.<a name=350:7></a> There must be pure and holy love that does not pass over what is unsuited to God.<a name=350:8></a> When you have come to love you have come to what God is, and that is holy love; love is something pleaded as a ground for passing over all kinds of things.<a name=350:9></a> You get no enlargement in the love of God till the foundation of righteousness is laid in the soul.<a name=350:10></a> If a man talks much about his love to God without a solid foundation of righteousness, I do not believe in it a bit.<a name=350:11></a> Love does not want to bring sins into the light of judgment, but it is not indifferent about them.<a name=350:12></a>

		Verse 7.<a name=350:13></a> They had the apostle in their hearts when he was in bonds.<a name=350:14></a> I suppose his prayers went up for them, and they were all partakers of his grace.<a name=350:15></a> If you are identified with the work of God and those who are carrying it on, you will be partaking of the grace; but it is impossible to define how this works.<a name=350:16></a> You could not be in fellowship and contact with the servants without being more or less partakers of their grace.<a name=350:17></a> I desire to be in company with those who are in the testimony for the moment, for there <i>is</i> a testimony for the moment, and it is not revivalism!<a name=350:18></a> We must admit that the Lord has a mind about things at any given moment.<a name=350:19></a> There is something down here, small enough perhaps, but that which meets the mind of the

		Verse 10.<a name=351:3></a> "Sincere" is, without mixture, pure, unalloyed.<a name=351:4></a> It is more difficult now than in that day; the difficulties now are enormous.<a name=351:5></a> Things were much more declared in that day; but when Christianity is nationalised, it is far more difficult to judge the path.<a name=351:6></a> You are insensibly influenced by what is around -- you cannot help it.<a name=351:7></a> We have not persecution, but we are in the greatest possible danger of being demoralised; it is so very easy to drop down to a lower level and to maintain orthodoxy and proprieties.<a name=351:8></a> I do not believe one of us is safe from this if not conscious of being in the mind of the Lord for the moment.<a name=351:9></a> There is no moment in the history of the professing church as to which the Lord has not revealed His mind.<a name=351:10></a>

		Verse 13.<a name=351:11></a> "My bonds in Christ are manifest".<a name=351:12></a> It is beautiful to see that the apostle was vindicated in that way; he was not looked at as being bound as a malefactor.<a name=351:13></a> The effect was to give confidence to the brethren.<a name=351:14></a> If a man is going on right God will vindicate him, and not allow him to be looked upon as an evil-doer.<a name=351:15></a>

		Do you think it was the grace of the apostle that made him say Christ was preached?<a name=354:5></a> -- I think so; but I do not suppose they preached Christ as he preached Him, but more in connection with Judaism -- a Jewish faction in the church -- man's own will in a certain line.<a name=354:6></a> Christ was preached, but there must have been some qualification or dilution of the gospel if preached of envy and strife.<a name=354:7></a> The apostle uses two strong expressions: "not sincerely" and "in pretence".<a name=354:8></a> You can see now that a great deal of very specious work, which passes with many, comes from motives not quite pure; there is a great deal of activity, and people are often uncommonly active if a little bit twisted.<a name=354:9></a> I can understand the Jewish faction at Rome taking the opportunity to bring in legalism, as at the present day.<a name=354:10></a> They say, Christ kept the law for you; but if so, you are under law.<a name=354:11></a> One sees the sort of place Christ has in such teaching as that; no death and resurrection, no setting aside of man after the flesh.<a name=354:12></a> The object, to a large extent, is to make room for clergy; but the truth is, Christians are priests only as risen with Christ.<a name=354:13></a> It has interested me that the attestation of priesthood was the budding of Aaron's rod -- resurrection -- and if you are sons of Aaron you too must be of that order.<a name=354:14></a> I think verse 18 has been used to keep people a little in bondage -- that if Christ is preached you must accept the preaching.<a name=354:15></a> The motives from which the preaching sprang could not have given Paul satisfaction; if a testimony to Christ, it must have been very low down.<a name=354:16></a> I do not suppose they testified very much that the first man had gone in

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter the principles of life and death are the great point.<a name=359:3></a> In one sense we die out of sight, but it is that we may come out in another light altogether, in another colour; not that people could understand it.<a name=359:4></a> It is not here a question of a Christian's everyday life and duties, but of his testimony.<a name=359:5></a> Everyday life has to be carried on, and we have to take up a variety of things down here.<a name=359:6></a> But that is not the point of this chapter -- it is not even like Romans, where the ordering of the world is recognised; but it is the testimony of the Christian, the principles of which are death and life.<a name=359:7></a> You die out in obedience, but you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, and the effect is that you come out in a new colour, holding forth the word of life -- the testimony.<a name=359:8></a> If I wanted to find out what a Christian is to be in his everyday life among men, I should hardly look to Philippians for it, but rather to Romans; but if I wanted to know what a Christian should be as dead to the world, I should turn to Philippians.<a name=359:9></a> You would not come out in this way unless you had learned something of Romans.<a name=359:10></a> It is the practical getting out of sight.<a name=359:11></a> In Romans it is a question, to a large extent, of deliverance from sin; but it goes further here -- it is coming out in a new way, "blameless and harmless" as children of God.<a name=359:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it collective?<a name=359:13></a> -- Yes, I think so.<a name=359:14></a> The point of the apostle is, while recognising the great encouragement he had had from the Philippians, that they should complete his joy, that there should be complete oneness; it is, I judge, the idea of collective testimony.<a name=359:15></a>

		Is the maintenance of unity essential to it?<a name=360:6></a> -- There could be no collective testimony without it.<a name=360:7></a> At Philippi there was a little jarring, not complete unity, and so Paul says, "Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded".<a name=360:8></a> I see three points in John's gospel: (1) Life, which is individual, and connects itself with the wilderness; it begins there; (2) Unity; (3) Fruit.<a name=360:9></a> Up to chapter 6 it is all life, but not out of the wilderness -- the bread, the manna; but in chapter 10 the point is unity: one flock, one Shepherd.<a name=360:10></a> Then chapter 15 is fruit, which connects itself with this chapter; it is what you get here.<a name=360:11></a> In order for fruit there must be unity; if anything interferes with that, there will not be fruit.<a name=360:12></a> Fruit is the evidence of life, it is the spontaneous product of life in healthy conditions.<a name=360:13></a> As surely as possible in a tree, <i>if</i> there be life in a healthy condition, fruit is the spontaneous product; but you may be sure of this, if not of one mind there will not be much fruit -- there is a hindrance to affection.<a name=360:14></a> Still, what comes out is, that you have to get out of sight as to all you are in your own eyes, and that is not so easy; for there is not one of us but attaches a certain importance to himself -- you are something in your own eye.<a name=360:15></a> But all that has to go, and that is why Christ is brought in, for whether in the form of God or the form of a servant, He made nothing of Himself if one may venture to say it of Him.<a name=360:16></a> It is very humiliating for a man to be nothing in his own eyes.<a name=360:17></a>

		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following Notes on the Epistle to the Hebrews having been read with profit by one and another into whose hands they have come are now presented in print, in the hope and confidence that they may be serviceable to the people of God.<a name=405:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be observed that gaps appear in regard to portions of the epistle where Notes were not taken.<a name=405:2></a> These are chapter 1 and chapter 11 from verse 17 to end.<a name=405:3></a> A few remarks in reference to these passages may with advantage be made by way of introduction.<a name=405:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 1 presents to us the truth of a heavenly Christ instead of an earthly Messiah, beyond which the thoughts of Jews had hardly reached.<a name=405:5></a> The quotations in the chapter, taken almost exclusively from the Psalms, present to us the more excellent name (than angels) which He has inherited.<a name=405:6></a> We see in them all that which is under the eye of God in Christ -- like the ark of the covenant in the holiest -- when purgation has been made of sins.<a name=405:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The quotations begin with setting forth One who is of God's nature and is viewed as in the relationship of Son to Him -- who is the object of homage to angels -- whose everlasting throne is based on proved discrimination between righteousness and iniquity -- and who, in contrast to all created things, remains the same, and His years do not fail.<a name=405:8></a> For the time all is hid in Him in the place which He as man is called to occupy provisionally at the right hand of God, but will be displayed when the moment shall have come for His foes to be made His footstool.<a name=405:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that has been noticed above is, as we have seen, established on testimonies drawn from the Old Testament scriptures.<a name=406:1></a> But the great additional light shines in this chapter that the One who has inherited the more excellent name is "the Son" by whom God has spoken in these last days.<a name=406:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have before us that blessed divine Person who, being the effulgence of the glory and the exact expression of His substance, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.<a name=406:3></a> Such is the apostle -- the speaker, in contrast to prophets; and it is evident from the fact of who He is that He must have the last word -- no one can speak after Him.<a name=406:4></a> Hence the appeal is final; and it may also be added that speaking from heaven (not from mount Sinai) He brings to light all the counsel of God.<a name=406:5></a> "He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.<a name=406:6></a> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you".<a name=406:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It needs not to say much in regard to chapter 11.<a name=406:8></a> The thought will be found expressed in the notes that every individual testimony of faith will have its answer in the world to come.<a name=406:9></a> Saints before the flood received light as to the principles on which the world to come is founded, <i>viz</i>.<a name=406:10></a>, acceptance through sacrifice, translation to heaven, and preservation through judgment.<a name=406:11></a> The promises refer in their full scope to the world to come; and the ground from Egypt to Canaan, traversed by Moses and the children of Israel, will never be trodden by them again.<a name=406:12></a> When the Lord comes He meets the Jew in the land.<a name=406:13></a> All the worthies died in faith, not having received the promises, though persuaded of them; but without us they were not to be made perfect.<a name=406:14></a>

		CHAPTER 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Down to verse 4 we still have the thought of the apostle, then verse 5 introduces the world to come, in connection with the purpose of God, which has been put under the Son of man.<a name=407:1></a> In chapter 1 the point is the greatness of the apostle.<a name=407:2></a> Then we get the greatness of what has been spoken, which introduces the thought of the Son of man.<a name=407:3></a> The Son is the Apostle.<a name=407:4></a> God had spoken in times past by prophets, now by the Son.<a name=407:5></a> The idea is that the communication is characterised by the greatness of the speaker.<a name=407:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "world to come" is the special subject of testimony, that of which the epistle speaks -- not the world that is.<a name=407:7></a> All the truth unfolded in Hebrews with regard to saints has reference, I judge, to the world to come.<a name=407:8></a> The holiest belongs properly to the world to come, to the time of Christ.<a name=407:9></a> We get heavenly blessing in anticipation, on the principle of 'which gives us now as heavenly light what soon will be our part'.<a name=407:10></a> From the fact of the world to come not being yet established publicly, if we enter now into what will be the heavenly part of it we must go outside the camp.<a name=407:11></a> We are partakers of the heavenly calling.<a name=407:12></a> There is a heavenly and there is an earthly calling in connection with the world to come.<a name=407:13></a> We, as believers, have the privilege in anticipation; in heaven we shall be in the actuality of the blessing.<a name=407:14></a> Privilege is that which belongs to me, but I may not always be in a state to enjoy it.<a name=407:15></a> We do not speak of privilege in heaven -- there all will be actuality.<a name=407:16></a>

		It is interesting to see that the great salvation began to be spoken by the Lord.<a name=407:17></a> "Great salvation" refers, I suppose, to all that has been effected for saints in the way of deliverance, and which is made good by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=407:18></a> The Lord began to speak of it.<a name=407:19></a> He spoke of the coming of the Comforter, the promise of the Father.<a name=407:20></a> Then the Holy Spirit came;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a real object in deliverance, and that is that you may enter into God's purpose concerning you.<a name=408:9></a> The divine end is that the soul of the believer may be so at liberty as that he may enter into the enjoyment of his true place with God: we are often greatly hampered by sin, the law, and the world.<a name=408:10></a> The Jews had not got salvation from the Roman power, it was salvation for their souls -- that Christ was the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth; He had come to give salvation to His people by forgiveness of their sins.<a name=408:11></a> The great idea of salvation is that you are saved <i>from</i> something.<a name=408:12></a> "The knowledge of salvation .<a name=408:13></a>.<a name=408:14></a>.<a name=408:15></a> by the remission of their sins" refers to what you are saved <i>from</i>.<a name=408:16></a> Faith would embrace more and take in all you are brought to.<a name=408:17></a> Salvation is the emancipation of the soul from all that could be between it and God.<a name=408:18></a> We get salvation as to the moral part before it is applied to the material part; we get the soul salvation first.<a name=408:19></a> The first thing is to get the soul freed from the judgment of God.<a name=408:20></a> Afterwards it may learn that it is freed from sin, law, the world.<a name=408:21></a> It is of great interest to see that the great salvation began to be spoken by the Lord, and had its climax in

	<div class="paragraph">
		The human mind cannot take in all as to Christ at one and the same moment, as for instance the truth of chapters 1 and 2 of Hebrews; we have to learn it in detail.<a name=410:10></a> It is a great thing for our souls to be in the light of Jesus crowned with glory and honour, in the highest place as man.<a name=410:11></a> If this is so it bodes good for man.<a name=410:12></a> It is bound to have a great effect upon us if we are in the light of it.<a name=410:13></a> If He takes that place in heaven as Man He must have companions.<a name=410:14></a> "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one".<a name=410:15></a> The purposes of God existed before sin came in, but before they could be effectuated the Son of man must be in this place in heaven.<a name=410:16></a> Angels are the highest of created beings, Jesus "made lower" is simply that He became Man.<a name=410:17></a> We have never yet heard of an angel being placed in a position corresponding to that in which God placed man -- and in the world to come all things, including angels, are put under the Son of man.<a name=410:18></a>

		In the previous chapter we had the thought of "fled for refuge", that is the entrance of the soul on to new ground -- the ground of divine counsel; leaving the ground of responsibility, where for the Jew all was lost, to enter on that new ground.<a name=438:1></a> Now we get what is exceedingly important, the new order of priest; the order of the priesthood determines everything.<a name=438:2></a> I do not think the priest could be beyond the people as regards his order.<a name=438:3></a> Aaron was taken from among men, he had honour put upon him, but he could not be beyond the people, or he could not properly have represented them; and so, if you get a change of order, it involves a great deal as to those represented by the priest, a change of order as regards them, too.<a name=438:4></a> The priest is not of one order and we of another.<a name=438:5></a> He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one.<a name=438:6></a> When you come to the priesthood, you are on the ground of appropriation.<a name=438:7></a> When Christ as Apostle is making known the mind of God, you listen; but when you come to the Priest, you appropriate, or, using the figure of John, you eat.<a name=438:8></a> Our entering in to our proper place according to God's thoughts depends on our appropriation.<a name=438:9></a> In the measure in which we appropriate the Priest we enter into our calling.<a name=438:10></a>

		<a class="footnote" name="#472:f1"><sup>+</sup></a>Explanatory Note. -- As to @Ephesians 2, the statement in that chapter is clearly of what God by His power had effected in the saints: He had, as is seen also in Colossians, quickened them together with Christ. In referring to it, my point was to show what it is in which this is displayed. Evidently the first point is that Christ risen is the centre and ground on which all is formed. Then we stand associated with Him, a heavenly band. We have (conscious of His love) appropriated Him in what He is to God as risen from the dead, and thus live together with Him God-ward in love (see chapter 1: 4). It may be said that this is mixing up what is, in a sense, experience, with the power of God, but I think that the result of God's work is viewed, as a whole, in Ephesians: the fruit and effect of His power working where nothing was but death, and producing a result suitable and sufficient for Himself. It is seen in its full extent, and is what is true in principle in all Christians, though not realised by all.

		The only place in which Christ is known here is outside the camp, and that is reproach -- the reproach of having suffered outside the gate.<a name=485:8></a> Man put Him outside, but He took that place, and He can have no place here but through judgment.<a name=485:9></a> This chapter is the answer to chapter 10.<a name=485:10></a> If we go in we cannot evade the reproach of Christ.<a name=485:11></a> Christ is accepted in the holiest, but He is in reproach here.<a name=485:12></a> Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp: "go forth" is an injunction at a certain crisis.<a name=485:13></a> The Living Stone is disallowed of men, but accepted of God -- chosen of God and precious.<a name=485:14></a> The two things go together.<a name=485:15></a> It resolves itself into a question of going on with the first man or with the Second.<a name=485:16></a> Those who served the tabernacle had no business to take the place of reproach here, for the tabernacle service contemplated God being in relation with that order.<a name=485:17></a> If the camp were owned by God, it would be clearly wrong to go outside.<a name=485:18></a>

		Verse 14, "we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come", the Christian has the sense that there is nothing stable in this world -- no continuing city.<a name=487:15></a> A 'city' in our day has a cathedral and a charter; the idea of a 'city' is a political and ecclesiastical centre.<a name=487:16></a> Jerusalem was a 'city'.<a name=487:17></a> What is the charter in the coming City?<a name=487:18></a> "Jerusalem which is above is free".<a name=487:19></a> We are under grace.<a name=487:20></a> The mother represents the system under which you are, and that system is <i>grace</i>: it is the grace in which God is accomplishing His purpose.<a name=487:21></a> We are not under law but under grace.<a name=487:22></a>
