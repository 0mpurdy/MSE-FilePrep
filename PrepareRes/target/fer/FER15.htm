		Death is God's judgment, the <i>fear</i> of death is in the hands of the devil and salvation removes this fear.<a name=2:17></a> The purpose of the gospel is to bring salvation to man, so that he may be delivered from his enemies and set free to serve God.<a name=2:18></a> Every intelligent being ought to serve God.<a name=2:19></a> God is entitled to the service of every man.<a name=2:20></a> Anyone who has apprehended the grace of God will desire to serve God.<a name=2:21></a> Salvation is an effective thing -- it is a question of realisation.<a name=2:22></a> The power and authority of the Lord are maintained in us by the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:23></a>

		Righteousness and salvation are coincident and contemporary -- this is an important point to remember.<a name=23:1></a> You get it in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51:5">Isaiah  51:5</a> - 6 -- all prove that God's righteousness and His salvation are parallel -- they run together.<a name=23:2></a> Salvation is one step further than righteousness.<a name=23:3></a> Righteousness is that we stand in relation to God morally.<a name=23:4></a> If a man is not in righteousness, he is in lawlessness.<a name=23:5></a> God has had in view that man may be brought morally into relation to Him.<a name=23:6></a> The point is to see it in <i>Christ</i>, not in Scripture.<a name=23:7></a> We are too doctrinal and we want to see it in Christ.<a name=23:8></a> The wonderful thing has come to pass that Christ is the revelation of God's righteousness and He is also our righteousness.<a name=23:9></a> God has made Him unto us righteousness.<a name=23:10></a> What is wanted is for people to apprehend things morally, that is, as they <i>must</i> be.<a name=23:11></a> The great point on the part of God was to declare His rights.<a name=23:12></a> Sin having come in, it became necessary for God to declare His rights and He has declared them in the righteous One.<a name=23:13></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>is the doctrine of it, but the reality of it is in Christ.<a name=23:14></a> God Himself took up man's liabilities and met them in the righteous One.<a name=23:15></a> That was His <i>grace</i> in order to enforce His righteousness and His righteousness is His rights.<a name=23:16></a> To assert and declare the righteousness of God and His rights are to govern the affections of His creatures.<a name=23:17></a> Until a man bows to the grace of God he will never own the rights of God.<a name=23:18></a> The third chapter of Romans is more moral than judicial.<a name=23:19></a> God begins entirely <i>de novo</i> in Christ.<a name=23:20></a> The great point is that man should submit to the righteousness of God.<a name=23:21></a> If God had not approached man in <i>grace</i>, man would have had to come under judgment God acts for man and yet independent <i>of</i> man.<a name=23:22></a> It is the declaration of God's rights -- it is

		in Israel the idea of 'city'; and in David the idea of 'king'.<a name=59:1></a> Moses was king because he was the meekest man on earth.<a name=59:2></a> That is the proper characteristic of a king according to God.<a name=59:3></a> My object tonight is to try and show what the divine idea is in connection with each; how they are taken up in the New Testament and their application to us and their effect on us at the present time.<a name=59:4></a> I do not think they are much to us if they do not tend to establish and instruct us in divine purpose.<a name=59:5></a> Each of these thoughts are peculiarly applicable to us at the present time and test each one.<a name=59:6></a>

		God promised Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed.<a name=59:7></a> He gave to Abraham an inheritance referring to a country.<a name=59:8></a> He was called out by God from his country, kindred, and father's house, to a land which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance.<a name=59:9></a> There it is you begin to get the idea of country.<a name=59:10></a> It presents the idea of expanse.<a name=59:11></a> It is not exactly like a city.<a name=59:12></a> A city cannot exist by itself.<a name=59:13></a> It would be nothing without a country in length and breadth.<a name=59:14></a> There is room in the country for men to contemplate the beneficence of God.<a name=59:15></a> It no doubt came out in a special way in the promised land.<a name=59:16></a> The eyes of God on it marked it.<a name=59:17></a> The expanse is a witness to the goodness and beneficence of God.<a name=59:18></a> There was room for it to be enjoyed.<a name=59:19></a> There is a great deal more but you can accept that much.<a name=59:20></a>

		Now look at the 'city' for a moment.<a name=59:21></a> It is a place where religious and political elements combine.<a name=59:22></a> It is the seat of light and rule.<a name=59:23></a> The influence of London is felt all over England -- it must exercise immense influence.<a name=59:24></a> If everything is right in regard to the city the effect is felt throughout the country.<a name=59:25></a> Jerusalem became a city and had influence over the garden of God, which included all the surrounding nations.<a name=59:26></a> It was the city of light and rule.<a name=59:27></a> Light from God and rule had their influence in the city.<a name=59:28></a> Man has a city for his own glory and that city will most surely come under destruction.<a name=59:29></a> Babylon came under destruction never to be restored.<a name=59:30></a>

		Now as to 'king'.<a name=60:6></a> The king is the vessel of rule, not the seat of rule.<a name=60:7></a> The king is the representative of God for light and rule.<a name=60:8></a> When the kingdom was set up in the time of David, Nathan was prophet, Zadok was priest and David king.<a name=60:9></a> What God intended was set forth in three persons.<a name=60:10></a> They were not combined in one person, nor could they be.<a name=60:11></a> The prophet was a check on the king in order to bring the mind of God to bear on him.<a name=60:12></a> The king was always subject to the prophet.<a name=60:13></a> The king never takes priestly functions.<a name=60:14></a> The mind of God was expressed in the three persons.<a name=60:15></a> That is the Old Testament.<a name=60:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to come to the New Testament.<a name=60:17></a> But first as to Abraham -- he was not content with an earthly country; he sought a better, that is a heavenly country.<a name=60:18></a> He sought a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God.<a name=60:19></a> Abraham was familiar with the cities but he did not find a city on earth that had moral foundations; he looked for one which had foundations; the thought and aspiration of Abraham really went beyond what was of earth.<a name=60:20></a> The answer to that was "wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:16">Hebrews  11:16</a>.<a name=60:21></a> All that God spoke to Abraham about was earthly, yet his faith went out to the heavenly city.<a name=60:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is a little remarkable to notice how the thought of union appears through Scripture.<a name=113:1></a> You will find it pervading Scripture from the beginning.<a name=113:2></a> In the first great relationship formed was the thought of union; God made a woman and brought her to the man, and union was brought about.<a name=113:3></a> That thought came out very early in Scripture.<a name=113:4></a> Then the same thing came out in regard to Israel.<a name=113:5></a> God was a husband to them, but they were like an unfaithful wife.<a name=113:6></a> Then when we come down to our own time and the church, we get again the thought of union.<a name=113:7></a> It fills a large place in connection with christianity.<a name=113:8></a> In this chapter there is the thought of union -- to be married to another.<a name=113:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning God did not think it well that <i>man</i> should dwell alone.<a name=113:10></a> After the fall a husband becomes a necessity.<a name=113:11></a> It is from a husband we get support.<a name=113:12></a> Christ is that to us that we may bring forth fruit to God.<a name=113:13></a> Israel, too, will be brought back to their Husband, to Jehovah, that they may bring forth fruit to God.<a name=113:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This thought of union pervades Scripture, Christ as the Bridegroom.<a name=113:15></a> The Lord speaks of Himself in that character.<a name=113:16></a> "The bridegroom cometh".<a name=113:17></a> It is a very wide expression in regard to Christ.<a name=113:18></a> It is the One who comes to enter into relationship with what is for God down here, and all will obtain the moral support of the Bridegroom.<a name=113:19></a>

		Now I want to come to the point of this chapter.<a name=113:20></a> It is of all moment that we should bring forth fruit to God.<a name=113:21></a> God looks for fruit.<a name=113:22></a> The Lord cursed the fig-tree, but there was fruit to be found for God.<a name=113:23></a> Now the mystery is solved and we know the secret through which fruit is brought forth.<a name=113:24></a> No one would contest for a moment that it is suitable that there should be fruit for

		Now there is another thing God has in view, and that is that He has the purpose to deliver us, to detach us from all those things by which men are bound.<a name=114:24></a> If there is attachment on the one hand, God is working equally on the other hand to bring about detachment.<a name=114:25></a> Souls are drawn to Christ but there is another object in view, they are to be delivered from this present evil world.<a name=114:26></a> Christ died for our sins; He was the blessed expression of grace and truth, but with the end in view that He might deliver us from this present world according to the will of God and our Father.<a name=114:27></a> I could not impress upon you too strongly what this world is in the eye of God.<a name=114:28></a>

		Now the real secret of all deliverance lies in the Spirit of God, or attachment to Christ.<a name=115:9></a> It is only in that way that any of us is kept in this world.<a name=115:10></a> We are kept on the principle of attachment to Christ.<a name=115:11></a> The one who is true to Christ is not prepared to go on in sin.<a name=115:12></a> He will not be lawless, but duly subject to Christ, walking here under the rule of Christ.<a name=115:13></a> That is where we want to be found down here.<a name=115:14></a> People try all kinds of experiments to escape the world, but they do not succeed.<a name=115:15></a> But the divine way is for people to be kept in their souls, and the principle is attachment to Christ.<a name=115:16></a> A faithful wife's constant thought is fidelity to her husband.<a name=115:17></a>

		The moment He became Man there was a new outset; there was a sun appointed in regard of the moral universe.<a name=134:1></a> The day began to dawn; you have One in whose heart is the rule of God.<a name=134:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the law of God is love.<a name=134:3></a> "Thy law is within my heart".<a name=134:4></a> The object of that was that He might give the rule to the universe which God intends to bring to pass.<a name=134:5></a> In the presence of that great light all life is developed.<a name=134:6></a> When the appointed light comes in then He communicates the Spirit of life, that in the presence of light there might be life.<a name=134:7></a> The day has begun.<a name=134:8></a> The One in whose heart is God's rule -- that Man has come in, who will give the law to the Jew and to the nations; He gives now the law to the church.<a name=134:9></a> It is God's law; the law of love, which is to rule, and in the presence of that everything is to be subdued.<a name=134:10></a> Just as the light of the sun is great enough to fill the world, so Christ is great enough to fill all things.<a name=134:11></a> He is exalted far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.<a name=134:12></a> The apostle John says that if all that Christ had done were recorded, the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.<a name=134:13></a> Christ is the great appointed light, and with the introduction of the light a new order of things has come to pass.<a name=134:14></a> A man is brought upon the scene who has accomplished redemption so that God may take up His rights, and in whom God can give the law to the moral universe.<a name=134:15></a>

		It seems to me strange if God cannot bring in a better order of things than what exists now in the world.<a name=134:16></a> "The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life" are the things which rule man, and give birth pretty much to the strife which is upon earth.<a name=134:17></a> I defy the most acute man to find out the rights and wrongs, politically, of anything in the world.<a name=134:18></a> God will introduce a world of His own; but then that world will have its own proper character of righteousness.<a name=134:19></a> The day has begun, the darkness is passing, and the true light now shines, and the appointed light is great

		I desire to draw attention to the place of christians as companions of Christ, for it is a point of the greatest moment for us to apprehend.<a name=136:1></a> I shall be able to shew you that a very great deal depends upon it, not only for us, but for God.<a name=136:2></a> A very important place is filled by the companions of Christ in the course of divine dealings, in that in them the continuity of the ways of God is maintained.<a name=136:3></a> If I judge for others by myself, this has a great effect in establishing our souls in the truth.<a name=136:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that there can be no lapse in the ways of God.<a name=136:5></a> Everything must be maintained for Him, and He has His own way of maintaining all.<a name=136:6></a> Things may appear to us to go to the bad, for if God takes up a people and they do not answer to His mind, He will set them aside.<a name=136:7></a> This is what He has done, and will do, but for all that He preserves the continuity of His ways.<a name=136:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two principles of God which underlie the whole of Scripture: that is, He works out His purpose, but never gives up responsibility on the part of man.<a name=136:9></a> His purposes are not dependent on the responsibility of man.<a name=136:10></a> He has His own way of working them out; but, at the same time, He retains man in responsibility, and, so far as I understand things, the wisdom of God is apprehended in seeing these two most important principles maintained by God in His ways.<a name=136:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We all see the lapse of Israel after the flesh, but the Israel of God is maintained in the companions of Christ, so that there is really no lapse.<a name=136:12></a> God had His own way before Him, and, if there was an apparent lapse in the ways of God, He knew how the continuity was to be maintained; I am going now to shew how the Israel of God is maintained in the companions of Christ.<a name=136:13></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That we are companions of Christ is a truth of profound moment to us.<a name=137:1></a> The Lord said to His disciples, "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations".<a name=137:2></a> Now we are the companions of Christ in the time of His rejection.<a name=137:3></a> Whatever may be our position and connections in this world, if they are of the most exalted kind, nothing can compare with the idea of companions of Christ, "For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end".<a name=137:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very evident that if Christ has companions they must take their character from Him.<a name=137:5></a> In a family where the eldest child has brothers and sisters, they are his companions, and will be very largely influenced by him, the first-born.<a name=137:6></a> And so, too, in companies on earth, there is commonly a leader who influences and gives character to his companions.<a name=137:7></a> Now that is the case with us when we take Christ into account; Christ has ability, not only to influence His companions, but to make His companions answer to Himself.<a name=137:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important for us to see that everything must in result be for God, and that is assured in the fact that Christ is the Head and centre of the moral universe which is of and for God: the universe of bliss.<a name=137:9></a> From the position He occupies in the ways of God, of necessity everything must be for God.<a name=137:10></a> You may test that as you like.<a name=137:11></a> There is no principle of truth with which we are familiar but has its first application to Christ Himself.<a name=137:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will take up one or two points in connection with that.<a name=137:13></a> I do not, for the moment, refer to what is moral, but to what is more material.<a name=137:14></a> I take up the thought of the world -- all is for Christ.<a name=137:15></a> Every part of the creation was for Him.<a name=137:16></a> He was the Creator of all things, and in that connection we get the statement: "All things have been created by him and for him".<a name=137:17></a> He is the "image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation".<a name=137:18></a> Creation was for Him.<a name=137:19></a> God placed Adam in the midst of it in the first instance, with dominion over it; but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=138>[Page 138]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all things were created not only by Christ, but for Him.<a name=138:1></a> It was ever in the divine purpose that Christ should become Man, and all was formed in view of His becoming Man and occupying the place, as in the counsels of God, of the Head of the universe of bliss.<a name=138:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is confirmed in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>and 5.<a name=138:3></a> In chapter 4 all creation is taken up by Christ as Creator, as having been created for Him.<a name=138:4></a> All were created for His pleasure, and He takes up creation on that ground.<a name=138:5></a> In chapter 5 He takes all up on the ground of redemption.<a name=138:6></a> He is the Lamb, that was slain, in the midst of the throne.<a name=138:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is the Heir of all things.<a name=138:8></a> God created the worlds by Him, and, in order that He might take up the inheritance, redemption was accomplished, and has its application thus to Christ Himself.<a name=138:9></a> The same thing is true with regard to the accomplishment of righteousness.<a name=138:10></a> It was accomplished for Christ that, the lawless man having been removed from under God's eye, He might be the Sun of righteousness.<a name=138:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I come to a narrower circle: Israel.<a name=138:12></a> The point with Israel was, that they were God's house.<a name=138:13></a> You get that thought in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:8">Exodus  25:8</a>: "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them".<a name=138:14></a> Also in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:16">2 Corinthians  6:16</a>: "for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people".<a name=138:15></a> These thoughts evidently had reference to Israel.<a name=138:16></a> God took them up to dwell among them and walk in them.<a name=138:17></a> Until you get the figure of redemption you do not find the thought of God dwelling among men.<a name=138:18></a> He visited man, like Abraham, to communicate with Him; but there was no indication of His dwelling until there was the figure of redemption.<a name=138:19></a> Israel was taken up provisionally in order that the purpose of God might be accomplished.<a name=138:20></a> God did not dwell among them nakedly, that is, without a temple, because they were taken up after the flesh.<a name=138:21></a> Israel had a national calling,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=139>[Page 139]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and the highest point of it was, that God would dwell among them.<a name=139:1></a> All the material of the tent of meeting was taken from the people to construct the tabernacle; that is, God came as close to them as it was possible for Him to come under the circumstances, and it was intended that they were to be affected by that.<a name=139:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that Israel was really called out for Christ: just as creation was made for Him and by Him.<a name=139:3></a> They were God's inheritance, which was to be taken up in due time in Christ.<a name=139:4></a> Christ came to His own, but His own received Him not, and hence we get the end of Israel after the flesh, but not the end of Israel according to the purpose of God.<a name=139:5></a> All connection with Christ after the flesh terminated in His rejection.<a name=139:6></a> Israel lost the place they had provisionally, because they did not receive Christ.<a name=139:7></a> That is referred to in Isaiah, and whilst there is a lapse as after the flesh, yet God has taken care that there is no real lapse.<a name=139:8></a> What was lost in Israel was secured in the companions of Christ, the children given to Him: "Behold I and the children which Jehovah hath given me;" they were for signs and portents, they were given to Christ in the time of the hiding of the face of Jehovah from both the houses of Israel, and in them you get the true Israel.<a name=139:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find a confirmation of that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>.<a name=139:10></a> Israel had been the vine, but the Lord said to the disciples, "I am the true vine .<a name=139:11></a>.<a name=139:12></a>.<a name=139:13></a> ye are the branches".<a name=139:14></a> We have the same thought continued, though not in connection with the vine, in verse 7: "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you".<a name=139:15></a> That is, the thought of fruit-bearing is maintained in that which was before God as the true Israel: the children which God gave to Christ; thus the continuity of things is preserved in the companions of Christ.<a name=139:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In them you get, for the time being, the Israel of God, and that thought is taken up in Hebrews.<a name=139:17></a> In the chapter which I read we get two points.<a name=139:18></a> The first is, that christians were God's house, and the second, that

		<a name=140>[Page 140]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		they were companions of Christ.<a name=140:1></a> In the gospels the thought of the companions of Christ comes out continually in connection with the disciples.<a name=140:2></a> The Lord says to them, "I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel".<a name=140:3></a> We see there that they had not lost their relation to Israel in being the companions of Christ.<a name=140:4></a> We all know that the beginning of the church was in a remnant of the Jews.<a name=140:5></a> God added the saved ones daily to the church, they were brought into the place of companions of Christ.<a name=140:6></a> There was no gentile as yet brought in, we do not get one until <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>, when Cornelius received the Spirit.<a name=140:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our place is that of companions of Christ because we have received Christ in the time of His rejection.<a name=140:8></a> That thought comes out in the beginning of John's gospel.<a name=140:9></a> "He came to his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God".<a name=140:10></a> We have the Holy Spirit's testimony to Christ in the time of His rejection, while He is hid from the world at the right hand of God, and by faith of it come into the place of His companions.<a name=140:11></a> God is bringing many sons to glory: He has revealed in this His thought and mind.<a name=140:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul says in Romans, "he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God".<a name=140:13></a> And in Philippians he says, "we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit".<a name=140:14></a> God has the circumcision, the true Israel, the true Jew, because all is found in the companions of Christ.<a name=140:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another interesting point in connection with this is that the companions of Christ, in the time of His glory, come out as the holy Jerusalem.<a name=140:16></a> The link with earth and Israel is not lost.<a name=140:17></a> The holy Jerusalem comes down

		from God, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed on the twelve gates of the city.<a name=141:1></a> Paul suffered for the truth and the hope of Israel, and we find these maintained now in the church.<a name=141:2></a> There will come the time when all Israel shall be saved: a nation will be born in a day, but, in the meantime, the true Israel is maintained in the companions of Christ.<a name=141:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The place which the heavenly Jerusalem occupies should, in a sense, have been occupied by Israel.<a name=141:4></a> The nations of the earth ought to have walked in the light of Israel, but what will come to pass is that they will walk in the light of the holy Jerusalem.<a name=141:5></a> She has the glory of God, and her light like unto a stone most precious, and the nations of the earth bring their glory and honour unto it.<a name=141:6></a> But all Israel will be saved.<a name=141:7></a> There will come the Deliverer out of Zion, and they will have their own proper connection with the heavenly city.<a name=141:8></a> Israel will be responsive to the heavenly city, while the nations will be responsive to Israel.<a name=141:9></a> That will be brought to pass when Christ is manifested in glory.<a name=141:10></a> In the meantime, we have the exalted Christ, the Head, the Sun of righteousness, the Beginning of the creation of God, and we are companions of Christ, in whom the truth and hope of Israel are maintained.<a name=141:11></a> We are brought into the light of the coming age.<a name=141:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can understand christianity who does not see that the real power of it lies in the anticipation of the coming age.<a name=141:13></a> The day has dawned, Christ shines upon us though the Sun of righteousness has not yet arisen with healing in His wings.<a name=141:14></a> When Christ shines upon us we get an apprehension of the whole system and order of things of which He is the Beginning and Head.<a name=141:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A first principle of this is that the truth and the hope of Israel are maintained in His companions.<a name=141:16></a> The Jew today calls himself a Hebrew and maintains Jewish traditions, but the hope of Israel is not found in him.<a name=141:17></a> He is self-seeking and pursuing worldly advantages, but Israel's hope is not there.<a name=141:18></a> The Jew after the flesh is

		lost in the world, and the truth of Israel according to God is maintained in the children given to Christ.<a name=142:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to what is to mark the companions of Christ: Christ is pre-eminent among them, that must be so in the very nature of things.<a name=142:2></a> Thou hast anointed him "with the oil of gladness above thy fellows".<a name=142:3></a> The house of God is, in a sense, for Christ, as being Son over it.<a name=142:4></a> Moses was a servant in it, and for him it was a test of faithfulness, but for Christ it is the sphere in which He is entitled to order all.<a name=142:5></a> That will expand as wide as the universe, because all things will, in a sense, form God's house, and in the universe of bliss Christ will order all things.<a name=142:6></a> In the meantime, we are His house, and there it is that Christ orders all according to God.<a name=142:7></a> There can be nothing which is according to God now save that which is of Christ.<a name=142:8></a> He is the one Man before God.<a name=142:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This will be verified even in Israel: Christ will give character to them when the law is written in their hearts.<a name=142:10></a> They will be according to God because they have taken character from Christ.<a name=142:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We get in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>the thought of the power of attraction in Christ: "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me".<a name=142:12></a> I should connect that with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>.<a name=142:13></a> The Lord recognises there His rejection by Israel, and consequent upon that you get the word: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<a name=142:14></a> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<a name=142:15></a> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light".<a name=142:16></a> Christ is the point of attraction now, the outset and Head of the world to come.<a name=142:17></a> He is the true Sun of righteousness, though not yet arisen with healing in His wings.<a name=142:18></a> It is not yet the moment of His coming in glory and dissipating the darkness, but the darkness is passing and the true light now shines.<a name=142:19></a> Christ has been lifted up, and draws all to Himself.<a name=142:20></a> There is a mighty, beneficent, moral influence

	<div class="paragraph">
		There comes a moment in the experience of people weary and heavy laden.<a name=143:2></a> They become jaded by life in the world, and it cannot satisfy; and God works so that people really become burdened; then it is that the Lord's word is heard, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest".<a name=143:3></a> No mere impostor or philosopher would ever have said that.<a name=143:4></a> Then He goes on to say, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me".<a name=143:5></a> He virtually says, 'I can come down to you'.<a name=143:6></a> There never was a man but He who was meek and lowly in heart.<a name=143:7></a> We have not to get up to Him, the difficulty for us is to get down.<a name=143:8></a> The qualities which were in Christ do not obtain in this world.<a name=143:9></a> The man who is meek and lowly in heart cannot be successful in the world because he has not the qualities for it.<a name=143:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a people here heavy laden like Israel in Egypt, and, for them, there is the One who has been lifted up from the earth: the magnet, the point of attraction for the heart: and He says, 'Take my yoke upon you, become my companions, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls'.<a name=143:11></a> If we are brought to that point we partake in the qualities which are suited to the house of God.<a name=143:12></a> That comes out clearly in Ephesians.<a name=143:13></a> In chapter 2 the saints are spoken of as being of the household of God, and in chapter 4 they are to be characterised by lowliness and meekness.<a name=143:14></a> The part of the Lord Jesus is, that He presents Himself to us as the point of attraction.<a name=143:15></a> Just as the sun is the point of attraction in the material system, so the Sun of righteousness is the seat of attraction and the power of it in the system which is, not material, but moral.<a name=143:16></a> He presents Himself to us, and in that way brings us into the place of companions with Himself.<a name=143:17></a> We are here sharing His rejection, and if we suffer with Him, we shall also be glorified together.<a name=143:18></a> That is the point to which we are brought now, suffering

		No power of evil can ever get christianity out of the world, because it depends upon the living Christ who has declared God, and God is declared in such a way that the word is irresistible.<a name=150:18></a> Men come to feel the need of what is presented in Christ: grace and truth.<a name=150:19></a> They are conscious of being infirm and sinful, and they want God; they feel that they are in the dark in regard of Him, and have need of the truth.<a name=150:20></a> From the moment that Christ came here to the present time the principle of testing has been going on in the world.<a name=150:21></a> Man will be tested to the end by Christ, and the result is, that while some are drawn to Christ, on the other hand, the testing makes man darker and worse than he was before.<a name=150:22></a> We have all been drawn to Christ by what is presented in Him.<a name=150:23></a> You may not have understood it, but when you heard the gospel He was drawing you to Himself.<a name=150:24></a> He is the magnet.<a name=150:25></a> Christianity depends upon the living Christ, who is the point of attraction to men.<a name=150:26></a> What is presented in Christ precisely meets the need of men,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The flock is not taken up on the ground of profession, it is that which God has purchased with the blood of His own.<a name=155:6></a> The thought in the early church was (and it succeeded only too well) to scatter the flock, that is, to destroy unity.<a name=155:7></a> If the enemy succeeded in doing that, he succeeded in destroying testimony.<a name=155:8></a> Unity was the testimony of the flock.<a name=155:9></a> The Lord prays in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=155:10></a> We are intended to be a testimony here for God.<a name=155:11></a> God was the Shepherd of Israel, and they should have been a testimony to Him.<a name=155:12></a>

		I have been endeavouring, on former occasions, to shew that things foreshadowed in God's dealings with Israel have their fulfilment in the church.<a name=157:1></a> We have been too much accustomed to think that the things there foreshadowed had reference only to Israel hereafter.<a name=157:2></a> My impression is that whatever came out had the church in view.<a name=157:3></a> The truth of the church was not made known; it was hid from ages and from generations; but it was in the mind of God, and everything was to have its place there.<a name=157:4></a> God made clear the end of Israel after the flesh in the prophetic books.<a name=157:5></a> It was made known that they would come under the curse of a broken law, and would be scattered over the face of the earth.<a name=157:6></a> But they would be gathered again by God, who would bring them into their own land and proper blessing.<a name=157:7></a> When that comes to pass Israel will take its character from the heavenly city, because the church has, in the meantime, come in as the centre of God's ways.<a name=157:8></a>

		It seems to me that the holy Jerusalem, the heavenly city, is really the Israel of God, and the Israel which will be upon earth will take its colour from that.<a name=157:9></a> The same principle will apply also as to the nations.<a name=157:10></a> They will walk in the light of the city.<a name=157:11></a> The connection of the church with Israel is carefully maintained; the twelve apostles were to sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, and yet their names are found in the foundations of the heavenly city; also on the gates of the city are written the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.<a name=157:12></a> The connection is very intimate between the church and Israel.<a name=157:13></a>

		God's house.<a name=158:1></a> God set up His dwelling-place among them, but the truth of the house is fulfilled in the church.<a name=158:2></a> I spoke, too, of the companions of Christ.<a name=158:3></a> It is in them that you get the thoughts of God fulfilled.<a name=158:4></a> Last time I took up the thought of the flock.<a name=158:5></a> Israel was God's flock.<a name=158:6></a> He led His people like a flock through the wilderness, but, after all, the truth of the flock is really fulfilled in the church.<a name=158:7></a> The Lord brings that out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>.<a name=158:8></a> Israel was God's flock, but they were limited to the fold, and the Lord came to lead His sheep out of the fold.<a name=158:9></a> The thought of the flock properly belongs to Israel, but we find it fulfilled in the church at the present time.<a name=158:10></a> Israel in the future will take colour from what is fulfilled in the heavenly city.<a name=158:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The dealings of God in the past were in shadow.<a name=158:12></a> There was no present fulfilment of the promises.<a name=158:13></a> Now we get every divine thought established in the church, and the church is the great light of the world to come.<a name=158:14></a> The heavenly city has the glory of God, and her light like unto a stone most precious, the saved nations walk in the light of it, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour unto it.<a name=158:15></a> No one can gainsay the immense importance, in the ways of God, of the heavenly city.<a name=158:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going now to take up other points, in connection with God's dealings with Abraham and Israel, which are gathered up in the church, and will be also fulfilled in Israel.<a name=158:17></a> Israel will have its part in them, but my point, for the moment, is that they are accomplished in the church, so that Israel hereafter will take its colour from the heavenly city.<a name=158:18></a> All these things of which I am going to speak belong to us, not in a public way, but they have come to us.<a name=158:19></a> They are hidden and unseen, but they are real: they come to us in such a real way, that they exercise the greatest influence over us.<a name=158:20></a>

		People are too prone simply to believe things.<a name=158:21></a> We must believe things which God has made known to us, but we must not end there.<a name=158:22></a> The point is, that whatever light God is pleased to give us should be operative in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two points before me are blessing in connection with Abraham, and liberty in connection with Israel.<a name=159:3></a> Liberty is in connection with sonship.<a name=159:4></a> This is introduced in the passage I have read.<a name=159:5></a> The first thought is connected with Abraham.<a name=159:6></a> It was promised to him that in him and in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed, and this is spoken of in Galatians as the blessing of Abraham.<a name=159:7></a> The blessing of Abraham had come to the gentiles in Christ Jesus.<a name=159:8></a> In the beginning of chapter 4 we get the reality of sonship.<a name=159:9></a> It had been God's thought in regard of Israel, and bondage was unsuitable to it.<a name=159:10></a> God said to Pharaoh, "Let my son go that he may serve me".<a name=159:11></a> It was inconsistent with the thought of God that His son should be in bondage, and therefore the charge to Pharaoh.<a name=159:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There we get sonship as the calling of Israel and the idea connected with sonship is the knowledge of God, so that one can serve God in holy liberty.<a name=159:13></a> If God is to be served, the one who serves Him must be clear of the bondage of evil.<a name=159:14></a> In the present time if a christian is in bondage to the world or to man he cannot serve God.<a name=159:15></a> He needs to be freed from bondage to Satan, the world, and man if he is to serve God.<a name=159:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things belong to Israel in a literal way.<a name=159:17></a> They will come hereafter into the blessing of Abraham, and will be brought into sonship that they may serve God in righteousness and holiness all the days of their life.<a name=159:18></a> In the coming day Israel will take its colour from the heavenly city, in which every thread of God's ways has been gathered up, for God's glory.<a name=159:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The blessing of Abraham entirely depended upon the <i>true</i> seed of Abraham, because man as such was really under the curse of God.<a name=159:20></a> The law brought man very definitely under the curse, but it was not required to bring man there.<a name=159:21></a> That was his place as the effect of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=160>[Page 160]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sin, and hence the introduction of the blessing depended upon the coming of the seed of promise.<a name=160:1></a> Abraham was called upon to offer up his son Isaac, and received him again from the dead in figure of resurrection, and then God confirmed the blessing in the seed.<a name=160:2></a> The reason was this, that man was morally at a distance, in darkness, and away from God.<a name=160:3></a> God had withdrawn from him.<a name=160:4></a> The effect of sin was to alienate man from God, but God withdrew Himself also from man, and man came into moral darkness.<a name=160:5></a> The legitimate effect of this is seen in the heathen.<a name=160:6></a> Man got into the darkness of heathenism, and, in a certain sense, was forsaken of God.<a name=160:7></a> God left the nations to go on in their own way, and they were under the curse of God.<a name=160:8></a> That was the true position of man by reason of sin.<a name=160:9></a> On the other hand, the idea of blessing is seen in God drawing nigh to man and making him conscious of His favour.<a name=160:10></a> Divine favour is the way in which blessing would be known to man.<a name=160:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the way that God took to accomplish that.<a name=160:12></a> Blessing was promised in the seed of Abraham; but that, of necessity, involved that the seed of Abraham must remove the curse.<a name=160:13></a> In the cross of Christ you get the complete setting aside of man.<a name=160:14></a> He is first set forth in his true position relatively to God.<a name=160:15></a> Christ on the cross demonstrated the true position of man.<a name=160:16></a> <i>He</i> was made a curse by being hanged on a tree, and was forsaken of God.<a name=160:17></a> What was forsaken of God was the man under curse.<a name=160:18></a> Christ in being hanged on a tree, represented man under the curse of God, which lay upon man in its reality.<a name=160:19></a> That was not simply the place of Israel, but of man.<a name=160:20></a> It was definitely the place of Israel, because they had brought themselves under a broken law; but what was true in the case of Israel was really true in regard of man universally.<a name=160:21></a> Every man is lawless, and Christ represented the lawless man under the curse of God.<a name=160:22></a> On the cross we get the demonstration of that.<a name=160:23></a> He was made a curse by being hanged on a

		tree, and entered into all the consequences of the place which He had taken.<a name=161:1></a> That is the explanation of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=161:2></a>" The forsaking was the forsaking of Christ as Man.<a name=161:3></a> It was the righteous One who was there; but, for the moment, He represented the lawless man.<a name=161:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What came to pass was this, that the lawless man was terminated.<a name=161:5></a> There was the end of the old man.<a name=161:6></a> "The truth is in Jesus" is the having put off the old man.<a name=161:7></a> There was the termination of the old man, in the ways of God, in the death of Christ.<a name=161:8></a> It was not simply that Christ was made a curse and entered into the condition in which man was, but He terminated that man in death.<a name=161:9></a> There was no revival of the victim: the priest was revived.<a name=161:10></a> Depend upon it that man after that order was never revived.<a name=161:11></a> The lawless man was terminated for God.<a name=161:12></a> That is one side of the truth.<a name=161:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is true on the other side?<a name=161:14></a> The blessed truth abides, that in Christ man is made nigh to God.<a name=161:15></a> He was raised again from the dead and is now the Head of every man.<a name=161:16></a> In Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and man is brought nigh to God in Christ, so that the curse is gone with the man that was under curse.<a name=161:17></a> Hence you get the blessing of God.<a name=161:18></a> You can see that at the close of the gospels, where the Lord comes into His own company.<a name=161:19></a> The lawless man was gone; and Christ was among them, and He brought God close to them.<a name=161:20></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>the Lord breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit".<a name=161:21></a> He brought God close to them in blessing, and they must have been conscious that God was nigh to them in favour.<a name=161:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3: 13, 14, we get two classes spoken of.<a name=161:23></a> It is said, "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law", and then, the blessing of Abraham come to the gentiles.<a name=161:24></a> Those redeemed from the curse of the law were the true remnant of Israel, and this was with the object that the blessing of Abraham might come to the gentiles.<a name=161:25></a> Blessing could not come to the gentiles without

		In resurrection Christ comes out into a wider sphere.<a name=162:9></a> The ministry of Christ was first to a people after the flesh, but in resurrection the ground is larger.<a name=162:10></a> He comes out as last Adam and second Man, and it is not simply to gather in the remnant of the Jews, but that the gentiles might be brought into common blessing with them.<a name=162:11></a> They come into the place of the companions of Christ.<a name=162:12></a> Those who believed in Christ were the children whom God gave to Him, and they could not be more than companions of Christ, and the gentiles too have that place: hence these are spoken of as "fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God".<a name=162:13></a> The blessing of Abraham has reached the gentiles in Christ Jesus.<a name=162:14></a> The reality of the blessing is assured to us in the gift of the Spirit.<a name=162:15></a> It is not only that the people of God are forgiven, but they are brought nigh in Christ Jesus, and the proof of it is in the gift of the Spirit.<a name=162:16></a> I can believe in the delight of the Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>in communicating to man the gift of the Spirit.<a name=162:17></a> It was the proof of what had come to pass, and God was brought nigh to them so that they might be conscious of the favour of God.<a name=162:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the other point -- namely, sonship.<a name=163:13></a> In the blessing of Abraham, God spoke to Abraham that he might have His way before him.<a name=163:14></a> I do not think that the blessing could be spoken of as fulfilled while God was dealing with man in the flesh, but it has now been brought to pass in Christ.<a name=163:15></a> He has necessarily brought God to man.<a name=163:16></a> God withdrew from man as the consequence of sin, but Christ has brought God to man, and made the consciousness of it effectual in the communication of the Spirit.<a name=163:17></a> But there is another thing, that is, of necessity Christ brings to man the knowledge of God, because in Him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell.<a name=163:18></a> The truth came out in Him as to what the Father was to the Son, and the Son to the Father.<a name=163:19></a> The love of God came out in Christ.<a name=163:20></a> God's nature was revealed in Him.<a name=163:21></a> The whole truth of God was revealed in Him.<a name=163:22></a> His body was the temple of God, and there was the setting forth of God in Him here.<a name=163:23></a> God was revealed that man might know Him, not simply in His

		And there is another thing in God, He is to be trusted, because there is nothing in Him contrary to His love.<a name=164:9></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal".<a name=164:10></a> The death of Christ was the expression of the love of God.<a name=164:11></a> Love would not tolerate the lawless man, and God in love removed him, that love might be effectual for man.<a name=164:12></a> The practical result of it is that in the knowledge of God, man is brought into sonship.<a name=164:13></a> God indicated that even in regard of Israel.<a name=164:14></a> Before ever they were put under law, He said, "Israel is my son, my firstborn".<a name=164:15></a> That will be fulfilled in Israel hereafter.<a name=164:16></a>

		If you turn for a moment to the prophet <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#3:4">Hosea  3:4</a>, it says, "For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days".<a name=169:5></a> There we get two things: they were to abide many days without a king; but in the latter days they would fear Jehovah and His goodness.<a name=169:6></a> They are to be so impressed by Jehovah and His goodness that they will fear Him in the latter days.<a name=169:7></a> I quote this to prove that Israel has now no national existence.<a name=169:8></a> They have no king, no prince, yet, as a matter of fact, God has every true principle connected with Israel before Him, and therefore He can present to us the reality of the world to come.<a name=169:9></a> Everything which is proper to and characteristic of the world to come God has before Him, and it says we have come to it.<a name=169:10></a> We have come to the apprehension of it, and that implies that we have the capability of apprehension.<a name=169:11></a>

		Now all this follows on the line that I have attempted to pursue; that is, to shew how God has been pleased to gather up every thread of His dealings in Christ and the church.<a name=169:14></a> The church is inseparable from Christ, and what is gathered up in Christ, of necessity, has its place in the church.<a name=169:15></a> The saints are united to Christ; therefore whatever is gathered up in Him must, of necessity, have its place in us.<a name=169:16></a>

		If you read from verse 18 to 21 you will find that everything is leading up to God, while in verses 22 to 24 everything is working down from God.<a name=170:1></a> We are come to mount Sion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, the general assembly, to the church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things than that of Abel.<a name=170:2></a>

		Apart from Israel and God's dealings with Israel, you could not understand these things.<a name=170:3></a> Every point that is touched upon here has some relation to God's dealings with Israel, and to the issue of His ways in reference to them; and yet, after all, these things are effected in Christ and the church.<a name=170:4></a> The least intelligent of us know how mount Sion is bound up with God's dealings with Israel.<a name=170:5></a> The allusion is probably to the bringing of the ark to mount Sion.<a name=170:6></a> The force of it is that, while everything has been forfeited by Israel on the ground of responsibility -- they are suffering the consequences of it at the present time -- yet, on the other hand, everything for God has been recovered in Christ.<a name=170:7></a> What has been forfeited by unfaithfulness on the part of Israel is recovered in Him.<a name=170:8></a> That is the principle of mount Sion.<a name=170:9></a> The people had lost the ark, and it was impossible for them to get it back, but God did so.<a name=170:10></a> He smote His enemies and put them to a perpetual shame, and the ark was brought back and placed on mount Sion.<a name=170:11></a> That is the first principle of God's dealings with regard to the recovery of Israel.<a name=170:12></a> It sets before us the thought that God has established all for Himself in Christ.<a name=170:13></a> Everything has been lost in man, but all is secured, in the sovereignty of divine mercy, in Christ, so that man should have part in it.<a name=170:14></a>

		Another point in the course of divine dealings with Israel is a city, and we are come to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=171:7></a> I understand a city to be symbolic of continuance and permanence.<a name=171:8></a> A tent is not that.<a name=171:9></a> When God tabernacled with the people in the wilderness He dwelt in a tent, and there was no pledge of continuance as they were.<a name=171:10></a> They were on the move toward the promised land, but in the promised land there was a city, a most important element in divine dealings in the world to come.<a name=171:11></a> God comes down to man in that way, to give to him the pledge of continuance and permanence in the order of things which belongs to the world to come.<a name=171:12></a>

		Now this is not the city of the great King, it is the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=171:13></a> Mount Sion and Jerusalem were most important factors in God's dealings with Israel.<a name=171:14></a> Jerusalem upon earth was called the city of the great King because it was David's city, and God takes it up on that account.<a name=171:15></a> David begged God to dwell in it, and He responded to the request of David; but it was not the city of the living God.<a name=171:16></a> We are come to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=171:17></a> It is the city of the living God because everything in it is living, and in that way answers to God.<a name=171:18></a> The city of the great king answered to David, the city of the living God answers to Him.<a name=171:19></a> Jerusalem in the future will answer to Christ, the great King.<a name=171:20></a>

		My thought is to enlarge a little on what is peculiar to the church: the privileges peculiar to it.<a name=191:1></a> I have attempted, in what has come before us from time to time, to shew how that in the church God has taken up every thread of His previous dealings.<a name=191:2></a> All the previous dealings of God had Christ and the church in view.<a name=191:3></a> That was a necessity, because there was nothing really accomplished in His dealings.<a name=191:4></a> Promises were made to Abraham, and certain things were conferred upon Israel, but there was nothing really accomplished or final: all had reference to things which were yet to come.<a name=191:5></a> Everything looked on to Christ and the church, where God purposed to gather up every thread of His previous dealings.<a name=191:6></a> You can understand that, in regard both to the promises, and to the kingdom, and to blessing, and to life; whatever was spoken of in that way was in anticipation of what God intended to establish in Christ and the church.<a name=191:7></a> There are other things which are yet to come to pass, but the first thing with God was, to gather up and establish all in Christ and His companions.<a name=191:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are also certain truths which are entirely peculiar to the church.<a name=191:9></a> The church, in the scheme of divine purpose, has its own place distinct from anything else, and it would be a very great pity to lose sight of that.<a name=191:10></a> In the Old Testament you find, in the headings of chapters, the idea that Israel was the church, but it is much more true that the church is really Israel: the Israel of God.<a name=191:11></a> The true Israel was the nucleus of the church: the beginning of it.<a name=191:12></a> God gathered the remnant of His people into the church, and they were the first-fruits.<a name=191:13></a> But we have to look at the church in the light of what it is to Christ.<a name=191:14></a> You can never learn what is peculiar to the church except by learning what the

	<div class="paragraph">
		church is in relation to Christ.<a name=192:1></a> That is what I want to come to now -- the church as the body and the bride of Christ.<a name=192:2></a> It never could be said that Israel had that place.<a name=192:3></a> It belongs to the church.<a name=192:4></a> So, too, the holy Jerusalem, the centre and joy of the heavenly land, is entirely peculiar to the church.<a name=192:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get here a remarkable expression; that is, He "gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=192:6></a> In the beginning of the next chapter we have the thought of union.<a name=192:7></a> This connects itself with the idea of the bride.<a name=192:8></a> In chapter 5 we read that "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish".<a name=192:9></a> There again is the thought of the bride.<a name=192:10></a> So, too, in the same connection, we learn that the Christ is the Head of the church, as the husband is the head of the wife.<a name=192:11></a> The husband being the head of the wife is the figure employed to shew the headship of Christ to the church.<a name=192:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very wonderful thing that the church should have the place of the bride of Christ, and it is impossible to understand that apart from the ways of God in Christ.<a name=192:13></a> If you are to enter into the idea of the church's place in relation to Christ you must know something of God's ways.<a name=192:14></a> In a way the church is necessary in order that those ways may become manifest.<a name=192:15></a>

		A point which I desire first to touch upon is the interchange of thought you get sometimes in Scripture.<a name=192:16></a> By way of illustration, we may turn to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=192:17></a> In the first ten verses we have a kind of appeal, taken up by David, to Jehovah, then in the eleventh and following verses we have the word of Jehovah.<a name=192:18></a> David was a remarkable man.<a name=192:19></a> He was one marked by very great failures.<a name=192:20></a> He had a sort of absolute power, and, at

		times, he used his power and opportunities in a very gross way indeed.<a name=193:1></a> And yet if you have studied what the Chronicles say of the house of David, you will have seen that the first book is almost entirely taken up with two thoughts.<a name=193:2></a> The first is the bringing up of the ark to the city of David, and the second the building of a house for God.<a name=193:3></a> Jehovah was to arise and to enter into His rest, He and the ark of His strength.<a name=193:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What led me to read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>is the interchange of thought between David and Jehovah.<a name=193:5></a> David's thought was to find a resting-place for the ark of Jehovah, and Jehovah's thought was to build a house for David and to establish his throne.<a name=193:6></a> His enemies were to be clothed with shame, but upon himself his crown was to flourish.<a name=193:7></a> All that is remarkable in contrast to the great blemishes which marked David.<a name=193:8></a> As a matter of fact, David never was allowed to build God a house.<a name=193:9></a> He was a man who had shed much blood; Solomon was to build the house for Jehovah.<a name=193:10></a> But the real house of God never was built by Solomon, he built a material house which perhaps pointed on to the church, as Solomon himself pointed on to the real Son of David.<a name=193:11></a> I have no doubt that the thought of Christ in His ministry down here was really to secure a house for God, that He might dwell here.<a name=193:12></a> But, on the other hand, the divine thought in regard of Christ is that He should be glorified above all principalities and powers.<a name=193:13></a> When you come to Christ, things are not for a moment to be compared with those of David.<a name=193:14></a> David would build a house, but his thought was a material one.<a name=193:15></a> Christ, on the other hand, purposed to build God a house, but one of a very different character to that which David proposed to build.<a name=193:16></a> That is what He has done.<a name=193:17></a> There was a house prepared for God to dwell in, and, as the result, God has been dwelling here from that time to this.<a name=193:18></a> The Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, and has abode here ever since.<a name=193:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		I go on now to shew that the body and the bride are necessary to the place which Christ has taken.<a name=195:8></a> What I understand by the body is the vessel in which Christ should be perfectly expressed.<a name=195:9></a> If you entertain any idea of the greatness of Christ, the body is that in which He is adequately expressed.<a name=195:10></a> The body serves that purpose now.<a name=195:11></a> It is that in which Christ lives, which is animated by Him, and consequently He is expressed in it.<a name=195:12></a> That is a point of all moment at the present time.<a name=195:13></a> I was dwelling upon that in a former lecture in connection with the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=195:14></a> The thought connected with the body is that there should be that in which the sensibilities and graces of Christ should become manifest down here.<a name=195:15></a>

		I was referring last night to what was an important principle, that is, that God has been pleased to gather up the threads of His past dealings in the companions of Christ which otherwise would have lapsed.<a name=221:1></a> In the setting aside of Israel they would have dropped, but God foresaw, and having done so, He saw to it that there should be no loose threads; and that is, that every thread should be gathered up in Christ.<a name=221:2></a> Now tonight I purpose to take up the thought of the flock.<a name=221:3></a> Now the thought of a flock does not connect itself with heaven, but like that of the vine, with the earth.<a name=221:4></a> The thought of the flock is taken up in a <i>peculiar</i> way in christianity.<a name=221:5></a> In the Old Testament you get expressions which show that Israel took that ground -- "We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture".<a name=221:6></a> The expression is prophetic, and refers to when Jehovah reigns; then they will say, "We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture".<a name=221:7></a> Then again we get, "He led them, like a flock".<a name=221:8></a> Now the strength of a flock and the sheep of His pasture properly belongs to Israel, and will be taken up in a future day, and then Israel will be a known and recognised people, and God will make it patent that they are His people, and He (Jehovah) their shepherd.<a name=221:9></a> It will be a public thing, and made evident in the world.<a name=221:10></a> It is not so now.<a name=221:11></a> You can neither see the flock nor the Shepherd.<a name=221:12></a> We can only know it by the revelation of God -- the Shepherd too is unseen.<a name=221:13></a> All that is proper to the flock is at the present time remarkable.<a name=221:14></a> I have thus so far shown that the idea of the flock is therefore still existing, and finds its place in the companions of Christ, but is not manifested in a public way, as it will be in the future in connection with Israel.<a name=221:15></a> Everything is peculiar and paradoxical at the present time.<a name=221:16></a> Things

		Now I come to the next point.<a name=223:23></a> If I want to get to Christ, I have to get outside of the world.<a name=223:24></a> When Christ was here judaism was the world.<a name=223:25></a> I ask, what is the world now?<a name=223:26></a> Christendom is the world, christendom is not of the Spirit of God, and if you want to find Christ, He stands at the door, and knocks, and you have to find Him outside all the enclosures in christendom.<a name=223:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to say a little on the way in which Christ is presented to us in this passage.<a name=246:1></a> We get the thought of the Son of man, and it is in that way the Lord speaks of Himself all through this chapter; but we also find, by the Spirit of grace accorded to Peter, that he confesses Christ as the Son of the living God, and then the Lord forbids them to say any longer that He was Jesus the Christ.<a name=246:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to say a little on what is connected with the Son of man, and then on the privilege of christians -- because it is a privilege -- of knowing Christ as the Son of the living God, given to Peter by revelation of the Father.<a name=246:3></a> It is not a question of the mere name, but of the significance of the name.<a name=246:4></a> Any one can repeat the name, but the important point is to know the significance of that name.<a name=246:5></a> What does it convey to you?<a name=246:6></a> I can only speak of it according to the apprehension I have myself; one cannot do more.<a name=246:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord continually speaks of Himself as Son of man, and in each place the responsibility of man is connected with it; but as Son of the living God it is a secret, and was so important that the Lord says, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven".<a name=246:8></a> It was of the highest importance that this should be known in regard of Jesus.<a name=246:9></a> I think the title of Son of man is that with which the responsibility of man is bound up.<a name=246:10></a> It goes right on to the coming of the Lord and to the kingdom, when the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He shall reward every man according to his works.<a name=246:11></a> The Lord raises the question, "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=246:12></a>" Every one had his own thought with regard to the Son of man.<a name=246:13></a> He was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord further speaks of what the pathway would be to those who follow Him.<a name=247:10></a> We have to share the rejection of the Son of man.<a name=247:11></a> His rights are in abeyance now, and therefore for the moment we have to suffer with Him.<a name=247:12></a> The present moment is the moment of suffering.<a name=247:13></a> Looked at down here, we only know Him as the One who has suffered.<a name=247:14></a> He has been lifted up on the cross, He has no place here, and hence it is a time of suffering; but at the end of the chapter He comes again in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will render to every man according to his works.<a name=247:15></a> It is in that way that man's responsibility is connected with the Son of man.<a name=247:16></a> I have no doubt the foundations of all God's purposes have been laid, but then He comes again in connection with the responsibility of man.<a name=247:17></a> When He comes He will render to every man according to his works.<a name=247:18></a> We have the same thing in John's gospel -- all judgment is committed to the Son, because He is the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John says to the young man in his epistle, "ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one"; but then he goes on to say, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.<a name=248:3></a> If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<a name=248:4></a> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<a name=248:5></a> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever".<a name=248:6></a> So when the Son of man comes in the glory of the Father with His angels, He renders to every man according to his works; that is, He will bring responsibility to an end in judgment.<a name=248:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now pass on to the other light in which the Lord is presented in this passage.<a name=248:8></a> "He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<a name=248:9></a> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=248:10></a> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven".<a name=248:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just refer to three points we get in connection with this confession of Peter.<a name=248:12></a> The confession was the result of the revelation; but, there are three things the Lord speaks of afterwards: (1) He pronounces a blessing upon Peter, and tells him the source and spring of His confession; (2) He would give him the keys of the kingdom of heaven; (3) He forbids them to say any longer that He was the Christ.<a name=248:13></a> Here we have Jesus presented to us, not in connection with the responsibility of man, but in the light of divine counsels.<a name=248:14></a> Peter really knew very little of what he spoke about.<a name=248:15></a> Flesh and blood had not revealed it unto him, but the Lord laid great stress upon the confession.<a name=248:16></a> It is a great thing to be in the secret of what Christ is as the Son of the living

		Now <i>there</i> is the beginning of the creation of God, that is, all has its source in God Himself.<a name=249:10></a> That is what I understand by being in the secret of God.<a name=249:11></a> You get to the ark of the covenant.<a name=249:12></a> No one had access to the holiest but the high priest, and that only on the great day of atonement; but now the true ark of the covenant has come into view, that is Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=249:13></a> Everything has its source in the living God -- the church of the living God, the word of the living God, and so on.<a name=249:14></a> If you speak of the living God, all must be characterised by life, Christ is the beginning of that; but now we have the Spirit of the living God, by which the writing of Christ is made effectual in saints; writing not on tables of stone, inanimate, but by the Spirit of the living God, on fleshy tables of the heart.<a name=249:15></a> Everything that is living is of the living God, and is in holy, blessed affections.<a name=249:16></a> That is what the Lord made known in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>that man may be quickened in the seat and spring of his affections.<a name=249:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very great thing for us to be in the secret of God, and to apprehend Christ in the counsels of divine goodness.<a name=250:7></a> If you look at things from the divine standpoint, there is nothing but the spiritual house, the holy priesthood, and that is His assembly, it has His mind.<a name=250:8></a> We get a little taste of it when we come together.<a name=250:9></a>

		The Lord was very considerate with His disciples when here upon earth.<a name=250:10></a> He was so ready to impart everything to them, but He found them so very dull, they never really understood what He said to them until the Spirit came.<a name=250:11></a> That is not the case now; we understand that which Christ has been pleased to declare to us, and in the midst of the church He can sing praises to God.<a name=250:12></a> What a wonderful thing to have the mind of Christ!<a name=250:13></a> I can conceive of no greater privilege than coming into contact with Him personally.<a name=250:14></a> It is not by Scripture, but by the soul coming in personal contact with Christ.<a name=250:15></a>

		The Lord says to Peter, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven", and then forbids any one to speak of Him as Jesus the Christ; that is, He has cut off all connection with the world as after the flesh.<a name=250:16></a> If we know Him as Christ the Son of the living God, we know Him as He is now above.<a name=250:17></a> His church was built, I have no doubt, on the day of Pentecost.<a name=250:18></a>

		I think there are two positions in which we ought to be found as christians, I mean christians in reality.<a name=258:1></a> There are two positions which we occupy, one as guests, and the other as disciples.<a name=258:2></a> You get the first in the former part of this passage, the parable of the great supper.<a name=258:3></a> The teaching of the Lord was often in parables, and conveyed the truth better than could have been done by doctrine.<a name=258:4></a> The latter part of the chapter is taken up with discipleship, and forms pretty much the sum total of our lives down here as christians.<a name=258:5></a> In the supper we are fed, nourished, and sustained; but the purpose of it all is that we might come out as disciples.<a name=258:6></a> God presents His things to us, and we are refreshed and invigorated by them in order that we might come out in the world as the disciples of Christ.<a name=258:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The supper is that which marks the present moment, and the occasion for this parable was the remark made by some one, "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God".<a name=258:8></a> I do not think that the idea in the mind of the person who spoke was anything more than a pious aspiration, and that he did not look at the matter in the light in which we apprehend it now.<a name=258:9></a> In contrast to that the Lord presents the idea of the great supper, and shows the way in which it would be regarded by different classes.<a name=258:10></a> I will endeavour to give you some idea as to what the meaning of the great supper is.<a name=258:11></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>there is another striking parable as to the position of believers, namely as having gone forth to meet the bridegroom.<a name=259:7></a> I only speak of this in order to show that the kingdom is deferred, and in the meantime the supper is going on.<a name=259:8></a> The kingdom is really established at the right hand of God, and there is the celebration of it in the great supper down here.<a name=259:9></a> It means the reign of grace on behalf of men.<a name=259:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68">Psalm  68</a>says: "Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts for men".<a name=259:11></a> And the beginning of the epistle to the Hebrews shows that the throne has been established at the right hand of God: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom".<a name=259:12></a> That is a great point for our apprehension, that the throne and the kingdom are really established at the right hand of God.<a name=259:13></a> Christ has received the kingdom, the throne is established, and that means a great deal for man.<a name=259:14></a> It means the subjugation of every enemy of man, the casting down of Satan, the breaking the power of death, and the taking away the sin of the world, in fact, the setting aside of all that oppresses man, because it is the introduction of the reign of grace.<a name=259:15></a> We read in Hebrews of the throne of grace, which is established in the Man who has ascended up on high, but the celebration of the kingdom

		Many look forward to the coming of the Lord, and sometimes forget that grace is established on the basis of all things being ready, and that the Holy Spirit has come down as witness to it.<a name=260:3></a> We have Jesus as Lord, and for those who have eyes to see, the throne and the kingdom are established at the right hand of God, the reign of grace has begun.<a name=260:4></a> Yet Satan still reigns, and the rule of death still goes on; lawlessness is rampant in the world, and will mount up to a height which it has not as yet attained.<a name=260:5></a> I can understand that there are intelligent objections, because outwardly nothing is changed, and all this makes it appear that the kingdom is not established; but what has come to pass is that the Holy Spirit has come down to maintain the kingdom here, and thus we get the good of it.<a name=260:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to my mind a wonderful thing that believers can be maintained in the power of the Holy Spirit in spite of the power of the enemy, the power of death, and the lawlessness of man; maintained in all the good of God's kingdom -- which is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit -- even while the outward conditions of things remain unchanged, and will remain until the coming of the Lord.<a name=260:7></a> Righteousness, peace and joy are things that characterise heaven; righteousness is in heaven, peace reigns in heaven, and joy is found in heaven.<a name=260:8></a> They are brought down to us in the power of the Holy Spirit, and are thus established in our hearts in spite of everything we see around us.<a name=260:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The supper is the celebration of the reign of grace in God's house down here.<a name=261:2></a> The house of God was dependent on the Holy Spirit coming down from heaven, and it is there that the celebration of the kingdom, that is, the great supper takes place.<a name=261:3></a> It is celebrated by those who are really in the good of God's kingdom.<a name=261:4></a> There were those who would not come, and such were really attached to the earth.<a name=261:5></a> There is no greater hindrance to the things of God than the things of earth; the things that hindered them were not immoral things, but the ties of earth.<a name=261:6></a> They had peculiar reference to the case of the Jew, and they hindered his coming in to the supper, and hence it is the invitation goes out to the highways to compel others to come in, so that God's house may be filled.<a name=261:7></a>

		I think that in the minds of christians generally there is a great deal of indefiniteness with regard to priesthood.<a name=266:1></a> In evangelical Christianity it is pretty much the custom to claim priesthood for all christians, to set forward the assertion that all christians are priests.<a name=266:2></a> I do not doubt there is truth in this, for no one can question for a moment that God has but one thought in regard of christians.<a name=266:3></a> None of us would contradict that.<a name=266:4></a> The expression of God's mind with regard to all of us is Christ; He is the perfect expression of that.<a name=266:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there comes in another point, and that is, what is apprehended by us, because, in christianity, nothing is of much good to us beyond that which we have apprehended spiritually.<a name=266:6></a> I have no hesitation in stating that.<a name=266:7></a> God may have in His mind many thoughts with regard to us; but if we have not apprehended them, they have not become available to us.<a name=266:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a power in every christian by which everything may be available to him, for every real christian has part in the Spirit of God; but then it is equally true that we must avail ourselves of everything.<a name=266:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think it is prudent to claim anything beyond that of which, by the Spirit of God, you have availed yourself.<a name=266:10></a> It is wisdom to keep within those limits.<a name=266:11></a> In christianity, reality is a great point.<a name=266:12></a> If you attempt to claim things beyond your spiritual apprehension you are in danger of getting into unreality, and unreality is a kind of bog that may let you through.<a name=266:13></a> None of us can claim to have got very far on in apprehension; there is a great deal more for us, and it is a great thing if we are wakened up to go forward; but as to what we assert, prudence would dictate that we should keep within the limits of our spiritual apprehension, because anything

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is not like Israel.<a name=267:2></a> You would hardly get babes and young men and fathers spiritually in Israel, but you get them all in christianity.<a name=267:3></a> There are such distinctions in Scripture, and in marking progress of that kind, evidently the Spirit of God has regard to the point of spiritual apprehension.<a name=267:4></a> No one can read the second chapter of John's first epistle without coming to that conclusion.<a name=267:5></a> But whether those addressed were babes, or young men, or fathers, God's thought as to them was the same.<a name=267:6></a> From that point and onwards, John speaks in a general way, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us".<a name=267:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I would touch upon a point in regard of Israel as to priesthood.<a name=267:8></a> I am going to try to make plain how we come to it in spiritual apprehension, so that it becomes really available to us, and we get the gain of it.<a name=267:9></a> I do not think that in our meetings we see great evidence of priesthood.<a name=267:10></a> We do not see such great liberty of access.<a name=267:11></a> Of course, there are comparatively few meetings known to me, but in the few that I know, I have not seen so much of that liberty of access which should mark priests, so that I may be borne with in attempting to shew how we avail ourselves of that which is in the mind of God with regard to us.<a name=267:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Israel priesthood was limited to a special family.<a name=267:13></a> The whole tribe of Levi were not priests; the priesthood was limited to a special family of that tribe.<a name=267:14></a> God took up the man most distinguished next to Moses to constitute him high priest.<a name=267:15></a> Moses was mediator and lawgiver, but Aaron was the high priest.<a name=267:16></a> He was called of God, and there never was another called of God except Christ.<a name=267:17></a> Aaron was a type; he was not the antitype, the reality, for, after all, Aaron was a poor, failing man; he made the golden calf.<a name=267:18></a> The One really called of God to priesthood is Christ; Christ did not glorify Himself to be made high priest, but was called of God, as was Aaron, the difference being that Aaron was the type, and Christ

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of Israel, one point has struck me, that is, that the application of the sacrifices was general -- for all the people.<a name=268:4></a> Any Israelite might have offered a burnt-offering; the sacrifices were free to all, they were not limited to priests.<a name=268:5></a> The priests offered them; but the availability of the offerings was not limited to them.<a name=268:6></a> The book of Leviticus is a very interesting book, for it opens up the terms on which God would be with the people, not only with the priests, because, as I said, any one might bring a burnt-offering for his acceptance, and, in a sense, the meat-offering and the peace-offering stood on the same platform.<a name=268:7></a> If an Israelite brought a peace-offering it was usually in connection with thanksgiving; but it was free to all the people to approach God in that way.<a name=268:8></a> That is an important point, and shews the distinction between the fact of acceptance and priesthood.<a name=268:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In christianity you cannot run to extremes the same distinction, but you do get a distinction between the fact of acceptance through an offering and priesthood.<a name=268:10></a> They may belong to the same persons, but the things themselves are different.<a name=268:11></a> You get the principle of offering all through Scripture, from Abel onward.<a name=268:12></a> An Israelite might approach God with an offering; it indicated a movement of soul.<a name=268:13></a> A man brought his offering and was conscious that he was before God in the acceptance of it.<a name=268:14></a> But you have not yet got to the point of priesthood.<a name=268:15></a> Now, priesthood hung, to begin with, upon the calling of God.<a name=268:16></a> But what about Aaron's sons?<a name=268:17></a> I do not think they are spoken of as being of God.<a name=268:18></a> Aaron alone was called of God, and his sons were originally priests by reason of being related to him.<a name=268:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the time of Ezra and Nehemiah the priests had to prove their genealogy.<a name=268:20></a> They could not take the ground of being called of God.<a name=268:21></a> If they could not prove their genealogy they were put out of the priesthood.<a name=268:22></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am now going to speak of the application of these things to christians.<a name=269:2></a> In the beginning of this chapter you do not get the thought of priesthood.<a name=269:3></a> Certain people are addressed by the apostle, and the ground on which he addresses them is that they had believed in God, had received His testimony.<a name=269:4></a> What I understand to be the testimony of God is Christ risen.<a name=269:5></a> It is the witness on the part of God that He has broken the dominion of death, Christ is risen, redemption has been accomplished.<a name=269:6></a> One man is risen, and the dominion of death has thus been broken.<a name=269:7></a> Those addressed had believed in God, who had raised Christ from the dead and given Him glory, and their faith and hope were in God.<a name=269:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Peter recognises another point with regard to them, that is, they were born again.<a name=269:9></a> The work in them had originated with God.<a name=269:10></a> Now he says, 'As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation'.<a name=269:11></a> What I understand by that is that in growing by the sincere milk of the word, people leave in spirit the system connected with man down here, and come into the apprehension of that system of which Christ is the Head.<a name=269:12></a> God has been pleased to bring into view the second Man, the true Head, and the world to come in connection with the one Man.<a name=269:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not quite like the common idea of two men, because the first man was really the type or figure of the second Man; the second Man is the reality, and the world to come is all built up on the reality.<a name=269:14></a> That reality was brought into view, and the growing up unto salvation meant turning the back on the world system, coming into the reality of baptism and growing up to Christ, in whom is salvation.<a name=269:15></a> Salvation belongs to the system of which Christ is Head.<a name=269:16></a> It is in Christ Jesus.<a name=269:17></a> You have to change your ground.<a name=269:18></a> People often think to get salvation as a sort of experience in themselves.<a name=269:19></a> You have to recognise that salvation is in Christ, and to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have your face towards Christ and the system which is centred in the Sun of righteousness.<a name=270:2></a> Some would ask me what scripture I have for it; I answer, the apostle endured all things for the sake of the elect, that they might obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<a name=270:3></a> We are saved in His life, not in our own life.<a name=270:4></a> We are undoubtedly confronted with two systems.<a name=270:5></a> No one fails to take in the idea of the world system.<a name=270:6></a> If you look at the newspapers -- I look at them sometimes, but I dislike them -- they bring the world system into view.<a name=270:7></a> It is a system in which man departed from God <i>is glorified</i>.<a name=270:8></a> What dominates in the world more than perhaps anything is the importance of money.<a name=270:9></a> I have come across people of position in the world, but I found that they were prepared to bow down to riches.<a name=270:10></a> People do not consider if a man is rich what that man is morally; they pay homage to the man on account of the part which he has in the mammon of unrighteousness.<a name=270:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is one system.<a name=270:12></a> But in Christ Jesus we have another system brought into view, the head of which is the Sun of righteousness, like the sun is the centre of the solar universe.<a name=270:13></a> We have a system revealed -- not yet displayed -- in connection with the Sun of righteousness, in which all that is perfect morally prevails -- righteousness and holiness, and at the same time in which God is perfectly glorified.<a name=270:14></a> Whether people understand it or not the fact remains that two systems are in view, and if you come into salvation you turn your back on one and have your face towards the other, that system where only you can realise what Christ is to the glory of God, the One on whom that blessed system of glory is built up.<a name=270:15></a> Salvation lies there.<a name=270:16></a> It does not lie simply in an experience of soul, but in the apprehension of Christ Jesus.<a name=270:17></a> If you apprehend salvation, you apprehend it in Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to verses 4 and 5.<a name=271:3></a> We have here the thought of priesthood brought into view.<a name=271:4></a> The beginning of priesthood is that you have come to the Living Stone.<a name=271:5></a> So far as I understand this, it is by the power of attraction which is in the Living Stone.<a name=271:6></a> I would wish to make that clear.<a name=271:7></a> We get an instance of it in Peter.<a name=271:8></a> Peter came to the Living Stone; he was drawn, but the attraction resided in the Living Stone.<a name=271:9></a> At the beginning Peter was drawn to Christ by Andrew, but he was held to Christ by the attraction which was in Christ.<a name=271:10></a> We begin as christians by faith in the Head; there is no doubt about that.<a name=271:11></a> The name of the Head is presented to us, and forgiveness of sins in His name, in order to attract us to Him.<a name=271:12></a> Christ is the Head of every man, that forgiveness may be presented in His name to every man, and every man may be attracted to Christ.<a name=271:13></a> The Lord refers to this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=271:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step was that Christ gave to us living water, the practical result of which is to attach us to Him.<a name=271:15></a> You cannot have the Spirit of Christ without being attached to Him, because the Spirit is given to that end.<a name=271:16></a> Now the next point is that we get an apprehension of Him, we begin to apprehend the greatness of Christ, that He has ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.<a name=271:17></a> He is great enough to fill all things.<a name=271:18></a> He is the good Shepherd who gave His life for the sheep, and there is goodness enough in Him to give character to every circle connected with Him.<a name=271:19></a> He will fill all things morally.<a name=271:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is, that He is precious.<a name=272:12></a> In Christ you have One chosen of God, like Aaron was; on the other hand, He is precious to man.<a name=272:13></a> What would be the value of a priest for us if he were not precious to man?<a name=272:14></a> There must be a certain reciprocity between Christ and us, else you would not get the true idea of a priest.<a name=272:15></a> So the apostle goes on to say, Unto you which believe is the preciousness.<a name=272:16></a> The nation did not care for Him; they rejected Him; but to you which believe He is precious.<a name=272:17></a> He becomes a link as between God and us; the One who is precious to us is the One who is chosen of God.<a name=272:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The early verses of the chapter do not contemplate priesthood: they contemplate the believer.<a name=272:19></a> There are a good many real believers who have never entered upon the ground of priesthood (I do not say that priesthood is not available to them), because they have never found salvation.<a name=272:20></a> Salvation is the crucial point to my mind.<a name=272:21></a> They have never turned their backs on the world system and got an apprehension of the system of which Christ is the Head.<a name=272:22></a> No christian in system knows salvation, because every system that I know of is part of the great world organisation, and any one who continues in that does not know salvation, because salvation is in Christ Jesus, and Christ Jesus will not touch the world organisation.<a name=272:23></a> If I have anything to say to saints,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=273>[Page 273]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is to put Christ Jesus and all connected with Him in the strongest contrast to the world system.<a name=273:1></a> Salvation is the crucial point, the bridge, so to speak.<a name=273:2></a> People may have believers' meetings and all that, but that is not priesthood.<a name=273:3></a> When we come to that we are drawn to it by the apprehension of the preciousness of Christ and of His greatness.<a name=273:4></a> He went into the lower parts of the earth, as low as it was possible to go, but He has gone up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things.<a name=273:5></a> What a contrast to all which subsists in the world as it is!<a name=273:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I can prove my priesthood; I have my genealogy.<a name=273:7></a> I should say, if challenged, I am kindred to the One who is Priest; He has given me of His Spirit.<a name=273:8></a> I appreciate Him as the good Shepherd; He knows me and I know Him.<a name=273:9></a> I find delight in the thought that He is going to fill all things.<a name=273:10></a> Any one that has been attached by the Spirit to Christ can prove his genealogy, like the priest of the line of Aaron.<a name=273:11></a> If you cannot prove your genealogy you are not entitled to take up priesthood.<a name=273:12></a> The point at which you can do that is when you have been brought, by the Spirit, to the appreciation of Christ.<a name=273:13></a> How can you prove that you are kindred if you are not in accord with Him?<a name=273:14></a> I am in spirit outside of the world system, and set in that system of which He is the centre.<a name=273:15></a> When God raised Christ from the dead, He in a sense brought forth another world; the world to come was brought into view when Christ was raised.<a name=273:16></a> He was raised -- I am risen with Him; I belong to that order of things of which He is the Head and centre.<a name=273:17></a> Not only am I rejected of the world, but I reject it.<a name=273:18></a> The friendship of the world is enmity with God.<a name=273:19></a> I am crucified by the cross of Christ to the world.<a name=273:20></a> I wish I could impress that upon all.<a name=273:21></a> There seems to me to be often a hankering after some sort of place in this world, and the consequence is, that saints are hindered in their apprehension of Christ, because Christ will not be connected in any way with the present order of things.<a name=273:22></a> We are disallowed, and should be content to be disallowed.<a name=273:23></a>

		Now I have a word to say with regard to consecration.<a name=274:11></a> I think the consecration of the priesthood really took place on the day of Pentecost.<a name=274:12></a> I doubt if the consecration is repeated.<a name=274:13></a> The consecrated company were there before God.<a name=274:14></a> I think a first principle of consecration is having our bodies washed with pure water.<a name=274:15></a> You must be in accord with the death of Christ, cleansed from the world.<a name=274:16></a> I do not think there can be any idea of consecration if you do not accept that.<a name=274:17></a> The apostles had that; they were completely clear of the world system -- so clear of it that Peter had to say, "Silver and gold have I none".<a name=274:18></a> I do not know anything that impresses me more with profound satisfaction than the testimony of the apostles in the beginning of Acts.<a name=274:19></a> They had the power of the name of the heavenly Man, but they had not silver or gold, and the power of His name could make a poor cripple perfectly sound.<a name=274:20></a> Do you think the world is going to be made sound or set right by silver and gold?<a name=274:21></a> I do not think so.<a name=274:22></a> It is Christ who will do it without silver and gold.<a name=274:23></a> Then, on the other hand, they were very conscious of being kindred to Christ.<a name=274:24></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, we see them kindred to Christ; He breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit".<a name=274:25></a> When they began, in Acts, every one of the hundred and twenty could have proved, without any difficulty, his genealogy

		I want to point out the difference which exists between the two distinct lines on which the Spirit of God leads us.<a name=278:1></a> I have no doubt that one line on which the Spirit of God leads, or which the Spirit of God teaches, is to lead our hearts into the consciousness of association with Christ where He is; and I think there is also another line on which the Spirit leads us, and that is to the understanding of all God's ways down here.<a name=278:2></a> When we go to be above, we shall pass out of the scene of God's ways.<a name=278:3></a> God's ways are wrought down here.<a name=278:4></a> The church is to be in the secret of all God's ways, in order that it may fulfil its proper function in regard of the world to come.<a name=278:5></a> "Her light was like unto a stone most precious".<a name=278:6></a> That could not be the case if the church were not instructed in every way of God.<a name=278:7></a> That is our education.<a name=278:8></a>

		There is another line on which the Spirit of God conducts us, and that is into the sense of association with Christ above.<a name=278:9></a> The truth of our calling is that we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's Son.<a name=278:10></a> That is brought out in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a> - 30.<a name=278:11></a> We get the thought of that passage confirmed in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, where you find definitely that God is bringing many sons to glory.<a name=278:12></a> The work of the Spirit of God is to connect our hearts with Christ, God's Son, in glory.<a name=278:13></a> The Spirit is the Spirit of God's Son, and if He is that He evidently witnesses to God's Son, and His mission is to connect our hearts with Christ in glory, for we are predestinated "to be conformed to the image of his Son".<a name=278:14></a> Hence it is of all moment that God's Son should be known to us.<a name=278:15></a> Our calling is above, it is the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=278:16></a> That is what God has called us to.<a name=278:17></a> He has "blessed us with all spiritual

	<div class="paragraph">
		what Moses was employed for.<a name=291:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two or three points I want to touch on.<a name=291:2></a> To begin with the discipline of Moses: it comes out in this passage <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:24">Hebrews  11:24</a> - 27.<a name=291:3></a> We get two things here with regard to Moses.<a name=291:4></a> The first is that he refused Egypt, and then he forsook Egypt.<a name=291:5></a> Things generally follow pretty much in that order.<a name=291:6></a> If he had not refused Egypt, he would not have forsaken Egypt.<a name=291:7></a> He had a status in Egypt.<a name=291:8></a> He refused Egypt, and then he forsook Egypt.<a name=291:9></a> He braved the wrath of the king.<a name=291:10></a> It brought about the destruction of Pharaoh and his host.<a name=291:11></a> That is the case in a certain sense with regard to Christ Himself.<a name=291:12></a> He refused Egypt and all the glory of man.<a name=291:13></a> Then he forsook Egypt.<a name=291:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will say a word or two with regard to the first.<a name=291:15></a> He "refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season".<a name=291:16></a> He would not have any part in the world system, or the world's glory.<a name=291:17></a> He esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward".<a name=291:18></a> That is a very remarkable word to be used more than a thousand years before Christ came -- "the reproach of Christ".<a name=291:19></a> Moses preferred to be identified with the suffering people of God.<a name=291:20></a> He would not have any part in Egypt.<a name=291:21></a> He felt that moral glory was to be identified with the suffering people of God.<a name=291:22></a> He esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt".<a name=291:23></a> Can any one doubt that he is going to get the recompense of the reward?<a name=291:24></a> If he was content to be identified with the reproach of Christ, he will get the recompense of Christ.<a name=291:25></a> If he was identified with the people in bondage, he will be identified with Christ in glory.<a name=291:26></a> He refused Egypt, and he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king.<a name=291:27></a> I take it that that was when he was leading the people out.<a name=291:28></a> He forsook Egypt with the people of God.<a name=291:29></a> He led them out, not fearing the wrath of the king.<a name=291:30></a> It ended in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses in a kind of way fails as a type, because he never brought the people in.<a name=292:4></a> He brought them out and brought them to God, but he never brought the people in.<a name=292:5></a> It is a remarkable thing that no allusion is made here to Joshua.<a name=292:6></a> Moses failed, and had to die in the wilderness, and God had to employ another man to bring the people in.<a name=292:7></a> That is why Moses falls short as a type of Christ.<a name=292:8></a> If you want to get a complete type of Christ, you must put Moses and Joshua together.<a name=292:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to pass on to Christ, and see how these principles come out in Him.<a name=292:10></a> Christ has undertaken to bring the people out that they may serve God, but at the same time to bring the people into the land of promise.<a name=292:11></a> Christ does not fail.<a name=292:12></a> He brings the people out and He brings them in.<a name=292:13></a> I want to make it plain that the people are brought out and brought in.<a name=292:14></a> The thought of God is not merely to bring a people out, but to bring them in.<a name=292:15></a> I wish I could bring that home to you.<a name=292:16></a> God's purpose is to bring us <i>in</i>, and the means or instrument by which God brings us out and brings us in is Christ.<a name=292:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up a thought or two with regard to Christ.<a name=292:18></a> When Christ came to earth He came as a Saviour, as a Deliverer.<a name=292:19></a> That is why Christ came here.<a name=292:20></a> There was another thing about the Lord.<a name=292:21></a> He came into Egypt, and He refused Egypt.<a name=292:22></a> All the world into which He came was Egypt.<a name=292:23></a> The Jews were no better than the world.<a name=292:24></a> Christ came into Egypt, but He refused Egypt, He refused the world.<a name=292:25></a> He was carried down into Egypt that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt have I called my son"; but He refused Egypt.<a name=292:26></a> I look upon Egypt as a type of the world and all its glory.<a name=292:27></a> You will remember the temptation of the devil, when he took the Lord "up into an exceeding high mountain" and showed "him all the kingdoms of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is equally true that Christ forsook Egypt.<a name=293:4></a> He left the fold.<a name=293:5></a> That is brought out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>.<a name=293:6></a> The Shepherd went before the sheep; He left the fold in order to take the sheep out of the fold.<a name=293:7></a> I want to speak a word or two with regard to the ministry of Christ on earth.<a name=293:8></a> Every one saw that He did wonderful things -- that was evident enough; but it was equally evident that in thought and spirit He was completely outside the world.<a name=293:9></a> His brethren said, "If thou do these things, show thyself to the world".<a name=293:10></a> They recognised that He did wonderful things.<a name=293:11></a> "Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come".<a name=293:12></a> He did wonderful things, "healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him"; but He was entirely outside all the system of this world's glory.<a name=293:13></a> He was a Stranger here, entirely outside all the present course of things.<a name=293:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Lord's ministry here below His thought was to be a Deliverer.<a name=294:5></a> In that way He was the antitype of Moses.<a name=294:6></a> I refer again to <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, He presents Himself as lifted up from the earth as a point of attraction in contrast to the world which comes under judgment.<a name=294:7></a> A great many people have a difficulty in discerning where the world is.<a name=294:8></a> The difficulty at the present time is that the world is no longer heathen, nor Jewish, but christianised.<a name=294:9></a> I will give you an idea which makes it clear to me what the world is.<a name=294:10></a> It is a system of glory built up which is not according to God.<a name=294:11></a> Do you see God glorified down here?<a name=294:12></a> It is the place where man is glorified.<a name=294:13></a> All the great principles of the world are "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life".<a name=294:14></a> The world system is where death reigns: sin is reigning unto death.<a name=294:15></a> If I apply these tests there is not much difficulty in discerning where the world is.<a name=294:16></a> The principles of lawlessness are to be developed in christendom; the man of sin is to arise in christendom.<a name=294:17></a> Protestantism will drop down to the level of the world; and on the other hand, popery will ride the beast.<a name=294:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My point is this, that the very thought and purpose of Christ at the present time is to deliver people from this present evil world.<a name=294:19></a> "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=294:20></a> How is it that Christ delivers people from this present evil world, and how does He bring them to the land of promise?<a name=294:21></a> With regard to Israel, how was it that they were brought through the Red Sea?<a name=294:22></a> Because they were attached to Moses, and had they not been they would never have been brought through the Red Sea.<a name=294:23></a> Their deliverance

		The apostle brings before us here the secret of liberty in the mother of whom we are begotten.<a name=308:12></a> I can understand the contrast to it in Ishmael.<a name=308:13></a> Ishmael took his character from his mother, who was a bondwoman.<a name=308:14></a> I have no doubt that he became an Ishmaelite from his mother: his hand against every man, and every man's hand against him.<a name=308:15></a> That kind of man is really in bondage, knows nothing of true liberty.<a name=308:16></a> Nor did he know much of dwelling in a house or of being at home.<a name=308:17></a> He was the son of the bondwoman and took character from his mother.<a name=308:18></a>

		Now, as to the children of promise, I understand that they are the children of God's purpose.<a name=310:9></a> Isaac was the child of purpose, and therefore the child of promise.<a name=310:10></a> Since the time of Abraham God has always been acting on that principle of sovereignty.<a name=310:11></a> It is declared in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>, 10.<a name=310:12></a> There were two children of Abraham -- and if the principle of sovereignty had not been acted on Ishmael would have had part with Isaac, for he was the son of Abraham after the flesh.<a name=310:13></a> Had it not been for the principle of sovereignty the same would have been the case with Esau and Jacob.<a name=310:14></a> But God <i>chose</i> Jacob.<a name=310:15></a> He says, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated".<a name=310:16></a> Israel could not complain of that principle, for they were the children of Isaac and Jacob, and it was the principle on which Ishmael and Esau had been rejected.<a name=310:17></a> Isaac and Jacob were the children of promise.<a name=310:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing, then, that comes out here is, that christians are the children of promise, that is, the children of God's purpose.<a name=310:19></a> If you refer to the previous chapter you will see that "before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<a name=310:20></a> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by

		You have a picture of this in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>where the Lord encourages Peter to leave the boat to go to Himself.<a name=311:16></a> The picture is not completed till chapter 16.<a name=311:17></a> As far as I see, Peter did not reach Christ in his soul till then.<a name=311:18></a> In chapter 16 Peter reaches Christ by the revelation of the Father.<a name=311:19></a> He confesses Christ: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=311:20></a> Peter apprehends Christ in that light as the blessed expression of the purpose of God, and in answer to that the Lord says: "thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it".<a name=311:21></a>

		The fact is, that the assembly is really built on the truth of sonship, and the light of sonship is come out in Christ.<a name=311:22></a> God has been pleased to reveal to us in Christ what sonship means -- we could not understand it otherwise-it could not have been fully expressed otherwise.<a name=311:23></a> You may get the name in the Old Testament, as, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in chapter 4 you get a point farther.<a name=312:9></a> "When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son" verse 4.<a name=312:10></a> That is very much like <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=312:11></a> Christ comes of a woman -- that had reference to the ways of God with regard to His humanity; He is made under law.<a name=312:12></a> Those who were the heirs of promise were under law.<a name=312:13></a> Christ comes into both positions, "come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship", be brought thus into the light of purpose.<a name=312:14></a> Sonship is the gift of God.<a name=312:15></a> It is of great importance to apprehend that.<a name=312:16></a> It is something akin to what we have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:12">John  1:12</a>: to "as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be the children of God".<a name=312:17></a>

		Then further: "because ye are sons, God hath sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=312:18></a> So far what we have got to is this.<a name=312:19></a> The christian is in the light of God's purpose, apprehends His gift, and has the Spirit of God's Son.<a name=312:20></a> This could never be till Christ was in glory.<a name=312:21></a> Sonship refers to

		And yet after all the Galatians were very little grown -- they had made but little progress!<a name=313:7></a> You see what the apostle says, "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you", verses 19, 20.<a name=313:8></a> They had not gained much ground spiritually.<a name=313:9></a> Christ was not formed in them.<a name=313:10></a> They had the Spirit, but they were not in the good of sonship, for the Spirit of God's Son cries, "Abba, Father".<a name=313:11></a> They had poor apprehension of the love of God, and there was but a poor response to that love.<a name=313:12></a> They knew nothing about the assembly as Christ's body though they had the Spirit.<a name=313:13></a> Until Christ is formed in us sonship is not of any very great account to us.<a name=313:14></a> You may rejoice in the term and in the knowledge that it belongs to you, but it is of little avail for present enjoyment.<a name=313:15></a> As I understand it the truth is made known that you may be in state and nature what is suitable to sonship, and what is suitable to sonship is Christ.<a name=313:16></a> To put it in other language it is to be holy and without blame before God in love.<a name=313:17></a> That is the effect of Christ being formed in you.<a name=313:18></a> There is a nature suitable to the relationship in which God has been pleased to place me, and the consequence of Christ being in me is that I am before God, not only in the light of His purpose, but in a condition to enjoy the position and the relationship that He has been pleased to give to me.<a name=313:19></a> "Before him in love", "holy and without blame" comes by the way, but the great point is, "before him in love".<a name=313:20></a>

		There is one thing more connected with it.<a name=314:2></a> It has often been impressed upon us that love will have company.<a name=314:3></a> That thought is not so prominent in grace.<a name=314:4></a> It is because God loves us ("for his great love wherewith he loved us") that He will have us with Himself in His holy habitation.<a name=314:5></a> Just as God would have Israel in the land of Canaan.<a name=314:6></a> The wilderness would not satisfy God.<a name=314:7></a> And so God now desires His people to be with Him in His holy habitation -- near Him.<a name=314:8></a> He has "raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=314:9></a>

		Now I want to come to an important point, and that is of character, and how you get it.<a name=314:10></a> Our character as christians is undoubtedly formed by the testimony, and I must refer a little to the testimony.<a name=314:11></a> Look at the latter part of the chapter, verses 21 - 31.<a name=314:12></a> We were speaking on a previous occasion of the testimony of God, and I will refer to it again in a very limited way.<a name=314:13></a> I go back only as far as Abraham, for the special testimony began with Abraham, and what came out in connection with him was this, that it was the purpose of God to bless; and not only to bless one special people, but "in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed".<a name=314:14></a> The principle that has come out in connection with that is that the blessing of Abraham has come to the gentiles in a risen Christ, as you see in chapter 3: 13, 14, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law .<a name=314:15></a>.<a name=314:16></a>.<a name=314:17></a> that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith".<a name=314:18></a> That is how it reaches the gentiles.<a name=314:19></a> Christ had to come after the flesh to redeem the Jew from the curse of the law, but to the end "that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus".<a name=314:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You may be assured of this, that every one formed on that testimony to Abraham will take a certain character.<a name=315:1></a> Isaac took a certain character; I do not doubt that he was formed on that testimony of the purpose of God to bless.<a name=315:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we come to the law we find another testimony for faith, and what is shadowed there is this, that in virtue of the law being written in man's heart God would dwell among men.<a name=315:3></a> It all depended on what we get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>Christ comes forth to be the reflex of God as a Man down here, and in connection with that God dwells in man.<a name=315:4></a> That is the next great testimony.<a name=315:5></a> If faith had apprehended that, the apprehension would have had an immense effect.<a name=315:6></a> It does not set aside what preceded -- the blessing of Abraham, which really means that a man is justified in the eye of God, stands good, but that is followed by the further thought of man being the reflex of God, and, in consequence of that, God dwelling among men.<a name=315:7></a>

		Now I come to a further testimony, and that is the throne.<a name=315:10></a> The testimony in David is this, grace acting in power.<a name=315:11></a> That is what the throne meant.<a name=315:12></a> What was established in David, was not merely the principle of grace but grace acting in power.<a name=315:13></a> The enemies of God's people were subdued.<a name=315:14></a> It was the effect of God coming in.<a name=315:15></a> Grace was predominant when Israel had forfeited everything after the flesh.<a name=315:16></a> One thing comes out very prominently in connection with David -- we have heard of it already today -- "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=315:17></a> In a limited way it was the reign of grace.<a name=315:18></a> The beginning was that the ark had been taken captive and Ichabod

		That brings me to another point.<a name=316:7></a> The testimony of God is identified with a city.<a name=316:8></a> I could not say so much with regard to the blessing of Abraham; but when you come to the dwelling of God and to the throne, both the one and the other have eventually become identified with the city of the great king.<a name=316:9></a> Jerusalem was not the first resting-place of the ark.<a name=316:10></a> It was pitched at Shiloh, then brought by David to the city of the great king.<a name=316:11></a> When Jerusalem proved unfaithful, like an unfaithful wife, then God allowed Babylon to come into prominence.<a name=316:12></a> The idea of a city is maintained.<a name=316:13></a> The present time is really the time of Babylon, the fact being that the Jerusalem down here has had to give way to the Jerusalem above.<a name=316:14></a> That is what has come to pass, though eventually it will be restored to its place here.<a name=316:15></a> Now it is desolate, but eventually it will return to its first affections.<a name=316:16></a> But what marks the present time is "Jerusalem above".<a name=316:17></a> What I understand by that is that there is a point where every testimony of God is centred.<a name=316:18></a> "Jerusalem above" is the full expression of God's pleasure.<a name=316:19></a> It is not simply this testimony or that testimony of God, but the full expression of God's pleasure.<a name=316:20></a> Every testimony rests and will be displayed there.<a name=316:21></a> If you want a definite idea of Jerusalem above I can only point you to the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=316:22></a> In Him every testimony rests.<a name=316:23></a> We have a full expression of God's pleasure in the glory of the Lord.<a name=316:24></a> It speaks of righteousness;

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not desire to say much as to the details related in this scripture, and I take up this passage in it (verses 8 - 23) as giving a striking picture of the grace of God.<a name=319:1></a> The ministry of Elisha differs from that of Elijah in that it is for the most part a ministry of grace.<a name=319:2></a> It corresponds to the Lord's ministry, which was in contrast to that of John the baptist.<a name=319:3></a> The object of Elijah's ministry was to recall the people to their allegiance to Jehovah.<a name=319:4></a> The ministry of Elijah failed in that respect, but God's claim was maintained, and then the ministry of Elisha comes in, which was the grace of God in the helplessness and ruin of Israel.<a name=319:5></a> Elisha had a double portion of Elijah's spirit, that is the portion of a first-born.<a name=319:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Things were very dark in Israel at this time.<a name=319:7></a> It was the reign of Jehoram and immediately after Ahab.<a name=319:8></a> The previous chapter shews us what was the darkness of Israel at this moment, as the Lord says in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>, "many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian".<a name=319:9></a> Israel did not get the benefit of the light, but Naaman the Syrian got it.<a name=319:10></a> I only speak of that to point out the state of things when this circumstance occurred.<a name=319:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want first to call your attention to this fact, the <i>testimony of God</i> was in Israel, but the <i>light</i> was not with Israel; the light was with the prophet.<a name=319:12></a> You have in a day of confusion to distinguish between the <i>vessel of testimony</i> and the <i>light</i>, and when such is the case the <i>protection of God is with the light</i>.<a name=319:13></a> The king of Israel got the benefit of the light, though the light was not with him.<a name=319:14></a>

		The next point is, the <i>protection of God is with the light</i>.<a name=320:11></a> Look at verses 13 - 17.<a name=320:12></a> "Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.<a name=320:13></a> And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.<a name=320:14></a> Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.<a name=320:15></a> And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.<a name=320:16></a> And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master!<a name=320:17></a> how shall we do?<a name=320:18></a> And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.<a name=320:19></a> And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.<a name=320:20></a> And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha".<a name=320:21></a> If your eyes have been opened like the servant of Elisha, you will see that the protection of God is with the light -- the care of God is there.<a name=320:22></a> To refer for a moment to the seven churches,

		We might have good reason to fear any little bit of light being extinguished were it not for divine protection; but my conviction is, that if the light is there, God will take care of the light to the end.<a name=321:7></a> I do not believe that His protection will be around assumption, or anything of that sort, but where the truth is held in lowliness God will not fail of His protection.<a name=321:8></a> I cannot tell you where the light may be at any future moment.<a name=321:9></a> Supposing that we have the light with us today, there is no saying where it may be another day, but wherever the light may be, the protection of God will be about the light.<a name=321:10></a> There was no fellowship in Israel in that day -- save in evil, none for good; Elisha was a solitary man, but the protection of God was around that man.<a name=321:11></a> I think in this day God has given us the light, however small the appreciation of it may be, and He gives us also the privilege of fellowship; and as the light of God was bound up with that solitary man, and the protection of it, so now the protection of God will be round about the light, and those who are identified with it.<a name=321:12></a>

		And I will give an antitype of it.<a name=322:16></a> I think you get this in Saul.<a name=322:17></a> Saul was not going to Samaria, but to Damascus, the city of these very Syrians, and on the way he was struck with blindness; he was made completely <i>weak</i>.<a name=322:18></a> It was not judgment, but God struck him with weakness, and he was brought to Damascus -- the place to which he in his maddened rage was bent on going.<a name=322:19></a> He never expected to arrive there weak; he expected to be there strong in authority to carry out his mission of persecution; but God had other thoughts for Saul, and to that end He makes him utterly weak.<a name=322:20></a> God can make a strong man weak.<a name=322:21></a> I could give you other instances besides Saul.<a name=322:22></a> The thief on the cross was made weak.<a name=322:23></a> The Philippian jailor was made weak, and as we have seen, Saul was going to Damascus "breathing out threatenings and slaughter".<a name=322:24></a> Think of the expression!<a name=322:25></a> He had to be led by the hand and brought to the place where he purposed to go.<a name=322:26></a> What a humiliating position, to be led by the hand!<a name=322:27></a>

		When Saul reaches Damascus what does he find?<a name=323:1></a> Not retribution; the disciples were a bit afraid of him at first, but Ananias comes to him, and instead of reproaching him sets before him the ministration of "bread and water".<a name=323:2></a> Saul became acquainted with two things in Damascus, the <i>grace of God</i> in forgiveness of sins and the <i>gift of the Holy Spirit</i>.<a name=323:3></a> Bread in Scripture is, I think, emblematic of grace, and Saul had grace ministered to him and the refreshment of the Spirit.<a name=323:4></a>

		God dealt with them was that they were the seed of Abraham, God's chosen.<a name=327:1></a> God called out Abraham, and he was accounted righteous; and God took up Israel simply because they were the seed of Abraham.<a name=327:2></a> It was not the establishment of a relationship with man as man stood, but God formed a link with one apart from the world and the flesh in His eye.<a name=327:3></a> You may depend upon it God never lost sight of the fact that the judgment of death lay upon man.<a name=327:4></a> This was perhaps even more serious than man's moral state.<a name=327:5></a> God never forgot it.<a name=327:6></a> If you examine into the dealings of God with this and that man, you will find some indication that God never forgot the position in which man was as driven out from His presence and under sentence of death.<a name=327:7></a>

		You will understand now how the brazen serpent is the beginning for God.<a name=327:8></a> It is that which is alluded to here.<a name=327:9></a> "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh" (verse 3).<a name=327:10></a> Three things have come to pass: 1st, The introduction of the Head who is the beginning of the creation of God; 2nd, The Head has borne the liabilities under which man lay by God's judgment; 3rd, The Spirit is here as the power to form man according to the Head.<a name=327:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are three most important elements in the ways of God which come out in this chapter.<a name=327:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will speak about the consequences directly; but in referring to the Head, I speak of the Head in the widest possible sense, the beginning of the creation of God; the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the first-born from the dead.<a name=327:13></a> I think we want to apprehend Christ more in that light.<a name=327:14></a> I am impressed with the thought that we have an inadequate idea of the greatness of Christ: "ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=327:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The beginning of the creation of God" is a most remarkable expression.<a name=327:16></a> We might have said Adam was the beginning of God's creation, but Scripture says
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=328>[Page 328]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is the beginning of the creation of God.<a name=328:1></a> I have often said (and others too) that God began very small.<a name=328:2></a> In an outward sense Christ did not begin so great as Adam.<a name=328:3></a> He was "come of woman, come under law".<a name=328:4></a> Christ came into human life in the lowliest possible way, but nevertheless He was the beginning of the creation of God, and He is the Head and crown of that creation.<a name=328:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He came to take up the liabilities under which man lay in regard of God, and in so doing He has brought to an end before God the lawless man.<a name=328:6></a> "God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=328:7></a> There was the termination of that state for God, a very great point for us to apprehend.<a name=328:8></a> God could form no link with that man.<a name=328:9></a> That man was useless or worse in the ways of God, he was no profit to God nor to himself.<a name=328:10></a> The death of Christ was the termination of that man for the glory of God, and we have the introduction of another man, the beginning of the creation of God.<a name=328:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now consequent upon redemption the Spirit is here in order that He may form man according to the head, so that he may derive his character from Christ.<a name=328:12></a> This principle goes out to the widest limits, for in every circle man will in result take his character from the head.<a name=328:13></a> That is the purpose and work of God.<a name=328:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to touch on what comes out in this scripture in connection with the Spirit on two or three very important points.<a name=328:15></a> We get the thought of life and peace and righteousness, and all in connection with the Head.<a name=328:16></a> What I understand by life is that one who is in life is, in soul, outside the claim and domain of death.<a name=328:17></a> That described the position of Christ here on earth: "In him was life".<a name=328:18></a> Death had no claim upon Him.<a name=328:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there was also peace.<a name=328:20></a> There could be no question between Himself and God.<a name=328:21></a> And there was righteousness; He was the preacher of righteousness.<a name=328:22></a> He loved righteousness and hated iniquity.<a name=328:23></a> All these things characterised Christ, as Man here, as Head: life and peace
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=329>[Page 329]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and righteousness.<a name=329:1></a> Well, by the Spirit of God the same things characterise us.<a name=329:2></a> We are cleared of liability before God, and it is a great thing to be in life; to be sensible that death has no claim upon me.<a name=329:3></a> That is true.<a name=329:4></a> I do not mean but what one may die, but death has no right over me.<a name=329:5></a> The rights of death are destroyed and I am in life by the Spirit of God.<a name=329:6></a> There is in the christian a man over whom death has no right.<a name=329:7></a> Death may touch my body, but if I regard myself as I am before God, I am in life by the Spirit of God, and have come to ground where death has no right over me.<a name=329:8></a> We get peace, too, by the Spirit, that is, the sense that there is no unsettled question with God.<a name=329:9></a> And so, too, in regard of righteousness.<a name=329:10></a> "The Spirit is life because [or in view] of righteousness".<a name=329:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things were found in Christ, and it is no small thing that the Spirit of God has come down to form us according to Christ as Head.<a name=329:12></a> It is a great thing for anyone to say, I live by the Spirit; I do not account of myself as in natural life, I live by the Spirit.<a name=329:13></a> The apostle says, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit".<a name=329:14></a> When I look at myself in that light death has no claim upon me.<a name=329:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you understand what it is to live in the Spirit?<a name=329:16></a> Christianity is not a garment which I put on to cover the flesh; christianity is that I live by the Spirit, the flesh being crucified.<a name=329:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christians, properly speaking, are a wonderful generation in this world of lawlessness, they are more wonderful than they allow themselves to be; but we have so poor an idea of what it is to live in the Spirit.<a name=329:18></a> The great part of christians have taken up christianity as though it were a question of orthodoxy in doctrine; but in the true power of it, it is, we live in Christ by the Spirit.<a name=329:19></a> Peace and righteousness are necessary consequences.<a name=329:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take up two other points coming out here: sonship and liberty in connection with Christ, for Christ being the Head, you cannot have a standard less than the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ, and it was equally true that there was sonship and liberty; and indeed the one hangs on the other.<a name=330:1></a> All these things work out to the utmost bounds.<a name=330:2></a> I do not look upon them as having exclusive application to us -- they have now their application to us; we are here for the will of God for the moment -- but they work out to every family.<a name=330:3></a> Christ gives character to each and all, not in the same degree, I admit, but in principle the Head gives character to all who come under Him.<a name=330:4></a> The Spirit is to be poured out on all flesh.<a name=330:5></a> What for?<a name=330:6></a> In order that everything may be subdued to Christ.<a name=330:7></a> The Spirit of God will give character to all that creation, every family will take character from Christ.<a name=330:8></a> It is of great moment to get some idea of the greatness of the Head and of the system to which He gives character.<a name=330:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not suppose any one of us has apprehended the greatness of that expression, "the beginning of the creation of God".<a name=330:10></a> Then it belongs to Him to give character to the creation of God.<a name=330:11></a> All that creation will be brought into the rest of God.<a name=330:12></a> He will have complacency in all.<a name=330:13></a> The secret of that complacency is, that all comes under the Head and more or less takes its character from Him.<a name=330:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I suppose most of us are conversant with these things.<a name=330:15></a> We can speak something of life, peace, and righteousness, and we know something of sonship and liberty.<a name=330:16></a> They are good things to be in the reality of down here; but what are we here for?<a name=330:17></a> I think, for the will of God until all is expressed.<a name=330:18></a> We are going on as saints, gaining intelligence in the ways of God; they are opened up in the succeeding chapters; and this intelligence in the things of God is to qualify us for the time to come, when we are to be companions of Christ reigning in glory.<a name=330:19></a> We are qualifying for the day of glory.<a name=330:20></a> God's ways are educating us that we may be fit for our part in the day of Christ's glory.<a name=330:21></a>

		I think it is a great point to apprehend the purpose with which Christ is presented to us.<a name=332:1></a> The preaching of the gospel is the presentation of Christ, not merely of the benefits to be obtained by Christ.<a name=332:2></a> The gospel is the glad tidings of the Christ, not simply of something <i>about</i> Him.<a name=332:3></a> The truth is that Christ is the centre of a system which <i>God has now before Him</i>, and is presented as the light of that system, and, as such, there is virtue in <i>Him</i>.<a name=332:4></a> When He was here there went virtue out from Him, and now forgiveness is preached in His name.<a name=332:5></a> The setting forth of the virtue that is in Christ is not the end in the presentation of Christ.<a name=332:6></a> The point of attraction is Christ Himself.<a name=332:7></a> That is why I read <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>, 32.<a name=332:8></a> In verse 31 we see one system judged, and in verse 32 another system introduced in the presentation of the Son of man lifted up.<a name=332:9></a> When the Lord cast out seven devils from Mary Magdalene virtue went out of Him, but it was to attract her to Himself.<a name=332:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 9 of this gospel we find that after the Lord had given sight to the blind man, He presented <i>Himself</i> to him and said, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=332:11></a>" He gave the man sight that he might be attracted to <i>Himself</i>.<a name=332:12></a> I believe that God's object is to attract everyone to Christ, and forgiveness of sins is presented, not to occupy us with the virtue that is in Him but to attract us to Himself.<a name=332:13></a> I dare say all will accept this.<a name=332:14></a> When the light came into the world it was largely rejected, but there were those who came to it, and in coming to the light they proved that they were attracted by Christ.<a name=332:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ has been lifted up from the earth, that He might be the point of attraction for all.<a name=333:8></a> He attracts to Himself as One who has died <i>from</i> the earth.<a name=333:9></a> It has been said that He could hardly have died <i>on</i> the earth, it would have been unsuitable that the righteous One who had glorified God on the earth should die on it.<a name=333:10></a> He is lifted up out of it vicariously, and, as lifted up from the earth, draws all to Himself.<a name=333:11></a> We have each and all, if believers, in one way or another been drawn to Christ Himself, and He is the Head and centre of God's system -- He is the sun of that system.<a name=333:12></a> That system is founded on redemption, and the head of that system is necessarily Christ Himself.<a name=333:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the coming day that system will be brought out into display; but it is already established for God in Christ.<a name=333:14></a> He has prepared it in every part, and will set it forth in due time, and it is in connection with that system that we have been attracted to Christ.<a name=333:15></a>

		I will ask you now to turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:9">Romans  6:9</a> - 11.<a name=333:16></a> I want to give you an interpretation of that passage.<a name=333:17></a> Suppose, for a moment, I put 'the world system' in the place of "<i>sin</i>" here, and read, 'In that he died, he died unto the world system', that would largely convey the idea, for sin is the ruling principle of that system.<a name=333:18></a> In the sight of God, every bit of this world system is sin.<a name=333:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the position of the christian is, that he corresponds to Christ.<a name=334:5></a> <i>He</i> is the point of attraction, and "In that he died, he died unto <i>sin</i> [the world system] once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=334:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ had died to sin and to the whole world system, and we are associated with Him in that death.<a name=334:7></a> We reckon ourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, that system to which Christ has died.<a name=334:8></a> Every christian properly is to reckon himself as crucified with Christ.<a name=334:9></a> On the other hand he is attached to Christ, and that by the Spirit of God, so that he can recognise himself as alive unto God in the system of which Christ is the Head and centre.<a name=334:10></a> We are privileged to take that place in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=334:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"In Christ Jesus" is an expression of wide bearing.<a name=334:12></a> It implies our being in Him as the Head and centre of a system, and consequently in correspondence to Him in that system.<a name=334:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the system of which Christ is the Head three things will prevail -- <i>righteousness</i>, <i>holiness</i> and <i>eternal life</i>.<a name=334:14></a> And these three you find here in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=334:15></a> They are principles which Christ has brought in, and are in marked contrast to the principles that prevail in the system of the world.<a name=334:16></a> These may be described as <i>lawlessness</i>, <i>impurity</i> and <i>death</i>.<a name=334:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the system which God has brought in by Christ, the principle that rules is <i>love</i>, and love is really righteousness in practice.<a name=335:5></a> You love your neighbour as yourself.<a name=335:6></a> Love being the bond between all, righteousness prevails in every circle.<a name=335:7></a> <i>Righteousness is fidelity in every divinely appointed relationship</i>.<a name=335:8></a> Where fidelity is thus maintained, there is righteousness.<a name=335:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now where there is righteousness, impurity becomes intolerable.<a name=335:11></a> In this world system we are surrounded by it -- it is seen in the newspapers, in the placards on the walls, and there has been an immense increase in that way in my time, and the worst is that much is said <i>not</i> to be impurity.<a name=335:12></a> Now in the universe, which is according to God, impurity will not be tolerated.<a name=335:13></a> The principle which will be present in the day when Christ takes up His true position as the centre of the universe of bliss will be holiness.<a name=335:14></a> I am quite sure that the judgment of death in a world of sin, is of the wisdom of God, but in the system which is of God, eternal life will rule as the blessed consequence of righteousness and holiness.<a name=335:15></a> Now we reckon ourselves dead unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus, and so are in that system of which He is the Head, the first principle of which is righteousness, and we have to look to it now, that we do not fail in fidelity in our obligations, and love is that by which those obligations are discharged.<a name=335:16></a>

		I just desire to add one word on the subject of recovery.<a name=348:1></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:15">Matthew  2:15</a>.<a name=348:2></a>) What struck me (and I was very much interested in what our brother was bringing before us) was that it is a wonderful thing to see that God has the power of recovery with Himself.<a name=348:3></a> That is what I want to indicate.<a name=348:4></a> And that Christ <i>is</i> that power of recovery; and all recovery, whatever it may be -- and it is a great principle with God beyond all manner of doubt -- is really the revival of Christ.<a name=348:5></a> There is no recovery in man as man.<a name=348:6></a> All recovery, whether in the individual or in whatever circle it may be, is the revival of Christ in that individual or that circle.<a name=348:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see the principle in Israel.<a name=348:8></a> In a sense Israel began with Christ.<a name=348:9></a> This is seen in Moses.<a name=348:10></a> Israel has lost all savour of Christ, but all recovery and blessing for them in the future is the revival in them of Christ.<a name=348:11></a> You get the expression of this in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>.<a name=348:12></a> Christ will be revived in them.<a name=348:13></a> It is wonderful that God has thus the power and principle of recovery with Himself.<a name=348:14></a> It is all involved in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:15">Matthew  2:15</a>: "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=348:15></a> Christ is identified with Israel.<a name=348:16></a> God had brought Christ in, and He is the power and principle of recovery.<a name=348:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in regard of the church.<a name=348:18></a> There is defection in the church.<a name=348:19></a> The principle of recovery is the revival of Christ in the saints.<a name=348:20></a> That is the force of what the Lord says in Laodicea.<a name=348:21></a> "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire".<a name=348:22></a> What is the recovery there?<a name=348:23></a> It is Christ.<a name=348:24></a> So in regard of the individual.<a name=348:25></a> We might take Peter as an example of this.<a name=348:26></a> Peter called to mind the word of Christ.<a name=348:27></a> It was the revival of Christ in him; he remembered the word the Lord had said to him.<a name=348:28></a>

		to be recovered in a kind of way -- it is the power of Christ in us.<a name=349:1></a> The power of recovery is in Christ, and the way in which it works is by the revival of Christ, whether it be in the church, or Israel, or the individual.<a name=349:2></a> We all ought to be set for recovery; but I think the point is, that the principle of recovery should be seen in us.<a name=349:3></a> God would desire the revival of Christ in us, wrought by the Spirit of God, so that we ourselves might be the expression of the power of the Spirit of God in the way of recovery.<a name=349:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be a good thing, and I heartily go with the desire for recovery to any extent in the saints down here, but it must be brought about by the revival of Christ.<a name=349:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Revival is a very great thing.<a name=349:6></a> I do not limit it to the conversion of people.<a name=349:7></a> It is in the saints.<a name=349:8></a> No doubt if Christ were revived in the saints there would be much more work and power in the gospel.<a name=349:9></a> The revival must work in us.<a name=349:10></a> You may be confident there is no revival in man; the revival is the revival of Christ in man.<a name=349:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has brought Christ forward as the blessed One in whom He accomplishes all the purpose of His will, but also as the great principle of recovery for every one, whether Israel, or the church, or the individual.<a name=349:12></a>

		We all recognise the great interest which attaches to the Acts of the Apostles.<a name=386:1></a> It has sometimes been said that the book might have been called, 'The Acts of the Holy Spirit', but I do not quite think this is just, for the reason that the work of the Holy Spirit lies in a sense underneath what is recorded.<a name=386:2></a> The Acts of the Apostles presents the work externally, that is, the outward effects of the testimony -- the work of the Spirit lay in what was underneath in souls.<a name=386:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a good deal recorded in Acts of the effect of the testimony which did not probably eventually stand.<a name=386:6></a> We read, for instance, that a great company of priests were obedient to the faith: that was the outward result of the preaching, but much of that probably fell away; the real operation of the Spirit of God in souls would not.<a name=386:7></a> We see nowadays great outward efforts made in the gospel and apparent results produced by the word, but that is not necessarily the measure of the Spirit's work.<a name=386:8></a> The work of the apostles was carried out in the power of the Holy Spirit, but even <i>their</i> work and the Spirit's work in souls were not commensurate.<a name=386:9></a> The parable of the sower would prove the same point.<a name=386:10></a> The Lord Himself was the Sower, sowing the seed -- the word of God.<a name=386:11></a> And yet only the seed which fell on good ground brought forth fruit.<a name=386:12></a>

		I have already said, to shew the true character of christianity.<a name=387:1></a> We need to go back to what was from the beginning to see this, and we thus get light as to the divine thought and intent in the gospel.<a name=387:2></a> If we go back thus it will lead us into a narrow, and in a sense exclusive path, because in the light of the truth we cannot go on with things in christendom which are not according to the first and divine thought, but are in principle unrighteousness.<a name=387:3></a> It has been said, that the purest water if it falls on the earth becomes mud, and therefore we want to go back to the fountain to find out what the pure water was.<a name=387:4></a>

		We have had before us the subject of the house of God.<a name=387:5></a> God dwelling here by the Spirit.<a name=387:6></a> We saw that the establishment of the house was dependent upon the fact of Christ having taken His place in heaven as the last Adam.<a name=387:7></a> The tabernacle in Israel was the figure of what God was going to establish here -- His house.<a name=387:8></a> Now it is established, for the question of responsibility has been settled, and Christ has taken His place as last Adam in the presence of God in subsisting righteousness.<a name=387:9></a> Now I may remark that we do not find in Scripture the idea of a church formation or organisation.<a name=387:10></a> There was a company who believed in Christ and had been gathered by the testimony of His resurrection, and the advent of the Holy Spirit necessarily constituted that company the house of God.<a name=387:11></a> Church formation was the subsequent work of man, but it is a great thing for us to get back to what was from the outset in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=387:12></a> When decline had set in the apostle Paul sought to bring the servant back to what were the first principles of christianity -- the glory of the Lord, and the Spirit of God down here.<a name=387:13></a> You may say, were there not such offices as elders and deacons?<a name=387:14></a> Well, there were men full of the Holy Spirit, and they were appointed to this work on account of their spiritual qualifications.<a name=387:15></a> So real was the presence of the Spirit that in the first instance of discipline recorded the sin is said to be lying to the Holy

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to another feature of christianity.<a name=388:6></a> The earlier chapters in Acts just leave room for the possibility of the restoration of Israel, and yet at the same time the church was being formed by the Spirit.<a name=388:7></a> But in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>all hope or thought of the restoration of Israel was coming to an end, and this opens the way for the true power of christianity to be brought to light.<a name=388:8></a> There are two things which come out in the end of chapter 8.<a name=388:9></a> (1) The true significance of baptism.<a name=388:10></a> (2) The formative work of the Spirit in the saint.<a name=388:11></a> But it is interesting to refer to one or two points in the earlier part of the address of Stephen (see verses 14 - 16).<a name=388:12></a> The Jews boasted in the <i>fathers</i>, and they boasted about themselves.<a name=388:13></a> They assumed that they were the people of God, but they did not take to heart the fact that the patriarchs themselves never really came into the enjoyment of the promises.<a name=388:14></a> If Israel was to enjoy the promises it must be with those to whom the promises were made.<a name=388:15></a> Therefore their going into the land could only have been provisional; resurrection must come in, for it was not possible that the children could come into the enjoyment of the promises without the fathers, and the latter had been laid in sepulchres.<a name=388:16></a> The Jews boasted in the fathers; but these had died, and never got the promise.<a name=388:17></a> They boasted in <i>Moses</i>, and they had rejected him, both as a deliverer and as a prophet.<a name=388:18></a> (See verses 27, 39): "Who made thee a ruler and judge over us?<a name=388:19></a>" "To whom our fathers would not obey, but <i>thrust</i> him from them".<a name=388:20></a>

		(see verses 40 - 43).<a name=389:1></a> God had already said in His mind, "I will carry you away beyond Babylon".<a name=389:2></a> I believe that this refers to their present dispersion, and this is put down to their worshipping the golden calf in the wilderness.<a name=389:3></a> God visits upon them the original sin.<a name=389:4></a> Another boast was in the house of God, and yet they had made it a den of thieves; but "the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me?<a name=389:5></a> saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?<a name=389:6></a>" They had material ideas of God's house, but God is not to be limited to a material house.<a name=389:7></a> The Jew had forgotten that heaven was His throne, and that the earth was His footstool.<a name=389:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to sum up these things.<a name=389:9></a> In their thoughts they were to enjoy the promises without the fathers, they had refused Moses, they boasted in the land but forfeited it by idolatry, and they brought the thought of God's house down to a material temple.<a name=389:10></a> Now I ask what was left to a man like Stephen -- whose eyes were opened to all this?<a name=389:11></a> What value was there for faith in the people who took the place of God's people here?<a name=389:12></a> Stephen charges them with unvaryingly resisting the Holy Spirit; they had broken the law, persecuted the prophets, and slain the just One.<a name=389:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in contrast to all this we get the light which was vouchsafed to Stephen (see verses 55 - 60).<a name=389:14></a> Stephen <i>looked up steadfastly to heaven</i>; he was full of the Holy Spirit, and a man who is so always looks to heaven; and he saw the glory of God and Jesus (not Israel), and he apprehended that every purpose of God was established in heaven in the Person of Jesus.<a name=389:15></a> The counsel of God had in no wise failed; all was established in a scene where sin and death and Satan's power have no place.<a name=389:16></a> It was the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=389:17></a> When the glory of God is displayed when Jesus comes, the effects of sin will be put away.<a name=389:18></a> Death will be swallowed up in victory.<a name=389:19></a> But what a man who is full of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in heaven the glory of God and Jesus are seen together and all has to come from heaven for the setting right of things here; but a power has already come, the Holy Spirit, by which we can look up, and see all accomplished, and established in one Man, and that one Man is a life-giving Spirit, so that He can quicken millions.<a name=390:2></a> It is not only that righteousness has been established in Him, but that He being a life-giving Spirit has power to quicken, and therefore every purpose of God stands steadfast in Him.<a name=390:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here this comes out in the way of-testimony, and Stephen says, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God".<a name=390:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point comes to light, and that is, the formative work of the Spirit in the believer, the life of Jesus was manifested in Stephen's mortal body.<a name=390:5></a> We see the character of Christ coming out in him; he was formed in moral likeness to Christ.<a name=390:6></a> The expression recorded here, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge", indicates the life of Jesus, and this was the effect of the formative work of the Spirit.<a name=390:7></a> And we get also the true significance of baptism.<a name=390:8></a> Stephen was stoned to death, he was literally baptised unto death.<a name=390:9></a> He left the earth, where there was no place for him.<a name=390:10></a> Do we desire now to get out of sight here?<a name=390:11></a> Are we content not to be prominent here; to be identified with Christ's death?<a name=390:12></a> If you get out of sight in identification with His death, you will come into sight, but in the likeness of His resurrection.<a name=390:13></a> When He comes into sight we shall come into sight.<a name=390:14></a> Our life now is <i>hid</i> with Christ in God, but when He who is our life is manifested we shall appear also with Him in glory.<a name=390:15></a> Stephen was completely identified with Christ in death; he gets out of sight, but the answer in him will be when Christ shall appear.<a name=390:16></a>

		There are three great testimonies of God's purpose which come out in Scripture with reference to man: the first is <i>of blessing</i>, the second of <i>dwelling</i>, and the third of <i>ruling</i>.<a name=392:7></a> The first, namely blessing, came out in the scriptures I have read; dwelling appears in connection with Israel; and ruling is typified in David.<a name=392:8></a> God has seen fit to identify Himself with a kingdom.<a name=392:9></a> He will reign.<a name=392:10></a> The Psalms look forward to Jehovah reigning: "Jehovah reigneth .<a name=392:11></a>.<a name=392:12></a>.<a name=392:13></a> He sitteth between the cherubim.<a name=392:14></a> Let the earth be moved".<a name=392:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of blessing we find came out at the very outset of man's history, long before Abraham.<a name=392:16></a> It was for this reason that I referred to Genesis, but the idea of dwelling did not come out until a figure of redemption is present, although it was ever, I suppose, in the mind of God: then the kingdom, the throne was set up in David, but evidently had in view David's Son.<a name=392:17></a> These are three great testimonies, but I purpose only to speak of one at present, but at the same time to shew that every testimony centres and rests in one point, and that is Christ; they all converge there.<a name=392:18></a>

		Now I turn to chapter 12, which comes in after the scattering of man.<a name=393:16></a> The importance of that passage is that it shews that God had not departed from His mind to bless, although the condition of blessing was altered.<a name=393:17></a> God says to Abraham, "in thee shall all families of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the passage in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3">Galatians  3</a>.<a name=394:14></a> After Abraham -- four hundred years -- another principle came in and that was law -- which brought a curse.<a name=394:15></a> There had been curse before; the ground had been cursed on account of man's sin.<a name=394:16></a> Curse is evidently the opposite of blessing.<a name=394:17></a> A man's curse is of small account, but if man is under the curse of God it is a bad prospect.<a name=394:18></a> If a man is cursed he will be thrust away from God like thorns.<a name=394:19></a>

		But Israel, when the Lord came to them, being far away in heart and spirit from God, had no sense of favour or blessing from God; but a wonderful thing had come to pass in the presence here of the Lord Jesus, and that was that the vessel of God's blessing was on earth.<a name=395:3></a> We could not, I think, speak of Christ as being blessed, for He was the <i>Blesser</i>.<a name=395:4></a> The Son had become Man, and was thus the vessel of God's blessing for man.<a name=395:5></a> The little company who were gathered around Christ were greatly blessed.<a name=395:6></a> They were in the midst of an apostate people, but by the fact of being in the company of the Lord they must have been conscious of being blessed, and that more than they could have described to you.<a name=395:7></a> They had instinctively, I imagine, a sense of the favour of God; they could not have explained their experience, but still we read they "contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father".<a name=395:8></a> They could not have been in the company of such an one without having the sense of being blessed.<a name=395:9></a>

		I pass on to the passage in Galatians.<a name=395:10></a> "That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus?<a name=395:11></a>" I shall touch here on two points.<a name=395:12></a> (1) That the vessel of blessing needed to be adequate -- that is, One who was in the communion of God's thought.<a name=395:13></a> The vessel of blessing must be naturally acquainted with the divine purpose to bless.<a name=395:14></a> No one therefore but the Son of God could be the vessel of blessing.<a name=395:15></a> (2) He must also be one who could take away the curse which stood in the way of blessing, and that is what we get here, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us": and mark the consequence, "that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus".<a name=395:16></a>

		Now I see three truths which necessarily come in that we may have part in the blessing and be conscious of being blessed.<a name=396:1></a> We need to know (1) the God of resurrection; (2) the vessel of blessing; and (3) the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=396:2></a> Now with regard to the first; all that I have in this world is limited to me by <i>death</i>.<a name=396:3></a> When a man dies, his genius and acquirements and everything pass away from him; and if I am to be conscious of blessing from God I need to be acquainted with the God of resurrection -- the living God who can <i>make alive</i> the dead.<a name=396:4></a> (God <i>raises</i> the wicked, but it is never said save as to blessing that God makes alive.<a name=396:5></a>) Nothing can be more essential to us, being liable to death as we are, than that we should have faith in the God who raises the dead.<a name=396:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our consciousness of blessing depends likewise upon our <i>nearness to the vessel of blessing</i> -- like the disciple who leaned on the bosom of Jesus.<a name=396:7></a> We are conscious of blessing as we are near to Him.<a name=396:8></a> The vessel of blessing not only died for us, but He is Priest for us.<a name=396:9></a> God blesses through Christ, and to be conscious of blessing means to be near to Him.<a name=396:10></a> I ask, Why should you not be near to Christ, when He came into death that you might be?<a name=396:11></a> If we were near to Him, how conscious we should be of favour; God has associated us with the vessel of blessing.<a name=396:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But not only are we near to the vessel of His pleasure, but the Spirit has been given that saints may be formed according to Him.<a name=396:13></a> One great work of the Holy Spirit is to subdue, and another is to form saints according to the pattern of the heavenly Man.<a name=396:14></a> All God's ways looked forward to the vessel of blessing, and the Holy Spirit has come down to form us according to the image of that vessel.<a name=396:15></a>

		Thus the unvarying purpose of God's ways from the beginning was to bless, and nothing that has come in in this world's history has diverted Him from His purpose: He has blessed and will bless.<a name=397:2></a> I ask, Can there be anything wanting for us if we stand blessed of Him?<a name=397:3></a> "We have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=397:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three principal thoughts connected with God's testimonies, and these all rest in the heavenly city, and there is nothing revealed beyond that.<a name=398:3></a> There is a point where every testimony of God rests, where all that God has given witness to is displayed, and this point is the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=398:4></a> The Old Testament saints could not fully understand the testimonies of God, for they did not apprehend where they all centred.<a name=398:5></a> God gave them a measure of light and glimpses of His purpose, but with us the day has dawned and the day-star has arisen in our hearts; this was not the case with those who went before.<a name=398:6></a> When the time of display comes, the Sun of righteousness will arise with healing in His wings.<a name=398:7></a> Christianity is different to this: to us the Sun of righteousness has not arisen, but we have in the day-star the light of all God's testimonies.<a name=398:8></a> The heavenly Jerusalem is the proper resting-place of these; you get there the display of everything testified of.<a name=398:9></a> The nations will walk in the light of the heavenly city.<a name=398:10></a> Men are in darkness now; they stumble over this thing and that thing; but there will be no dark infidelity in that day, for all that is of God will be in display.<a name=398:11></a>

		We saw last time the truth that God purposed to bless; what He did at the beginning of the creation in Adam, He reiterated in Abraham, and the blessing has reached the gentiles in Christ Jesus.<a name=398:12></a> Now I desire to speak of God dwelling, and you could not have a greater security

		for blessing than the fact of God dwelling.<a name=399:1></a> In proof of this I draw attention to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:4">Revelation  21:4</a>: "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away".<a name=399:2></a> This speaks of the blessing and happiness of the time when God will dwell with men.<a name=399:3></a> The presence of God among men must bring the greatest possible security for blessing; therefore the thought of God dwelling is an advance on that of God blessing.<a name=399:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, because it is there that we get the first definite idea of God dwelling; we get an allusion to it in chapter 15 in the expression: "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in"; but in chapter 25 we get the injunction to Moses to prepare for God a sanctuary, that He might dwell among the children of Israel.<a name=399:5></a> Everything for the sanctuary was to be taken from the people; it is not here the thought of God preparing for Himself a sanctuary; for all was to be taken from men; but God would dwell among men.<a name=399:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But previously to this the law had been given, and I believe we get in that an intimation of the principle upon which God's dwelling among men depends, and that is that man should be morally a reflex of Himself.<a name=399:7></a> Redemption had, of course, to be accomplished, but the fact upon which all hangs is the incarnation -- that the Son of God should become Man -- which was the prelude to the law being written in the heart of man.<a name=399:8></a> The law was given on tables of stone, but in the mind of God Christ was in view, and the new covenant in which the law is written on the heart of man; and I believe it is on the ground of this that God says, "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them".<a name=399:9></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the midst of Israel you get therefore in the way of testimony the fact that God dwelt among men.<a name=400:2></a> The tabernacle was much more important in this respect than the temple.<a name=400:3></a> The temple came in when the people had come into the land and the kingdom was established; then, too, God dwelt among His people -- but it had not the same force of testimony.<a name=400:4></a>

		I pass on now to <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:18">John  2:18</a> - 22.<a name=400:5></a> Here we get a great advance.<a name=400:6></a> The thought is no longer of a material temple, but still of the dwelling of God in the way of testimony.<a name=400:7></a> God was veiled when Christ was here: you could not speak of display; it was God dwelling here in the way of testimony.<a name=400:8></a> Christ spoke of His body as the temple of God.<a name=400:9></a> The Father was there, and the Holy Spirit was there; the Father who dwelt in Him did the works, and Christ acted in the power of the Holy Spirit; it was God here in the way of testimony.<a name=400:10></a> There could be no greater proof of the grace of God than that in Christ God should present Himself in this way.<a name=400:11></a> God in Him had come close to man; the Father's words and works were there, and the energy of evil subdued in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=400:12></a> In thinking of the Lord when here, you must remember that the glory of God was veiled in a servant's form; but at the same time the fulness of the Godhead was there, <i>not</i> in display, but in the way of testimony.<a name=400:13></a>

		Evil has come in, and if God's purposes are to be established on earth, there must be rule, and the object of God's rule is the subjugation of every enemy both of God and man, and thus I judge in the eternal state there will not be the thought of reigning, because when every enemy has been put down the kingdom will be given up to the moral supremacy of God, which will be fully established, so that God may be all in all.<a name=404:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would call your attention for a moment to the place and importance which cities have in Scripture.<a name=404:2></a> I think a city in Scripture is the symbol of imperial rule, of a power which rules over kingdoms; so in the book of Revelation, Babylon is viewed as a great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth; and in blessed contrast to it we have the heavenly city, and that too is imperial, for the throne of God and the Lamb are in it.<a name=404:3></a> You will find too in Scripture that when one city is in the ascendant, another city is out of sight for the time being; for instance, when Jerusalem was in the ascendant, Babylon had no place; on the other hand, when Babylon was in supremacy, Jerusalem was in a state of ruin and desolation.<a name=404:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God never allowed the two cities to be prominent at the same time.<a name=404:5></a> In the history of the church we can see the same principle.<a name=404:6></a> When the church will be in the ascendant, Babylon will have no place -- her place will not be found at all.<a name=404:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I return to the passage I read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>.<a name=404:8></a> The thought of man, even at that early time, was imperialism.<a name=404:9></a> Man intended to have a city, and the principle which budded then came out fully afterwards in Babylon.<a name=404:10></a> Babel was the definite assertion of man's will, and the principles which you get in the book of Genesis, although small as a grain of mustard seed, come out in full in the book of Revelation.<a name=404:11></a> You see them there in their tremendous development.<a name=404:12></a>

		But I want to shew you that that which follows close upon these things has been testified of God all through Scripture, and I would press the fact that every testimony of God has now been brought to a point of rest, to the glory of God, and that all that remains is the display of His purpose.<a name=405:3></a> We have come to the great vessel of testimony -- to the heavenly city (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a>) -- where all is displayed.<a name=405:4></a> It is a wonderful moment in the history of the soul, when it sees that every testimony centres in the heavenly city, in that Jerusalem above which is free, and is our mother.<a name=405:5></a> We then take our character from it, as a child takes character from its mother; when we come to the heavenly city we find that there is nothing in it but Christ.<a name=405:6></a> In the first place you get full <i>blessing</i>.<a name=405:7></a> "There shall be no more curse": this is the full accomplishment of God's long-standing purpose.<a name=405:8></a> God has been bent upon blessing from the outset, but at the time when this was first made known there was no resting place for the blessing; no vessel competent to carry it, but yet Abraham saw Christ's day and was glad, and "he looked for a city which hath foundations" -- a city in which the testimony of God could rest.<a name=405:9></a> The important point now is that what Abraham looked for we have come to, and we are the children of it.<a name=405:10></a>

		The next testimony of God was His purpose to <i>dwell</i>, and this came out, as we previously said, in connection with the giving of the law.<a name=405:11></a> When the law is written in the hearts of Israel, and man thus becomes morally the reflex of God, then it is that God will fulfil His purpose

		Now I come to the next point, which is God's purpose to <i>rule</i>.<a name=406:5></a> This comes out in connection with David.<a name=406:6></a> It is clear that the last testimony is essential to the other two, because if God is to bless and to dwell, then everything contrary to it must be put down.<a name=406:7></a> He must by His power subjugate all that is not according to His mind.<a name=406:8></a> This is foreshadowed in David.<a name=406:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>we find that God turned away from Shiloh, but He chose Zion, and took David from the sheepfold to be the ruler of His people.<a name=406:10></a> Jerusalem is called the "city of the great King".<a name=406:11></a> Christ, not Solomon, was the true Son of David; so when you come to the beginning of the New Testament you see how carefully the genealogy of Christ is traced down, and the Lord Jesus is presented as the seed of David after the flesh.<a name=406:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21">Matthew  21</a>we find that the Lord rode into Jerusalem as David's Son according to prophecy, and by doing so He claimed the kingdom, and it is a point of vital moment that the Lord here claims the kingdom in testimony.<a name=406:13></a> The result of His rejection was that Jerusalem was destroyed, and from that time has been trodden down by the gentiles, and Babylon is in ascendancy.<a name=406:14></a> But to faith another thing has come into view, and that is the <i>heavenly city</i> -- a sure proof that Babylon will have to go.<a name=406:15></a> The heavenly city is the place where God's purpose to rule has found its rest.<a name=406:16></a> Now we have come to it (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>), and as we apprehend it we are formed for rule.<a name=406:17></a> As an illustration, take the Prince of Wales; it is according to the established course of things that he will in time

		There is this connected with the Son of God, that every promise is now established in Him.<a name=409:1></a> The promises of God had relation to man, whatever they were.<a name=409:2></a> They regarded man, and therefore, in order that these promises might be effectual, they need to be centred at a point from which God could affect and subdue man, for it was impossible that God's promises could be brought to pass if it were not in God's power to affect man according to Himself; but that is what God <i>has</i> proved His power and ability to do; it is in the Son of God that all the promises of God are yea and Amen.<a name=409:3></a> If you look for a moment at these promises, they related both to Jew and gentile.<a name=409:4></a> The great promise to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed", had relation to the gentile as well as to the Jew, and so, many other passages in the Old Testament relate to the gentile.<a name=409:5></a> There are ample promises to the Jew, and at the same time rich promises for the gentile.<a name=409:6></a> Christ is to be the Head of the heathen: "a people whom I have not known shall serve me".<a name=409:7></a> There are abundant promises for the gentiles, in Christ.<a name=409:8></a> The great promise to Abraham was connected with blessing, but we have also foreshadowed the complete victory over the power of evil -- the head of the serpent was to be bruised; then there is, too, the promise of the new covenant -- man was to be morally a reflex of God; and when that came to pass, God would dwell among men.<a name=409:9></a> And we have also the purpose of God to reign.<a name=409:10></a> God Himself was going to take the kingdom.<a name=409:11></a> God had the kingdom, in a sense, when David reigned in Jerusalem.<a name=409:12></a> Then, when the line of David became completely unfaithful, and God had to break with them, power was put for the time into the hands of the gentiles, and we have the times of the

		The great point of chapter 15 is vitality as shown by our affections one to another; so in fruit-bearing there is proof of vitality.<a name=445:3></a> I think you must begin with that, Christ dwelling in the heart by faith, the affection of a bride for a bridegroom, of a wife for her husband, that is properly the position of the church down here, you want all your affections put in order and strengthened and maintained.<a name=445:4></a> People put the social before the meetings; if Christ were dwelling in the heart by faith we would be devoted to every interest of Christ down here.<a name=445:5></a> I do believe we would get on a great deal better if we let everything be secondary to Christ "ye believe on God, believe also on me", the bride comes down as the public witness but in the meantime the bride is left down here as witness to the bridegroom.<a name=445:6></a> We do not live in ourselves, it marked the Lord, but no one of us can have life in himself.<a name=445:7></a> All vitality is by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=445:8></a> If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit.<a name=445:9></a> Vitality comes out in the way of fruit-bearing; fruit-bearing is for God.<a name=445:10></a> It comes out in our relations one to another, it is the product of the Spirit of Christ, fruit really consists in what characterises our relations one to another in love and joy.<a name=445:11></a> I think saints are trees of God's planting.<a name=445:12></a> The peculiarity in an ordinary tree is that it lives by itself, but saints do not carry their life in themselves, Christ is the source of fruit.<a name=445:13></a> It all depends on our abiding in Christ.<a name=445:14></a>

		The subject which is before me tonight is the throne of God.<a name=449:1></a> It is important enough in a way; I refer to it in the moral aspect not the dispensational aspect.<a name=449:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The throne of God, how it is established and also a few words in regard of the moral government of God, are points of the last moment with regard to us, the person who does not seek to order himself according to them is not wise.<a name=449:3></a> Job was defective in regard of the moral government of God and that led him into trouble, it was that which led me to read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#34">Psalm  34</a>, it is wonderful to me how the language of such a psalm should be applicable to us.<a name=449:4></a> We do not occupy David's position, we are a humble people down here, yet his language is perfectly applicable to us.<a name=449:5></a> The throne is not yet set forth and when it is, the language of that psalm will not be applicable.<a name=449:6></a> Though the throne is not set forth yet, it is prepared and it is important in regard of us.<a name=449:7></a> If I speak of the moral government of God it was always true and the point is that the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and His ears open to their cry.<a name=449:8></a> What can be more important in regard of us?<a name=449:9></a> Who do you think the righteous are?<a name=449:10></a> I should say those who admit the rights of God.<a name=449:11></a> In the Old Testament justification had not come in but you can see how often the righteous come in.<a name=449:12></a> In christianity the believer is righteous, he acknowledges the rights of God, the lawless are those who do not admit them now.<a name=449:13></a> If the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous you are worse off than the wicked; they are allowed to go pretty much their own way but the righteous are compelled to order their conduct in regard of the rights of God, so the righteous cannot do wrong.<a name=449:14></a> The lawless man is independent, he is not in any orbit and has not to answer anything.<a name=449:15></a> If the ways of the righteous are not

		God will not answer prayer just at the moment you expect because God will not humour your thoughts.<a name=450:2></a> The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil, they may do it for a very long time.<a name=450:3></a> He may allow it for a long time yet the face of the Lord is against them and He will blot them out.<a name=450:4></a> To see this necessitates patience on the part of the saint as in Job the Lord came in after due time and relieved Job and he had twice as much as before.<a name=450:5></a> The apostle is the one who brings out the moral government of God; in this chapter the Lord inspects your way, your doings, do not be afraid of approaching Him and do not be disappointed if you do not get an answer at once.<a name=450:6></a> I have known what it is to cry in deep exercise and not to get the answer at once, but remember the face of the Lord is against them that do evil and a time is coming when their remembrance will be blotted out.<a name=450:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the throne it is an expression which implies the moral government of God in heaven.<a name=450:8></a> It is not yet set forth but it is established, that is what I want to make plain tonight.<a name=450:9></a> Look at <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom".<a name=450:10></a> Now when that psalm was written it was all prophetic, no part was fulfilled -- it was "touching the king".<a name=450:11></a> Regarding the throne it is the throne established, the throne of God but established in a Man.<a name=450:12></a> You could get no public government of God except in a man.<a name=450:13></a> How could the government of God be appreciated in this world except in a man?<a name=450:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>you get the Man of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>.<a name=450:15></a> It is no longer prophetic.<a name=450:16></a> You get in the beginning of Hebrews "unto the Son he saith, thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever".<a name=450:17></a> He has inherited a more excellent name than angels, in Him the throne of God is established so that God can come out in public government in the world, but if God must come out in public, of necessity
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=451>[Page 451]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He must establish His throne.<a name=451:1></a> In the second chapter you get this, but veiled, the One in whom it is established is in heaven.<a name=451:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look now at verse 5, chapter 1 "I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son".<a name=451:3></a> What is in connection with the One in whom it is established is that He is in relation to God as Son, so it was said to Israel, "Israel is my son, my firstborn"; so I can understand this saying when spoken in regard of Christ "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=451:4></a> The throne is established in that One.<a name=451:5></a> You see the relation between the One in whom the throne is established to God and it brings in love, the thought of God, into the kingdom "the kingdom of the Son of his love".<a name=451:6></a> So He can say "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever".<a name=451:7></a> Now I understand this to refer to the pathway of Christ here upon earth: He loved righteousness -- everything that was according to the rights of God.<a name=451:8></a> On the other hand He hated lawlessness and so He establishes what He loves -- righteousness -- and puts away and removes what He hated.<a name=451:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the next point, the basis of the throne, the establishment of righteousness and the removal of lawlessness.<a name=451:10></a> Now in verses 10 and 11, the One in whom the throne is established is "the same"; everything else changes, the earth will be removed, but He does not grow old.<a name=451:11></a> David grew old.<a name=451:12></a> We see the last days of David.<a name=451:13></a> Now the kingdom is established in the true Solomon and it will not be removed, it retains its character.<a name=451:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just touch those three points because it gives a character to everything.<a name=451:15></a> My point is that all is prepared, it is not yet set forth; the Man is there in whom the throne is established but that Man is for the moment hid within the veil.<a name=451:16></a> He has gone to heaven and is hid behind the veil of providences.<a name=451:17></a> Providences are not an expression of God and it does not do to judge God by His providences.<a name=451:18></a> God hides behind His providences but He will come out yet in His throne.<a name=451:19></a> It has been said

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool".<a name=452:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one word as to the effect.<a name=452:2></a> It brings in one important point, angels are put at the service of man.<a name=452:3></a> You see it in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>, an innumerable company of angels and they are ministering spirits sent forth to minister.<a name=452:4></a> The point is that we are not to be governed by providences, we are in the faith of the Lord.<a name=452:5></a> The throne is good to faith.<a name=452:6></a> It is not simply a question of the moral government but that we get the good and very great gain from the kingdom which is established in the throne in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=452:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a few points in connection with that: the Lord brings home to me the thought of throne, there is salvation in His name.<a name=452:8></a> I have believed in the Lord because I see that there is salvation in His name as the Philippian jailor did: "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved".<a name=452:9></a> Salvation is connected with the thought of the Lord.<a name=452:10></a> When God brings forth the kingdom it will be salvation to the people.<a name=452:11></a> Meanwhile it is salvation in the name of the Lord.<a name=452:12></a> Where do you get it?<a name=452:13></a> "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved".<a name=452:14></a> You believe in Him for righteousness as an object of faith, and salvation in the confession of Christ as Lord which can only be by the Holy Spirit.<a name=452:15></a> It is the confession of Christ as Lord that brings in the power of salvation.<a name=452:16></a> He has become a reality to you and by that fact you come into salvation.<a name=452:17></a> You are not really afraid of anything, of man, death or any power of evil and that is by the Lord being a reality to you, so that you confess Him as Lord and come into salvation.<a name=452:18></a> Next you cleave to the Lord with purpose of heart, He is indispensable and so I cleave to the Lord, as in the beginning they did.<a name=452:19></a> He is your protector and tower, and wisdom to you: "The name of the Lord is a strong tower".<a name=452:20></a> The next point is to rejoice in the Lord, and that continually increases, you rejoice

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next you look for His appearing, for the crown of righteousness will be given to you.<a name=453:6></a> Your righteousness will become manifest, that is the crown, every christian should look for the appearing of the Lord.<a name=453:7></a> I quite admit a christian getting under a cloud, but we should all look for the appearing of the Lord, which brings to you the crown.<a name=453:8></a> Would you not like your righteousness to become manifest?<a name=453:9></a> I should like it.<a name=453:10></a> Mind you I do not mean your righteous conduct but our righteousness in the sense of our relation to Christ and the Lord.<a name=453:11></a> What does it mean, my saying to people in the world I am righteous?<a name=453:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one point more.<a name=453:13></a> That is that if you love the appearing of the Lord you will be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and so be able to stand against the power and reality of evil in the world.<a name=453:14></a> Some people do not believe in the existence of the devil because they do not believe in the Lord.<a name=453:15></a> The more the Lord is a reality to us the more we are conscious of the power of evil.<a name=453:16></a> It is a great thing to stand in the present day.<a name=453:17></a> I see a great many things abroad -- infidelity, superstition and other things, but they do not terrify me.<a name=453:18></a> We would not be really strong in the Lord unless we had on the whole armour of God, able to resist these things.<a name=453:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I touch on these points so that we may be in accord with the moral government of God, the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous.<a name=453:20></a> The result will be you will not be troubled or fret yourself, but wait patiently for the Lord, because, remember, you get the gain of the throne.<a name=453:21></a> Salvation is connected with the Lord and you cleave to

		Probably the existence of God would not be denied by such, but I am wholly at a loss to understand of what moral value the existence of God is to man, if God is not revealed.<a name=462:4></a> It is remarkable in the opposers of revelation what an absence there is of moral ideas.<a name=462:5></a> One hears little of such thoughts as righteousness, holiness, peace, etc.<a name=462:6></a>, and this is not wonderful when, practically for them, there is no God; for such thoughts manifestly have reference to a God who is and is revealed.<a name=462:7></a> God is known as righteous and holy, and hence the ideas of righteousness and holiness in man come in.<a name=462:8></a> The "higher life" which is spoken of, is apart from any true or certain moral ideas, for it is without any real fixed standard of right and wrong, for this cannot possibly be without some light from God.<a name=462:9></a> No kind of agreement among cultured men could fix a <i>permanent</i> standard of right and wrong.<a name=462:10></a> Thus the absence of such simple ideas as righteousness and holiness in the thoughts of those who reject the idea of revelation, is readily explained.<a name=462:11></a> My point is to make manifest the utter hopelessness of man in regard of moral things apart from light from God.<a name=462:12></a> And to think that genius, or philosophic ideas, or scientific knowledge, is light from God, is a delusion, for in this, even according to man, there is too much uncertainty, and the life of those in whom these things are seen, is often morally defective enough, judged even by the standard which exists in the mind of man.<a name=462:13></a>

		Many christians are, alas!<a name=468:4></a> in bondage, and there are two reasons for this.<a name=468:5></a> The first is that they have but a very poor apprehension of the counsel of God's love, and the other hangs upon this, that they tolerate to a large extent the flesh, and what they tolerate becomes their scourge; they find the flesh continually clinging to something natural; they perhaps give too much place to objects of natural affection, and that may hinder the soul and keep it in bondage.<a name=468:6></a> The contrast to this comes out here in type, Isaac is weaned, he is separated from the natural, and then it is that the counsel of God is revealed in him.<a name=468:7></a> And so, too, all God's counsel in regard of us is revealed in Christ apart from the flesh, and God has given us the power by which that counsel can be effectuated in us, the well of water which springs up in us to eternal life, and as the well of water springs up, the rule of the flesh is refused.<a name=468:8></a>

		In taking up this part of the gospel we have to look at it in respect of those to whom the words were immediately spoken, but it is important not to limit our thoughts to those only, but to see how they apply to us.<a name=475:1></a> We want to find their bearing as regards us; it is plain that the things spoken of were not for the apostles only, but of a permanent character.<a name=475:2></a> For instance, the presence of the Comforter was not for them only, but surely for us.<a name=475:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a primary reference to the disciples, but the principles apply equally to us, because we are left here m the absence of Christ.<a name=475:4></a> Christianity is, as it were, based upon two things: the absence of Christ and the presence of the Comforter, and these were the things that were announced to the disciples first in these chapters.<a name=475:5></a> Christ announces to them, "I go", and that the Comforter was coming and He "abides".<a name=475:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Comforter is here in Person, He is not merely an influence, and if Christ is <i>absent</i>, it is just as equally true that the Comforter is <i>present</i>.<a name=475:7></a> Chapter 13 shows our weakness, but chapter 14 shows our strength.<a name=475:8></a> The apostle could say, "When I am weak, then am I strong"; it is a paradox, and yet every christian quite understands the meaning of it.<a name=475:9></a> The Lord does not hide either the one or the other; in chapter 13 He shows out their weakness, and in chapter 14 the elements of their strength and the same elements of strength belong to us, and they have been proved for nearly two thousand years.<a name=475:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		They are elements of positive strength to God's people, so that though weak we are strong.<a name=475:11></a> So the apostle says to Timothy, "Be <i>strong</i> in the grace that is in Christ Jesus".<a name=475:12></a> With regard to the change seen in the beginning of chapter 13, everything combined for a great change, and it has much to do with the "weakness".<a name=475:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the counsels of God are goodness; the Son of man was to be glorified in God.<a name=476:3></a> In regard of the disciples, the case was that they were to be left in a defiling world, and their fidelity to Christ and to one another was tested; that showed their weakness -- they were to wash one another's feet, that brings out their weakness.<a name=476:4></a> We are weak by our susceptibility to be influenced by the world, and many of us would own how poorly we carry out the obligation to wash one another's feet, and that shows our weakness.<a name=476:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what are the elements of our strength in chapter 14?<a name=476:6></a> The first element of strength to us is faith in Christ, we must remember that that was spoken to a little company that Christ Himself had gathered; <i>He</i> had chosen them, and not they Him, and He was about to leave them.<a name=476:7></a> He had been content with their company here below -- it might have been dull company perhaps, but He was content with it, for it was the company that <i>He chose</i>.<a name=476:8></a> How blessed!<a name=476:9></a> He was content with them, He knew them perfectly, for He knew all that was in man; but the Lord had had pleasure and delight in their company; and now He was going to leave them, but He was going to continue to think of them.<a name=476:10></a> He was not going to forget them, "that where I am, there ye may be also".<a name=476:11></a> The Lord has chosen <i>us</i>, He has pleasure in our company: so that the first element of our strength is <i>faith</i> in Him -- that He has chosen us and has pleasure in us.<a name=476:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great things for the christian connected with the presence of the Comforter -- first, that by Him we live in Christ, and, secondly, that by Him Christ has His expression in christians.<a name=477:8></a> Stephen was just about to die, he had incurred the hatred of the Jews, and he could see what was before him from them, but he saw Jesus in glory, and he lived because Christ lived, he knew his life in this scene was but for a moment, he says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit".<a name=477:9></a> My life in this scene is not really now my life -- as the apostle could say, "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God".<a name=477:10></a> I live because Christ lives, so it was with Stephen, he saw Jesus, and we too see Him by the Spirit, and we live because He lives.<a name=477:11></a> He was going up on high, and He intended to be present here in word and work in His own, just as "the Father", He could say, "that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works".<a name=477:12></a> Christ is here now characteristically; He comes out in His people in word

		Now the next point of strength is that Christ will manifest Himself to them, but this is conditional, you must keep His commandment, and Christ is the great commandment for His people; you must have Christ before you, you cannot do your own will if you have Christ before you, and then He can manifest Himself to you, so we see in many instances in the New Testament, as when the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord, so also when they went fishing, and the Lord came to them and said, "Cast the net on the right side".<a name=478:5></a> So also did He manifest Himself to the two going to Emmaus, when He was known to them in the breaking of bread.<a name=478:6></a> It tallies with the thought that has been given out in connection with "gift" that it is some divinely given impression of Christ -- so is this manifestation to the one who loves and keeps His commandment.<a name=478:7></a> Now we get another element of strength in verse 23.<a name=478:8></a> The Father and the Son make their abode with the one who keeps the word of Christ.<a name=478:9></a> The thought in keeping the word of Christ is the separation in heart and spirit from the world, whereas in keeping the commandment of Christ it is separation from all that is of the flesh.<a name=478:10></a> The Father and Son abiding in you involves complete separation from all that is of the world, because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world.<a name=478:11></a> Connected with this is the thought of the <i>Father's love</i>, whereas with regard to Christ it is the <i>salvation</i> which is in Christ Jesus, and thus the two make their continuance

		THE ROOT AND OFFSPRING OF DAVID

		It is important to see the light in which Jesus presents Himself in this passage.<a name=480:1></a> It contains His last words to us, spoken when in heaven.<a name=480:2></a> He speaks of what He is, and not of what He was, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star;" nothing can be more important than to have Jesus before us as a living Person in heaven, as Peter says, "Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him".<a name=480:3></a> When He says, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star", it is to attract our hearts.<a name=480:4></a> There are many men in the world who are attractive, and who draw attention, some in one way and some in another; but here we get the attraction of Jesus.<a name=480:5></a> Remember He is coming; if He stayed in heaven men would not care, but He is coming, and that in response to a call; "The Spirit and the bride say, Come", and it is because they say "Come" that He comes.<a name=480:6></a> This is wonderful language, "I am the root .<a name=480:7></a>.<a name=480:8></a>.<a name=480:9></a> of David".<a name=480:10></a> If it were only the offspring, Solomon might have been that, but here is the root of David.<a name=480:11></a> A root is the spring or source.<a name=480:12></a> Things in the world spring from a root, but Christ says, "I am the root .<a name=480:13></a>.<a name=480:14></a>.<a name=480:15></a> of David".<a name=480:16></a> It might indeed be said with equal truth that He was the root of Abraham, "Before Abraham was I am".<a name=480:17></a> He was the root of every saint we read of in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=480:18></a> There we get many different saints, but each drew from the root.<a name=480:19></a> Abel was an offerer; Enoch was a walker, he walked with God; Noah was a preacher and a builder; Abraham was a pilgrim and stranger; Moses was a deliverer; David was a shepherd and warrior, he fed God's people and fought against God's enemies; all these drew from the root; whatever was of value in any

		But He is also the offspring of David, and that brings in the thought of the kingdom, because the kingdom was to be established in the Son of David; He is God's King.<a name=481:9></a> Two things marked David as a king; he was a pastor of the sheep, and he exposed himself to danger on their behalf.<a name=481:10></a> He it was who went against Goliath and slew him.<a name=481:11></a> He exposed himself, and he fed the sheep, and had the kingdom.<a name=481:12></a> Jesus is the Offspring of David; He is the blessed Root of all that is according to God, and the One who is to take the kingdom, and He will reign for ever and ever.<a name=481:13></a> It is important to think of Him as coming to take the kingdom, and it will not pass out of His hand.<a name=481:14></a>

		But more, He is the bright and morning Star.<a name=481:15></a> In the Old Testament He is spoken of prophetically as the Sun of righteousness .<a name=481:16></a>.<a name=481:17></a>.<a name=481:18></a> "Shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings".<a name=481:19></a> No one can doubt the reference to Jesus.<a name=481:20></a> He is the Sun of the whole moral system.<a name=481:21></a> The system of this world is all in confusion, but there is a moral system which at present is hidden; but God will put aside the veil of providence, and will make Himself known in a universe of bliss; the Sun of righteousness will rise with healing in His wings.<a name=481:22></a> The morning Star is the herald of the day when the Sun of righteousness will arise.<a name=481:23></a> When the sun has risen the day has come, but before then the morning star is seen as the herald of the day.<a name=481:24></a> Jesus is the Bridegroom who will take up everything for God.<a name=481:25></a> God has rights, the earth belongs to Him and all that dwell therein; Israel is His people, and Christ will take up all for God, and that is all bound up with the rising of the Sun of righteousness.<a name=481:26></a>

		Jesus is the Root of all that is for God, but He works everything in man by His Spirit, He bore all that was due to man that He might give us living water.<a name=482:11></a> Fruit is the evidence of life and health, and Christ gives the Spirit that we may bring forth fruit; He accomplished righteousness to that end, and in Galatians we find what are the fruits of the Spirit, they are brought forth in us if we are rooted in Christ, otherwise there is no fruit; there may be works, but not life or fruits.<a name=482:12></a> If we have living water from Christ, knowing that He has accomplished righteousness that we might have it, then we can say to Him, Come!<a name=482:13></a> Christ presents all His attractions to us to woo our hearts -- how do we answer?<a name=482:14></a> We say, Come!<a name=482:15></a> He is coming to dispel the darkness, to establish the kingdom, to bring in the light of God, so that there may be fruit for God.<a name=482:16></a> Are we saying, Come?<a name=482:17></a> Things in this world are disappointing enough: we brought nothing into this world and can carry nothing out; a man cannot carry his riches or glory or reputation with him, he goes into a scene where they have no place, where he will stand before God naked.<a name=482:18></a> But Christ can give us of

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another appeal: Jesus says, "Let him that is athirst come".<a name=483:4></a> Is there anyone not satisfied?<a name=483:5></a> The best things of this world are only husks, they do not contain real food.<a name=483:6></a> Man needs to be satisfied with divine goodness; Christ is bread out of heaven, and so He says to any one who is not satisfied, "Let him come".<a name=483:7></a> There is no man in the world to whom Jesus does not appeal; He gave Himself a ransom for all, and therefore He has the right to appeal to every man, whoever he may be, "Let him take the water of life freely".<a name=483:8></a> Whoever will may come and drink of living water without money and without price.<a name=483:9></a>

		FRUIT-BEARING

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:1">John  15:1</a> - 17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see from this passage that we as believers have to bring forth fruit to God here on earth.<a name=484:1></a> He expects us to bear fruit, for it is that to which, if I may say so, God is fully entitled.<a name=484:2></a> We expect from a tree that it should bear fruit, and if fruit is there it is the proof that the tree is in good condition.<a name=484:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the old covenant, Israel had this place on earth towards God.<a name=484:4></a> As a result of the blessings and the privileges with which God had favoured them, they should have borne fruit to Him and He was certainly entitled to expect fruit, but His earthly people did not glorify Him.<a name=484:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord came, as we know, and looked for fruit from Israel, but nothing remained for Him except to curse the fruitless fig-tree.<a name=484:6></a> "Let there be never more fruit of thee for ever".<a name=484:7></a> Israel according to the flesh has not borne fruit for God, and from the words of the Lord mentioned before, we see that the flesh is not at all able to do this, but in spite of this Israel will bear fruit for God in the future in association with Christ.<a name=484:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it is a question of fruit-bearing, two things are necessary in the first place, namely, light and rain.<a name=484:9></a> The earth brings forth fruit because it moves in the light of the sun and receives rain from heaven.<a name=484:10></a> So it was with Israel, and so it is with us.<a name=484:11></a> Israel was called to enjoy the light and the blessing of God, to bring forth fruit for Him and to glorify Him, and so also should we bear fruit for God.<a name=484:12></a> Without the light of our Sun and rain from heaven, we could bear no fruit for God, and who is our Sun if not the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God?<a name=484:13></a> Then the rain is the gracious service of Christ for our souls.<a name=484:14></a> It is only then if we stand in the light of the sun, that is the Son of God, and nourish ourselves on

		Him as the living bread that we bear fruit for God.<a name=485:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God Himself is our Sun.<a name=485:2></a> He came down out of heaven to effect redemption for us.<a name=485:3></a> All had come under the power of the law, all had died, but He has given Himself as a ransom for all; and, after He had completed the work of redemption, He went back to heaven.<a name=485:4></a> But He did not go back to heaven as He came out of heaven.<a name=485:5></a> He has gone back there as <i>Man</i> and we stand through faith in the light of Christ as the Sun of righteousness.<a name=485:6></a> But then we enjoy the rain from heaven, that is, the supply of the grace of Christ, and we are in this way capacitated to bear fruit for God.<a name=485:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look at the two previous chapters, we find that in a certain way they prepare the way for that which is unfolded in our chapter.<a name=485:8></a> Feet-washing precedes fruit-bearing.<a name=485:9></a> It is only when we correspond with the thoughts of God in our relations with one another that we can bear fruit for God.<a name=485:10></a> We see in chapter 13 that the Lord lays upon His own the responsibility to wash one another's feet.<a name=485:11></a> He said "If <i>I</i> therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, <i>ye</i> also ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given you an example that, as <i>I</i> have done to you, <i>ye</i> should do also".<a name=485:12></a> It is a question therefore here of our obligation towards one another as saints.<a name=485:13></a> We should not forget that refreshment is included in the thought of feet-washing.<a name=485:14></a> We are obligated to refresh one another and how could we do this otherwise than by presenting Christ in our contact with one another?<a name=485:15></a> In this way we serve one another and any defilements that we have contracted on our way through this world will be removed.<a name=485:16></a> Each one is responsible to serve his brother with a view to blessing and refreshment, so that through feet-washing what is of Christ is set out amongst us.<a name=485:17></a> When the Lord washed the feet of the disciples, it soon became apparent who among them was committed to Him.<a name=485:18></a> The christian circle, if I may say so, came to light when the traitor was exposed.<a name=485:19></a> Through feet-washing,

		<a name=486>[Page 486]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		those whose hearts do not beat for Christ become apparent; for they soon prove that in reality they are not interested in such a service.<a name=486:1></a> They do not need to be refreshed by someone approaching them with the grace of Christ, because their hearts are too much taken up with the things of the world.<a name=486:2></a> But on the other hand, this service finds a joyful response in each one whose heart is devoted to Christ.<a name=486:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like now to remark in passing how the hour of the deepest darkness precedes the most glorious day.<a name=486:4></a> We read here that when Judas has received the morsel he went out immediately and that it was night.<a name=486:5></a> It was indeed the darkest hour of the life of the Lord here below, but the brightest day follows the darkest hour.<a name=486:6></a> "When therefore he was gone out Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=486:7></a> If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately".<a name=486:8></a> The Son of man has glorified God; the glory of God is secured in Him, and as to His present place He is glorified in God.<a name=486:9></a> The moment approaches when He will be publicly glorified, but at the present time He is hidden in God and the Holy Spirit has come down to bring us the report of His being glorified in God and to bear witness of this here below through His saints.<a name=486:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The darkest hour is still to come for the world.<a name=486:11></a> I refer to that period of time in the history of the world which will be characterised by the fact that the woman (Babylon) sits on the beast (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#17">Revelation  17</a>).<a name=486:12></a> The harlot represents the great popish system and the beast is the Roman Empire.<a name=486:13></a> What follows now after this dark hour?<a name=486:14></a> The marriage of the Lamb.<a name=486:15></a> The dark hour of the ascendancy of Babylon precedes the brilliant morning of the revelation of the glory of Christ and of the assembly.<a name=486:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another word in this connection on chapter 14.<a name=486:17></a> We have seen that Christ is now glorified in God and this chapter sets the blessed consequences of that before our

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Until the Lord Jesus came there could really be no fruit for God.<a name=487:9></a> He was the Vine, the source, out of which fruit should come; but it does not exactly correspond with the truth if one says He bore fruit to God <i>here below</i>.<a name=487:10></a> The fruit is borne by the branches, as the Lord said to His disciples, "Ye are the branches", and again "<i>I</i> have chosen you, and have set you that <i>ye</i> should go and that ye should bear fruit, and that your fruit should abide".<a name=487:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"I am the true vine".<a name=487:12></a> Fruit must proceed from Christ Himself, as we also read, "From me is thy fruit found", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#14:8">Hosea  14:8</a>.<a name=487:13></a> Christ came to bring us life, and fruit demonstrates the presence of life and of healthiness.<a name=487:14></a> The christian then is in a healthy condition if he moves in the light of Jesus as the Sun of righteousness and if his soul drinks of the streams that are poured out of heaven.<a name=487:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not only do we see in Christ the source from which fruit for God comes, but we can also see in Him the true character of that which is good and pleasing in the sight of God.<a name=487:16></a> Everything in Him stood in complete contrast to that which was in men.<a name=487:17></a> <i>Love</i> was there, which went out to all, to His Father, as well as to the disciples and to those in need; He knew also how to draw joy out of deep wells, and <i>peace</i> always accompanied His path.<a name=487:18></a> It is true that He engaged in conflict against the whole power of the evil one, but within all was peace.<a name=487:19></a> Then we see <i>patience</i>, <i>kindness</i>, <i>graciousness</i> and indeed many other blessed features.<a name=487:20></a> Now all this may serve to give us

		It is this that in a believer is pleasing in the eyes of God, what He may expect to see in us; and "in this", said the Lord, "is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine".<a name=488:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our chapter teaches us in addition the way in which we are capacitated to bear fruit for God.<a name=488:3></a> Before everything, we abide in Christ.<a name=488:4></a> The earth never gets out of the light of the sun, and because it enjoys the light and the warmth of the sun in the first place it is able to bring forth fruit.<a name=488:5></a> Now God has called us out of darkness into His marvellous light.<a name=488:6></a> There is no doubt that there are sleeping christians, that is, those who have come under the influences of the world, but the Lord's word is suited for them, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a>.<a name=488:7></a> That is what every sleeping christian needs, namely, to come into the light of Christ and to move in the shining of the Sun of righteousness.<a name=488:8></a> Christ is coming and we should stand in the light of His appearing, and as to the manner He will shine forth as Sun of righteousness; "He is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:5">Psalm  19:5</a>.<a name=488:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the second place we are capacitated to bear fruit by His words abiding in us (verse 7).<a name=488:10></a> Through the words of the Lord we are both formed and led.<a name=488:11></a> The words of the Lord Jesus Christ are sound words (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:3">1 Timothy  6:3</a>) and suited to bring about that healthy condition of soul with us, which, as we have seen, lies at the foundation of fruit-bearing.<a name=488:12></a> It is necessary that His words abide in us; for by them we shall be brought above all to wish and to pray for what is from Him and for Him.<a name=488:13></a> "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you".<a name=488:14></a>

		In verse 13 the Lord pronounces a "Woe to thee" over Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum, cities in which most of His works of power had taken place.<a name=491:4></a> Then He says in verse 18, "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven".<a name=491:5></a> This has not all taken place actually, but I refer to the passages to show how we see here in a certain sense the one world disappear.<a name=491:6></a> Judgment has not yet come in and Satan has yet his place in heaven, but the moment of the overthrow of Satan was already present in the thoughts of the Lord.<a name=491:7></a>

		The activity of Satan comes into evidence throughout the world.<a name=491:8></a> The believer knows that idolatry, superstition, infidelity and all other evil influences to which men fall a prey are the sorrowful fruits of his activity.<a name=491:9></a> These are the serpents and scorpions of which the Lord speaks here, poisoning influences which work in a deadening way on the minds of men so that they become quite blunted and unimpressionable in relation to God.<a name=491:10></a> But the present evil age will come to an end after Satan has been cast out of heaven.<a name=491:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12:8">Revelation  12:8</a>, 9).<a name=491:12></a> The Lord pictured this moment to Himself when He said, "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven".<a name=491:13></a>

		This world to come, or the coming age, is as we have seen subjected under the feet of the Son of man.<a name=492:6></a> We find an indication of this already in our chapter.<a name=492:7></a> The Lord says "All things have been delivered to me by my Father".<a name=492:8></a> When we think of Christ, we should also think of a world which stands in connection with Him, indeed which is subjected to Him.<a name=492:9></a> We as believers do not view things as men of this world view them.<a name=492:10></a> It is clear to us that the present course of things must make way for the coming age, and so we see now already in principle in the Spirit the one world disappear whilst the other comes into view.<a name=492:11></a> The Lord has broken the power of Satan and the moment is approaching when he will actually be cast out of heaven.<a name=492:12></a> All this was before the eyes of the Lord when He uttered the words of our chapter.<a name=492:13></a>

		In the further course of the chapter, we find that the One to whom the Father has given all things has become man's neighbour.<a name=493:8></a> The Samaritan in the parable was the neighbour of the Jew who had fallen among robbers, but Christ in heaven is the real neighbour of man.<a name=493:9></a> The word signifies the relationship in which He stands to every man, although He is now hidden in heaven.<a name=493:10></a> We read that the Jews had no intercourse with the Samaritans, so that the one who had fallen among robbers could make no claim on the service of the Samaritan, and also man has no title to Christ, but it has pleased Him to take this place in relation to man and indeed not only now but also in the coming age.<a name=493:11></a> Christ will there stand in the same relationship to man upon the earth.<a name=493:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of the neighbour consists in the fact that he exercises mercy.<a name=493:13></a> Man has claim to nothing; it is just that Christ acts in mercy because He has become man's neighbour.<a name=493:14></a> It is an exceedingly blessed thought that the One who in Himself forms the centre of the world to come is the Sun of righteousness and also the merciful One.<a name=493:15></a> Man is entirely dependent upon mercy, for he has got away from God, fallen among robbers, is paralysed, come under the power of the law through sin and cannot help himself.<a name=493:16></a> But Christ has come upon the scene in order to bring mercy to man.<a name=493:17></a> In the coming age each will be debtor to Christ because of the mercy which He has exercised towards him.<a name=493:18></a> He will put this imprint upon each one, and everywhere the sense of

		mercy will come to light.<a name=494:1></a> Mercy is often mentioned in the epistles, for instance the apostle prays, "The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus".<a name=494:2></a> Again he says of Epaphroditus, "But God had mercy on him".<a name=494:3></a> Similarly in the epistle of Jude we read, "Awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life".<a name=494:4></a> So it will be in the coming age that men will be true neighbours under Him and each will exhibit the quality of mercy; (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#112:4">Psalm  112:4</a>, 5).<a name=494:5></a> The Jews came under judgment because they opposed the mercy which was proffered to the nations but now they have become the objects of the same mercy.<a name=494:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the moment nears when Christ will take into His hands actually all that has been given to Him by the Father, and it is our privilege to find ourselves in the light of that moment and to exhibit the quality of mercy.<a name=494:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us consider now the way which mercy takes and pursues.<a name=494:8></a> We read of the good Samaritan that he came up to the man and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine.<a name=494:9></a> The way in which Christ as neighbour deals with men is wonderful.<a name=494:10></a> His thought is to make man entirely whole.<a name=494:11></a> Man is sick from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, but the work of Christ is to bind up his wounds and to make his soul and conscience quite sound, as also Peter said of the lame man, "And, by faith in his name, his name has made this man strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him has given him this <i>complete soundness</i> in the presence of you all" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:16">Acts  3:16</a>).<a name=494:12></a> The name of the One who is now in heaven gave the man complete soundness.<a name=494:13></a> The jailor at Philippi was in the same way badly wounded (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>), but Christ gave him also complete soundness.<a name=494:14></a> Oil and wine were poured into his wounds and he learnt the Lord Jesus as the neighbour who had shown mercy to him.<a name=494:15></a>

		In the physical world, the sun is the great motivating power, and in the world to come every stimulus will go out from the Sun of righteousness, from Him who has become man's neighbour.<a name=495:5></a> The word describes His attitude towards all men in the present time.<a name=495:6></a> He is man's neighbour, and to those who turn to Him He gives living water.<a name=495:7></a> To this end He has been made sin and has taken upon Himself on the cross all that lay upon man as the judgment of God.<a name=495:8></a>

		This chapter sets before our eyes the goal which God pursues in His operations with us.<a name=496:1></a> Righteousness and liberty, one can say, are His thoughts for us.<a name=496:2></a> It is His will that we obtain real righteousness and enjoy true liberty.<a name=496:3></a> Both things belong together; for without righteousness nothing can be said of liberty.<a name=496:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the world we cannot expect to find righteousness and liberty.<a name=496:5></a> If we see it as God sees it, lawlessness and bondage only characterise it.<a name=496:6></a> "Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin", and as long as man goes on in self-will he finds himself in bondage.<a name=496:7></a> Lawlessness and bondage are therefore just as closely bound up with one another as righteousness and liberty.<a name=496:8></a> Real liberty rests on righteousness and God is working to bring man to righteousness, so that he may then enjoy true liberty.<a name=496:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see from the Holy Scriptures that from the moment when sin came into the world and man turned his back on God, He has worked with reference to another world in which a new man, Christ, should be the centre.<a name=496:10></a> We read of Him, "Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#80:17">Psalm  80:17</a>.<a name=496:11></a> He said: "To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and thy law is within my heart" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:8">Psalm  40:8</a>); and in Him we see both righteousness and liberty.<a name=496:12></a> In the fulness of time God sent His Son; Jesus came and took part in flesh and blood in order that He might be the centre and the light of another world.<a name=496:13></a> Righteousness and liberty are the characteristics of this other world, which is already opened up to our view now through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and if christianity does not first of all signify righteousness and liberty for me, it avails me little.<a name=496:14></a>

		In the natural world that surrounds us, everything is subjected to certain laws, and the same is true of that world of which we have spoken.<a name=497:1></a> Its law is righteousness and then liberty is there too.<a name=497:2></a> Everything revolves round Christ, whom God has exalted to His right hand and has placed there as Head.<a name=497:3></a> Christ is the righteous One (see <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:18">1 Peter  3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:1">1 John  2:1</a>, etc.<a name=497:4></a>), but at the same time He is the Son, and the Son sets free (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:36">John  8:36</a>).<a name=497:5></a> From this we see that righteousness and liberty are inseparably bound up with Him, and through the fact that we are brought into relationship with Christ, we obtain righteousness and liberty.<a name=497:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the first point we read, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up".<a name=497:7></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a>).<a name=497:8></a> He must be lifted up on account of righteousness and in order to fulfil righteousness.<a name=497:9></a> The third verse of our passage refers to the same matter: "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=497:10></a> So also in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a> "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him".<a name=497:11></a> If we carefully consider these passages of scripture, we shall find that they all refer to how God has brought to an end in judgment our entire state as men in the flesh so that we might find righteousness alone in Christ.<a name=497:12></a> Through His death He has fulfilled righteousness, and that indeed to the end that He might give us of His Spirit, through whom we are attached to Him and the fruit of righteousness is produced in us (verse 10).<a name=497:13></a> Practical righteousness is the proof that the Christ has been justified.<a name=497:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we are attached to Christ by the Spirit, so also Christ is in us.<a name=498:3></a> He is our righteousness, and we are in liberty before God.<a name=498:4></a> Verse 15 in our passage speaks of this liberty, it is the liberty of sonship.<a name=498:5></a> Not only have we found righteousness in Christ, but He, the Son, has set us free, so that now we can cry, Abba, Father!<a name=498:6></a> We are no longer in bondage, but in the consciousness of sonship and liberty we can draw near to God.<a name=498:7></a>

		Christianity consists not in doctrine, creeds or theories, but is something entirely practical and living; one could say it is Christ Himself who lives in His own.<a name=498:8></a> "He who has not the Spirit of Christ is not of Him".<a name=498:9></a> It is of the utmost importance to understand the relationship in which the believer stands to Christ.<a name=498:10></a> What lies at the foundation of this relationship is the Holy Spirit.<a name=498:11></a> Just as the earth stands in relationship to the sun, so the believer does to Christ, the Sun of that world which God has before Him; and Christ lives in him.<a name=498:12></a> Everything rests on righteousness, which is the law of that world.<a name=498:13></a> It does not merely consist in the fact that we do what is right in every sense towards our fellow men, but that in all things and at all times we maintain righteousness towards God and Christ.<a name=498:14></a> Christ is the Head of every man and faithfulness towards Hint in every relationship becomes us as believers.<a name=498:15></a> Then Christ is in us, and the word is verified which says: "He that practises righteousness is righteous, even as <i>he</i> is righteous".<a name=498:16></a> In this manner we prove that we have experienced the grace of God in our hearts; we practise righteousness and thus demonstrate that we are in living relationship with Christ, the Sun of righteousness.<a name=498:17></a> Christ shines upon us and we bear fruit to God.<a name=498:18></a> Then in verse 14 of our chapter we find liberty.<a name=498:19></a> Not only is the Spirit in

		As we know, the Lord was to be called "Son of the Highest" and later He Himself spoke of the fact that the disciples should be "Sons of the Highest".<a name=513:5></a> This title, which is mentioned several times in the gospel by Luke, refers to the supremacy of God presented to us in Christ.<a name=513:6></a> Then we find in the second place in our psalm the name "Almighty".<a name=513:7></a> Under this title God had revealed Himself to Abraham.<a name=513:8></a> He said to him: "I am the Almighty God: walk before my face, and be perfect" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:1">Genesis  17:1</a>).<a name=513:9></a> Israel knew Him as Jehovah but He was not yet revealed as Father.<a name=513:10></a> "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=513:11></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=513:12></a> The knowledge of God as Father presupposes the gift of the Holy Spirit; for without the Holy Spirit we could not apprehend God as Father (see <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:15">Romans  8:15</a>; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a> - 6).<a name=513:13></a> The name "Father" signifies: God revealed in love; and only through the Spirit of sonship can we cry Abba, Father and enjoy the love of God which is what He is in His nature.<a name=513:14></a> The soul learns first of all to know the grace of God, but then it is brought through the Holy Spirit to cry Abba, Father and thus to apprehend and to enjoy the love of God.<a name=513:15></a> The Lord said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>"And I have made known to them thy (the Father's) name".<a name=513:16></a> And for what purpose?<a name=513:17></a> "That the love with which thou hast loved

		Let us turn now to our psalm.<a name=514:5></a> With the name of the Highest, the thought of a hidden place is linked.<a name=514:6></a> The people of God at the present time have a hidden place, as we also read: "For .<a name=514:7></a>.<a name=514:8></a>.<a name=514:9></a> your life is hid with the Christ in God".<a name=514:10></a> The time of manifestation has not yet come; but when God shall be known in the whole universe as the Highest, that is, when He asserts His rights and reigns publicly, then His people will no longer have a hidden place but will also be manifest.<a name=514:11></a> God will reveal Himself as the Highest in the Son of the Highest, that is to say, in Christ, but up to that moment when He will be manifested, our life is hid with Him in God.<a name=514:12></a> Faith has its place now in the secret place of the Most High, and then we read further: "He .<a name=514:13></a>.<a name=514:14></a>.<a name=514:15></a> shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty".<a name=514:16></a> It is for us now to persevere in faith, which corresponds to the secret place, and then we "abide under the shadow of the Almighty".<a name=514:17></a> The value of the name of the Highest for us consists in our enjoying the place in secret, whilst we find in the Almighty protection and shelter from the heat of the sun (pressure and the like).<a name=514:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we persevere in faith, we find that God knows how to protect us.<a name=514:19></a> We read in the parable of the sower that the seed that was sown on stony ground could not bear the heat of the sun.<a name=514:20></a> The Lord said: "he .<a name=514:21></a>.<a name=514:22></a>.<a name=514:23></a> has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended".<a name=514:24></a> On the other hand we read in our psalm: "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the

		Almighty".<a name=515:1></a> It may be that persecutions and tests come, we feel the heat of the sun, but God sees to it that we find shadow.<a name=515:2></a> The shadow of the Almighty serves to preserve us from depression and discouragement.<a name=515:3></a> We have to do with the Almighty.<a name=515:4></a> Under this name He revealed Himself to Abraham and spoke to him of things which humanly speaking were impossible, but Abraham had to learn to trust in the Almighty as to the fulfilment of the promises.<a name=515:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not the thought of God that His saints should be continually exposed to persecution and tribulation.<a name=515:6></a> He sees to it that we come under the shadow, and that in order that His work in us might progress.<a name=515:7></a> In the early days there were great persecutions, but then we read: "The assemblies then .<a name=515:8></a>.<a name=515:9></a>.<a name=515:10></a> had peace, being edified .<a name=515:11></a>.<a name=515:12></a>".<a name=515:13></a>, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:31">Acts  9:31</a>.<a name=515:14></a> So the Lord also said to the assembly in Smyrna: "The devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried"; but the tribulation was to be limited to a defined time (ten days).<a name=515:15></a> Neither Satan nor man can do what they like with the people of God.<a name=515:16></a> Faith has its place in the secret place of the Most High and abides in the shadow of the Almighty.<a name=515:17></a> God knows how to protect and preserve His own.<a name=515:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The name Jehovah also has a blessed significance for us.<a name=515:19></a> We read further: "I say of Jehovah, My refuge and my fortress".<a name=515:20></a> And again in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#18">Proverbs  18</a>"The name of Jehovah is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe".<a name=515:21></a> It is a question here of conflict.<a name=515:22></a> Christians are called on to oppose the enemy, whether it be that he comes as a roaring lion, or with his deception, and therefore the apostle says: "Be strong in the Lord, and in the might of his strength!<a name=515:23></a>" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:10">Ephesians  6:10</a>).<a name=515:24></a> That is our refuge and our fortress.<a name=515:25></a>

		A great part of this psalm refers, as we know, to the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=515:26></a> When He walked here below, Jehovah was His refuge.<a name=515:27></a> It is a wonderful thought that the Son of God took such a place here below.<a name=515:28></a> He did not take the attitude that He wished to be strong in

		Himself; but was strong in Jehovah.<a name=516:1></a> When the enemy in the beginning came with his cunning, He met him in the power of the Spirit of God, and at the end when Satan appeared as a roaring lion, the Lord opposed him in the same power.<a name=516:2></a> Now in all these things He is our example.<a name=516:3></a> He took this place in grace and identified Himself with the people of God, so that we might learn from Him how to conduct ourselves in the same circumstances.<a name=516:4></a> He was the perfect Man here below, in whom God could have His good pleasure, and "for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted".<a name=516:5></a> He had recourse to Jehovah and found in Him a fortress, and so in that way He is now capacitated to be our High Priest.<a name=516:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These therefore are the thoughts of God for His own.<a name=516:7></a> He wills that we dwell in the secret place of the Most High and abide under the shadow of the Almighty, and find a refuge and a fortress in Jehovah.<a name=516:8></a> Then will be verified with us that of which the psalm next speaks further: "There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent".<a name=516:9></a> For us a plague is that which would turn us from the way of the Spirit.<a name=516:10></a> It is a spiritual sickness from which we are to be continually preserved.<a name=516:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the psalm we find Christ in humiliation, but it is a blessed thought that His exaltation is just as great as was His humiliation.<a name=516:12></a> He stooped to take this place of confidence in Jehovah, and now He is highly exalted.<a name=516:13></a> God has raised Him from among the dead and given Him glory.<a name=516:14></a> His exaltation is equal to His humiliation.<a name=516:15></a> The final verses of the psalm refer to that.<a name=516:16></a> It is Jehovah who speaks here with reference to Christ and says: "I will set him on high".<a name=516:17></a> As Man upon earth, the Lord had delight in Jehovah.<a name=516:18></a> Such a thing could not be said about us; we love God, <i>because He has first loved us</i>; but the path of the Lord in this world was characterised by the fact that He, as the perfect Man, had His delight in Jehovah.<a name=516:19></a> Then we read further: "I will deliver

		him".<a name=517:1></a> Christ might experience persecution, but in all that befell Him from the hand of man the counsel of God was fulfilled (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:23">Acts  2:23</a>).<a name=517:2></a> He was nailed to the cross by the hand of lawless men, but God raised Him from among the dead.<a name=517:3></a> "Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my name".<a name=517:4></a> In the same way, this last could only be said of Christ.<a name=517:5></a> We have not known the name of God; it is true that He has now been revealed to us, but of Christ as Man upon earth it could be said, that He knew the name of God.<a name=517:6></a> Further: "He shall call upon me".<a name=517:7></a> We have not called upon God.<a name=517:8></a> We call upon Him because He has called us.<a name=517:9></a> Everything here refers to Christ, as we further read: "I will deliver him and honour him".<a name=517:10></a> Christ has gone into heaven and sits glorified at the right hand of God.<a name=517:11></a> This is His portion because of His own perfection, as we see from the psalm; but if we are delivered and glorified, we owe it entirely to the grace of God.<a name=517:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"With the length of days will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation".<a name=517:13></a> Length of days for Christ signifies also length of days for us who believe in Him.<a name=517:14></a> He has destroyed the power of death and secured length of days for men.<a name=517:15></a> When Christ is manifested, then will it also be manifest that length of days has been given to Him.<a name=517:16></a> He is the Head of the coming age and has secured righteousness and consequently also length of days for man; and as to the salvation of Jehovah, it signifies also salvation for man.<a name=517:17></a> "My salvation" is a comprehensive word.<a name=517:18></a> God is revealed therein as a Saviour and the salvation includes liberty for man from all that in which he was held prisoner.<a name=517:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an important thought that the exaltation of Christ corresponds to His humiliation.<a name=517:20></a> He went down to the lower parts of the earth but has ascended above all heavens that He might fill all things.<a name=517:21></a> We look for the moment when God will draw aside the veil of providence and Christ will come forth in order to set up the world

		In closing I would like again to emphasise that we come into the gain of all the different names under which God has revealed Himself.<a name=518:3></a> There is one God; but it has pleased Him to make Himself known to men under different names and each of these names has its special, blessed significance, as we see from this psalm.<a name=518:4></a> It is granted to us to know <i>God</i> not only as the <i>Highest</i>, <i>Almighty</i>, and as <i>Jehovah</i>, but also as <i>Father</i>.<a name=518:5></a> He is revealed in His nature, and through the Holy Spirit we are permitted now to enjoy what God is, namely, love.<a name=518:6></a> That is now our portion already and Christ will come at the appointed time to bring us into the Father's house, so that where He is we also may be.<a name=518:7></a> If we have fellowship with Him in His humiliation, so shall we also have part with Him in that day in which He will be revealed in glory.<a name=518:8></a>

		But we read: "To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil".<a name=519:6></a> He came, as we read in another passage, to bind the strong man and to bring man liberation from his power (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:29">Matthew  12:29</a>).<a name=519:7></a> Our scripture is illustrative of this truth.<a name=519:8></a> The Lord Jesus was here clothed with this gracious power and He was available to all.<a name=519:9></a> In grace He placed Himself at the disposal of every needy one, as we see from this whole chapter.<a name=519:10></a>
