		INDIVIDUALITY IN THE SERVANT

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> It is helpful to remember that these two epistles and the epistle to Titus were written to individuals; so that what comes out in them has reference to individual conduct pretty much.<a name=1:3></a> What comes out in epistles addressed to churches is more general.<a name=1:4></a> Both Timothy and Titus were servants, and a great deal is brought out in these epistles which is intended to govern the conduct of the servant.<a name=1:5></a> Nothing can be more important at the present day than that the sense of individuality should be maintained with us -- everything depends on that.<a name=1:6></a> One's position is that one stands apart from the great organizations into which christianity has involved itself.<a name=1:7></a> In doing that, however, we have to be uncommonly careful that we do not constitute ourselves another organization.<a name=1:8></a> This would only add to the confusion.<a name=1:9></a> Two or three of us may be able to walk together, but it does not necessarily follow that we form a kind of community or body.<a name=1:10></a>

		F.W.<a name=1:11></a>T.<a name=1:12></a> I suppose it would be necessary to have learned what was written to the churches, before the conduct here could be carried out?<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:14></a>R.<a name=1:15></a> Yes.<a name=1:16></a> In the first few chapters the apostle gives the position, and proper order of the church of God -- "These things write I .<a name=1:17></a>.<a name=1:18></a>.<a name=1:19></a> that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God" (verses 14, 15).<a name=1:20></a> The apostle has tarried long, and it leaves a long interval in which a man ought to know how to behave himself in the house of God.<a name=1:21></a> That is the great point in the first epistle; in the second epistle the point is that we should not be ashamed of the testimony.<a name=1:22></a> The one comes before the other; before he can take up the testimony, a man needs to know how to behave himself in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first few chapters present what marks the house of God; you cannot get any representation of that in christendom today.<a name=2:3></a> The truth is the agreement for walking with one another.<a name=2:4></a> The first obligation of the servant, and of everybody, is to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit.<a name=2:5></a> The servant shows other people what is right by practising it himself; the apostle said to Timothy, "Be thou an example of the believers".<a name=2:6></a> The servant takes the humblest place, "I am among you as he that serveth" the Lord said.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The servant knows what is right, and not only so, but he sets the example of what is right.<a name=2:8></a> Clergy and ministers take the place of servants, but there are a great number among them whom it would be very undesirable to copy.<a name=2:9></a> They preach one thing, but do not exactly practise what they preach.<a name=2:10></a> The servant should practise what is right and we should follow those who are servants.<a name=2:11></a> It is a very important point for everyone of us to take care what company we keep -- whom we follow.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 2 and 3 there is nothing which answers to what you get in christendom.<a name=2:13></a> Where can you find any allusion to clergy?<a name=2:14></a> Yet they are a very important item in christendom.<a name=2:15></a> The position of the church is intercessory, and the men are to "pray every where".<a name=2:16></a> The woman is not to usurp authority over the man (chapter 2).<a name=2:17></a> Then in chapter 3 there is no idea of gifts.<a name=2:18></a> The elder people should take oversight of people's souls and deacons should take care of their bodies.<a name=2:19></a>

		but if you cannot find the house of God in the concrete form, one ought to know how to behave oneself there.<a name=3:1></a> So long as the Spirit of God is abiding here, every one of us is under obligation to know how to behave himself in the house of God.<a name=3:2></a> All those who are baptized by the Spirit form the house of God.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great value of these epistles is not simply to mark out the path of the servants, but they lay great stress upon individual fidelity when the church has failed.<a name=3:4></a> The great organizations around do not answer to the church of God at all.<a name=3:5></a> When you see that and stand apart from them, then it is you seek to know how a man should behave himself in the house of God.<a name=3:6></a> What marks those in the house of God is lowliness, meekness, forbearing one another in love, and so on.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The common idea of ruin is a broken down thing -- and all around us is that which is great in the eyes of men -- the mustard tree.<a name=3:8></a> Men have adapted christianity to the world as it is, but that is corruption and not outside of the system of this world.<a name=3:9></a> People come into the house of God through the figure of baptism -- it was never meant at all to be accommodated to this world.<a name=3:10></a> Just think of what christianity as adapted to this world will be in the end.<a name=3:11></a> It will be that all christianity is lost, the form and shadow only left.<a name=3:12></a> The harlot rides the beast.<a name=3:13></a> Then take Sardis -- what christianity is left there?<a name=3:14></a> The world has accommodated christianity to itself and in result all christianity is gone.<a name=3:15></a> The mystery of iniquity already works, but the end of it will be that the Lord will come in judgment -- He treads the winepress of the wrath of God.<a name=3:16></a>

		a great deal that is round about you in christendom.<a name=4:1></a> Wherever you get the refusal or non-admission of the rights of God in Christ, that is what I should call unrighteousness.<a name=4:2></a> In Corinthians we get "purge out", but we cannot purge out at the present day.<a name=4:3></a> We talk about putting out of fellowship, but now what it speaks to my mind is, that we say, I am not going to walk with that man.<a name=4:4></a> If a case turns up of a person who by his conduct shows that he is entirely unfit for christian company anywhere, under any circumstances, we put that person out; and that simply means to me that I will no longer walk with that man.<a name=4:5></a> In the existing state of things it is very much more a question of purging yourself from those who are going on unrighteously.<a name=4:6></a> 'Purging out' was connected with the power of the Spirit of God in the assembly.<a name=4:7></a> They put out the leaven; but now I purge myself from the leaven.<a name=4:8></a> The principle at the bottom is the same, but it is the altered condition of things that makes it necessary.<a name=4:9></a>

		The idea has been abroad that the Spirit has a special gathering in these days, but the only gathering point to my mind is Christ.<a name=4:10></a> The eyes of a great many have been opened to discern the true state of things around, but as to any special gathering on the part of the Spirit of God, I do not believe in it a bit.<a name=4:11></a> If you stand apart from what is around and you give place to the Spirit of God, you begin to get light.<a name=4:12></a> It is an activity on the part of God to maintain truth in the church.<a name=4:13></a> It is an immense mercy to get your eyes opened, so as to have some discernment of the reality of things as they are in the eyes of God.<a name=4:14></a> There is another thing too -- you get the sense brought home to you of the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=4:15></a> It is His working for the benefit of the whole church, for such a one is "serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work".<a name=4:16></a> These principles always hold good.<a name=4:17></a> Everything

		F.E.<a name=5:6></a>R.<a name=5:7></a> No, I do not.<a name=5:8></a> I am very much afraid of any particular few people, arrogating to themselves the idea of a remnant.<a name=5:9></a> In Israel you get the idea of a remnant all through the prophets, but the remnant included <i>all</i> that was of God.<a name=5:10></a> There could be no remnant character to the church strictly speaking -- the church must be the complete thing.<a name=5:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things which come out in the house of God here: the mystery of piety (verse 16), and the warning of the Spirit (chapter 4).<a name=5:16></a> In the house of God you put everything together in regard to Christ.<a name=5:17></a> God has been "manifest in the flesh .<a name=5:18></a>.<a name=5:19></a>.<a name=5:20></a> glory".<a name=5:21></a> That is the mystery.<a name=5:22></a> The initiated are able to put it together.<a name=5:23></a> It is only what is known in the house of God.<a name=5:24></a> It is a wonderful thing to think that "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit [resurrection], has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory".<a name=5:25></a> That is what is known to the initiated; it is not a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you get the warning of the Spirit -- "The Spirit speaks expressly", and you get certain principles which attach to man.<a name=6:2></a> Asceticism is one thing, and then you get the importance which riches attach to man.<a name=6:3></a> In high churches and all that kind of thing, it is a peculiar kind of fleshly sanctity which gives importance to man.<a name=6:4></a> That is what comes out in chapter 4.<a name=6:5></a> Verse 16 of chapter 3 is your sheet anchor, your mainstay, and by it you have pretty good safeguard against what you get in chapter 4.<a name=6:6></a> People will hold one part of it often, but the great point is to put the whole together.<a name=6:7></a> That is the mystery of godliness, and that it is known in the house.<a name=6:8></a> The last clause, "received up in glory", carries you out of the world and you do not care to attach importance to man, as alluded to in chapter 4.<a name=6:9></a> It is amazing to me what an influence the clergy have over man.<a name=6:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to get a divinely given idea of the house of God; you cannot get it from christendom.<a name=6:11></a> It helps you to understand how a man should behave himself in the house of God.<a name=6:12></a> However small and limited your circle, you would endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=6:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=7:1></a>R.<a name=7:2></a> The second epistle has a very different character from the first.<a name=7:3></a> In the first epistle the point is that a man should learn how to behave in the house of God; in the second epistle it is committing the testimony to Timothy unto the coming of the Lord.<a name=7:4></a> There is no doubt whatever that when things take the character which is presented in this epistle, the testimony refers to what is coming in.<a name=7:5></a> It carries you on to the appearing.<a name=7:6></a> You get something of the same principle in <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:9">Haggai  2:9</a> -- they had to look on to the latter glory of the house.<a name=7:7></a> Of course the testimony always had its own proper place, but it comes more into prominence when things have assumed the character spoken of in this epistle.<a name=7:8></a> The testimony is the great interest of the people of God now, and the great point is not to be "ashamed of the testimony of our Lord .<a name=7:9></a>.<a name=7:10></a>.<a name=7:11></a> power of God", verse 8.<a name=7:12></a> That thought runs through the epistle; in chapter 3 it is, "Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned"; and in chapter 4 he was to "preach the word" (verse 2).<a name=7:13></a> Also he says, "Watch thou make full proof of thy ministry".<a name=7:14></a> It is well to notice the first verse of chapter 4 too.<a name=7:15></a> The servant is looked upon as continuing until the appearing.<a name=7:16></a> The apostle passes off the scene, but Timothy represents the servant that continues until the appearing -- it is in that way the testimony is committed to him.<a name=7:17></a> In connection with it, the apostle contemplates four generations -- there was the apostle, Timothy, and he was to commit the testimony to faithful men, who should be able to teach others also, (chapter 2: 2).<a name=7:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the early days in the Acts of the Apostles, people were very much content with what was present.<a name=8:6></a> The Spirit ruled, and everything in the house of God took its character from the Spirit -- the disciples were filled with joy in the Holy Spirit -- and that kind of thing.<a name=8:7></a> You cannot get back to primitive christianity, and the testimony now comes into prominence, bringing before the mind what is going to be displayed.<a name=8:8></a> The best that can be done down here is most mean in comparison with the beginning, but the testimony is the latter glory of the house.<a name=8:9></a> People have to be in the testimony morally -- that comes out all through the epistle; "Be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus" -- the truth is to be held in "faith and love which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=8:10></a> Christ Jesus is really the testimony and all that will come out in the appearing of Christ in His glory is involved in the testimony now.<a name=8:11></a>

		F.E.<a name=9:12></a>R.<a name=9:13></a> Yes.<a name=9:14></a> Moses was used as a ministering servant to set up a pattern of all things for a testimony of those things which should be seen after (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>).<a name=9:15></a> Now the "all things" have come into view.<a name=9:16></a> It is not altogether so much as Christ and the church, but a much wider idea; all the mystery of His will was covered by Christ.<a name=9:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to complete the figure of the tabernacle you must take in the priesthood.<a name=9:18></a> The great point was that the priest should 'touch' the mercy-seat; you could not get anything perfect until the priest could touch the mercy-seat.<a name=9:19></a> To have done that under the law would have meant death for the priest; but now, when you come to the reality of things, the High Priest has gone in and touched the mercy-seat.<a name=9:20></a> Hence you have got perfection, and the effect is that the approach is equal to the revelation.<a name=9:21></a> The ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat is more connected with coming out -- God has found a point in which

		The mystery of the gospel (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a>; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:9">Ephesians  1:9</a>, 10) is all that was centred in Christ, of which the tabernacle was figurative, and so is as much a subject of the Old Testament as of the New.<a name=10:4></a> The introduction of Christ really means this -- man has to go out of one door, but he can get in at another.<a name=10:5></a> Man has been terminated in the cross of Christ, but then he comes in by another door, and that is by the Spirit.<a name=10:6></a> The means by which God is going to regenerate the world is by Christ, but then men will not have Christ.<a name=10:7></a>

		We have in this passage two striking instances of the ministry of the Lord here; both simple and intelligible.<a name=15:1></a> In the one it is the dealing with a case of leprosy; and in the other with a case of palsy.<a name=15:2></a> Now it is just these that I want to put together, for in a way they are descriptive of the condition of men in the world today -- and I do not think one will have much difficulty in making that plain.<a name=15:3></a> Men in this world are universally defiled -- the world itself is full of defilement; and we are so accustomed to the defiling influence of things in this world, that we are scarcely conscious that they are defiling.<a name=15:4></a> But no one can come in contact with things as they are around us without being defiled.<a name=15:5></a> Now the Lord came in contact with these things here, but the consequence of <i>His</i> coming in contact with them is that in result they are removed.<a name=15:6></a> The effect of sin having entered into the world has been to bring about the defilement of man; no one can doubt the defiling influence that idolatry has had upon men; but then the Jew was defiled too.<a name=15:7></a> The leper in this passage is a picture, I take it, of Israel: and it shows that Israel had not escaped the defilement of the world, the taint of idolatry was upon them too, many things had been done in Israel which were every bit as bad as had been done in heathendom.<a name=15:8></a> They were defiled by that which had been abroad in the world; they had touched idolatry, and were defiled by it.<a name=15:9></a> It is impossible for men, being what they are, to escape defilement in a world that is defiled, and the fact is, that whatever defilement you find in the world, you find the answer to it in your own heart.<a name=15:10></a> The purest man in the world is not free of the contamination that is in the world; and the effect of the fall has

		It is evident enough that a revolution took place in regard of the leper and the paralytic, and the way of it was either the touch or the word of Christ; they were both brought into contact with Jesus, the leper by the touch of Jesus, and the paralytic by the word of Jesus, and the effect in each case was

		the removal of what was there, the defilement or the weakness.<a name=18:1></a> The leper was cleansed, and the paralytic took up his bed and walked.<a name=18:2></a> Now that is the effect of the introduction of that Man into the world; a Man, who had personally no part in the contamination or the weakness -- He was apart from all that was either defiling or weak, but was brought into contact with it, and with this effect, that both the defilement and the weakness departed from before Him.<a name=18:3></a> It must have been a wonderful experience to this poor leper to be cleansed; he could not understand the meaning of it spiritually, perhaps, but what a moment it must have been to him when at the touch of Jesus he finds himself relieved of his leprosy.<a name=18:4></a> And it must have been an unparalleled experience to the paralytic, accustomed to his weakness and helplessness, to be made to take up his bed and walk; to either one or the other it must have been an unparalleled experience, and it was evidently not due to anything in themselves, but to another Man, to One who had come into contact with the defilement and weakness of men, though, as I said before, Himself personally apart from it all.<a name=18:5></a> But He put Himself in contact with it, so to speak, He touched the leper, and spoke to the paralytic -- "Thy sins are forgiven thee", and then in confirmation said, "take up thy couch, and go".<a name=18:6></a> Now I carry the thought on to the future; that One to whom I have referred, who had come into the world, is rejected of men, but He has accomplished the will of God, and is the Sun of righteousness, at the right hand of God; He is not yet manifest, but there is a bright hope before us, and that is of His coming in glory.<a name=18:7></a> We get that constantly presented in Scripture; there were people who looked for redemption in Israel at the time when Christ first appeared; they had a good hope -- but now we have a better hope, the hope of the appearing of the glory

		And again, when I come to chapter 8 I read, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you".<a name=36:5></a> There is only one Spirit of God.<a name=36:6></a> So later on, verse 15; there is only one spirit of sonship.<a name=36:7></a> Every believer participates in the same Spirit; all are baptised "by one Spirit .<a name=36:8></a>.<a name=36:9></a>.<a name=36:10></a> into one body".<a name=36:11></a> One Spirit brought the love of God into our hearts; we are all in the one Spirit if the Spirit of God dwell in us.<a name=36:12></a> There is only one Spirit of God's Son, and that is the Spirit by which all believers cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=36:13></a> That is the truth of the Spirit in the believer, and therefore I understand you get the truth of the presence of the Spirit recognized, and although the truth of the body is not taught, the body is involved inasmuch as you get the same Spirit in all the saints.<a name=36:14></a> You must have one body because one Spirit.<a name=36:15></a>

		Now I think it must be plain to every one here tonight that in the very fact of its being taught in Romans that we all receive the Spirit we are necessarily constituted into one body; thus the apostle says, "We, being many, are one body in Christ".<a name=36:16></a> Not one body in Adam, not one body in our responsible life down here, for the body involves new creation.<a name=36:17></a> There is thus a certain doctrinal basis in Romans for the truth of the body, and therefore he

		Now as to the formation of the body.<a name=37:6></a> We look at the body before we look at the Head.<a name=37:7></a> Let me say one word which may perhaps cut across the thought of some here as to the body of Christ.<a name=37:8></a> The one body is the same evidently as the body of Christ.<a name=37:9></a> These are not two different thoughts in Scripture.<a name=37:10></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>we read (verse 13), "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", and in the same chapter (verse 27), "Now ye are the body of Christ", because the one body is the body of Christ.<a name=37:11></a>

		What I want to show you now is this, that the truth of union is not taught in connection with the body.<a name=37:12></a> What is taught in connection with the body is <i>unity</i>, not union.<a name=37:13></a> And the truth of unity is involved, I think, in connection with the body in these scriptures, "There is one body, and one Spirit", and again, "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body".<a name=37:14></a> Thus the teaching of the Spirit of God, in connection with the Spirit and the body, is not to show union but unity.<a name=37:15></a> By the very fact of the reception of the Spirit the saints have been formed into one body.<a name=37:16></a> We find in the Acts, in the early part of the church's history, the saints were gathered together by the testimony of the resurrection of Christ.<a name=37:17></a> Then they received the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the presence of the Holy

		Suppose we take the figure of the human body in connection with the head, the moral idea connected with head is direction, and Christ in taking the place of Head of the body takes the place of Chief.<a name=38:14></a> I will give you a passage of Scripture for it, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a> - 23: "Which he wrought in Christ".<a name=38:15></a> It is the fulfilment of the prophecy in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>.<a name=38:16></a> The Son of man set over everything.<a name=38:17></a> Then the additional truth, He "hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church".<a name=38:18></a> He is given as Head to the church which is His body.<a name=38:19></a> Thus the church is formed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and Christ is given to be Head over all, and Head to the church which is <i>His</i> body.<a name=38:20></a> But I cannot dwell on this.<a name=38:21></a>

		Bear in mind first how the body is formed.<a name=39:8></a> The body is the mystery of the gospel remember, because I do not want you to think that the gospel is one thing and the mystery another.<a name=39:9></a> It is the mystery of the gospel, because the body is hid in the gospel, and the gospel goes on to the communication of the Spirit, and no believer is in the good of the gospel till he has received the Spirit.<a name=39:10></a> The great end of the gospel is that God may be revealed in the heart of the believer, but that cannot be until the Spirit is received.<a name=39:11></a> Love is not known else.<a name=39:12></a> "The love of God is shed abroad .<a name=39:13></a>.<a name=39:14></a>.<a name=39:15></a> by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<a name=39:16></a> And I say unhesitatingly, no person is in the good of the gospel until he has received the Holy Spirit.<a name=39:17></a> God's end in the gospel is that He may be revealed in the heart of man; man's idea is that God's object is to save him, but the gospel brings you to the Spirit; and the moment the Spirit is received the body is formed.<a name=39:18></a> And why?<a name=39:19></a> Because <i>Christ</i> is in you.<a name=39:20></a> Now the body is formed by the baptism of the Spirit, and having been thus formed, Christ is in the place of Head.<a name=39:21></a> He is looked at there as Man, and the place given to Him of God, and it is regarded as being the highest place of His exaltation, "Head over all things to the church".<a name=39:22></a> Now, mark this, that the truth of union is not taught in connection with the body, union brings in the thought of the bride.<a name=39:23></a> The idea of union is that the church will share in the glory and exaltation of the Head.<a name=39:24></a> Just as a woman who marries a man superior in position to herself

		So far we have the idea of the body, and the truth taught in connection with the unity.<a name=40:7></a> Now we will go a little into detail.<a name=40:8></a> And what I venture to say first is this, you do not find the truth of the Head until you come to Colossians.<a name=40:9></a> You get the truth of the body both in Romans and Corinthians.<a name=40:10></a> In Romans it is to check independency and in Corinthians to check clericalism.<a name=40:11></a> If I recognize the truth that I am a member of the body I cannot be independent.<a name=40:12></a> If a man is set in a position not dependent on anybody else he can take the ground of independency.<a name=40:13></a> A man might say, I am not concerned about anybody else.<a name=40:14></a> But if he is a member of the body of Christ he is so far dependent.<a name=40:15></a> No one of us can be exclusively individual.<a name=40:16></a> Many christians are too individual.<a name=40:17></a> They are taken up far too much with what is connected with their individual paths, "We, being many, are one body".<a name=40:18></a> You may carry independency too far as to the individuality of the saints.<a name=40:19></a> I admit each has his individual path, but we must not use our individuality to the extent of forgetting that we are members one of another.<a name=40:20></a> You may find saints coming to the meetings on the Lord's day morning, and you do not see much of them for the rest of the week.<a name=40:21></a> They forget we are members one of another.<a name=40:22></a> So the truth of the body is brought in in Romans as an antidote to independency.<a name=40:23></a> He is not to think too highly of himself, but as God has given him a place in the body.<a name=40:24></a> But Christ is not seen as Head of the body in Romans.<a name=40:25></a> The character in which He is presented there is as Lord.<a name=40:26></a> And that is a different idea to that of the Head; He is Lord in the house -- the

		I daresay you will hardly understand my purpose in reading these scriptures, but they have a connection in my mind and in them we really trace the course of Christ.<a name=61:1></a> It is intimately connected of course with the way in which Christ is presented in this particular gospel.<a name=61:2></a> In Matthew the kingdom of heaven is established in Christ; He is the Sun of righteousness in heaven.<a name=61:3></a> In the gospel of John He is presented more in the light of the Ark of the Covenant and the Mercy Seat; but in the gospel of Luke we have Him taken from among men; His genealogy is traced right back from Adam.<a name=61:4></a> The point of the gospel is Man taken from among men and eventually going up to God.<a name=61:5></a> Morally down here He was the Priest.<a name=61:6></a> There is one parable in chapter 10, that of the good Samaritan, which indicates it.<a name=61:7></a> The priest and the Levite failed, neither of them could deal with the man that was half dead, and Christ, the Neighbour, undertakes priestly service with regard to the man.<a name=61:8></a> He comes in to fill not simply the place of the Levite but the place of the priest.<a name=61:9></a> His service was priestly.<a name=61:10></a> He poured in oil and wine, set him on His own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him so long as he was in circumstances to need care.<a name=61:11></a> The priest and the Levite were unprofitable, they could do nothing with the man, but all was fulfilled in Christ.<a name=61:12></a>

		I can understand people making dispensational difficulties about it and saying that Christ was not a priest till He went to the right hand of God; but in anticipation of that I cannot question that Christ did a great deal of priestly work down here.<a name=63:9></a> See what He said to Peter before his fall, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not".<a name=63:10></a> That was priestly work.<a name=63:11></a> Christ when He was here was the anointed vessel to bring about a certain result and that was that there should be an offering up to God, a company acceptable to Him, and that was priestly work.<a name=63:12></a>

		I think the same thing is in a sense true in regard to the church; the church is the temple of God.<a name=70:4></a> The apostle says to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?<a name=70:5></a>" The Spirit of God dwells in the church; it being the temple of God, the oracles of God are there.<a name=70:6></a> Whatever light there is of God is in the church by the Spirit.<a name=70:7></a> But there is another truth connected with the church: the church is the body of Christ, where gifts are set, where there is the word of wisdom and knowledge, in order that the light may be diffused, may be brought to man in the way of service.<a name=70:8></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>, the apostle says, "Ye are the temple of God", and in chapter 12, "Ye are the body of Christ".<a name=70:9></a> That is what we are called to down here.<a name=70:10></a> Service is more than levitical; rightly understood, it is priestly.<a name=70:11></a> The service of the Lord Jesus was not simply levitical: it was priestly, and had in view the offering up of a remnant of the people.<a name=70:12></a> That came to pass on the day of Pentecost; a remnant was offered as a result of the service of the Lord Jesus here on earth.<a name=70:13></a>

		Now I want to touch upon the priestly service of Christ in regard to man.<a name=71:1></a> The objection may be raised that Christ is only Priest on behalf of His people; but at the same time there is a light in which Christ can have to say to all men.<a name=71:2></a> If He gave Himself a ransom for all, to bring home to man the knowledge that is His own, this ministry is priestly service on the part of the Lord.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First I will say a word in regard to the tabernacle of testimony.<a name=71:4></a> All the detail of the tabernacle was given to Moses, and Moses had to set it up according to the fashion shown to him.<a name=71:5></a> The first things about which God spoke to Moses were the ark and the mercy seat; I go no farther than that.<a name=71:6></a> Evidently the ark and the mercy seat were connected with the revelation of God.<a name=71:7></a> Everything was thus set forth in the way of figurative representation.<a name=71:8></a> The time was coming when God would put Himself in communication with man by the mercy seat; all was connected with revelation.<a name=71:9></a> But then, in connection with the tabernacle of testimony there was the priest; people often take up the tabernacle of testimony and the detail of it, but the priest was an essential part.<a name=71:10></a> Suppose there had been no injunctions about the priest, what good would it all have been to man?<a name=71:11></a> There would have been no approach to God.<a name=71:12></a> The furniture of the tabernacle was connected with God's way of approach to man; but that would not be of much value to man unless there were with it the thought of man's approach to God, and you get that in connection with Aaron and his sons.<a name=71:13></a> When God gave directions as to the tabernacle and its furniture, He gave directions for Aaron and the garments of Aaron; in order to make a system complete, you must have not only revelation, but also approach to God, and that was set forth in Aaron.<a name=71:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All that was typical; now we have come to the reality of things, and what is brought to our view is not simply revelation, but that the approach is equal to the revelation.<a name=72:1></a> You cannot understand approach except in Christ.<a name=72:2></a> You must remember that He has gone in as Priest; and, as to its application to us, we are taught that "through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father"; it is through Him, the One who has gone in.<a name=72:3></a> This is brought out at the end of the gospel of Luke.<a name=72:4></a> The Lord in resurrection brings home to the disciples the reality of His being Man, and after He had commissioned them, a cloud received Him out of their sight and He went up on high, in order to communicate the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name=72:5></a> All that has been fulfilled; the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat are no longer typical.<a name=72:6></a> We have the temple and the oracles of God; God's mind is declared in Christ, and, on the other hand, approach to God is perfect, because Christ is the Priest.<a name=72:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Luke I think we see priestly service on the part of Christ.<a name=72:8></a> I want to show you the way in which Christ waits upon man, to bring home to man the knowledge of God.<a name=72:9></a> We are in a world where we have to meet a great many things; the conditions of man's life are complex; we have to meet vicissitudes, disappointments, trials, sorrows, bereavements, weakness, and many other things.<a name=72:10></a> Now, if you are to pass through these things, what is going to be your stay in them?<a name=72:11></a> I only know of one thing that is available, and available in everything, and that is, the knowledge of God.<a name=72:12></a> Hence one can see the grace connected with the priestly service of Christ, who waits upon man, in order to bring home to man the knowledge of God, so that, whatever we have to meet down here, we always have a stay -- and that is God.<a name=72:13></a> It is not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dare say you will remember that there is a succession of parables in Luke peculiar to that gospel.<a name=73:2></a> I refer to one in chapter 7: 41 - 43.<a name=73:3></a> I read one also in chapter 10, then I turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14:15">Luke  14:15</a>, and following.<a name=73:4></a> The final one is in chapter 15.<a name=73:5></a> Now we see in each of these Christ waiting upon man, to bring home to him the knowledge of God, because that knowledge is to be the stay of man down here.<a name=73:6></a> I may remark in regard to these parables that they are not found in the other gospels; they are peculiar to Luke, and connect themselves with the particular way in which Christ is presented in that gospel.<a name=73:7></a> I may say another thing: as you increase in the knowledge of God, you increase in the sense of blessing.<a name=73:8></a> If your knowledge is elementary, you will not have any very great sense of blessing.<a name=73:9></a> God is intent on blessing, He is called in Scripture "the blessed God"; hence the more we increase in the knowledge of God, the more we increase in blessing.<a name=73:10></a> What I understand by blessing is, God brought near to man, so that man may be conscious of being in the favour of God.<a name=73:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up two of these parables now, the one in the seventh and the other in the tenth chapter.<a name=73:12></a> They are progressive; I will first touch on the four and note the progress.<a name=73:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the fourth, chapter 15, is the climax.<a name=74:2></a> The prodigal is brought back to the Father's table, to be conscious that the Father has complete complacency in him.<a name=74:3></a> What a wonderful thing it would be for us if we were conscious of being with the Father in such a way as to know that He has entire complacency in us, and that there is nothing to interfere with the complacency.<a name=74:4></a> That is what is presented to us in the thought of the prodigal.<a name=74:5></a> He is at the Father's table, they began to be merry, he is conscious of the Father's complacency in him, and that nothing interferes with it.<a name=74:6></a> I think you will be prepared to allow that there is progress in what is unfolded in these parables.<a name=74:7></a> The first thing that Christ sets Himself to bring home to man is the attitude of God toward man.<a name=74:8></a> That comes out in the parable of the creditor and the two debtors.<a name=74:9></a> The mind of the creditor was alike in regard to the two debtors.<a name=74:10></a> The two debtors represent all men.<a name=74:11></a> In that particular case they were intended to represent the woman and Simon, and the parable brings out that the mind of the creditor was alike to both.<a name=74:12></a> That is a great lesson to be brought home to man.<a name=74:13></a> The Lord had a very inapt pupil, for Simon was the one for whose benefit the parable was spoken.<a name=74:14></a> We do not hear much more about him; but, so far as we can tell, he was sceptical about Christ.<a name=74:15></a> He was not very sure whether, after all, Christ was a prophet.<a name=74:16></a> What marked the Lord was priestly grace, and therefore He could attend on Simon and bring the truth before him.<a name=74:17></a> It was a reproach to Simon, but we see the grace of the Lord who could utter such a parable for such a man.<a name=74:18></a> Christ was attendant upon man, in priestly grace, His lips keeping knowledge, to bring home to man what at that particular point was the attitude of

	<div class="paragraph">
		God toward all men.<a name=75:1></a> It is a lesson which the Lord would bring home to all of us.<a name=75:2></a> I cannot conceive anything more important than to apprehend what God's attitude is, without reserve, at this present time, not only toward the repentant, but toward all men.<a name=75:3></a> The secret of it is that Christ has given Himself a ransom for all, and thus every man comes into the view of God, and God is propitious toward every man.<a name=75:4></a> Christ is the propitiation; that is the light in which God is presented at the present time.<a name=75:5></a>

		I pass on to the second parable, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>.<a name=75:6></a> The priest and Levite pass by the half-dead man on the other side, because they had to make room for the real Priest.<a name=75:7></a> They were the official men.<a name=75:8></a> Experience has taught me to distrust officialism.<a name=75:9></a> The moment you find officialism in divine things there is danger.<a name=75:10></a> In Judaism there was officialism; but it broke down, and I do not think God intends to repeat that.<a name=75:11></a> They passed by on the other side, but they made room for the one who was really the priest.<a name=75:12></a> The priest's lips are full of knowledge.<a name=75:13></a> Here again, the Lord had a very inapt pupil: the pupil was the lawyer.<a name=75:14></a> The lawyer was tempting Christ; there was nothing encouraging about the pupil, yet Christ attended on the lawyer.<a name=75:15></a> Lawyers and Pharisees were not very hopeful; but the Lord sought to bring home the truth to the lawyer.<a name=75:16></a> The question here is not of God's attitude toward all men, but of God found as a resource for man down here.<a name=75:17></a> There are few people who have not moral wants; what is going to heal them?<a name=75:18></a> The knowledge of God.<a name=75:19></a> What is going to carry you along?<a name=75:20></a> The knowledge of God.<a name=75:21></a> What is going to comfort you?<a name=75:22></a> Because you will certainly now and then need comfort.<a name=75:23></a> I know only one thing, and that is, the knowledge of God.<a name=75:24></a> Whether it is support or comfort in the pathway here through the wilderness, Christ supplies all,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How important the knowledge of God is to us!<a name=76:4></a> How important that we should be set upon it!<a name=76:5></a> Christ is set upon it; He will serve you in that way.<a name=76:6></a> We do not want to be sceptical like Simon, or like the lawyer, tempting Christ.<a name=76:7></a> There needs readiness on our part, and we have to look to God for grace that the one thing we are athirst for is the knowledge of God.<a name=76:8></a> What we really want to know is divine love in its application to us in our pathway here.<a name=76:9></a> That is the first element in the knowledge of God.<a name=76:10></a> It is not the knowledge of God in the highest sense, but in the most important sense in regard to us.<a name=76:11></a> It is the apprehension of divine love in connection with our responsible life.<a name=76:12></a> I dare say I have before pointed out how this comes out in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4">1 John  4</a>.<a name=76:13></a> The apostle takes up the love of God in its application to saints all along their responsible pathway (verses 7 - 12, 16 - 19).<a name=76:14></a> It does not talk about the love of God to us in heaven, as in Ephesians, where God has set the saints in heavenly places; it does not go beyond our responsible pathway here, closing up with the day of judgment, and in that connection you get the love of God.<a name=76:15></a> It runs parallel with what the apostle Paul says at the close of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=76:16></a> It is very wonderful to see the application of divine love to us, even in the way of discipline.<a name=76:17></a> It comes out in that way; God has to discover to us something in ourselves which has an undue place in the heart; some idol perhaps; and love is in the way of discipline.<a name=76:18></a> But it is also in

	<div class="paragraph">
		One point more.<a name=77:11></a> It is a point of the greatest interest for the soul to be entering into God's things.<a name=77:12></a> You will not enter into God's things if you do not see how God enters into your things.<a name=77:13></a> Unless you apprehend God's love to you down here, it is futile to expect to be led into the range of God's things; but if you are led into that great circle of interests, that universe which is centred in Christ, you have to learn the capability of God to fill it all.<a name=77:14></a> The universe would be no good unless it were filled.<a name=77:15></a> Our physical universe would not be of much account unless the sun filled it all.<a name=77:16></a> Hence there is fertility and life.<a name=77:17></a> God has a universe; a vast system consisting of all things, and all centred in Christ.<a name=77:18></a> But it is a very blessed thought that with God there is the capability to fill it.<a name=77:19></a> I would not care about the thought of a universe unless I knew how it is to be filled.<a name=77:20></a> God has not only devised and brought to pass a universe, but He is capable of

		I think there ought to be with us a readiness to be led on in the knowledge of God.<a name=78:3></a> Grace and peace will be multiplied to us in it.<a name=78:4></a> Christ is waiting upon man in priestly service; there is wonderful grace about Him, though we may be dull and inattentive pupils; yet He is waiting upon us.<a name=78:5></a> It is a great thing to know that you have a support and a source of comfort in whatever you may be exposed to here.<a name=78:6></a> If you lose the dearest relative, you still have a stay and support in the knowledge of God.<a name=78:7></a> Christ takes care of us, and the proof of it is in bringing home to us the resource that we have in the knowledge of God.<a name=78:8></a> It is a great thing to be led on in the apprehension of love in the details of its application towards us.<a name=78:9></a> And the Spirit will lead you further into those things which are centred in Christ.<a name=78:10></a>

		There are certain parables which are peculiar to this gospel, just as there are those which are peculiar to Matthew; if you were to transplant any of these parables to another gospel, you would find that they would not fit in.<a name=79:1></a> If you were to take the parables in Matthew and attempt to transplant them into this gospel, they would not fit, though they have their place there just as these have here.<a name=79:2></a> I allude particularly to the four parables I have mentioned on a previous occasion, in which it is not difficult to apprehend a progress in the unfolding of the truth.<a name=79:3></a> One was the parable of the creditor and the two debtors, in the seventh chapter; then the parable of the good Samaritan in the tenth chapter; now we have the parable of the supper in the fourteenth, and still another in the fifteenth; that is the succession of parables peculiar to Luke.<a name=79:4></a> My point was to view these parables in the light in which Christ is presented to us in Luke.<a name=79:5></a> Luke specially presents to us the service of Christ as the anointed Man.<a name=79:6></a> I illustrated that in the parable of the good Samaritan.<a name=79:7></a> The priest and the Levite, official representatives of the old covenant, passed by on the other side; but they passed by to make room for the true Priest, the anointed Man.<a name=79:8></a> I quite admit that Christ would not be a priest if He were upon earth; but I have no doubt that many things which the Lord did when He was on earth were anticipative of what He is doing at the present time; they illustrate it.<a name=79:9></a> We have to take into account where Christ now is, at the right hand of God, a

		Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=80:1></a> Many things brought before us in this gospel will help us to understand the character of the service which Christ carries on in regard to us now.<a name=80:2></a> When you read the gospels, you should read them in the light of where Christ is now.<a name=80:3></a> It is not that they present Him where He is now; but if you read them in that light, it will help you to understand them.<a name=80:4></a> In Luke we get Christ a real Babe, born into the world, made of a woman -- a Child, then a Man; then we have His death and resurrection; but all is leading on to what is brought out in the last chapter, Christ going up to heaven and communicating the promise of the Father.<a name=80:5></a> It is in the light of priestly service that Christ is presented in the gospel of Luke.<a name=80:6></a> Even in the account given to us of the sufferings of Christ, what comes before us is the offering priest rather than the victim.<a name=80:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the point in these parables is that we get the instruction of Christ; the anointed Man is the Instructor.<a name=80:8></a> I referred to a passage in <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:7">Malachi  2:7</a>, "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth": you never get that verified except in Christ.<a name=80:9></a> Throughout this gospel you have the Lord as the anointed Man, waiting upon man, to bring home to him that which He knew.<a name=80:10></a> The knowledge of God was perfect there: in fact, He was God; but looking at the Lord as Man, the knowledge of God was perfect, and He was attending upon men to lead them into the knowledge of the suitability of God to man down here.<a name=80:11></a> When a man is awakened to know anything, the first principle and element of the knowledge of God is to apprehend the attitude of God toward man; that is, not imputing trespasses, not calling men to a reckoning; His disposition toward man is forgiveness.<a name=80:12></a> You get that coming out at the close of this gospel: "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations".<a name=81:1></a> That could never have been preached had it not been in the pleasure of God.<a name=81:2></a> Then in the parable of the good Samaritan we saw the true Priest, leading man into the knowledge of God, in the suitability of God to man, in his need down here.<a name=81:3></a> He poured in the oil and the wine, set him on his own beast, and took care of him so long as he needed care.<a name=81:4></a> That is what the knowledge of God means to us.<a name=81:5></a> It is the one thing that we have; our mainstay, and if you have not that, you have not very much.<a name=81:6></a> A christian is to find his comfort, his stay and support, in the knowledge of the way in which God can adapt Himself to man in man's weakness down here.<a name=81:7></a> It is a wonderful thing to think that God will care for a man's soul -- for his body, too, for the matter of that -- but for his soul so long as he is in need of care.<a name=81:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the two remaining parables; they complete the series.<a name=81:9></a> My point is that we still have the Lord before us as Instructor.<a name=81:10></a> Teaching properly belongs to the priest; I do not think anyone could teach if he were not a priest.<a name=81:11></a> Suppose I had the capacity to teach: where did I get it from?<a name=81:12></a> No one can teach a christian except as he himself knows God; and if I know God, that is priestly.<a name=81:13></a> The fact of knowing God and having access to Him is priestly, and that is one's only capability to teach.<a name=81:14></a> I often feel half-afraid to take the place of teacher, feeling that one's knowledge of God is so limited that one is very little able to teach others.<a name=81:15></a>

		Christ, you can understand what it is to be at the great supper, and you will see that the supper is the celebration of righteousness.<a name=84:1></a> I refer to two scriptures, <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:9">Philippians  3:9</a>, 10, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>, 12.<a name=84:2></a> In the one passage we get the power of His resurrection spoken of, and in the other, the operation of God who raised Him from the dead.<a name=84:3></a> Evidently the resurrection of Christ is a point of the greatest possible moment on the part of God.<a name=84:4></a> "The power of his resurrection" is a remarkable expression, and again the "operation of God".<a name=84:5></a> It is the energetic working of the power of God that raised Him from the dead.<a name=84:6></a> So the apostle prays in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, that the saints might know "the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead".<a name=84:7></a> All these passages confirm me in putting forth the thought that the resurrection is the celebration of righteousness.<a name=84:8></a> The truth is that righteousness was accomplished in the death of Christ.<a name=84:9></a> What I understand by righteousness is redemption.<a name=84:10></a> Every right of God was taken up in the death of Christ and maintained; the right of mercy was declared, every liability under which man lay was met by redemption, and so the death of Christ was the accomplishment of righteousness.<a name=84:11></a> But we have not only the accomplishment of righteousness, but the celebration of righteousness.<a name=84:12></a> Righteousness is established and celebrated in a Man.<a name=84:13></a> Hence the expression used prophetically in regard to Christ, "Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings"; righteousness involves healing.<a name=84:14></a>

		The facts recorded in this chapter happened well nigh two thousand years ago; that is a long time in the way in which we reckon, but we sometimes forget that God does not count time: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day".<a name=90:1></a> But any way, the lapse of time has in no wise altered the attitude of the Lord.<a name=90:2></a> The point on which I purpose dwelling, the Lord helping me, is the attitude which Christ took here in regard to the disciples; it is still His attitude towards His people down here.<a name=90:3></a> I speak of His attitude, and of the proof of it, for the Lord is not only occupying a certain attitude towards His people, but is giving proof of it.<a name=90:4></a>

		I take up the subject in connection with what I have had to say previously in regard to this gospel, as to the way in which Christ is presented in Luke.<a name=90:5></a> He is, I judge, presented in a priestly way all through this gospel; attending upon man, in priestly grace, to bring home to him the knowledge of God.<a name=90:6></a> We see this in the case of the thief on the cross.<a name=90:7></a> The Lord was Himself suffering, and in the company of the thief; but He took occasion of it to attend on the thief, to bring the knowledge of God's grace home to him.<a name=90:8></a>

		The first thing the Lord does here is to assure the disciples of the reality of Himself as a risen Man; He took pains that way (verses 36 - 43).<a name=92:5></a> Nothing can be of greater moment than that, for if there is no resurrection, there is no triumph of God over death.<a name=92:6></a> Death is the penalty which has come in upon man by sin, resurrection is the triumph of God's power over death in virtue of redemption: hence resurrection is a point of cardinal importance.<a name=92:7></a> The apostle takes it up doctrinally in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, "By man came also the resurrection of the dead"; it has been brought to pass in the last Adam, the Head of every man.<a name=92:8></a> Here the Lord shows to them the reality of resurrection, in that He was actually in a body, even capable of eating and drinking.<a name=92:9></a> If we have not the resurrection, we had better give up the faith altogether, because the triumph of God over what has come in upon man by reason of sin cannot be witnessed to otherwise than by resurrection from the dead.<a name=92:10></a>

		I pass on to verses 46 - 48.<a name=95:2></a> The <i>first</i> consideration with God was man, not Israel.<a name=95:3></a> Israel thought that they were every consideration with God; but the truth comes out in Christ risen that He is the last Adam: that puts Him in relation, in a sense, to every man.<a name=95:4></a> The first Adam is dead long since; he is not head of anybody, he lost his place of headship morally when he fell; hence there really never was but one Head.<a name=95:5></a> In order that the Christ might take the place of the last Adam in regard to man, it behoved Him to suffer and to rise again, so that, in the name of the last Adam, the One who stands in relation to every man, repentance and forgiveness of sins might be proclaimed.<a name=95:6></a> His suffering and death had acquired for Himself as last Adam repentance and forgiveness of sins in regard to man; hence they were to be preached in His name.<a name=95:7></a> It is not simply that they were to be preached; the important expression in the passage is, "In his name".<a name=95:8></a> He had a name in relation to men, a new name which He had acquired by redemption.<a name=95:9></a> In Christ God is propitious toward the whole world.<a name=95:10></a> There is nothing which Christ has accomplished which He did not accomplish in a sense for Himself.<a name=95:11></a> He accomplished righteousness, that He might be the Sun of righteousness; He acquired forgiveness and repentance, in regard to man, that He might be the last Adam, the Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=95:12></a> It would not have been possible for Christ to take up the position of last Adam, had He not acquired repentance and forgiveness in regard to man.<a name=95:13></a> Now they are at the service of every man upon earth, they have been acquired by the One who is Head of every man.<a name=95:14></a> The anointed Man did not belong simply to the Jew; the proper idea connected with the Messiah

	<div class="paragraph">
		We come to the next point, verse 49: in this we see the effect of redemption, of His being the last Adam; no one would doubt that the reference is to the Spirit of God.<a name=96:3></a> It was not only that Christ had acquired repentance and forgiveness of sins; but, having acquired them, He was the One who could send the promise of the Father.<a name=96:4></a> I have little doubt that all the ways of grace in regard to man are in view of man receiving the gift of the Spirit.<a name=96:5></a> I do not think that forgiveness is the end and purpose of God's ways; but that man may receive the Spirit, and thus be brought into attachment to Christ.<a name=96:6></a> All God's ways and counsels centre in Christ.<a name=96:7></a> He is the One in whom God has purposed to gather together in one all things.<a name=96:8></a> The giving of the Holy Spirit was on the day of Pentecost, and the disciples were brought by it into attachment.<a name=96:9></a> The bond was established between them and Christ; they no longer belonged to this world.<a name=96:10></a> One brought into attachment to Christ belongs to Christ, and to the world of which Christ is the Centre.<a name=96:11></a> The great mistake which has been made in christendom generally is to connect Christ with <i>this</i> world.<a name=96:12></a> Christ and christianity have been captured, and made to do service to the world as it is.<a name=96:13></a> That never was the purpose of God.<a name=96:14></a> Whoever received the Spirit and was brought into attachment to Christ was delivered from the present course of things, because such were brought into that world which is centred in Him.<a name=96:15></a> To that end the Lord was going up on high, to send the promise of the Father.<a name=96:16></a> The point was that the testimony might go out from thence.<a name=96:17></a> Heaven was the real source of the testimony, and the substance of the testimony was Christ exalted

		In verses 50 and 51 we have the climax.<a name=97:7></a> It is remarkable that the Lord did not first bless them and then say that He would send the promise of the Father upon them.<a name=97:8></a> That seems the more natural course.<a name=97:9></a> He speaks about sending the promise of the Father, and then He blesses them.<a name=97:10></a> It is important to my mind, because in moral order the blessing follows upon the promise of the Father.<a name=97:11></a> The mind of Christ toward them was blessing, and in blessing them He was parted from them.<a name=97:12></a> Christ has gone up on high; the Comforter has been given.<a name=97:13></a> Attachment to Christ is brought about; we are married to Him, and the attitude of Christ towards His people here is still blessing.<a name=97:14></a> The predominant thought in Luke's gospel is of Christ as Priest.<a name=97:15></a> He is Priest after the order of Melchisedec, which is blessing.<a name=97:16></a> You may say, Is there nothing else connected with priesthood?<a name=97:17></a> Yes, surely; He sympathizes; He succours the tempted; He saves to the uttermost; He makes intercession.<a name=97:18></a> There are many things He does; but I do not think that even all these things come up to the height of His priesthood; He is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec, and what is properly priestly is the blessing of the people.<a name=97:19></a> The time will come when people will not want care or sympathy, when the universe will be filled with the knowledge of God; when people will not need to be saved to the

		The last words of a great man are generally of moment.<a name=101:1></a> He cannot have much before him in connection with this world; and is in measure free from being swayed and prejudiced by motives connected with worldly advantage.<a name=101:2></a> When a man comes towards the close of his life, he reviews his pathway, and you can therefore attach importance to his last words.<a name=101:3></a> Here we get the last words of a very distinguished man.<a name=101:4></a> He was raised up of God; God took him from the sheepfold and raised him up on high, set him in a distinguished place in the political firmament.<a name=101:5></a> God had a garden here upon earth, which consisted of a number of nations, in the midst of which God ruled.<a name=101:6></a> Israel was by far the most distinguished nation, and David the most distinguished man.<a name=101:7></a> He was the anointed of God, and ruled by divine right.<a name=101:8></a> Then he was the sweet psalmist of Israel; and Scripture gives us his last words.<a name=101:9></a> I think that we may fairly attach importance to them; they are pregnant with meaning, and well worthy of consideration.<a name=101:10></a> The interesting part is that, while he has to admit the failure of his own house, "Although my house be not so with God", yet his refuge was in the fidelity of God.<a name=101:11></a> This is a great thing for us; most of us would be prepared to admit that our houses are not perfect with God; we could not find unalloyed satisfaction in our houses; still, there is a refuge for those who are in the fear of God; we can count on His fidelity: "He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure".<a name=101:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I point out one thing in regard to David.<a name=102:1></a> In the historical books of Scripture David is the central point.<a name=102:2></a> The ordinary links of the people with God had previously broken down.<a name=102:3></a> The priesthood had failed; Eli had died; the ark had been taken by the Philistines.<a name=102:4></a> Then it is that David is raised up of God.<a name=102:5></a> He was "the beloved"; that is the meaning of his name; he formed a fresh link of the people with God on the ground of sovereign mercy.<a name=102:6></a> That is excessively important.<a name=102:7></a> The kingdom properly comes in with David; Saul was set aside from the outset.<a name=102:8></a> The kingdom really means the intervention of God in the rights of mercy.<a name=102:9></a> I do not think people sufficiently connect the idea of mercy with the kingdom; but that is what the kingdom is to us, and its purposes and intention is the bringing of man under the moral sway of God.<a name=102:10></a> Nothing else than mercy would do this.<a name=102:11></a> If man is to be brought under the moral sway of God, it must be through the expression of God's rights in mercy.<a name=102:12></a> There could be no kingdom of God except in mercy, and so it must be based on redemption.<a name=102:13></a> Men are all under death, under the curse of God; and unless redemption had come in for a foundation, there could be no kingdom of God at all.<a name=102:14></a> You will see how that comes out in connection with Christ.<a name=102:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say one thing in regard to David: he was the expression of the mercy of God.<a name=102:16></a> He was raised up in a very special way.<a name=102:17></a> At the beginning of his history in connection with the people he adventured himself against the giant Goliath, and killed him.<a name=102:18></a> It was the intervention of God in mercy on behalf of His people.<a name=102:19></a> But there is another very important point connected with David; he was raised up of God to bring the ark to Mount Zion.<a name=102:20></a> God would not allow the ark to remain among the Philistines; He smote them in the hinder parts and put them to a perpetual shame; and David brought the ark to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=103>[Page 103]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Zion.<a name=103:1></a> Zion was the place where God saw fit to dwell.<a name=103:2></a> They celebrated the establishment of the ark with the song, "His mercy endureth for ever".<a name=103:3></a> I think all ought to be able to see that the kingdom was the expression of God's rights of mercy in regard to the people.<a name=103:4></a> God retired into His rights and raised up the kingdom in David, to bring the people under the moral sway of God thus made known.<a name=103:5></a> Nothing very much was effected in that day; yet the kingdom went on for many years.<a name=103:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing marked David; he appreciated the mercy of which he was the expression.<a name=103:7></a> That he was the expression of God's mercy there can be no doubt, he came in when there was no help for the people except in the mercy of God; but in the history of David it is evident that he appreciated the mercy of which he was the expression.<a name=103:8></a> I refer to these things because they make it evident that David looked on, and the kingdom looked on, to One who was much greater than David.<a name=103:9></a> The ways of God did not terminate with David; and the promise to David, to which God pledged Himself, was that of his seed He would raise up One to sit upon his throne.<a name=103:10></a> You have to read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>to get the idea of the sure mercies of David.<a name=103:11></a> The sure mercies of David have pledged God to the restoration of Israel in the world to come.<a name=103:12></a> You will find that the prophets go on the ground of the sure mercies of David.<a name=103:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The utterance that we get here on the part of David is evidently prophetic; he was just about to pass away, and he reviewed his course.<a name=103:14></a> I have heard it said that when a man is drowning, in a moment all his life passes before his view.<a name=103:15></a> So it was with David, and the effect of it was that David could not find satisfaction in himself or in his house.<a name=103:16></a> David speaks here prophetically, by the Spirit of Jehovah, of the ruler among men.<a name=103:17></a> In a

		certain sense David himself had been a ruler among men; but he had not fulfilled what was spoken of here.<a name=104:1></a> "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God".<a name=104:2></a> As a matter of fact, David on more than one occasion proved himself lawless.<a name=104:3></a> David was really a man of faith and beloved of God; but when he came to the zenith of his power he proved that there was lawlessness with him.<a name=104:4></a> David was brighter in the day of adversity than in the day of prosperity.<a name=104:5></a> In adversity he shines, in prosperity he fails.<a name=104:6></a> Now he that rules among men must be just, or righteous, ruling in the fear of God.<a name=104:7></a> He should be as the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds.<a name=104:8></a> One cannot doubt for a moment that this points to the Sun of righteousness.<a name=104:9></a> What do you think will bring in the morning without clouds?<a name=104:10></a> I think the Sun will do it.<a name=104:11></a> In the physical world we see the beneficent effect of sunshine on the earth after rain.<a name=104:12></a> This scripture looks on to the time when the Sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in His wings.<a name=104:13></a> Before that the earth will come under very pernicious influences morally; there will be the combination here of all the influences of evil; then the Sun of righteousness will rise and disperse all.<a name=104:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moment the Lord Jesus came into this world He presented the kingdom of God, for He presented the rights of God in mercy.<a name=104:15></a> The law of God was in His heart, but He presented the rights of mercy, that men might be brought under the moral sway of God.<a name=104:16></a> You remember Mary Magdalene; the Lord cast seven devils out of her in the rights of mercy.<a name=104:17></a> She had no particular claim on God for that, but the Lord exercised the rights of mercy, with the effect that she was brought into the kingdom, the moral sway of God.<a name=104:18></a> So with the woman in the synagogue who had been bound eighteen years; the Lord released her; He exercised the rights of

	<div class="paragraph">
		mercy, and the woman was brought under the moral sway of God.<a name=105:1></a> In the case of the ten lepers: they were all cleansed, but nine of them never came into the kingdom; still God secured His tithe; the tenth came back and glorified God, he was subdued by the mercy of God.<a name=105:2></a> You must remember that the kingdom is God's assertion of Himself in the rights of mercy.<a name=105:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I say farther in regard to that, Christ appreciated the mercy which He expressed.<a name=105:4></a> He delighted in mercy, and in the exercise of it.<a name=105:5></a> The Lord never conferred any benefit grudgingly.<a name=105:6></a> He Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.<a name=105:7></a> It has been said by a very intelligent servant of God that Christ bore in His spirit what He took away by His power; and if He felt the ills under which men suffered, do you not think that He appreciated God's mercy towards man?<a name=105:8></a> I am sure everybody would be prepared to allow that.<a name=105:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we pass on we find that, in the mercy of God, the Lord laid the foundations of the kingdom in redemption.<a name=105:10></a> The mercy of God must rest on redemption, because man lay under liabilities to God, and they, of necessity, had to be met.<a name=105:11></a> Redemption came in; Christ by the grace of God tasted death for everything.<a name=105:12></a> Now God has appointed a day in the which He will judge, not only Israel, but the world, in righteousness.<a name=105:13></a> The ruler among men must be righteous.<a name=105:14></a> God is going to govern the world in righteousness, in the rights of mercy; and He has given assurance of it in the resurrection of the Man whom He has appointed.<a name=105:15></a> This is a wonderful thought to my mind; it shows me that God will establish the kingdom on the basis of resurrection, so that man may have a footing there.<a name=105:16></a> If the kingdom were established on the old ground of nature, death would be there, and the curse.<a name=105:17></a> God has been pleased to establish the kingdom on

	<div class="paragraph">
		the basis of resurrection, through redemption, in order that man may have a place there, and so He has given assurance of the kingdom to all men, in that He has raised Jesus from the dead.<a name=106:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have come now to the truth of things, the Sun of righteousness and the kingdom.<a name=106:2></a> As to the character of it, I quote a verse in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<a name=106:3></a> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity" (lawlessness).<a name=106:4></a> Christ proved Himself to be just.<a name=106:5></a> He delighted in righteousness; He loved every acknowledgment of the rights of God, whether it were in law or in mercy.<a name=106:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I trust you will be able to see how far the prophecy of David has been fulfilled.<a name=106:7></a> David looked forward to One not only positionally greater, but morally greater than himself; One who could be said to be righteous, the Sun of righteousness, rising with healing in His wings, bringing in the morning without clouds.<a name=106:8></a> The expression is beautiful.<a name=106:9></a> I want you to contemplate Christ in that light.<a name=106:10></a> We have come into the kingdom, under the moral sway of God; it has been established in the hearts of believers in the power of the Holy Spirit, so that the scripture can say, "The kingdom of God is .<a name=106:11></a>.<a name=106:12></a>.<a name=106:13></a> righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".<a name=106:14></a>

		This afternoon we had the christian presented in two aspects very distinctly: as "in Christ", and in his actual condition down here.<a name=112:1></a> If we look at the christian in Romans, we see him in his individuality.<a name=112:2></a> You do not get the "one new man" in Romans.<a name=112:3></a> The body is only brought in incidentally.<a name=112:4></a> The christian is a justified man in the place where he was a guilty man; he is in the Spirit, not in the flesh, or a debtor to it; it is a christian in his individual pathway through the wilderness.<a name=112:5></a> We do not get into the land in Romans.<a name=112:6></a> When I pass on to Colossians I come to another aspect.<a name=112:7></a> It is more corporate.<a name=112:8></a> In the passage read, I find the truth of one body.<a name=112:9></a> "To the which also ye have been called in one body" (verse 15).<a name=112:10></a> I have no doubt the reason is because this part of the epistle shows to us the testimony which is to be presented in saints down here corporately.<a name=112:11></a> That no one christian is adequate for the expression of Christ I should think every one would allow.<a name=112:12></a> The Lord when He comes is "to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe".<a name=112:13></a> In <i>all</i> His saints.<a name=112:14></a> In that day the saints will be the vessel for the display of the glory and beauty of the heavenly Man.<a name=112:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have just said this because I think there is a little danger of looking at the epistles simply as stepping-stones, though I have no doubt we learn in order.<a name=113:12></a> When we get to Ephesians we really get to where God started from; when we were dead in trespasses and sins, He quickened us together with Christ.<a name=113:13></a> That sheds immensely greater light on what we get in the other epistles; but Colossians continues as long as we are down here; there is to be the testimony of the new man, and at the same

		I feel in a sense the difficulty of presenting the subject which I have before me -- that is, the testimony -- and for the reason that many will regard it as a worn-out theme.<a name=136:1></a> The term has almost become hackneyed amongst us.<a name=136:2></a> But nevertheless I will venture to say a little about God's testimony, and will trace the line of that testimony through Scripture, and seek to show, if able, where that testimony now resides.<a name=136:3></a> And in connection with the subject I will say a word on the vessel of the testimony, and on the relation of the testimony to the vessel.<a name=136:4></a> Now, here are three pretty distinct points: the first, the testimony; then the vessel of the testimony, which in a certain sense is inseparable from it; and then what properly characterises the vessel of the testimony.<a name=136:5></a> That comes down, if not to practice, to what is very practical.<a name=136:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I begin by tracing the testimony of God through Scripture, and it is very interesting to see one mind, one thread, running through the whole word of God.<a name=137:2></a> The apprehension of this cannot fail to have the effect of confirming our confidence in the word of God, so that we have the sense that whatever may fail, or however we fail, yet the word of God cannot fail.<a name=137:3></a> That is a point to which every one of our souls must come.<a name=137:4></a> You have in the word of God not only what is in itself infallible, but what cannot fail us.<a name=137:5></a>

		The first point I take up in God's testimony is that seen in Abel, and I may remark that up to the church the testimony of God would appear to have been identified with individuals.<a name=137:6></a> I think that was so.<a name=137:7></a> The difficulty might be presented that Israel as a nation was here for the testimony of God; but I doubt if they really were that according to the purpose of God.<a name=137:8></a> They ought to have been a testimony, to have given by fruit-bearing, witness that they were a vine on earth; but when Christ came into the world, He says, "I am the true vine".<a name=137:9></a> Israel had the place of God's vine, but they were not the true vine.<a name=137:10></a> The Lord says, "I am the true vine" -- the genuine vine.<a name=137:11></a> Israel will, under Christ, come into the place hereafter, and will be a testimony here for God, but only in abiding in Christ.<a name=137:12></a> I make that remark in order to guard the particular point that in the Old Testament the testimony of God is bound up with individuals.<a name=137:13></a>

		Now I pass on to the next point, namely, Enoch.<a name=138:1></a> The theme of his testimony was the Lord's coming, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads".<a name=138:2></a> At that early date, that was his witness.<a name=138:3></a> It was in view of what was a necessity for that that he walked with God, and that he was not, for God took him.<a name=138:4></a> If you had not the light of translation, you could not understand how the saints would come with the Lord.<a name=138:5></a> It is in principle the difference between 1 and 2 Thessalonians; in the first epistle the saints are caught up to meet the Lord in the air; in the second epistle they come with Him.<a name=138:6></a> That is what came out in Enoch, and the effect of it on him was that he walked with God; he was thus the vessel of the testimony.<a name=138:7></a> He did not make a conspicuous figure on earth; he was obscure, and he disappeared, for God took him.<a name=138:8></a> He was the witness for God in that day.<a name=138:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to Noah.<a name=138:10></a> Noah is not, as Enoch, a witness of the coming of the Lord, but of the coming judgment.<a name=138:11></a> I need hardly say that judgment must connect itself very intimately with the coming of the Lord.<a name=138:12></a> Noah was a preacher of righteousness, and what righteousness meant was expressed in warning men of coming judgment.<a name=138:13></a> The effect on him of his testimony was that he, believing God, did what God told him to do -- he prepared an ark for the saving of his house.<a name=138:14></a> You see thus the effect of the testimony upon the vessel of it.<a name=138:15></a> Abel died; Enoch was not, for God took him; Noah was a preacher of righteousness, and built an ark for the saving of his house.<a name=138:16></a> That carries us up to the flood.<a name=138:17></a> Morally all was in a line.<a name=138:18></a>

		Now I come to later times, namely, to Abraham, and in him is marked a point of departure.<a name=138:19></a> It is not now simply a question of moral principles, as before the flood.<a name=138:20></a> In Abraham we come to another line, and it is indicated in that the <i>God of glory</i>

		But to return to Abraham.<a name=139:11></a> God gave the promises to Abraham.<a name=139:12></a> He promised to bless.<a name=139:13></a> In that way He anticipated the law and the curse.<a name=139:14></a> But another point comes out also in connection with Abraham, and that is, the title of God to dispose of the earth as He pleases.<a name=139:15></a> The world had become apostate; the spirit of antichrist was there; Babel was the proof that man had become apostate.<a name=139:16></a> In the face of this, God announces His purpose to dispose of the earth as He pleases.<a name=139:17></a> The earth does not belong to man.<a name=139:18></a> God has given it to man for enjoyment, but the earth is the Lord's and He will dispose of it to whom He will.<a name=139:19></a> God gave to Abraham the testimony of blessing -- he was to be the vessel of it, What was the effect upon him?<a name=139:20></a> He dwelt in a tent, but he looked for a city.<a name=139:21></a> He was a stranger and a pilgrim in this order of things, but he had a prospect -- he looked for a city that has foundations.<a name=139:22></a> He was a man of expectation.<a name=139:23></a> I never knew of a city in this world that had moral foundations.<a name=139:24></a> Rome had no foundations, or it would not have passed away.<a name=139:25></a> Its renown was largely built up on violence and tyranny.<a name=139:26></a> London has no foundations -- no moral ones.<a name=139:27></a> Abraham "waited for the city

		The next thing I take up is the tabernacle, and here the vessel of testimony was Moses.<a name=140:12></a> The truth foreshadowed in the giving of the law and the setting up of the tabernacle was this -- that where the law was written God would dwell, that was what God indicated.<a name=140:13></a> I hope to be able to make clear that when the law is written in man's heart, then the way is prepared for God to dwell among men.<a name=140:14></a> For the time being the law was written on tables of stone.<a name=140:15></a> God was acting on the principle of testing, therefore the law was not yet written in man's heart.<a name=140:16></a> But in the ways of God the law will be written in man's heart.<a name=140:17></a> The point of departure here is Christ.<a name=140:18></a> He said, "Thy law is within my heart".<a name=140:19></a> Not that the law was written

		there, I need hardly say, but it was within His heart, and the consequence of His coming is that the law will be written in Israel's heart; and when that is so, God will dwell with man.<a name=141:1></a> I do not doubt that this will be fulfilled in Israel in the future, when God consummates the new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.<a name=141:2></a> "Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and <i>they</i> shall be to me for people"; but "I will be to them for God" must be consequent on the law being written in the heart.<a name=141:3></a> There are two things consequent on the law being written in the heart: one is, that man becomes the reflex of God -- Christ as man was the reflex of God, He was so perfectly, as we see in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>-- and the other is, that at the same time every one has individual knowledge of God.<a name=141:4></a> Consequent on that, God sets up His dwelling among men.<a name=141:5></a> I think that was foreshadowed in the direction to make a sanctuary which God gave to Moses.<a name=141:6></a> Moses had to set up God's dwelling -- place, and to make everything according to the pattern shewed him in the mount.<a name=141:7></a> Moses was the vessel of the testimony in that day, and what marked him was that he was faithful in God's house.<a name=141:8></a> He was not only a stranger and a pilgrim -- he could not very well help being that, for he was in the wilderness.<a name=141:9></a> It had been different with Abraham: he dwelt in the land, and being rich he could have been otherwise.<a name=141:10></a> But it is in connection with God's house that Moses is spoken of as faithful.<a name=141:11></a> He did not deviate one jot or tittle from the directions given to him in the mount.<a name=141:12></a> He had a due sense of the importance of God's house, and of what it was to have to do with it.<a name=141:13></a> I think it would be well if we had more sense of the importance of God's house and of having to do with God in regard to it; we would not depart

		My subject is worship.<a name=157:3></a> It is important for us to understand something about worship; all the ideas around us as to it are fundamentally wrong, and I will tell you why -- it is that people come together for what they <i>find</i> prepared for them.<a name=157:4></a> Now that is not a true thought, for in what is true the point is not what you find but what you yourself bring.<a name=157:5></a> It is a fundamental difference which most can appreciate.<a name=157:6></a> In a large part of my life my thought as to the service of God was of coming to what I found ordained and arranged.<a name=157:7></a> In result I found, like many others, that true worship must be dependent on what we bring, for apart from that there is nothing to be found; and moreover you must not trust in any one else to bring anything.<a name=157:8></a> People come to our meetings and they have a sort of confidence that somebody will bring something, but the point is what <i>you</i> bring.<a name=157:9></a> The true ground of service or worship is seen in this chapter.<a name=157:10></a> We often speak of preaching or teaching, which have men in view, as service, but that is not the way in which the word is employed here; it means the service of God.<a name=157:11></a> In verse 1 and again in verses 6, 13, 14, it is the same word -- to serve or worship the living God.<a name=157:12></a> In verse 6 the worship of old is seen to depend on the priests, but who is the "your" in

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will say a little as to the preparation: if you have got the preparation, you will bring something, and so the preparation is very important.<a name=159:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps you will look at verses 11 - 14.<a name=159:7></a> Did you ever consider what that passage means?<a name=159:8></a> What I understand it to signify is that Christ has formed a platform before God which is available for us.<a name=159:9></a> You may say that it is a difficult idea to entertain; but you <i>must</i> entertain it.<a name=159:10></a> When He was down here it was not so.<a name=159:11></a> He abode alone in His own personal perfection, and there was nothing to hinder His returning to heaven from whence He came.<a name=159:12></a> But having accomplished redemption, Christ has entered on a ground which is available for us -- a point of the last moment for you and me to apprehend.<a name=159:13></a> People may say, Where is the holy place?<a name=159:14></a> I believe it is a moral idea; it is the ground or footing which Christ has taken up, and which is available for us, because He has ordained eternal redemption.<a name=159:15></a> It is a great thing to see that He has entered on a footing that is available for us.<a name=159:16></a> He <i>did</i> associate people with Himself on earth, but as to the platform on which He was, He was evidently alone; but now He has entered in.<a name=159:17></a> It is not a question of heaven or earth, it is not a place, but a ground, or whatever word you like to use, available for us, and on that we can stand before God.<a name=159:18></a> You do not want to go to church or chapel for that, nor to the meeting.<a name=159:19></a>

		If you do not find it outside the meeting you will not find it inside; it is the platform that He has found, and it is now the question of the individual apprehension in the soul of the place which Christ has taken.<a name=160:1></a> That is the first thing.<a name=160:2></a> I cannot talk of worship if that is not apprehended.<a name=160:3></a> It was not the mind of the Lord to return to heaven alone, He has found a ground available for us; you do not want a clergy or anything official, it is a question of the apprehension of each soul.<a name=160:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are two points in the preparation -- appreciation and purgation.<a name=160:5></a> You cannot do without either, and they have to follow in that order; then you have your preparation complete and are qualified for the service of God.<a name=160:6></a> You may have an archbishop or a cardinal, but without this preparation he cannot serve God; and if there is appreciation and purgation, a bed-ridden woman may be as qualified to serve as any other.<a name=160:7></a> A child might serve the living God, for with a child there may be appreciation and purgation, and no one can serve the living God without them.<a name=160:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now look at chapter 8: 6 - 13 and turn for a moment to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:38">Luke  10:38</a> - 42; 11: 1 - 4.<a name=160:9></a> I do not suppose you will see exactly the connection in my mind between these passages.<a name=160:10></a> I was saying that the first point as to qualification is to apprehend the platform on which Christ has entered.<a name=160:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I am going to speak now about the preparation.<a name=160:12></a> The first thing is to appreciate Christ as the covenant; you cannot understand what it is to approach God if you do not.<a name=160:13></a> In your own thought of things your man has changed; you have become another man by your appreciation of the covenant.<a name=160:14></a> I will tell you what is essential to a covenant on the part of God -- that it should make known what God is in His disposition towards us, as a man's will makes known his disposition towards his heirs.<a name=160:15></a>

		<a name=161>[Page 161]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might go through scripture and point to many covenants; the covenant after the flood made known the disposition of God towards man, and so with David, it made known God's disposition towards him, and the new covenant makes known His disposition now towards man.<a name=161:1></a> We only know God by his disposition towards us.<a name=161:2></a> Many of us here have children; my children know me by knowing my disposition towards them, that I would do the best I could for them.<a name=161:3></a> They cannot read my inmost heart, but they learn me by finding my disposition towards them.<a name=161:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another point, and that is -- knowing that disposition I respond to it.<a name=161:5></a> My child learns from infancy what my mind is toward it, and knowing me thus it responds to it.<a name=161:6></a> Those are two principles which everyone ought to take in.<a name=161:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the new covenant the importance is that God is known in His disposition towards us, and then that we respond to that.<a name=161:8></a> If that passage (chapter 8: 11, 12) means anything it expresses the disposition of God, and thus He is made known.<a name=161:9></a> But in the preceding verse it is said, "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people": that is the response to the knowledge of God.<a name=161:10></a> Things are stated in the inverse order to what is the case in their application to us, in that the knowledge comes first, and then the law of God is written in our hearts; that is the principle.<a name=161:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now how is all that to be brought about?<a name=161:12></a> By the appreciation of Christ, for we cannot see the truth except in Christ.<a name=161:13></a> We cannot understand the disposition of God towards men except as we see it in Christ.<a name=161:14></a> Hence, as I understand it, Christ is the covenant, for on the one hand it is in Him that

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:38">Luke  10:38</a> - 42 we see how Mary appreciated Christ, and I think it was founded on this, that He made known God in His disposition towards her; I connect it with verse 22, "All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him".<a name=162:3></a> The ground and character of her appreciation was that Christ revealed God to her.<a name=162:4></a> But in chapter 11: 1 - 3 we get another point.<a name=162:5></a> What suggested to the disciples that they should ask Him to teach them to pray?<a name=162:6></a> We might have done the same.<a name=162:7></a> I think they felt that Christ was everything a man should be for God and therefore that He could teach them to pray; He Himself could spend a night in prayer to God.<a name=162:8></a> When He was born there was good pleasure in men.<a name=162:9></a> Now if you have followed what I have said, you will see that we get two things in Christ.<a name=162:10></a> He declared God's disposition, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, it was declared in Himself.<a name=162:11></a> Those who came in contact with Him felt the grace of God, there can be no doubt about it.<a name=162:12></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:41">Luke  7:41</a> - 50 because it is evident to my mind that the woman in Simon's house apprehended that God was declared to her in Jesus; in the parable that the Lord propounded He exposed things as they were, but there was grace.<a name=162:13></a> He was the creditor, and she felt it; but He was the covenant to her; God was declared to her soul.<a name=162:14></a> But my point is, we want to appreciate Christ not only as declaring God, but as being the perfect response on man's part before God, so that you can ask Him to teach you to pray.<a name=162:15></a> He leads us into the response, we get the ability to pray from Christ.<a name=162:16></a> Christ is the covenant; we apprehend Him as the One who has

		declared God; but who is also all that man should or would be for God.<a name=163:1></a> It is a true saying that people are pretty much what they appreciate, and if you appreciate Christ as having declared God's disposition, and as being all that a man could be for God, you have changed your man; you have set yourself aside and put on another man -- the new man which is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=163:2></a> You could not understand the new man if you did not learn it in Christ.<a name=163:3></a> I discard the old man and appreciate the new, and am characterised by what I appreciate.<a name=163:4></a> If Christ is appreciated in my heart, God is known, and my delight is in the knowledge of God, I joy in God by our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=163:5></a> We are to glory in knowing God, and we know Him by knowing His disposition.<a name=163:6></a> But then there is the other side; Christ teaches me to pray, I pray by His Spirit.<a name=163:7></a> I cannot conceive any more radical change in a person, it meant a change of husband, and if so, a change of man morally on my part.<a name=163:8></a> I am no longer in the flesh, for the Spirit of God dwells in me.<a name=163:9></a> Christ is available for everybody, and He is the covenant to me, and so the believer gets the appreciation of Christ, and if he comes to the meeting he brings his appreciation of Christ.<a name=163:10></a> Do not put this aside, and say, somebody else will bring it; take care that <i>you</i> bring it.<a name=163:11></a> It is not the exclusive portion of the learned or intelligent, but it is for the youngest and most illiterate.<a name=163:12></a> What is there in this Babylonish world that is really worth anything but the appreciation of Christ?<a name=163:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the question of worship is a very important one, for we may practically drop down to what is around and look for a worldly sanctuary and ordinances of service.<a name=164:16></a> It might have been right once, but it is not so now; <i>now</i> all depends on what we bring; each must bring something; do not trust your neighbour to bring it, bring it yourself.<a name=164:17></a>

		I would like to say a word as to the progress of the soul, and its entrance into the sense of spiritual blessing.<a name=165:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that we cannot at once enter into things in the measure in which God has presented them to us.<a name=165:2></a> If God speaks to us, He speaks of necessity from His own fulness; it is impossible that we can all at once take in all that God proposes to us; if that were the case we should in a sense be as great in understanding as God.<a name=165:3></a> I believe we are led on into the consciousness of blessing just in proportion as we are in the apprehension of Christ; that is, we enjoy it, the truth works within us just as there is the apprehension of what is true in Christ, for the Spirit in the believer answers to what Christ is at the right hand of God.<a name=165:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have been struck with the sequence of the three chapters, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, 5 and 6.<a name=165:5></a> I believe they speak on the side of our apprehension of the truth.<a name=165:6></a> The Lord had revealed in chapter 3 the proposition or thought of God, and therefore to my mind <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>is essentially a gospel chapter, it is the revelation of what God has proposed.<a name=165:7></a> Our entering into it I believe comes out in the succeeding chapters 4, 5 and 6, and culminates in chapter 7.<a name=165:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just touch for a moment on the point of these chapters, especially on what comes out in chapter 5.<a name=165:9></a> I think there are three forms of pressure from which the Lord proposes to deliver man in the three chapters.<a name=165:10></a> In chapter 4 the <i>deliverance is from sin</i>, in chapter 5 the <i>deliverance is from weakness</i>, and in chapter 6, in the satisfying the soul, if I might use the expression, the <i>deliverance</i>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>is from want</i> -- these are three great things for God in His grace to effect for man down here in the very scene of sin and weakness and want.<a name=166:1></a> I assert that man is delivered from sin, raised up out of weakness, and every need of his heart is satisfied and more than satisfied.<a name=166:2></a> I think everybody would admit that that is a great thing to be effected for man down here, and in it is the fulfilment of the thought in chapter 3, "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=166:3></a> I get it carried out experimentally in that way.<a name=166:4></a> It is noticeable that there is but little reference to the future except in chapter 6, where the Lord says, "I will raise him up at the last day".<a name=166:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to touch, <i>seriatim</i>, on the points I have indicated.<a name=166:6></a> Jesus is presented in chapter 4 as the Christ, for although the Father's name occurs in the chapter in connection with worship, the name of the Son does not appear, and it is as the Christ that He communicates to the believer the living water.<a name=166:7></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, "In whom having believed", that is, in the Christ, "ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise".<a name=166:8></a> It is a great thing to get hold of the truth of the Christ.<a name=166:9></a> In the Old Testament we find the thought of the anointed of God, the One who, rejected here of men, is to take the earth for His inheritance.<a name=166:10></a> I believe you have a larger range of thought opened out in Hebrews, that He is the heir of all things; that connects itself with what we have in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, the mystery of God's will.<a name=166:11></a> To gather up in one all things in the Christ.<a name=166:12></a> He is the One who has to take all things, and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>it is He who communicates the living water; the water that He would give was to be in the believer a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=166:13></a> This is what I would call initial and introductory.<a name=166:14></a> Sin has met its judgment in Christ.<a name=166:15></a> He has fulfilled the type of the brazen

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the truth of eternal life comes in the most important point of deliverance from sin.<a name=167:2></a> You will never gain deliverance from sin except by getting another object than self before the soul.<a name=167:3></a> You must of necessity be superseded in your own eyes, and this is only by the power of another object, another man before the soul.<a name=167:4></a> I know that plenty of people would tell me that you are dead to sin, but you will not die to it till you get another object before the soul, and that is the second Man, who has entered into the holiest for us, and in the apprehension of that really lies the secret of deliverance from sin.<a name=167:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 I get a point further; it is here more than the communication of the Spirit of life to be in the believer, for we get the man raised up.<a name=167:6></a> The Son quickens the body, but the point in the chapter is that He raises up the man, and a wonderful thing it is for a man to be raised up out of the weakness which sin has brought upon him.<a name=167:7></a> The point of the chapter is the raising of the man.<a name=167:8></a> I believe it is effected by the apprehension in the soul of the truth of the Son and what depends on this, for in this chapter it is not the Christ who is brought before us, but the Son -- He reveals the Father.<a name=167:9></a> I get here the truth of the Person; He is the Son, and therefore He is competent to reveal the Father, that is the wonderful thing that comes out in this chapter.<a name=167:10></a> He knows the Father, lies in His bosom, knows all that is there.<a name=167:11></a> The Father loves the Son and shews Him all things that Himself doeth.<a name=167:12></a> You have got now to a grand point, you are raised up into a new scene altogether, and the new scene presented to us is an unfolding beyond all that was ever revealed before.<a name=167:13></a> None but the Son can reveal the Father, it is not any amount of language that could reveal the

		The apostle's desire for the little children evidently was stability, that they might not be moved by any antichristian influences that were at work.<a name=176:6></a> The object of these was to neutralise the revelation of God in Christ, that which is designated as "the truth".<a name=176:7></a> The Father and the Son were denied.<a name=176:8></a> The real test in regard to this is the Son, for there may be loose talk as to the fatherhood of God to men, which does not come out of the fact that the Father has been set forth in the Son.<a name=176:9></a> The unwary might be beguiled by this.<a name=176:10></a> Now the safeguard of the little children was, that they had received from the Holy One that which completed the truth, and made good in them the revelation.<a name=176:11></a> The Father had sent the

		It is not difficult to see that in the history of the Lord down here, the moment arrived at in this chapter was a very critical one -- a great change was about to take place.<a name=237:1></a> This is indicated by the words in verse 4 -- "He left them and went away".<a name=237:2></a> From that point the Lord is occupied with the disciples: He looks upon them as the bread, and He warns them against leaven.<a name=237:3></a> They were the body He was concerned about, and they were not to be leavened with the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.<a name=237:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to go a point further (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>, 31), what has come to pass is that Christ is made of God wisdom to us.<a name=248:5></a> He is a source or stock, so to speak.<a name=248:6></a> The man not according to God, the man after the flesh, who was under the judgment of death; that man has been removed in judgment in the death of Christ, that Christ might be the source of a company.<a name=248:7></a> "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus".<a name=248:8></a> Of God in Him.<a name=248:9></a> Christ is the source of life; we have received living water from Him.<a name=248:10></a> Every christian derives his moral being directly from God in Christ Jesus.<a name=248:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing when wisdom possesses a man's heart; it is thus we find ourselves in the midst of the paths of judgment, and our treasuries are filled by wisdom.<a name=248:12></a> The point to be desired in the experience of christians is that Christ should be in their hearts as wisdom: and He is made wisdom to us that we may not miss our way; it is a great thing to be kept of God.<a name=248:13></a> When the woman of the city went forth from the presence of Christ she found a new path for her feet, she did not revert to her previous course.<a name=248:14></a> Wisdom undertakes to find a path for us and to lead us in it; the man who is subject to Christ will find that path and be maintained in it by his soul's appreciation of Christ.<a name=248:15></a> I have thought much lately that christians often do not go the right way to secure their own happiness.<a name=248:16></a> If they appreciated Christ and were content to be guided by the appreciation of Christ, they would be happier in this world.<a name=248:17></a>

		The passage in Matthew presents a very striking picture, and evidently relates to the present time; it follows on a statement in the previous chapter, "the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites", that is, the parable presents to us the kingdom of heaven as it is at the end.<a name=251:1></a> The latter part of chapter 24 looks on to the time of the Lord's coming to judge His servants.<a name=251:2></a> Then in the beginning of chapter 25 we have the kingdom of heaven, in view of the coming of the Lord.<a name=251:3></a> All will have noticed that the cry has gone forth, "Behold, the bridegroom" -- everything is looking on to the coming of the Bridegroom, that is the consummation of all.<a name=251:4></a> And hence I would like every one to apprehend the importance of the parable.<a name=251:5></a> On our part we have to see to it that we have the preparation for it, and evidently one important item in the preparation is to have oil.<a name=251:6></a> The foolish virgins had no oil, they were in want, and in answer to their appeal the wise virgins answered wisely, "Go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves".<a name=251:7></a> That is the only way in which the oil is gained.<a name=251:8></a>

		But another point comes out in the psalm, "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun" -- the sun is the centre of the heavens -- "which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race" -- that is the figure, and I have not a doubt that the Spirit of God in inditing that psalm by David had Christ in view.<a name=252:4></a> There is a quotation from that psalm in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10">Romans  10</a>, "Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world", illustrative of the gospel; and the Bridegroom is really Christ.<a name=252:5></a> I refer to that because it shows that the thought of the Bridegroom has ever been before God.<a name=252:6></a> From the beginning of this world's history God has had one Man before Him, and that is Christ.<a name=252:7></a> Adam was the figure of Him that was to come; that is the Bridegroom.<a name=252:8></a>

		THE WRITING OF GOD

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:1">2 Corinthians  3:1</a> - 18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that what the apostle had before him when writing this passage was not what saints knew or might know, but what was <i>written</i> of God in them.<a name=316:1></a> That which is written is permanent, while that which a man knows may pass away.<a name=316:2></a> <i>Writing</i> is the great point in this chapter.<a name=316:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthians were a letter of commendation to the apostle, and that because there was the writing of Christ in their hearts.<a name=316:4></a> It was this thought of writing which led the apostle on to speak about the new covenant.<a name=316:5></a> The old covenant (that is, the ten commandments) had been written on tables of stone, but the new covenant is written in the hearts of the saints.<a name=316:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what God is concerned with is that which is written in our hearts, not what we know; of course we must know, for the mind is the eye to the heart, but what is written is indelible, being by the Spirit of God.<a name=316:7></a> What is written is of course what you have known, but the point is that what is written by the Spirit of God is ineffaceable.<a name=316:8></a> Many christians are eager about and content with knowing the truth, but God is bent upon that which is written in the heart.<a name=316:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two sides therefore to ministry -- the objective side, that which is presented to the saints for the enlightenment of the soul, and that which is effectuated in us by the Spirit.<a name=316:10></a> The latter is in a sense the answer to the former.<a name=316:11></a> The apostle is speaking here of that which the Spirit of God had written in the Corinthians.<a name=316:12></a> Memory may enable me to retain an address, but what is effective and abiding is that which is written in me of the Spirit.<a name=316:13></a> "The same anointing teacheth you of all things"; this refers

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=317>[Page 317]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to what is written on the fleshy tables of the heart.<a name=317:1></a> The writing of the living God cannot be effaced; it is that which will remain with us for eternity.<a name=317:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will refer to what <i>is</i> written.<a name=317:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>we get the terms of the new covenant, namely, "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel .<a name=317:4></a>.<a name=317:5></a>.<a name=317:6></a> saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbour .<a name=317:7></a>.<a name=317:8></a>.<a name=317:9></a> saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.<a name=317:10></a> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more".<a name=317:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we have the <i>terms</i> and the people with whom the covenant is to be made -- the house of Israel and the house of Judah; but my point in turning to the passage is because it shews that God's laws are to be <i>written</i> in their hearts.<a name=317:12></a> This will be so in order that they may be a reflex of His mind, and in a sense of Himself, and that every one of them may have individual knowledge of God -- "<i>all</i> shall know me, from the least to the greatest".<a name=317:13></a> Another point comes out in the last verse, "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old".<a name=317:14></a> So that it is <i>enduring</i>, will not become old; there never will be another to succeed it.<a name=317:15></a> Now you will observe that these three thoughts come out in the chapter we have read.<a name=317:16></a> The apostle speaks of himself as minister of the <i>spirit</i> of the new covenant, not of the letter, and tells us that the Lord is the Spirit.<a name=317:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The new covenant is contrasted with the system which ministered death and condemnation.<a name=317:18></a> The ministry in the new is of the Spirit, or life, and of righteousness, and its glory is enduring.<a name=317:19></a>

		It is in the apprehension that the Lord is the Spirit that a man is made alive.<a name=319:8></a> It is when Christ is appreciated as last Adam that the Spirit quickens.<a name=319:9></a> Underneath the letter you get what was the mind and thought of God, and that is that there should be a perfect reflex of Himself here, and this is what came out in Christ.<a name=319:10></a>

		Now I will speak of the last point, and that is that the new covenant is enduring.<a name=320:6></a> "If that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious".<a name=320:7></a> That in which God had no pleasure could not abide, and for the reason that what does not touch the heart effects nothing for God.<a name=320:8></a>

		Now this truth is presented in Scripture in an objective way as truth in Jesus, that we may see it, but what has been effected in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ has to be made good spiritually in the believer.<a name=335:5></a> Now the blood is the witness that man in the flesh is gone from before God; the blood is the life, and if the life is gone the man has no longer place; the blood of Christ is the witness that the man has been removed sacrificially -- "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=335:6></a> Reconciliation is brought in because the man that had brought in the distance between God and man has been removed; and that for the glory of God.<a name=335:7></a> The man has been removed vicariously from under the eye of God, in the Son of man lifted up.<a name=335:8></a> The worst point about man was that Christ could not trust him.<a name=335:9></a> You would have thought there might be some good in man when his mind was convinced through the miracles -- no, he is like a bent bow, which goes back again; he acknowledges the miracles, but he is not to be trusted.<a name=335:10></a>

		We have seen the simplest elements of christianity realised in those who were young in the faith in such a way as that they were marked by them.<a name=342:12></a> And the same things remain unchanged in regard of us.<a name=342:13></a> We need to be roused from the lethargic influences around.<a name=342:14></a> Christendom has long given up the coming of the Lord, and is using the word of God to serve its own ends; and it behoves every one who has been really affected by the gospel to seek to get back to what marked the saints in early days.<a name=342:15></a> The power for that lies in the knowledge of God as He has revealed Himself, and in the appropriation of the Son as the expression and witness of our blessing, and as having power to completely conform us to Himself.<a name=342:16></a>

		READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON SOME OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:59">John  6:59</a> - 71
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All I have to say to you, beloved friends, is of a very simple character (but I trust it may lead each of us into what may be real, practical results), to speak of the power of Christ to attract us and to attach us to Himself.<a name=343:1></a> It is not to believe certain doctrines, but what is connected with our relations to Christ, being actually bound to the Lord with the sense in our souls of it; the sense must be there and there is no real sense of it until we are attached.<a name=343:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step follows, He leads us to go in, we have access by Him; and the third step, He establishes Himself in our hearts so that we may witness for Him.<a name=343:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Each of these three steps is essential.<a name=343:4></a> There can be no knowledge of God without attachment to Christ.<a name=343:5></a> He has accomplished redemption to deliver us from this present evil world.<a name=343:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Who is the One here free from the world of sin?<a name=343:7></a> It can only be said of one Man, and that is Christ; so salvation must be in Christ, not in any one else, the salvation which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=343:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other steps equally important to conduct us to God; we may not be very far on the road, but wherever we are it must be very real to us, and thus we should be witnesses for Him, Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith.<a name=343:9></a> Then we shall be morally qualified to be witnesses for Him.<a name=343:10></a> It all comes down from above.<a name=343:11></a> We find the holy city, the new Jerusalem, spoken of as coming from God -- the Holy Spirit has come to us from God.<a name=343:12></a> We have been

		<a name=344>[Page 344]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		taken in, so to speak, that we may come out as witnesses down here.<a name=344:1></a> Now there are two points to which I wish to call your attention.<a name=344:2></a> One is Christ as our attraction, and the second is that we have to be attached to Him.<a name=344:3></a> All must begin with attraction to Him.<a name=344:4></a> The Lord indicates that Himself when he says, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=344:5></a> To use an illustration which I do not altogether care for, the thought conveys the idea of a magnet.<a name=344:6></a> Christ is the magnet which attracts hearts to Himself; there must be something in Christ which attracts.<a name=344:7></a> Attachment to Him we have to learn.<a name=344:8></a> The attractions in Him are vast and varied, and a long time must elapse before we can learn all the attractions.<a name=344:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the Lord was down here He was a point of attraction to a great many; they were attracted to Him in a wonderful way.<a name=344:10></a> We know that some, while attracted to Him, did not walk with Him, but there were those who were not only attracted but attached to Him; they were held to Him by a wonderful power.<a name=344:11></a> It is needless for me to give examples, many will come to your minds, but I just refer to the disciples, and then there were many women mentioned, and we know at the day of Pentecost a hundred and twenty were gathered, attached to Him, and held to Him notwithstanding His death.<a name=344:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Christ there is nothing to hold the natural man.<a name=344:13></a> Thus in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:1">Isaiah  53:1</a> - 3 the estimate of the natural man: "He hath no form nor comeliness .<a name=344:14></a>.<a name=344:15></a>.<a name=344:16></a> no beauty that we should desire him .<a name=344:17></a>.<a name=344:18></a>.<a name=344:19></a> he was despised, and we esteemed him not".<a name=344:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things mark the natural man's estimate of Christ.<a name=344:21></a> Now we find another thing: in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:52">Luke  2:52</a> "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man".<a name=344:22></a> In looking at this we have to remember this was said of Him before He entered into His ministry -- before He came out publicly in

		connection with His word and works.<a name=345:1></a> It is only there He can be really known.<a name=345:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know there have been knight-errants for Christ, for one raised up in their imaginations, and it is very possible to have a Christ of the imagination, not the real Christ; the truth of the matter is that no one can know Christ save through His death, apart from what His death expresses.<a name=345:3></a> It was the great expression of Himself.<a name=345:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know He was the Sin-bearer, but I am not just now looking at that side of things; but His death was the perfect expression of Himself.<a name=345:5></a> So we announce His death, and when He comes again He will come unto salvation.<a name=345:6></a> No form nor comeliness, there is nothing to appeal to the natural man.<a name=345:7></a> He never fitted in with the orderings of this world, as people born into the world are fitted into the positions they are born into as they grow up; but Christ was morally outside of all, and man did not, could not, esteem Him.<a name=345:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the temptations presented by Satan was the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; Satan is the god of this world.<a name=345:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other point I wanted to bring before you is the power of attachment to Christ.<a name=345:10></a> He was the perfect expression of the grace of God, and is, because He is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.<a name=345:11></a> His position has been changed, but morally He is the same and will be so for ever, and He declares it, because He came to declare His righteousness; and we have to remember there is the righteousness of grace as well as that of the law.<a name=345:12></a> John the baptist preached the last, Christ preached the righteousness of grace.<a name=345:13></a> He was here to talk about grace, and He not only talked about it but He was the perfect expression of it.<a name=345:14></a> He was full of grace and truth.<a name=345:15></a> He was the living Bread which came down from heaven.<a name=345:16></a> It is a very great point to me to see

	<div class="paragraph">
		what is in the heart of God.<a name=346:1></a> Christ was the embodiment of what is in the heart of God to man.<a name=346:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:41">Luke  7:41</a> - 50.<a name=346:3></a> God is presented to us here as the Creditor; there are two debtors, and He forgave them both; that was surely an expression of grace; grace to frankly forgive when they had nothing to pay.<a name=346:4></a> The mind of the Creditor to both debtors was the same.<a name=346:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Simon did not apprehend it, but the woman did, and He says to her, "Thy sins are forgiven .<a name=346:6></a>.<a name=346:7></a>.<a name=346:8></a> go in peace".<a name=346:9></a> She had, so to speak, the Spirit given to her as a witness.<a name=346:10></a> What is true is, the mind of the Creditor was the same towards both debtors.<a name=346:11></a> All here would admit the expression of God's grace to themselves, but the wonderful thing is, God's mind towards all debtors is the same.<a name=346:12></a> Christ proved a great point of attraction to that woman.<a name=346:13></a> She was a suitable object for grace, and she apprehended the grace that was present in the Person of Christ, and I do not think she was ever detached from Christ again.<a name=346:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same thing is true of us; the finest man in the world is nothing in the eye of God.<a name=346:15></a> No man, whoever he may be, can make amends to God.<a name=346:16></a> There is nothing in man that can enable him to pay his debt; he has nothing to pay, and, this being so, all alike are fit objects for God's grace, and His attitude is alike to all.<a name=346:17></a> "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins".<a name=346:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to pass on to another point of attachment.<a name=346:19></a> God and man have been brought together.<a name=346:20></a> In the incarnation of Christ God has been brought in touch with man.<a name=346:21></a> The Son of God became man; He was not going to abide alone, others would be associated with Him.<a name=346:22></a> I see an illustration of this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:47">John  1:47</a>, etc.<a name=346:23></a> In speaking of God and man being brought together I ought to have referred to a verse in 1 Timothy: "For there is one God, and one mediator
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=347>[Page 347]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		between God and men, the man Christ Jesus".<a name=347:1></a> The Mediator brings God and man together.<a name=347:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no mediator in the promises, for they were all on one side.<a name=347:3></a> In regard to God and man, two parties, a mediator was required.<a name=347:4></a> What has really come to pass, God and man have been brought together by the Mediator, and it means we are brought into attachment to the Man.<a name=347:5></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit".<a name=347:6></a> Now Nathanael in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>had that Man before him, a despised Nazarene, as he at first saw Him.<a name=347:7></a> And yet, after all, He so attached Nathanael to Himself that he has to own, "Thou art the Son of God".<a name=347:8></a> Thus we have a picture, God and man brought together in the one Man.<a name=347:9></a> Every one here ought to be able to apprehend that God and men have been brought together.<a name=347:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People talk of men and their doings, but there is only one Man before God; He is Head of every man.<a name=347:11></a> Now there is another point in regard to the power of attachment to Christ, and that is that He has taken up man's cause to be the vessel of blessing to man.<a name=347:12></a> Now for this I will give you an illustration in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:1">John  12:1</a> - 8.<a name=347:13></a> We get a contrast here to what we had in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=347:14></a> There the woman washed His feet with her tears.<a name=347:15></a> Mary in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>anointed the feet of Jesus, a very great token of her affection and attachment to Christ.<a name=347:16></a> She appreciated Him knowing who He was.<a name=347:17></a> She would remember Him as the One who had raised Lazarus out of the grave, and yet saw in Him the One who was going into death to take up the curse in order to be the appointed vessel of blessing; the true Isaac, the vessel of Abraham's blessing to bless the nations.<a name=347:18></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:13">Galatians  3:13</a>, 14.<a name=347:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought presented was that death could not hold Him.<a name=347:20></a> He dispossessed death of its power; it could not remain in His presence one moment, but He went into death to take the curse under which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=348>[Page 348]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		man was; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit.<a name=348:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these are three important points I have endeavoured to bring before you:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) Christ, the expression of God's grace to every man.<a name=348:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) God and men have been brought together in one Man, the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=348:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) That He has taken up the curse under which men lay in order to be the appointed vessel of blessing to men.<a name=348:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember He left this earth in blessing the disciples.<a name=348:5></a> He abides in the same attitude.<a name=348:6></a> Did you ever consider what blessing involves?<a name=348:7></a> I can tell you what curse is: man under the curse withers, like the fig-tree the Lord cursed; under blessing there is enlargement, the consciousness of divine favour, expansion.<a name=348:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point: all we want in the way of help and support is found in Christ.<a name=348:9></a> The capability to heal and support man is all to be found in Him.<a name=348:10></a> He gives to us living water, springing up to everlasting life.<a name=348:11></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>gives us an illustration on this point.<a name=348:12></a> The Lord used to speak in parables because He had to deal with unbelief.<a name=348:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parables required an expositor, and He was the expositor.<a name=348:14></a> Now in this passage we get the neighbour, and what comes out in the neighbour is the character of mercy, he "went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast".<a name=348:15></a> What we find is this, that we want a great deal more than forgiveness of sins.<a name=348:16></a> He gives us the Spirit to accomplish His purpose in us in order to bless us.<a name=348:17></a> When has any one conferred things on us like this?<a name=348:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Suppose a person were to give you a million, what is it worth in sickness and death?<a name=348:19></a> It may enable you

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to have doctors and comforts and all that sort of thing, but what is the worth of these things in death?<a name=349:1></a> He can pour in oil and wine.<a name=349:2></a> He can bind up our wounds.<a name=349:3></a> He can heal, He can support, He ministers the Spirit and carries us along the pathway here.<a name=349:4></a> And no doubt many of us can testify thereto.<a name=349:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just one point more: we have the Lord presented to our hearts as the Centre around whom are gathered all the counsels of God.<a name=349:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		See in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:26">Luke  24:26</a>: "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?<a name=349:7></a>" You find a parcel of foolish men attacking Scripture; they do not in the least understand the scope and meaning of it, or the purpose of it, and it is a poor thing to attack that which a man does not understand.<a name=349:8></a> To me it is one of the most wonderful things that we should have the Scriptures written at different times by different men, yet all through there is one central figure, the One who is the Centre of all divine counsel and purpose.<a name=349:9></a> He is to arise the Sun of righteousness, the Fulfiller of the mystery of His will; God's purpose will thus be made known in Him.<a name=349:10></a> He is the Centre of all, and He is capable of heading all things.<a name=349:11></a> It is a very great thing for us to have these things made known to us, "He opened to us the scriptures".<a name=349:12></a> Think of the Lord expounding the scriptures: from Genesis to Malachi they testify to Him.<a name=349:13></a> He is the central Figure of the books of Moses, as in the Psalms and the prophets.<a name=349:14></a> As He said, "Search the scriptures".<a name=349:15></a> I think the effect of all this would be greatly to establish the hearts of the saints.<a name=349:16></a> The proofs of Scripture must be its own evidence.<a name=349:17></a> Scripture is the test of faith.<a name=349:18></a> The ground of faith is Christ.<a name=349:19></a> The Spirit is now the expositor of Scripture.<a name=349:20></a> I believe, if we take up things in this way, it would enlarge our thoughts of Christ, and greatly attract us to Him; we should be bound to admire Him.<a name=349:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the present time we get everything that can be secured to us and maintained in us by the Spirit of God.<a name=351:1></a> This marks the present time, so that we have no lack: everything is maintained by the Spirit; but on the other hand it is a time of testing for the saints.<a name=351:2></a> It is not like the time to come, the time that shall be when the Bridegroom comes, and the time of testing will be over.<a name=351:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every blessing must be according to the pleasure and will of God; that must be the source of everything.<a name=351:4></a> Every thought for man has its origin in the pleasure of God; that is why the Lord Jesus said, "I come to do thy will".<a name=351:5></a> Then, too, the blessing is secured and maintained in Christ; that is very important; and in regard of us, every blessing must be witnessed to us by the Spirit down here, by whom everything comes to us.<a name=351:6></a> There must be the witness of the blessing down here.<a name=351:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Forgiveness of sins is also in the pleasure and will of God; it is secured in Christ and witnessed to us by the Spirit.<a name=351:8></a> We do not get the witness until there is faith in Christ, then we have forgiveness of sins.<a name=351:9></a> While it is true that there is a point where the blessing is secured, yet in ourselves and without there are not a few contrary elements; our surroundings affect us.<a name=351:10></a> If an angel came into the world, nothing would affect him; but with us there is so much that is kindred to it, hence it is that we are affected, and hence it is that faith has to overcome the world, and faith has to be maintained.<a name=351:11></a> It is a time of testing for us, and will be as long as the Lord is absent.<a name=351:12></a> God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What leads me to speak of this is that one great test now is fidelity to the Shepherd; following the Shepherd is a very great point.<a name=352:2></a> The church is a kind of connecting link between the past and the future; one example of this is in regard of the law.<a name=352:3></a> God cannot set aside the great moral principles of the law, though He has set aside the covenant.<a name=352:4></a> The law was given to Israel and they did not fulfil it, but now we get the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit".<a name=352:5></a> It will be fulfilled in the world to come.<a name=352:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church comes in as a connecting link in the ways of God between the past and the future in order that there may be no lapse.<a name=352:7></a> The righteous requirements of the law are maintained when the Spirit is in the church.<a name=352:8></a> In the world to come it is part of the new covenant.<a name=352:9></a> There are many other ways in which the church is a connecting link; it is "a holy nation", and thus comes in, in a sense, as a nation.<a name=352:10></a> As Peter says, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light".<a name=352:11></a> Paul, too, speaks of Christ having redeemed us from all lawlessness to "purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works".<a name=352:12></a> The kingdom, too, is manifested now in the church and will be re-established in Jerusalem, so that we get the thought of a city also.<a name=352:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this scripture we get the thought of the Shepherd, the flock, and eternal life.<a name=352:14></a> Of old the flock was Jehovah's flock.<a name=352:15></a> He led them by the hand of Moses.<a name=352:16></a> David, too, was a shepherd of God's people.<a name=352:17></a> The divine idea of a king is seen in a shepherd.<a name=352:18></a> Who is first exposed to danger?<a name=352:19></a> The shepherd.<a name=352:20></a> That characterised David when all Israel were affrighted

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have come to a time of a shepherd and a flock.<a name=353:4></a> Christ is the Shepherd.<a name=353:5></a> He is Jehovah.<a name=353:6></a> It is Jehovah's flock, and we have the true David.<a name=353:7></a> Jehovah will have His flock in Israel by-and-by, as we see in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#95">Psalm  95</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#100">Psalm  100</a>.<a name=353:8></a> You get that thought coming out continually in regard of Israel.<a name=353:9></a> These psalms are prophetic and celebrate Jehovah's coming in, and in the meantime the thought of the flock and the Shepherd is maintained in the church, and our fidelity is tested.<a name=353:10></a> We have the true David, the true Beloved, which is the meaning of the name David.<a name=353:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thought is eternal life, which was a promise in the Old Testament, and now we are brought to eternal life.<a name=353:12></a> The promise of eternal life will be fulfilled in the coming age to Israel, but we are brought to it because we are brought into the presence of eternal life in the Father and the Son by the Spirit.<a name=353:13></a> The more you think of it the more you will see that the church is the connecting link.<a name=353:14></a> There is the possibility of everything for us in the power of the Spirit, but many a believer misses everything.<a name=353:15></a> They are believers, but are defrauded of their inheritance; they allow the world and other things to come in and defraud them of everything to which they are entitled; but everything is possible to us in the power of the Spirit.<a name=353:16></a> God has taken pains to secure everything to us where it cannot be vitiated.<a name=353:17></a> May we be diligent, so as not to miss anything which God has established in Christ Jesus for us.<a name=353:18></a>

		In connection with the thought of the good Shepherd I desire to press what is of great importance, and that is the individual knowledge of Christ.<a name=354:6></a> We cannot know Christ collectively, it must be individual.<a name=354:7></a> We cannot live on meetings, formalities, ministry; He knows each one individually, and would have one know Him individually.<a name=354:8></a> In the present day nothing can be more vitally important than individual knowledge of the Shepherd.<a name=354:9></a> Each one of us has to see to it that we cultivate our relations with the Shepherd.<a name=354:10></a> Each one of us needs diligence to cultivate fidelity to the Shepherd.<a name=354:11></a>

		Traitors will get in amongst us, as the apostle said to the Corinthians, "there must also be sects among you", and where feet -- washing goes on they will be exposed; this is incidental to the service.<a name=367:7></a> Individual fidelity to Christ is what is needed and then the company will be right.<a name=367:8></a> All turns really on individual fidelity to Christ; where there is that, then feet-washing will go on as it were unconsciously, and not with the idea of <i>going</i> in order to wash somebody's feet.<a name=367:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One view of feet-washing is that His own may be kept in separation from the contamination of the world.<a name=367:10></a> We come together in assembly to meet one another in love in the unity of the Spirit, and in doing so we meet the Lord.<a name=367:11></a> Our relations one toward another are very important in coming together; our feelings one towards another must be right, or else we cannot be right with the Lord.<a name=367:12></a> Fidelity to Christ comes out largely in refusing this world's system.<a name=367:13></a> I want to be a stranger and pilgrim here, true to Him, and so refuse the things of the world; we want to be here in the light of the glory of Christ, we want to have the consciousness that we are in Him and He in us.<a name=367:14></a> The life of the saint is with Christ in God.<a name=367:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is plain that we have to look at these chapters (13 and 14) in their application to the disciples.<a name=368:1></a> We have to carry our thoughts back to them and when the Lord was with them.<a name=368:2></a> And yet it is extremely important to see what the chapters mean with regard to us, the point, the bearing with regard to us; for they have a further application to us.<a name=368:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more certain than that the coming of the Comforter meant something that would be permanent here.<a name=368:4></a> Nothing can be much more important than to understand the bearing of this chapter with regard to us.<a name=368:5></a> The primary application was to the disciples, but it also applies to us.<a name=368:6></a> We are left here in the absence of Christ.<a name=368:7></a> It all depends on the absence of Christ that the Comforter is still present.<a name=368:8></a> It supposes the absence of Christ.<a name=368:9></a> He is the object of faith in heaven, but the Comforter abides here, our stronghold and stay.<a name=368:10></a>

		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>everything was being resolved, a very great change was taking place -- Judas, Satan, and the chief priests coming together -- a fearful combination of evil, The devil enters into Judas, and he puts himself in communication with the Pharisees.<a name=369:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The disciples were left in a defiling world.<a name=369:11></a> Still, at the same time their fidelity to the Lord and to one another was to be tested.<a name=369:12></a> Their obligation was to wash one another's feet.<a name=369:13></a> This brings out our weakness.<a name=369:14></a> We are weak when we are affected by the influences of the world; weak also in attempting to carry out the obligation of feet-washing.<a name=369:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter (chapter 14) I bring before you the elements of our strength.<a name=369:16></a> They come out in a very distinct way, "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me".<a name=369:17></a> The first element of strength is <i>faith in Christ</i>: "ye believe in God, believe also in me".<a name=369:18></a> You must remember to whom that was spoken!<a name=369:19></a> To a little company gathered by Christ.<a name=369:20></a> They had not chosen Christ, but Christ had chosen them.<a name=369:21></a> You may say they were a very poor choice; but they were the company the Lord chose, and if He had chosen them they were to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now He was about to leave them; but how could it possibly be that He could leave them and not think about them?<a name=370:7></a> He could say, as it were, If I am going to the Father in heaven I will have you in My company up there, because I have chosen you, loved you, carried you; and now I am going to "prepare a place for you .<a name=370:8></a>.<a name=370:9></a>.<a name=370:10></a> that where I am, there ye may be also".<a name=370:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord has chosen us, and we have faith in Him, and know that where He is there we shall be also.<a name=370:12></a> We may not have much place in this world, and we should be very content to have no place here; and we are better without a place here because it tends to draw our attention from the place above, the place Christ has prepared and to which He is going to bring us.<a name=370:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next element of our strength is the divinely given appreciation of Christ and all that the Father has given to Him.<a name=370:14></a> No man can receive anything but what is given him from above.<a name=370:15></a> Christ is foolishness to the natural man; and hence appreciation of Christ must be divinely given.<a name=370:16></a> He says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls".<a name=370:17></a> That would be divinely given appreciation of Christ.<a name=370:18></a> The first element of strength is faith in the fidelity of Christ; now that He has gone to heaven, to have entire confidence in His fidelity; and then there is very great strength in the divinely

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is in verse 16, "another Comforter".<a name=371:10></a> This is another very great element of strength, the presence of the Comforter.<a name=371:11></a> He is come.<a name=371:12></a> We have the record of it in the Acts.<a name=371:13></a> The Comforter came and the Comforter has continued.<a name=371:14></a> His presence is a very great element of strength.<a name=371:15></a> By Him we live and do, and by Him, on the other hand, Christ has His expression in christians.<a name=371:16></a> Christ is brought into the view of His people, and because He lives they live.<a name=371:17></a>

		A point further.<a name=372:1></a> Now that the Lord was going away He said to His disciples, "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=372:2></a> The Lord Jesus intended to have a witness here, an expression here, to be present here in word and work.<a name=372:3></a> When He was upon earth He said, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?<a name=372:4></a> the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works".<a name=372:5></a> In the works and words of saints Christ is manifest here.<a name=372:6></a> "At that day" (Pentecost) Christ is present here.<a name=372:7></a> He comes out in His people, as the Father came out in Christ, in His works and words.<a name=372:8></a> Our works and words should be a savour of Christ, so that Christ should be magnified in these poor bodies, and also manifested and expressed characteristically in word and work.<a name=372:9></a> Are you left here just to pursue your business or to be simply in your family life?<a name=372:10></a> That is not the reason for which you are left here, but as vessels here on earth in which Christ finds expression, in work and word, in the power of the Comforter.<a name=372:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first element of strength is faith in Christ, "Believe also in me".<a name=372:12></a> The second is divinely given appreciation of Christ, and the third is the presence of the Comforter, so that Christ finds expression in His people here.<a name=372:13></a> We live because He lives, and on the other hand He finds expression in us: "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=372:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point, another element of strength is in verse 21, that Christ manifests Himself.<a name=372:15></a> It is conditional.<a name=372:16></a> It is ridiculous to talk of loving Christ and not keeping His commandments.<a name=372:17></a> What is His commandment?<a name=372:18></a> It is really that Christ is before the soul.<a name=372:19></a> <i>Christ</i> is the great commandment; Christ Himself is the law.<a name=372:20></a> You cannot do right except as you have Christ before the heart -- no licence to do

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another element of strength is the Father and the Son making their abode with the one who keeps the words of Christ.<a name=373:8></a> You are thus in separation from the world and you give no licence to the flesh.<a name=373:9></a> The gain is that you have the Father and the Son taking up their abode with you; you are in the Father's love, and you have Christ for salvation.<a name=373:10></a> Their presence and continuance is that which is peculiarly characteristic of each.<a name=373:11></a> That must of necessity involve complete separation from the world, and where we abide is in the Father's love, and we have salvation in Christ Jesus, but outside the course and order of this world.<a name=373:12></a> But we have the immense gain of the Father's love and the salvation which is in Christ Jesus; He is our strength and our "strong tower".<a name=373:13></a>

		What I seek to bring before you is the question of obligation, the obligation under which we are placed as children of God.<a name=375:1></a> We are placed under obligation from the fact of being children of God.<a name=375:2></a> For the fact of our being brought into any relationships, intelligent beings as we are, must entail obligation, and the obligations are corresponding to the relationship.<a name=375:3></a>

		Now in this chapter another thought is taken up, that of fruit-bearing.<a name=376:1></a> The first few verses refer to a vine, which has reference to earth, for Israel was said to be the vine of the earth.<a name=376:2></a> Christ superseded the vine.<a name=376:3></a> Israel was the vine, but Christ was the true Vine, and the disciples were the branches if they abode in Him, if they brought forth fruit.<a name=376:4></a> It applies to the time when the Lord was here.<a name=376:5></a> The Lord looked on, however, to the disciples abiding in Him.<a name=376:6></a> The idea of the vine is given up, but not that of abiding in Him, nor of fruit-bearing.<a name=376:7></a> It would be a demonstration that they were disciples of Christ if they bore fruit.<a name=376:8></a> The church is expected to be fruit-bearing here.<a name=376:9></a> Israel will find their fruit from Jehovah, He will be the source of their fruit and they will then bring forth fruit to God.<a name=376:10></a> I wish tonight to show the secret of fruit-bearing.<a name=376:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things I identify, and these are fruit-bearing and good works.<a name=376:12></a> They are certainly linked together in Scripture, and both are enforced upon us.<a name=376:13></a> We are to be fruitful in every good work; there they are combined.<a name=376:14></a> Saints are looked upon as vigorous; healthy trees bring forth fruit.<a name=376:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) In Christ's circle, which is the believer's true home circle; your proper home is not the domestic circle.<a name=380:8></a> The idea of your home in Scripture is Christ's circle.<a name=380:9></a> In early days, in times of persecution, the saints found their home in Christ's circle.<a name=380:10></a> Now that (sphere) circle is the sphere of fruit-bearing and of good works.<a name=380:11></a> Take a believer isolated from others, being shut up in a prison -- he would not have much opportunity of carrying out his desires to do good works.<a name=380:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) Then there is another circle -- the domestic circle, the home circle.<a name=380:13></a> In that sense a believer is looked to to show piety at home and to requite his parents; he is to be marked by good works at home; he is to be marked by fidelity in that circle.<a name=380:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) Further, there is a circle that is in connection with God's government down here: I do not say in the world.<a name=380:15></a> "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers".<a name=380:16></a> A child of God is not to be radical or lawless.<a name=380:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Good works become a testimony to God.<a name=380:18></a> We are known here as preferring the knowledge of God and Christ, and good works are a testimony to that.<a name=380:19></a> The Lord put the disciples under the obligation to love one another, and that they might go on and bring forth fruit.<a name=380:20></a> God puts us under an obligation to do these things.<a name=380:21></a> There must be vitality, because Christ is in us.<a name=380:22></a> The vitality is to come out in a

		Now, what is the secret of fruit-bearing?<a name=381:6></a> Scientists say human life could not exist on any other planet except our own because the forces which are necessary to human life, and upon which it is so dependent, are so peculiar and complex; they do not exist, so far as we know, on any other planet save this.<a name=381:7></a> God has constituted peculiar and complex conditions which are just suited to human life.<a name=381:8></a> If this be true physically, I am convinced it is equally true spiritually.<a name=381:9></a> If you take a man as a spiritual being, new created, he is dependent upon certain peculiar conditions correlated to one another.<a name=381:10></a> If you do not recognise these conditions there will not be much life.<a name=381:11></a> Now human life is dependent upon rule, atmosphere and light.<a name=381:12></a> If this be true in natural things, how much more in spiritual!<a name=381:13></a> Every inch of the body is subject to the law of gravity.<a name=381:14></a> So you must, in every part, be subject to Christ.<a name=381:15></a> The apostle says, "legitimately subject to Christ".<a name=381:16></a> We are married to Another, even to Him who is raised from the dead, so that we might come under His influence and that there should be no assertion of our wills, and then there will be fruit-bearing.<a name=381:17></a> We are thus under rule.<a name=381:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the divine circle, and there Christ is.<a name=381:19></a> There is a circle upon earth of which Christ is the centre, and if so Christ influences that circle.<a name=381:20></a> The disciples lived in and breathed that atmosphere -- no assertion of their wills, rights or tempers; thus they were under rule, and they also found their proper atmosphere under the influence of Christ.<a name=381:21></a>

		It is important to apprehend where God has put us on the ground of obligation.<a name=382:9></a> Worship and service are not put on the ground of exaction, but if we do accept our obligation and are fruitful in every good work, then God will have His part, He will be worshipped.<a name=382:10></a> There are obligations, and they are expressed in regard of good works and fruit-bearing, but both one and the other are based on the evidence of healthy vitality.<a name=382:11></a> Whatever is given to us is given in the witness of the Spirit, so that everything in us is connected with Christ and is marked by vitality.<a name=382:12></a> We are under obligation to prove that all is vital, and we do so in the way of fruit-bearing and good works.<a name=382:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first principle is on the ground of creation, that is referred to in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>; the second is on the ground of redemption, and that is chapter 5.<a name=384:11></a> Both these grounds are taken up in Christ: in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:11">Revelation  4:11</a> you get the ground of right by creation, and in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5:12">Revelation  5:12</a> you get the ground of redemption.<a name=384:12></a> These two grounds belong to God.<a name=384:13></a> Redemption has to come in to bring in the rights of God.<a name=384:14></a> God's rights have to be vindicated, and the One who has done all to accomplish this for Him is the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=384:15></a> This is extremely important, for the assumption of man is everywhere and is so great, man would claim everything for man; God will come in to take up His own rights and set aside man and his rights.<a name=384:16></a> It is a wonderful thing, beloved friends, all that <i>has</i> been effected for

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our weapons are in the power of God: He is greater than man, and man is totally powerless in God's presence.<a name=385:3></a> I think we get a wonderful picture of it in the children of Israel and the Red Sea, that which was their safety in their way through it: "the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left", and the Egyptians following, the waters returned and engulfed them, and there are many other similar instances in Scripture.<a name=385:4></a> God will come in and take His own way, and in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#6">Revelation  6</a>we get some of these ways referred to, and it shows the means He has at His disposal -- conquest, civil wars, famine, pestilence, the beasts of the earth.<a name=385:5></a> Then there remains bringing many sons to glory, the vessel is for God's glory because God displays Himself in the effect of it coming out in the heavenly city.<a name=385:6></a> God is forming that now, if you look at this chapter, like unto His brethren, and the point is that this would have no application if the "world to come" were here.<a name=385:7></a>

		The two chief thoughts that are presented in this passage are unity and completeness, and these two go together.<a name=389:1></a> Unity in the true sense cannot be unless there is completeness.<a name=389:2></a> In the case of man and wife they are complete, and they are one.<a name=389:3></a> In the universe there is unity and completeness, unity pervades the system (the sun, moon and stars), but intelligence is lacking.<a name=389:4></a> They move in relation to one another perfectly and exactly, but they are not themselves intelligent.<a name=389:5></a> But in the case of man and wife there is unity, completeness and intelligence, and in the body of Christ you have the three also.<a name=389:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to bring before you the thought of unity and completeness with regard to Christ: all is working to get unity and to the measure of the stature of the completeness of Christ, that really refers to the church (see chapter 1: 22), the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.<a name=389:7></a> The church is His completeness -- nothing is lacking.<a name=389:8></a> Eve was the completeness of Adam, there was no quality lacking that was in Adam; but with completeness you get unity, and unity is not incompatible with individuality, as may be seen in man and wife.<a name=389:9></a> There is a contrast between objective unity and subjective unity.<a name=389:10></a> Objective unity is seen in verses 4 and 5, it is what is presented to us; subjective unity is seen in verse 13, it is what we arrive at.<a name=389:11></a> In verse 4 it is one body, one spirit, etc.<a name=389:12></a>, unity is brought forward so as to enforce the exhortation to endeavour to keep the unity.<a name=389:13></a> Everything around us is seen to be in great confusion, there is neither unity or completeness, so it is a great thing to come back to the truth that there is one body.<a name=389:14></a> These truths have to be held abstractly;

		We have to take account of the truth of divine Persons; the presence of the Spirit is a great reality.<a name=390:2></a> It is sad to stand apart from the great bodies around us, but it has to be done: if we are to endeavour to keep the Spirit's unity we must separate from them, because we see that there is one body, one Spirit, etc.<a name=390:3></a> Till we all come in the unity of the faith, the gifts are directly given of Christ: officialism will not do.<a name=390:4></a> Undoubtedly there is much gift buried in the systems around, but gift is there, and it is given by Christ.<a name=390:5></a> Whatever gift there may be in christendom it is a witness to an ascended Christ; all gift has come from an ascended Christ, and the thought is found in the expression "that the Lord God might dwell among them".<a name=390:6></a> Gift witnesses to an ascended Christ, therefore gift is of great importance as witness to Him.<a name=390:7></a> All these gifts exist or have existed, and all witness to an ascended Christ.<a name=390:8></a> They all give proof of the ability of Christ to fill all things; the sun fills our universe, there is nothing hid from the heat thereof, so Christ is able to fill all things.<a name=390:9></a> He descended into the lower parts of the earth, and the One who ascended is the One who descended.<a name=390:10></a> He descended, He laid down His life; this is applicable only to Christ, not to us; the great point is, that the One who descended is now ascended: the same ability or power is seen in Him descending as in Him ascending.<a name=390:11></a> As the Son of God it is more wonderful for Him to go into the lower parts of the earth than for Him to ascend.<a name=390:12></a> He went into the grave for the will of God, and that morally was greater even than ascending.<a name=390:13></a> Christ -- the term implies <i>fulness</i>, and He <i>fills</i>; all fulness was pleased to dwell in Him, that God might be made known to man, but He also fills; go back to the thought of the sun that fills

		Chapter 5 shows us the great principles of christian conduct, liberty and the Spirit.<a name=416:1></a> Liberty realised in deliverance from principles such as sin and the world, in order that we may be free to serve one another, and then the Spirit is the power of walk.<a name=416:2></a> The flesh and the Spirit are mutually exclusive.<a name=416:3></a> The glory of each respectively is, adultery and love.<a name=416:4></a> Then in chapter 6 we get important principles.<a name=416:5></a> "Be not deceived; God is not mocked".<a name=416:6></a> God always stands to moral principles, and is never diverted from them.<a name=416:7></a> What a man sows he reaps; this is true in the world and true to christians.<a name=416:8></a> He who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap life eternal.<a name=416:9></a> It is the setting of the Spirit against the flesh all through.<a name=416:10></a> If you want to prove the power of the Spirit you must exclude the flesh.<a name=416:11></a>

		Now I want to speak for a moment of the power of the Spirit.<a name=416:12></a> In Old Testament times the power of the Spirit was here, but was not exactly set against the flesh.<a name=416:13></a> I will explain what I mean: I look at flesh in two lights; first, as the principle of evil and corruption in man; secondly, as mere natural force.<a name=416:14></a> And in this latter sense in Old Testament times the Spirit helped the flesh.<a name=416:15></a> Samson is an illustration of this.<a name=416:16></a> "The Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him".<a name=416:17></a> In Old Testament times the flesh was being tested, and consequently it was not yet the day of the Spirit.<a name=416:18></a> Flesh is evil; and flesh is natural power.<a name=416:19></a> This latter is of no avail for God, because it is at the disposal of an evil will.<a name=416:20></a> The principle which rules the natural power is not to be trusted.<a name=416:21></a> When the Lord was here the Spirit <i>abode</i> upon Him.<a name=416:22></a> That was new.<a name=416:23></a> He had come on occasions upon David and others, but the Spirit descended and abode upon Christ, and He was thereby marked out as the One "who baptises with the Holy Spirit" and this baptism took place at Pentecost.<a name=416:24></a> But the oil was on the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit has come down here to entirely exclude the flesh.<a name=417:2></a> Stephen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>set forward that the flesh under every dealing of God had been proved perverse, as witnessed in breaking of law, persecution of prophets, killing of Christ, and resistance of the Spirit.<a name=417:3></a> Every testimony from God was rejected, and the flesh was condemned in the cross, and the Spirit of God came down to give effect to this practically in the believer.<a name=417:4></a> The work of God in us <i>cannot</i> now be carried out in <i>natural power</i>.<a name=417:5></a> The Spirit is here to exclude the flesh entirely.<a name=417:6></a> The Spirit does not energise man's natural power, but is here to be the one sole power to the saints.<a name=417:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point in this chapter is this, that the great office of the Spirit is to carry those in whom He dwells up to the source from which He came.<a name=417:8></a> There is a great distinction drawn in Scripture between Christ and the Spirit.<a name=417:9></a> Christ came to an unbelieving world.<a name=417:10></a> He inherited a recognised name on earth -- Son of man -- Son of God.<a name=417:11></a> He was presented to men "after the flesh".<a name=417:12></a> In the sermon on the mount, the principle is of association with Him in His recognised place on the earth.<a name=417:13></a> Now the Spirit did not come after the flesh, but came when Christ is no longer known after the flesh.<a name=417:14></a> The Spirit did not become incarnate nor come to an unbelieving world, "whom the world cannot receive".<a name=417:15></a> The Spirit came to carry those who had believed to the source from which He came -- the Father.<a name=417:16></a>

		CONDUCT SUITED TO THE DOCTRINE

	<div class="paragraph">
		Notes on the Epistle to Titus
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Timothy the great point before the mind of Paul is the maintenance of the doctrine; in Titus it is the conduct suited to the doctrine, what are called "good works".<a name=421:1></a> Titus was among a people that were morally very degraded.<a name=421:2></a> The truth is evidently commended or otherwise by the practice of those who hold it.<a name=421:3></a> Here the doctrine is to be adorned, and, as has been frequently noticed, that is spoken in connection with the lowest grade of society, the slaves.<a name=421:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would judge that the connection between doctrine and piety was not being fully maintained.<a name=421:5></a> The apostle speaks of the truth which is according to godliness, or piety.<a name=421:6></a> I think piety is the true test of how far the doctrine is effective in people; it shews the measure in which it has taken root in them.<a name=421:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Piety is not exactly conduct, but refers more to the habit of the soul.<a name=421:8></a> "Therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe"; it is that kind of spirit.<a name=421:9></a> There is great danger because of the amount of doctrine which is current among us, for if it is held apart from piety it may be a very mischievous thing.<a name=421:10></a> Piety is not exactly practice, but it is practical.<a name=421:11></a> It is the acquaintance of God that issues in practice.<a name=421:12></a> The original is commonly translated "godliness", but that does not exactly express the idea, for we read of piety to parents: "Let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:4">1 Timothy  5:4</a>.<a name=421:13></a> What is the good of a man's boast of orthodoxy if he cannot practically trust God?<a name=421:14></a> The doctrine is not effective in him.<a name=421:15></a> A man's piety indicates his measure, not that which he knows.<a name=421:16></a> Doctrine held alone makes a man conceited, and there is not the tone about him which a pious man has.<a name=421:17></a>

		My great pleasure in going to the book of Psalms is that they are so very expressive of piety, trusting God in difficulties, and under pressure, and such like.<a name=422:1></a> Now the full light has come, but it will not do to take occasion of that to lose piety.<a name=422:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing ecclesiastical in this epistle; nothing about the assembly.<a name=422:3></a> Bishops and deacons are recognised, but as caring for the saints.<a name=422:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle has much the same character as those to Timothy; for instance, the apostle speaks of himself in each, "in hope of eternal life".<a name=422:5></a> It is wonderful to me that with God there should have been the thought of eternal life before death came in.<a name=422:6></a> It was purposed in Christ, but it was impossible that it should come to light before death had come in and been annulled.<a name=422:7></a> Adam in innocence was alive, yet he had not eternal life according to the thought of God.<a name=422:8></a> He had a life which might be forfeited, and was forfeited.<a name=422:9></a> The whole scheme and thought of eternal life connects itself with the second Man -- Christ.<a name=422:10></a> Wherever eternal life is, in heaven or earth, it takes its character from Christ.<a name=422:11></a> Adam never took his character from Christ.<a name=422:12></a> As far as I know, the one point of similarity between Adam in innocence and Christ was the total absence of evil.<a name=422:13></a> The church is the fulness of Christ, which no other family is, but none the less every family takes its character from Him.<a name=422:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The acknowledging of the truth which is after piety is the great point of the epistle.<a name=422:15></a> It is not quite what we understand by acknowledging, but rather clear knowledge.<a name=422:16></a> Other teachings were coming in to corrupt the saints, "Jewish fables, and commandments of men".<a name=422:17></a> The rabbis allegorised everything, and so completely got rid of all that was real in Scripture.<a name=422:18></a> One of the greatest dangers by which we are beset is the tendency to accept what has been handed down.<a name=422:19></a> Truth may in the first instance have

		"In due times manifested his word through preaching".<a name=423:3></a> His word is the expression of His mind.<a name=423:4></a> A man's thought is hid in himself until he makes it known, but when he makes it known his word is the expression of his thought.<a name=423:5></a> What is spoken of here was in the counsel of God, but when it comes out it is His word.<a name=423:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I look for in a teacher is a certain kind of originality, by which I mean that he gets his own proper apprehension of divine things instead of simply going on the line of others.<a name=423:14></a> An elder could follow up that which he had been taught.<a name=423:15></a> Gifts were moving about, but an elder was local; it was of importance, therefore, that the elder should hold fast the faithful word as he had been taught.<a name=423:16></a>

		If a teacher is right his great object is to give the saints an intelligent understanding of Scripture.<a name=424:10></a> We do not get truth from man; it is only by the Spirit.<a name=424:11></a> I think God provides for the maintenance of a <i>living</i> line of teaching for the church.<a name=424:12></a> In <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:2">2 Timothy  2:2</a> there are four generations, a succession of living witnesses in the power of the Holy Spirit: (1) Paul, (2) Timothy, (3) faithful men, (4) others also.<a name=424:13></a>

		The Red sea is also a type of the death of Christ; it shews the destruction of the enemy in death.<a name=431:7></a> Death stood as God's judgment between man and God, but the death of Christ, where the judgment was borne, has become the testimony to us of the love of God.<a name=431:8></a> The only way by which man could ever come to God was through bringing a witness of death.<a name=431:9></a> Abel came in that way; he brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.<a name=431:10></a> The reason of this is simple -- death lay on man, hence man could not approach God except by the recognition of what was upon him.<a name=431:11></a> When God came out to man, He came out through death, the death of Christ, and therefore it is now not the expression of His judgment, but of His love.<a name=431:12></a> The rod of God divided the waters of the Red sea and the power of the enemy is gone.<a name=431:13></a> The death of Christ is thus the way to God.<a name=431:14></a> If I am in the enjoyment of the love of God, death is no terror to me.<a name=431:15></a> The power of the enemy was really broken when Christ died, but it is broken for the believer when the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit given to him.<a name=431:16></a> The Holy Spirit brings the sense of God's love.<a name=431:17></a>

		But further, there was in the death of Christ the condemnation of man's state; flesh was set aside in the sight of God, and with the intent that God might impart the Spirit to the believer.<a name=432:4></a> The Spirit of God as an indwelling Spirit will not tolerate the flesh: "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh".<a name=432:5></a> The flesh retains reminiscences of what we have been accustomed to in the world, but the Spirit is against the flesh, so that we should not do the things to which we are prone.<a name=432:6></a> The Spirit is not an influence nor merely a power; in the believer He is a "well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=432:7></a> He begins at the bottom and His purpose is to displace completely the flesh.<a name=432:8></a> The apostle shews in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5">Galatians  5</a>very nakedly what the works of the flesh are, and what is the fruit of the Spirit.<a name=432:9></a> Then follows, "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts".<a name=432:10></a> I call that normal to the christian.<a name=432:11></a> The Spirit works in this way; He brings in the sense of the holiness of God.<a name=432:12></a> The cross displayed His righteousness, and the resurrection His power, but the Spirit gives the sense of what God's nature is -- His holiness and love.<a name=432:13></a>

		Think of the grace of God in which He has come out, revealing Himself to man as light that man may know Him, and then the love of Christ adapting itself to us in the circumstances in which we find ourselves down here and leading us into His own blessed circle above, and then the presence and power of the Spirit emancipating us from the dominion of sin, and forming us by the new and blessed association in which the grace of God has set us.<a name=433:5></a> Monks shut up in religious houses had an idea of mortification of the flesh, but they had no idea whatever of the Holy Spirit as forming the believer by divine light in the divine nature.<a name=433:6></a> It is the seeing this that delivers the soul completely from asceticism.<a name=433:7></a> The believer is not only dead with Christ, but is quickened together with Him; that is, he is made alive in Christ in the divine nature.<a name=433:8></a> It is in the reality of this that we enter into the truth of God's calling.<a name=433:9></a>

		THEOLOGY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose that theology concerns itself not simply with the question of what God is in an abstract way, but of what He is in relation to men.<a name=446:1></a> It involves, therefore, the revelation of God.<a name=446:2></a> Indeed, it would be difficult to see how there could be any such thing as theology if there were not a revelation.<a name=446:3></a> In christendom there are few who deny revelation; the great question that exists is as to the mode of the application of that revelation to men.<a name=446:4></a> As to this there are great and essential differences of mind.<a name=446:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may divide christendom into various great parts, not all owning one another, but all existing as a matter of fact.<a name=446:6></a> There is the Roman Catholic Church, though this is rather a contradiction in terms, because by the designation 'Roman' it is no longer catholic.<a name=446:7></a> Then there is what may be called the Episcopal Church, outside of Rome.<a name=446:8></a> Then there is Protestantism.<a name=446:9></a> These three would include pretty much all christendom.<a name=446:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the first of these, that is, Roman Catholicism, the idea is of the authority and infallibility of the church, so that it is a ground of faith to men.<a name=446:11></a> And there is not salvation out of the church.<a name=446:12></a> The idea in that system is that it stands, so far as the priesthood is concerned, outside of the world, but as exercising power over the world.<a name=446:13></a> It is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.<a name=446:14></a> This is the position that it has arrogated to itself.<a name=446:15></a> Celibacy is held in the priesthood, and in those devoted, in order that they may be separated from the common interests of society, but the object is to give power to the church so that it may dominate the forces of the world; that it may command the temporal power.<a name=446:16></a> It would control everything, education and training of the young especially, and extend its wings over all.<a name=446:17></a> Its idea would be that none could live without it.<a name=446:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the application of revelation, Rome would not encourage the study of Scripture, but would cast people on the support of the church system, which provides all that is necessary for them.<a name=447:1></a> To be attached to the system, and to make use of that which it provides is all that is required.<a name=447:2></a> There are no moral exercises essential.<a name=447:3></a> A man might be a good churchman enough without them.<a name=447:4></a> What is essential is the maintenance of the exclusive authority of the church in all things.<a name=447:5></a> In fact, it is confidence in a system that speaks with the authority of God.<a name=447:6></a> I think that such is the character of Rome, and it has never abated its pretensions.<a name=447:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the Episcopal Church there is no such central authority as Rome, nor would such submission be claimed to a system.<a name=447:8></a> The main feature is the authority of the clergy, which is derived from the idea of apostolical succession.<a name=447:9></a> With this there is the importance of sacraments, which would, I suppose, be accounted as essential to salvation.<a name=447:10></a> The application of the revelation is through the sacraments.<a name=447:11></a> A mental apprehension of the truth would be accounted a secondary matter.<a name=447:12></a> It is evident that there is a material idea pervading such a system, because there is a positive value in the sacraments apart from the spiritual state of those that partake of them.<a name=447:13></a> Whatever might be the moral condition of a man's mind, he might derive benefit from the sacraments.<a name=447:14></a> And as the administration of these depends on the clergy, priesthood is the pillar of the system.<a name=447:15></a> The apprehension in the soul of what is in the mind of God for man, as set forth in Christ, is a matter of small importance.<a name=447:16></a> Hence it is difficult to see how there is in it anything really vital in character.<a name=447:17></a> It seems to me that sacraments are of all moment in it.<a name=447:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=448>[Page 448]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		maintenance of the authority of the Scriptures as above all authority of church or clergy, and at the same time the responsibility of every one in respect of faith of the Scriptures.<a name=448:1></a> I have spoken here of the character of Protestantism as at the outset.<a name=448:2></a> It has now sadly degenerated.<a name=448:3></a> It has not been free from the taint of materialism, and the spirit of rationalism, as giving importance to the human mind, has crept in largely.<a name=448:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the former, this materialism is not in so gross a form as in the Episcopal system, where a substantive value is placed on sacraments, but it is more subtle.<a name=448:5></a> It consists in the thought that it is possible by faith to possess things of which the value is not known in the soul.<a name=448:6></a> It is plain that this is a material idea, in that it places a substantive and not simply a moral value on the things.<a name=448:7></a> To take an example, it is a common idea that a person may by faith possess eternal life without knowing its value.<a name=448:8></a> Such a thought of life is material.<a name=448:9></a> It may exist in natural life, as evidently in animals, but not in spiritual things.<a name=448:10></a> This seems to me a common error among Protestants.<a name=448:11></a> The source of this is that faith in doctrine is called for, rather than faith in divine Persons.<a name=448:12></a> There is a large leaven of dogma in Protestantism.<a name=448:13></a> On the other hand, Protestantism has become pervaded by rationalism, which is clearly not moral, but mental.<a name=448:14></a> A man but little touched by the knowledge of God may be a rationalist.<a name=448:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the important point is, what is the truth in contrast with all the above?<a name=448:16></a> I judge it to lie in the apprehension by faith of what is in the mind of God toward man, as perfectly expressed in Christ.<a name=448:17></a> Every thought of God toward man is bound up with the character of God, hence all these thoughts are expressed in Christ, the Son of God.<a name=448:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What follows is that as each such thought is seen there is corresponding increase in the knowledge of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=449>[Page 449]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God Himself.<a name=449:1></a> As this knowledge of God is added to in the soul, a greater insight is gained into the thoughts of divine love toward man.<a name=449:2></a> We are built up morally in the knowledge of God, and are increasingly capable of entering into His thoughts man-ward.<a name=449:3></a> It is by this growth that the Spirit enables us to appropriate to ourselves these thoughts of God, and thus it is that we can be said to possess the things that are spoken of.<a name=449:4></a> They are entered into morally, and thus become our own.<a name=449:5></a> Thus, though I may see that there are great thoughts in the mind of God manward, I do not claim to possess what is contained in any of these thoughts, save as I enter into it according to my spiritual growth.<a name=449:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be questioned how a man can ever claim to be a christian if he is thus slow to take the ground of possessing anything.<a name=449:7></a> My answer would be that he is entitled to take the ground of being a christian when he believes in Christ, and thus sees what is in God's mind toward man.<a name=449:8></a> We are not called on to believe anything about ourselves, but that which is set forth in Christ.<a name=449:9></a> It is when these things are appropriated, in the understanding of them, by the work of the Spirit in the believer, that they can be said to be possessed.<a name=449:10></a> There are thus two great steps, the first is faith, which means the apprehension of God's mind toward man in Christ, and then spiritual growth by the knowledge of God, which gives the capability of entering into God's thoughts, so that they become the possession of the soul.<a name=449:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it will be evident how different this is from the Romish idea of faith in a church and its authority, or from the Episcopal idea of the value to be attached to sacraments, and consequently to those who alone can administer them, or from Protestantism, with its insistence on faith in doctrine, and the claim to the possession of things of the value of which the soul has no sense, but which are said to be

		The apostle Paul says in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:17">2 Corinthians  4:17</a>, 18, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal".<a name=451:1></a> This appears to me to raise a question worth considering, namely, whether our minds are taken up with unseen or with future things.<a name=451:2></a> Very many christians are much interested in and occupied with future things -- such as the restoration of Israel, the disposition of the world according to prophecy, the millennium, and other truths of the future.<a name=451:3></a> These things may have a certain moral effect in unsettling us in regard to the present -- showing us that there is an appointed term to things in the world -- but it cannot be imagined that they will produce at all the same profound effect as the light of things which exist; and such are unseen things, of which faith is the conviction.<a name=451:4></a>

		There is a vast system of things of which sight and sense are unconscious, but which are veritable realities, and which, by their moral power, will supersede the existing order of things.<a name=451:5></a> It appears to me that it is God's way to build up a system and order of things, outside of the activities of man and the world, which awaits the displacement of all that is seen that it may be in due time displayed.<a name=451:6></a> These are the mysteries of God.<a name=451:7></a> A mystery is something which exists, but is not yet displayed.<a name=451:8></a>

		THE ENTERING IN OF THE HIGH PRIEST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told that the law had the shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, hence we must not expect that christianity can be learnt from the law, however much we may be assisted by the latter in the understanding of detail.<a name=494:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One simple point will serve to show how little able the law was to set forth the truth.<a name=494:2></a> In the very nature of things under the law a victim and the priest who offered it were distinct: now it is essential to christianity that they are combined in one Person; for it is plain that Christ could not be offered by any save Himself, and no victim short of Christ would meet the case, for in no other could divine love be fully shown.<a name=494:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to carry this contrast on to what took place on the day of atonement, on which the high priest entered into the holiest "with blood of others".<a name=494:4></a> He had to carry in every year the blood of the bullock for himself and his house, and of the goat for Israel, typical of the death, vicariously, of both, and incense beaten small, that thus he might be covered in the presence of the divine glory.<a name=494:5></a> Aaron and Israel were evidently in the flesh, and if Aaron had to approach God in His sanctuary, his approach must thus be ordered, otherwise it had been immediate death to himself.<a name=494:6></a> He represented his own house and Israel -- but both as being under death.<a name=494:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now nothing can be a greater contrast to this than the entering in of Christ.<a name=494:8></a> He entered in as the risen Man, when all the work of offering had been accomplished, having found an eternal redemption.<a name=494:9></a> He had no need, like Aaron, to be covered by blood and incense, nor was there need for the sprinkling of blood -- for He carries in His own Person the witness of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=495>[Page 495]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the one offering by which all has been purged.<a name=495:1></a> The blood of purging has been poured out.<a name=495:2></a> Christ Himself is the witness of death having been effected in the fact that He is risen from the dead, and has entered in, in the power of an endless life, high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=495:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So long as blood had to be carried in, the way into the holiest could not yet be made manifest, for there was, as yet, no resurrection from among the dead.<a name=495:4></a> Now all is changed -- man after the flesh has been removed in the cross, and in the removal God has been glorified, there is the purgation of all, and now Christ has entered into heaven to appear before the face of God for us.<a name=495:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is now come to pass "by man came also the resurrection of the dead"; and in the risen Man, the offering Priest, the way into the holiest is made manifest.<a name=495:6></a> The point now is not seeing 'sprinkled with the blood the mercy-seat above', but a risen man entered in when all the work of offering is over, sins put away, and the judgment and curse of God which lay upon man removed in the removal of the man after the flesh.<a name=495:7></a> I can hardly think of any truth as of more importance than the apprehension of the risen man abiding in the presence of God, and of the understanding of the significance of this, in that the way into the holiest is made manifest on the one hand, and on the other, that the work of offering is over.<a name=495:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To come now to the application of this to ourselves, It is clear that if we are to enter into the holiest we must be in accord with the Man that is there, and that in our minds.<a name=495:9></a> As we have seen, He has by one offering met all that lay upon us by the judgment of God, and our part lies now in the acceptance of death with Him so that we may by faith enter on the ground of "risen with him", and

		be suited for the exercise of priestly function, and this in the sense that all offering work is over.<a name=496:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But one thing is essential to this, and that is attachment to the Person of the Priest.<a name=496:2></a> We are quickened together with Him so that we should live in His life.<a name=496:3></a> He is head of the priestly house, and whatever may have been the relations of Aaron's sons with Aaron, none can separate us from the love of Christ; and in affection to Himself we are morally outside of the influences which appeal to nature, and are thus according to the glory of God, to serve Him in holiness.<a name=496:4></a>

		It may be of interest and profit to pass in review shortly the progress which can be marked in chapters 7 to 10 of the Acts of the Apostles in the unfolding of the testimony of the Christ.<a name=497:1></a> We reach in result a point which greatly helps us in the understanding of the moment in which we are.<a name=497:2></a> There can be no doubt that nothing can compare in importance with the testimony of God in the world.<a name=497:3></a> That testimony is comprehended in one single word, Christ.<a name=497:4></a> Briefly to indicate the line which I purpose to pursue, I would remark that the point in chapter 7 is the presence of Christ in heaven, and the corresponding presence of the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=497:5></a> In chapter 8 we have the absence of Christ from earth, and its effects on faith.<a name=497:6></a> In chapter 9 we see the activities of the Lord in connection with the testimony.<a name=497:7></a> And in chapter 10 we have the introduction of the gentile.<a name=497:8></a> He comes out from the darkness in which the gentiles had been hid morally.<a name=497:9></a> All was fulfilling what had been foreshadowed by the Lord when on earth.<a name=497:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To refer a little more in detail to the case of Stephen.<a name=497:11></a> It is evident that his testimony, and his consequent treatment, indicated clearly the mind of the Jews in regard to Christ.<a name=497:12></a> The breach was complete.<a name=497:13></a> But in spite of the darkness on earth there was an outlook for faith.<a name=497:14></a> All was ordered in heaven for man.<a name=497:15></a> Heaven was the scene of interest for man.<a name=497:16></a> I do not suppose that Stephen understood much about boldness to enter the holiest, but he was full of the Holy Spirit, and looked up stedfastly into heaven.<a name=497:17></a> He certainly saw the holiest, for the glory of God and Jesus came into his view.<a name=497:18></a> And evidently he was invited by heaven, and set free from the earth.<a name=497:19></a> He went to heaven as a messenger sent after Christ by the Jew, but he was welcome in heaven.<a name=497:20></a> When it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 8 we have the contrast to this.<a name=498:2></a> The glory of Jerusalem had departed, light was not there.<a name=498:3></a> The eunuch was returning from Jerusalem unenlightened.<a name=498:4></a> He was evidently a pious man desiring light on the scripture, and God sent him an interpreter.<a name=498:5></a> He received light in the grace of God, and instead of returning to Jerusalem, like the two disciples in the last chapter of Luke, he went on his way rejoicing.<a name=498:6></a> He was independent of Jerusalem; what he had learnt was that Christ had been here, but that His life had been taken from the earth.<a name=498:7></a> This is a matter of serious moment.<a name=498:8></a> For if <i>His</i> life is taken from the earth, what life can there be there for God?<a name=498:9></a> Hence the desire of the eunuch to be baptised, to be identified with the death of Christ.<a name=498:10></a> He was going into circumstances where he would not find fellowship or support, but he had been furnished with the key to the Scriptures, and he went on his way rejoicing.<a name=498:11></a> I have no doubt that in the present time there may be many that reverence the Scriptures who have hardly found the key to them; and if they did find it, they would be freed from dependence on human order, and would, like the eunuch, go on their way rejoicing.<a name=498:12></a> Thus we have had the scene of interest changed from earth to heaven, while the life of Messiah is taken from the earth, and our part is to announce the death of Christ till He come.<a name=498:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 10 we have a further advance.<a name=499:11></a> We see the instruction of Peter by the sheet let down from heaven.<a name=499:12></a> A truth comes to light of great moment in the ways of God.<a name=499:13></a> Not a truth inconsistent with God's previous dealings with Israel, but with which the future of Israel must be co-ordinated.<a name=499:14></a> In principle we see here that Christ is the Head of every man, and hence "by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life".<a name=499:15></a> The gentiles were no longer to be regarded as common or unclean.<a name=499:16></a> According to the word of Simeon, Christ was "a light for revelation of the Gentiles".<a name=499:17></a> The casting away of the Jew for the time is the world's reconciliation.<a name=499:18></a> The gentiles are come within the reach of God's testimony.<a name=499:19></a> This was a great truth for Peter to learn, and it was confirmed to him by the fact of Cornelius and his friends receiving the Spirit without their becoming Jewish proselytes.<a name=499:20></a> Thus we have the ways of God unfolding, and in principle all was accomplished.<a name=499:21></a> Jew and gentile were one body in Christ.<a name=499:22></a> In fact, every order of man was displaced, and Christ alone remained.<a name=499:23></a> It appears to me important that we should see that all was complete in principle before Paul enters on his ministry, in order that we

		When Paul comes on the scene we have the testimony of Christ carried out to the gentiles, but nothing is added to the light which came out in Christ on earth, for the Spirit had sealed a complete testimony.<a name=500:2></a> But Paul enters on his service as a chosen vessel to bear Christ's name to the gentiles and the vessel is endowed with special understanding both in the gospel, and in the mystery, and is used of God to expound all that had come to pass in the presence and power of the Spirit down here.<a name=500:3></a>

		If christians go on in sin and worldly ways it proves to me, not only that they have not accepted death, but are defective in the knowledge of God; they are not consciously in the light of the gospel.<a name=502:4></a> People want the truth of the gospel much more than we are aware of.<a name=502:5></a> I very much doubt if people are profoundly affected by doctrine, or position, or anything short of the knowledge of God.<a name=502:6></a> I think that another powerful motive also comes in and that is the love of Christ (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>).<a name=502:7></a> The light of God makes it impossible to continue in sin, and the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him.<a name=502:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In studying the Psalms you will readily see that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#14">Psalm  14</a>closes one part of the first book.<a name=514:1></a> We find there the climax of wickedness, "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.<a name=514:2></a> They are corrupt .<a name=514:3></a>.<a name=514:4></a>.<a name=514:5></a> they are all together become filthy"; it is the climax of the depravity and contrariety of man.<a name=514:6></a> When the apostle is taking a survey of the condition of man (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>) he confirms his position by quotations from this psalm.<a name=514:7></a>

		The Spirit of God begins a new phase of the subject in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#15">Psalm  15</a>, and we all have to learn the line thence opened out.<a name=514:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have had before us two remarkable psalms, 2 and 8, in which Christ is seen as God's Son, God's King and as the Son of man.<a name=514:9></a> These titles constitute His name as Man, they set forth the glory which belongs to Him, and embrace the counsel and purpose of God regarding Him.<a name=514:10></a> The beauty of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is that all is <i>of God</i>.<a name=514:11></a> Christ is God's Son, and He is God's King.<a name=514:12></a> "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion"; and "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee".<a name=514:13></a> But Son of man brings in more the thought of redemption, and of a new world which comes in on that ground.<a name=514:14></a> The burden of the first fourteen psalms is, I judge, the counsel of God, and the glory of the Lord according to that counsel; but with this, the contrariety and opposition of everything down here.<a name=514:15></a> My conviction is, that the more light we get in regard of God's counsel, and the vessel of it, the more conscious we become of the state of things down here that is opposed to it.<a name=514:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Psalms.htm#15">Psalms  15</a>and 16 we have quite another side presented.<a name=514:17></a> The question is raised in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#15">Psalm  15</a>,

		Who is the man to stand in the presence of this glory?<a name=515:1></a> Where is the man to come from who can meet the requirements of God?<a name=515:2></a> "Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?<a name=515:3></a> who shall dwell in thy holy hill?<a name=515:4></a>" In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>we get the answer.<a name=515:5></a> There we find set forth the man who can stand in the light of God, who is suited to the glory.<a name=515:6></a> Blessing is to come forth to man in connection with the man who is according to God.<a name=515:7></a> We get the description of this man in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, and the psalm is applicable evidently to Christ personally.<a name=515:8></a> What characterised Christ is that, deriving nothing from man, all that came in by Him was morally new.<a name=515:9></a> Christ as man is man to perfection.<a name=515:10></a> He can never be improved upon.<a name=515:11></a> He is the last Adam -- all starts from thence, and every family in heaven and earth is named of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=515:12></a> It is a new starting-point; all has to take its character from that man, and that man is in the presence of God.<a name=515:13></a> I see all the light of God in Christ.<a name=515:14></a> He is the revelation of God, and He is man too in the presence of God in the perfection of that light.<a name=515:15></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>gives the thought of the <i>last</i> Adam.<a name=515:16></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#15">Psalm  15</a>raises the question of the state of man.<a name=515:17></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>shows us the place that Christ has taken as man.<a name=515:18></a> It gives us thus life to God, not even what Christ was in respect of the contrariety of man, as in other psalms where man comes in and God judges, but what His life was Godward.<a name=515:19></a>

		In the ways of God, if He were to bless man, it was not only a question of having one to whom He could entrust all authority, but a man before Him in whom Satan should be defeated and that in the scene of his power, and in whom too God would be glorified.<a name=515:20></a> God could have readily swept man from off the face of the earth, but His purpose was not so.<a name=515:21></a> His way as regards man is recovery.<a name=515:22></a> But to look a little in detail at the place that Christ takes, He says to Jehovah, "Thou art my Lord".<a name=515:23></a> He accepts that

		place.<a name=516:1></a> He does not take the place of God but that of man.<a name=516:2></a> The psalm is full of life, all is morally according to God.<a name=516:3></a> Then He associates Himself with the saints, the excellent of the earth.<a name=516:4></a> He has companions.<a name=516:5></a> In a scene where there was "none that doeth good, no, not one", God had, I believe, in anticipation of Christ coming here, been forming saints in view of what was going to be.<a name=516:6></a> They took their character from Christ when He came.<a name=516:7></a> The Old Testament saints were formed upon promises, but then Christ was the Heir of promise.<a name=516:8></a> In the millennium what will mark Israel is the "law written in their hearts", but Christ is the first man in whose heart was God's law.<a name=516:9></a> He was the man out of heaven, "living bread which came down from heaven", and thus placed within the reach of man's appropriation.<a name=516:10></a> Before Christ came God had doubtless been working in view of His coming, and thus there were those with whom, when He comes, He associates Himself.<a name=516:11></a> Historically it refers to the godly remnant who were baptized of John, who had been made sensible of their ruin, and confessed it.<a name=516:12></a> They were poor things, but much more lowly than we are, for I think we have become more or less inflated with our intelligence.<a name=516:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter part of the psalm what comes out is this: Jehovah was His inheritance, Jehovah gave Him counsel, and Jehovah was His support.<a name=516:14></a> He had a goodly heritage.<a name=516:15></a> Proprietary possession is very dear to the natural man, but Christ had Jehovah for His portion.<a name=516:16></a> As to His pathway here He began life in a manger, He had not where to lay His head, and He went out of the world by the cross.<a name=516:17></a> When questioned about the tribute money He said, "Shew me a penny".<a name=516:18></a> He had not one, and yet He says, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage".<a name=516:19></a> He as man was in the full light of Jehovah, and having nothing as to this world, He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is that He did not need to turn to man for wisdom.<a name=517:4></a> "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel".<a name=517:5></a> He could say, "as I hear, I judge".<a name=517:6></a> Christ as man found Jehovah enough for Him.<a name=517:7></a> He maintained His lot.<a name=517:8></a> The Lord had no wealth here, no education from man, Jehovah was everything to Him.<a name=517:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Jehovah is His support, "Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved".<a name=517:10></a> He lived in the light of divine goodness, He had heritage, He had counsel, and He had support.<a name=517:11></a> If you can say that, you are not badly off.<a name=517:12></a> If God is at your right hand, who is going to move you?<a name=517:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ brought the light of God into this world; but more, He was Man in that light.<a name=517:14></a> He was the Man who found all His resources in God.<a name=517:15></a> The beauty of the psalm to me is that it teems with life.<a name=517:16></a> The devil might come as a tempter, or as a roaring lion, but he found nothing in Christ.<a name=517:17></a> He was Man, but independent of man and the world, and found His portion exclusively in Jehovah.<a name=517:18></a> Do you want to be in that path?<a name=517:19></a> Christ has inaugurated it, and we are called to walk in it; we are privileged to be in the light as God is in the light.<a name=517:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He could say, too, "My heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope".<a name=517:21></a> The path ends at the right hand of God.<a name=517:22></a> It is not a man treading the path in haste, but the soul maintained in freshness and vigour, and finding Jehovah its portion, and this in a pathway down here.<a name=517:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is what we get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, and every family will take its character from Christ.<a name=517:24></a> All will be formed according to Him.<a name=517:25></a> The psalm presents the heavenly man, but treading the path that leads to God's right hand.<a name=517:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The starting-point is Christ, and we have to be prepared to let all go except Christ.<a name=518:2></a> Nothing of the first man can abide, and therefore the second Man is brought in and everything is formed according to Him.<a name=518:3></a>

		FOUR NOTABLE THINGS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see four points in Christ:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. I see manhood beautified and adorned here upon earth, so that God should be glorified in man.<a name=518:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. I see God glorified in man in the putting away of sin.<a name=518:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. I see in the resurrection, man accepted.<a name=518:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. And in the exaltation of Christ, man glorified.<a name=518:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is in heaven, the glorified Man, and that Man is to be the glory and delight of the christian.<a name=518:10></a> If that is the case, then I am strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and in some little degree I learn how to maintain the truth which God has been pleased to give us; and the only possible way to do it is by your own soul being in the blessed reality of it, and the very essence of it is that Christ should be the glory of your heart, the Man in whom you delight, your glory.<a name=518:11></a> Then the result will be that every blessed quality that came out in Him as man will be reproduced in the christian down here, because Christ is the Man of the christian's heart.<a name=518:12></a>

		The same Person abides, though the condition be changed, in His coming of a woman.<a name=519:1></a> He is a real Man, body, soul and spirit, but still God's Son (that same Person).<a name=519:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you carry the thought of the incarnation beyond the scriptural limit, that is, form (that of a servant) and condition (flesh and blood), you cannot avoid, that I can see, reaching distinct personality, and so making two personalities in Christ, a divine and a human.<a name=519:3></a> These may be said to be mysteriously blended in one, the unity of the Person, but that is as great an error as if they were spoken of as distinct and apart in Him.<a name=519:4></a> The mystery of the incarnation and the true sense in which the union of God and man can be spoken of is that in one and the same Person God was made manifest to man (in flesh), and man was presented for the good pleasure of God.<a name=519:5></a> Unity of Person, or indivisibility, is not, I believe, a thought found in Scripture.<a name=519:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a> and <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:62">John  6:62</a> are simply the Lord speaking of Himself, as commonly, under an official name.<a name=519:7></a> Every scripture which definitely refers to the incarnation speaks of it as the assumption by Christ of a form or condition.<a name=519:8></a> One who is in Person divine and existing in the form of God emptied Himself in grace and took on Him a form and condition not commensurate with the greatness of His Person.<a name=519:9></a> But the Person never changes (so J.<a name=519:10></a> N.<a name=519:11></a> D.<a name=519:12></a> says), and any line of teaching that gives the idea of change in any way as regards the Person is, to my mind, dishonouring to the Son, and interferes with what He calls "My glory", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:24">John  17:24</a>.<a name=519:13></a> 'His complete person' is an expression I do not at all like.<a name=519:14></a>

		I only now add that if 'human condition', "bondman's form", 'likeness of men', "flesh and blood", do not describe what the Son took in becoming Man, it raises the question, whence did the rest come?<a name=520:1></a> I should certainly have thought that what was spiritual was of Himself.<a name=520:2></a> Certainly there was no creation in Him, as in us, of an intelligent moral being (in which the true idea of "person" lies), for we are "the offspring of God".<a name=520:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of union, or unity of Person, appears to me to have greatly clouded in people's minds the truth of incarnation.<a name=520:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the expression, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit", I judge that the Lord takes up an expression suited to the position in which He was.<a name=520:5></a> But it is the Person who left the condition, which He had assumed, to take it again, and not as flesh and blood but still as Man, and meantime He was in paradise.<a name=520:6></a>

		ETERNAL LIFE IN ITS PRESENT FORM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I understand eternal life in its present form it is our living by Christ in the power of the Spirit, in a new position and relationship before the Father, to which He has given us entrance by His death.<a name=520:7></a> We are thus morally outside the flesh and the world, in the Son -- a new sphere.<a name=520:8></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:54">John  6:54</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>, 32.<a name=520:9></a>) Hence even faithfulness down here, and walking in patience and grace and relative duties, though they give occasion for the display of the Spirit of Christ, hardly connect themselves in my mind with eternal life.<a name=520:10></a> That is displayed in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>.<a name=520:11></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>we have the two debtors, but the Lord addresses Himself to the woman at the end of the chapter and says, "Thy sins are forgiven .<a name=535:8></a>.<a name=535:9></a>.<a name=535:10></a> go in peace".<a name=535:11></a> He evidently does not conduct her in, she has to go on in her wilderness pathway.<a name=535:12></a> So, too, in regard to the parable of the good Samaritan -- the man is picked up and left at the inn.<a name=535:13></a> An inn is for people travelling on the road; he is left there, but cared for.<a name=535:14></a> But now, when we come to chapter 14 we get the house, and the supper is prepared for a great many to be conducted into it; "compel them to come in, that my house may be filled", and then in chapter 15 the prodigal is seen brought into the house sitting with the father, in complete suitability to him.<a name=535:15></a> The elder brother was outside.<a name=535:16></a> Then at the end of the gospel you get the thief on the cross; to him the Lord says, "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise".<a name=535:17></a>

		Now you will notice there is distinct advance in the gospel.<a name=535:18></a> A woman sent on her way through the world in peace, a man placed in an inn by the roadside amply cared for, a prodigal brought in in suitability to his father, really in reconciliation, and then the thief assured "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise".<a name=535:19></a> In the end we find the thought of Christ coming out in His blessing the disciples as He went up to heaven, and He has sent down the Holy Spirit

		Now, beloved friends, I want to touch upon the Lord's present activity for us, His service and ministry.<a name=536:14></a> Turn for a moment to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>, "such an high priest became us"; and then to chapter 8, He "is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle"; then verse 6, he hath "obtained a more excellent ministry".<a name=536:15></a> Now, there is one thing a believer can be said to have literally, that is, the forgiveness of sins in the witness of the Spirit.<a name=536:16></a> A great deal more, I know, but I am prepared to allow that everyone can have forgiveness of sins in the witness of the Spirit: "being justified" -- a purged conscience.<a name=536:17></a> But then, what is qualifying you for God's service?<a name=536:18></a> I will tell you, what answers to it is what we find in chapter 8, "A

		The bottom is as it were reached here (verse 14), all were proved dead since One had to die for all; but then there are those who live, who share in the risen life of Christ: for He is the only Man actually risen, and that being the case we should know what it is to live unto Him who died for us and rose again; therefore we now know no one after the flesh.<a name=539:3></a> Mary would have known Christ after the flesh, but was stopped by the words, "Touch me not".<a name=539:4></a> New creation is connected with resurrection, not necessarily ascension!<a name=539:5></a> The old order has passed away, the new order has begun, and in that sphere all things are of God, who has reconciled us.<a name=539:6></a>

		He has on His side removed (by death) every atom of that which made a distance between Him and us; and now the word of reconciliation was given to the apostles, and its practical bearing on us is that we too should be in accord with God's mind as to the extinction of ourselves and all being of Himself.<a name=539:7></a> That seems to me to be a great thought in reconciliation -- that our minds should be reconciled to God's mind, to His thought as to Christ; He has but Christ before Him.<a name=539:8></a> It is an eminently sanctifying thought because the allowance of any little atom of the "first man", that which God has condemned, will not do.<a name=539:9></a> That would show we are not in full union with the mind of God, since He condemned it in the death of Christ.<a name=539:10></a>

		We have two covenants spoken of which only become valid in death.<a name=540:1></a> A covenant is an instrument which makes known God's disposition, and it becomes valid by death.<a name=540:2></a> The first covenant only became valid by death -- the blood of calves and goats.<a name=540:3></a> The new covenant is established in the death of Christ, the death of the Testator, so the disposition of God toward us is shown out.<a name=540:4></a> The new covenant becomes thus a means of teaching the disposition of God toward us.<a name=540:5></a> There is a great contrast between the two covenants: in the first, man after the flesh was recognised and God was hid.<a name=540:6></a> In the second, man after the flesh was annulled and God was revealed.<a name=540:7></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>the apostle speaks a good deal about the veil.<a name=540:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses could not use plainness of speech, and he had to put a veil on his face; the apostle did not -- he used great plainness of speech.<a name=540:9></a> God is no longer veiled or hid.<a name=540:10></a> The allusion as to "Lord" is more or less in reference to Jehovah of the Old Testament, so you must consider it as equal to <i>God</i> -- not of the letter, but of the Spirit, and the Lord is that Spirit; it is not now that we want to be taken up with the terms of the new covenant, we want to get the spirit of it.<a name=540:11></a> If you have not the spirit of the truth, the letter would not be much use to you.<a name=540:12></a>

		The love of God annuls death really; death could not stand in the presence of the Lord, who was the expression of God.<a name=541:7></a> Your mind must be in accord with the death of Christ.<a name=541:8></a> So the apostle could say, "I am crucified with Christ"; his mind was in accord with the death of Christ, and again, "They that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts": you are in accord with the death of Christ, and you cannot indulge the flesh in the presence of the love of God, and you live by the Spirit, and by the Spirit the love of God is shed abroad in your heart; it is the Spirit that makes that love good in <i>your heart</i>; the death of Christ <i>showed it</i>, but the Spirit sheds that love in the heart.<a name=541:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering the force of any portion of the Word it is important to bear in mind that truth forms one complete whole, and that while we learn it in parts, it is the Spirit's work to form it as a complete whole in our souls.<a name=577:1></a> We may have keen enjoyment of some particular passage of Scripture, but at the same time we want to get understanding as to the way in which various parts form part of one scheme.<a name=577:2></a> It is therefore important to be enabled to put together the various parts.<a name=577:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this epistle (Romans) there are three chapters of which the object is evidently to <i>present God to us</i>, namely, chapters 3, 4, 5, while the next three chapters, 6, 7, 8, present what the christian is <i>for God</i>.<a name=577:4></a> We have necessarily to learn first what God is as revealed in the gospel, in the economy of grace; and hence chapter 3 presents the righteousness of God, as witnessed in the blood of Christ; chapter 4, the power of God as set forth in the resurrection of Christ, and chapter 5 the love of God as shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit given, and it is in this way that God has been pleased to reveal Himself to us; and I think that we learn things in the order of Scripture.<a name=577:5></a> We do not learn the love of God first.<a name=577:6></a> No!<a name=577:7></a> We are sinful, we have to learn His righteousness, made known in grace and not in judgment, and it is this which the gospel reveals.<a name=577:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:17">Romans  1:17</a>.<a name=577:9></a>) It is the first thing which God impresses on the heart of the sinner.<a name=577:10></a> The blood is the witness that God is righteous, but it is the ground, too, on which God can in grace justify, so we read, "that he might be just, <i>and</i> the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=577:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		These chapters present thus the full revelation of God to us, and it is by this alone that the heart of the believer is affected.<a name=578:4></a> The effulgence of God, the knowledge of His glory, for which God had shone into the heart of the apostle, is the light of the gospel, and this is the foundation which in his ministry the apostle laid in souls.<a name=578:5></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:10">1 Corinthians  3:10</a>, 11.<a name=578:6></a>)

		In chapter 8 we find he is not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, and the Spirit is the power by which we are formed subjectively.<a name=578:13></a> We are, so to say, in the grip of God, to be formed in something completely new, in which we had no part before.<a name=578:14></a> What we are to live in is sonship, and we come to this in the end of the passage I read.<a name=578:15></a> (verses 14 - 17.<a name=578:16></a>) To this end Christ had to become Man and to accomplish redemption, and redemption being accomplished, we "receive sonship", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a> - 6.<a name=578:17></a>

		To refer again to chapter 6.<a name=579:3></a> There, as I have said, you are to reckon yourself dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=579:4></a> The principle of the world is sin, Sin is seen in that everything here ends in death.<a name=579:5></a> "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin".<a name=579:6></a> Most people connect sin with the idea of something gross, but this is not the thought of Scripture.<a name=579:7></a> The 'man of sin' is the lawless one.<a name=579:8></a> Sin is the principle in man which refuses the restraint of God.<a name=579:9></a> The leaders of thought in the present day claim absolute freedom of mind and to exercise this without restraint in the things of God, but perdition, which means moral ruin, is connected with this.<a name=579:10></a> The man of sin is 'the son of perdition' (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:3">2 Thessalonians  2:3</a>.<a name=579:11></a>) In chapter 6 we accept death to sin, and the new platform is "alive to God" -- that means that the soul of the believer -- lives in the blessed light of the revelation in which God has been pleased to make Himself known; but then this is manifestly outside of the whole course of the world.<a name=579:12></a> Death is here, and this proves that the ruling principle of the world is sin.<a name=579:13></a> It is for this reason that the christian has to accept death to sin.<a name=579:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the next chapter the believer is placed in relation to One raised from the dead.<a name=579:15></a> No one can know naturally the ways of One risen from the dead, but the believer is placed under the Son of God, under the influence of His love, that he may be formed after Him.<a name=579:16></a> This, I judge, is the force of being married, or joined to Him, and just as you are under the influence of the love of the Son of God (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>), the One raised from the dead, so you bring forth fruit to God.<a name=579:17></a> The love of Christ evidently had a great place with the apostle.<a name=579:18></a> "The love of Christ constraineth us", we read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>.<a name=579:19></a> We are to live to Him who died for

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to chapter 8.<a name=580:9></a> Here we find a point of equal importance.<a name=580:10></a> We have had the platform and the husband, but these would be ineffective were it not for the power which resides in the christian.<a name=580:11></a> Until grace works in man he is not conscious of the flesh, of the law of sin in his members, and this is concurrent with the conviction of <i>mind</i> (I do not see in this, a nature) that God's law is good.<a name=580:12></a> So the conclusion is, that with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.<a name=580:13></a> The law of sin in the members is too strong, notwithstanding the conviction and mind as to God's law.<a name=580:14></a> Now in chapter 8 we get the power in the believer by which he can be free from the law of sin and death.<a name=580:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 6 we have seen that sin is not dead, but that the believer is to accept death to sin, so that he may be on the platform which God has formed for him.<a name=580:16></a> In chapter 8, on the other hand, we get the power in the christian.<a name=580:17></a> God has been pleased to bring in crucifixion to condemn sin in the flesh in order that He might be able to communicate the gift of the Spirit.<a name=580:18></a> I see the same connection

		These verses (9 - 11) are brought in to teach us that we are wholly dependent upon the Spirit.<a name=581:7></a> It would be wrong for the believer to say he could not do the things that he would; he is "not in the flesh, but in the Spirit", if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in him.<a name=581:8></a> Then also Christ is in him, and that by virtue of his having the Spirit (verse 10).<a name=581:9></a> Then we get "the Spirit is life".<a name=581:10></a> The question here is of living to God, and in this sense, the Spirit is <i>life</i>, because of righteousness.<a name=581:11></a> Then he will get final quickening as to his body, because of the Spirit indwelling him.<a name=581:12></a> Thus you have three things:

	<div class="paragraph">
		I first take Peter, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:15">John  21:15</a> - 17.<a name=583:6></a> To him the Lord said, "Lovest thou me?<a name=583:7></a>" No one can doubt that Peter loved Him, the Lord owns it, but his defect lay in thinking too much about his love.<a name=583:8></a> No one ever loved Christ unless he was first under the influence of Christ's love; but Peter gave himself credit for being pre-eminent in this, he thought he loved Christ more than all the others, and that was the reason for the Lord's challenge, "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=583:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a serious thing to talk about our love for Christ, for in so doing we bring upon ourselves the challenge to show it.<a name=583:10></a> Peter had not shown it, for he had denied the Lord with cursing and swearing.<a name=583:11></a> But he did love Him, and the Lord interceded for him and he was restored in conscience and heart, and then the Lord challenged him to give expression to his love.<a name=583:12></a> Three times the challenge was repeated, until he has to say, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee".<a name=583:13></a> He had attached too much importance to his love to Christ, and had been

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take John.<a name=584:4></a> He did not talk about his love to Christ, but he traded on Christ's love to him, and that is a much safer thing.<a name=584:5></a> Peter rested in his own love and broke down and denied the Lord.<a name=584:6></a> John rested in Christ's love and lay in His bosom.<a name=584:7></a> He got as close to Him as he possibly could, and the Lord did not resent it.<a name=584:8></a> He was near enough to speak to the Lord, and to hear His voice.<a name=584:9></a> It was like Mary, who got near to Him to hear His word.<a name=584:10></a> I venture to say that there is not one of us who would not be delighted to have a word from Him; but He does not speak to people at a distance, you must be near Him if you would have a word from Him.<a name=584:11></a>

		The christian accepts death, drinking the bitter waters of Marah.<a name=585:4></a> He is thus shut up to Christ; the One who died for him and rose again is before his soul.<a name=585:5></a> So it was with Paul.<a name=585:6></a> He went to a further extent in it than we can go, as he said, "Henceforth know we no man after the flesh"; he was apart from the power of all human relationships and affections.<a name=585:7></a> He was under the constraint of the love of Christ, and went through trials and persecutions, suffering the loss of everything in this world, to gain Christ.<a name=585:8></a>

		We are placed thus between the Father and the Son, the gift of the Father to Christ with this object, that He might bring us home to the Father's house, and the love of Christ will have complete satisfaction when He has us there.<a name=587:8></a> He tells His disciples that He is leaving them, but He goes to prepare a place for them, and will come again and receive them to Himself.<a name=587:9></a>

		Now that is still future, but I will tell you what He does in the interval, He brings us to the Father's heart.<a name=587:10></a> His love is not satisfied with anything less.<a name=587:11></a> He has declared to us the Father's name, and makes us to know that we are loved of the Father as He is loved.<a name=587:12></a> "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:26">John  17:26</a>.<a name=587:13></a>

		I have noticed these three points, but you cannot suppose that I could exhaust the subject of the love of Christ.<a name=587:17></a> There is first His claim as having died for us, then the fruit of His love as seen in intercession for us, then He conducts us out of the world to the Father, that the love wherewith He is loved may be in us.<a name=587:18></a> Thus we can understand the prayer of the apostle that I read from <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>.<a name=587:19></a>

		ON ETERNAL LIFE

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Difficulties have arisen in the minds of some whom I esteem, as to certain expressions in the American notes on the subject of eternal life, but I think that the root of them lies in not apprehending how the scriptures on the subject present themselves to my mind.<a name=589:4></a> I may be right or I may be wrong, but any way, it is not at all a question of any thoughts of my own, but of the way in which Scripture is apprehended, and I think that those that find difficulty might try to look at things as they present themselves to me before refusing them.<a name=589:5></a> I do not in the matter in any way make light of the work of God in the believer, but on the contrary insist on it as that by which alone eternal life can be entered into, but the point with me is that what is wrought in the believer is not spoken of as eternal life, but is the preparation or the means by which he enters into it.<a name=589:6></a> A man is born again, is enlightened by the gospel and is then sealed by the Spirit, and it is then by the Spirit he enters into eternal life.<a name=589:7></a> This is in accord with Scripture, which teaches that the living water that Christ gives is in the believer a well of water springing up into everlasting life; that he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life eternal; and again, that being made free from sin and having become servants to God, we have our fruit unto holiness and the end eternal life.<a name=589:8></a> These passages show conclusively that the work of God IN US is not spoken of as eternal life, but as leading to or ending in it.<a name=589:9></a> It is a great point to apprehend this.<a name=589:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes another point, that is, as to the part faith has in it.<a name=589:11></a> The passage, "He that believeth on

	<div class="paragraph">
		me hath everlasting life", is quoted, and so it is said that eternal life is had by faith.<a name=590:1></a> It is certain that no one has it without faith, for a man must have been enlightened by the gospel in order to have the Spirit, but the teaching of Scripture is not that a man gets it by faith, but that the believer is the person who has it.<a name=590:2></a> I might say, by way of illustration, that a member of Parliament votes because he is a member.<a name=590:3></a> This is true; it is his qualification to vote, and yet it is not the cause of his voting.<a name=590:4></a> This is because he belongs to a party and votes according to that party; that is the immediate cause of his voting, though I might well say that a member votes.<a name=590:5></a> A believer has eternal life because he is a believer, that is his title or qualification, but the immediate cause of his having eternal life is that he has the Spirit.<a name=590:6></a> It is that in him which springs up into it.<a name=590:7></a> He has eternal life as being a believer, so that I say the believer has eternal life, as I would say the member votes, but, then, he needs the Spirit to enter into it, as the member needs opinions or party to lead him to vote.<a name=590:8></a> His opinions are not his title, but they are his power, so having the Spirit is not the title to the believer, but faith which apprehends Christ in whom eternal life is.<a name=590:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to another point as to faith, namely, that one is not called upon to believe anything as to oneself, but faith apprehends what is true in Christ.<a name=590:10></a> I am not called upon to believe that I have eternal life, but that eternal life is in Christ for man -- that He is it.<a name=590:11></a> Scripture is explicit that eternal life is in Christ -- it is God's gift in Christ, and when faith is there, the seal of the Spirit is given so that we may appropriate what is there in Christ for man.<a name=590:12></a> It is ever there, and Christ is no poorer by our appropriation.<a name=590:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very important principle.<a name=590:14></a> I do not want to believe anything about myself in particular, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		what is in Christ for all men and, therefore, for me, and this faith is sealed by the Spirit and then begins the principle of appropriation, and this goes on as we advance in the knowledge of God, and so that all that God gives is morally in accord with Himself.<a name=591:1></a> Redemption is according and suitable to His grace.<a name=591:2></a> Salvation is according to His mercy and eternal life is according to His love, and as we apprehend these principles in God, we are enabled to reach our own blessings.<a name=591:3></a> It is certain that eternal life is constantly spoken of in Scripture as something to be entered into; the question therefore arises as to <i>what</i> it is that is to be entered into.<a name=591:4></a> The power or qualification to enter into it I have already spoken of.<a name=591:5></a> This is the springing up of the well of water in the believer.<a name=591:6></a> What is entered into is said to be eternal life.<a name=591:7></a> It must be something external to the believer or he could not be said to enter into it.<a name=591:8></a> He enters into it in soul.<a name=591:9></a> I might illustrate it in this way.<a name=591:10></a> When a child is born it enters into the elements of life which it finds existing, such as rule, atmosphere and light; and these things are life to the newly-born infant, without them it could not live.<a name=591:11></a> Had there not been sin man would doubtless have lived in them for ever, but the fall brought into the state of man the principle of non-continuance.<a name=591:12></a> Thus what is life to the infant, and without which even Adam could not have lived, is apprehended by us as objective.<a name=591:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in spiritual things the same principle is true -- the believer is born of God and in this way is qualified to enter into the appointed conditions.<a name=591:14></a> Just as the newly-born infant has a body subject to natural laws, lungs that can take in the air, eyes that can enjoy the light, so the believer, being born of God, is capable of entering into the conditions of life which God has appointed.<a name=591:15></a> These are, as in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=592>[Page 592]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		natural things, rule, atmosphere and light.<a name=592:1></a> Rule is found in abiding in Christ, so that the believer is delivered from lawlessness; he does not sin because he is under the law or influence of Christ.<a name=592:2></a> Atmosphere is found in the christian circle, where the love of Christ pervades all, and in that the believer is delivered from a world of hatred and death.<a name=592:3></a> "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren".<a name=592:4></a> Light is found in the perfect setting forth of God's disposition towards us in Christ, made good in us by the Spirit; Christ is the proof of what the love of God towards us is.<a name=592:5></a> We have thus seen what are the elements of life, and it is <i>in them</i> that eternal life consists, and they are there for us to enter into by the Spirit, and in entering into them we are conscious that we have eternal life, as we are told by the apostle John.<a name=592:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point as to which objection has been raised, namely, the application of the thought of eternal life to earth.<a name=592:7></a> I certainly am unable to find any scripture that connects it with heaven.<a name=592:8></a> It may be said that Christ is it, but this is in its application towards earth, and the principles of which I have spoken as making up eternal life properly apply to earth, such as rule, or kingdom, the bearing of which is towards earth.<a name=592:9></a> If Scripture anywhere speaks of eternal life in connection with heaven, I shall certainly receive it, but wherever it is spoken of, it appears connected with God's ways on earth.<a name=592:10></a> In Matthew, Mark and Luke it is connected with the coming age and John gives it a present application.<a name=592:11></a> I therefore prefer to take it up in that light.<a name=592:12></a> It has been said that I limit it, but this is not my thought, but to put the thing in its proper connection, and I cannot attempt to restrict the power of God to bring in other and, in a sense, better things, in heaven or in the eternal state.<a name=592:13></a> He says, "I make all
