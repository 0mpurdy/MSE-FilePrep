		LETTERS OF F. E. RAVEN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May 1st, 1888.<a name=1:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=1:2></a> Bradstock.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- I had rather explained things to you by word of mouth than in writing but will endeavour to comply with your wish.<a name=1:4></a> I hold nothing extraordinary, nor that any blessing given to us of Christ is matter of attainment but I am opposed to the taking up of things in such a way as practically to exclude faith and hope -- two of the essential elements of christian life.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point as to divine righteousness is as to the force of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>.<a name=1:6></a> It is, as I understand it, the text of the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=1:7></a> It gives us the divine intent in Christ being made sin for us.<a name=1:8></a> Divine righteousness is to be displayed in us in Christ.<a name=1:9></a> We are to have a perfect state in a heavenly standing.<a name=1:10></a> God has secured this for us in Christ in glory and the moment he appears it will be absolutely true in us.<a name=1:11></a> So long as we have the flesh and sin I could not say it is absolutely made good in us, but it is made good in us morally as we walk in faith in the power of the Spirit.<a name=1:12></a> Hence it is not any way a question of attainment but of walking in the power of the Spirit in faith and hope.<a name=1:13></a> Paul looked to be found having God's righteousness.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to eternal life, it seems to me that it is a kind of technical expression indicating an order and state of blessing proposed and prepared of God for man.<a name=1:15></a> With Paul it is viewed as a reward or end or hope, though the believer being called to it is to grasp it while on the road to it.<a name=1:16></a> With John it is present and moral (not in display) formed for us by the incarnation of the Son of God and we having entrance into it through His death.<a name=1:17></a> The Son, where His voice is heard, gives us the privilege and entry and freedom of this sphere of blessing which is expressed in Himself as a Man, the privilege of blessed nearness to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Father, and of being the object of the Father's love and joy and delight.<a name=2:1></a> Hence the eternal life is in the Son.<a name=2:2></a> He is it.<a name=2:3></a> So that eternal life is objective and practical rather than subjective, a sphere and order of blessing.<a name=2:4></a> But not only does Christ give freedom of entry into this sphere, He gives also the Spirit as the capacity, the Spirit in the believer is life.<a name=2:5></a> Hence the believer has the freedom of entry and the capacity to enjoy this sphere of blessing which Christ has formed, and behind all he is born of God.<a name=2:6></a> This is no question of attainment but I am at the same time quite sure that there are many christians who are not morally in it, yet loudly claiming to have the possession of eternal life.<a name=2:7></a> Faith is not in exercise and they are not free of the world.<a name=2:8></a> I should be thankful if the Lord uses this to set your mind at rest.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to reply to your note.<a name=2:16></a> I believe that eternal life belongs by the voice of the Son of God to every real christian (as redemption and sonship) and that he is privileged to live in what the disciples saw manifested in the Son (as Man), viz.<a name=2:17></a>, blessed nearness to the Father and consciousness of the Father's love and joy and delight -- where sin and power of death cannot intrude.<a name=2:18></a> More than this that the believer has in him the Holy Spirit -- the Spirit of life -- as the divinely given capacity to live in this blessing.<a name=2:19></a> Hence it is not conditional, or an object of hope only.<a name=2:20></a> The apprehension or enjoyment may of course be another thing.<a name=2:21></a>

		Mr.<a name=3:2></a> W.<a name=3:3></a> Bradstock.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- Pardon the delay in replying to your letter.<a name=3:5></a> First as to <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>.<a name=3:6></a> The subject here is reconciliation not justification.<a name=3:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>and 4 where the question is of offences, justification through faith in Christ's blood is brought in, and the believer is justified now -- is accounted righteous, the righteousness of God is upon him.<a name=3:8></a> But in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a> the point is not guilt, but state -- this is met by reconciliation on the basis of Christ having been made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in Christ.<a name=3:9></a> Surely to become God's righteousness is more than to be held for righteous as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>.<a name=3:10></a> If it means anything it means that sin is to be completely displaced in us by divine righteousness and that cannot be until the Lord comes.<a name=3:11></a> Looking at the believer abstractly as in Christ, it may be true now, but the verse involves more than this -- the full result of Christ having been made sin for us.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to eternal life that it is a sphere or condition of blessing is evident to all from such passages as <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:27">John  6:27</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>.<a name=3:13></a> It is in the Son.<a name=3:14></a> J.<a name=3:15></a>N.<a name=3:16></a>D.<a name=3:17></a> said over and over again that life was never said to be in us.<a name=3:18></a> It is given to everyone, the youngest believer in Christ, but it is in the Son, and the believer has the Spirit of life in him -- he is born too of God, has every element.<a name=3:19></a> Still the having eternal life is the result of the reception of the testimony as to the Son on which it is founded -- He that hath the Son hath life.<a name=3:20></a> John is seeking to lead those who believed in the name of the Son to the knowledge that they had eternal life -- he shows that the believer (babes and all) is in the light, is born of God and has the Spirit -- his object being that they, continuing in the testimony they had heard (the Father and the Son) might have the present experience of the blessing of eternal life.<a name=3:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- Just a line to say that should the meeting on the 17th not come off, I would readily come over and see you -- or meet Lowe and yourself.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thought to add a word, not as asserting my thoughts, but because I judge brethren have been a little at cross purposes in the use of terms.<a name=4:7></a> There seems to me two ideas in John -- 'life' and 'eternal life' -- intimately connected yet distinct.<a name=4:8></a> Christ is the source and head of life -- and the expression and seat of 'eternal life'.<a name=4:9></a> As source of life He, by His word, communicates life to the believer -- by whom His word is, as one might say, assimilated (the work of God being there) and the believer lives by Him.<a name=4:10></a> "He that eateth me shall live by me".<a name=4:11></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:57">John  6:57</a>) "He that hath the Son hath life".<a name=4:12></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:12">1 John  5:12</a>) It is a dependent life, inseparable from its source though in us in the power and reality of the Spirit.<a name=4:13></a> But more than this, in being drawn to the Son, who as Son of Man has been lifted up, we are morally out of the world and the flesh -- in the infinite and eternal blessedness which is expressed and exists in Him as Man, in a new position and relationship which He has constituted for man before the Father, Whom He has revealed.<a name=4:14></a> We are 'in the Son' -- and He is the true God and eternal life.<a name=4:15></a> I am not saying if that is right or wrong -- but it is this sense that some of us have used the term 'eternal life' -- perhaps, in appearance, a little to the exclusion of life, certainly not intentionally.<a name=4:16></a> I say this in the hope of helping to clear up misunderstanding.<a name=4:17></a>

		ROYAL NAVAL COLLEGE, <br>GREENWICH, <br>July 11th, 1888.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- If it be a question of meeting two or three brothers such as you name I could raise no objection.<a name=5:2></a> What I dreaded was a sort of formal meeting with brothers present whose minds were in a state of excitement.<a name=5:3></a> I do not think I could meet them without others being there who had been prominent at Witney.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You would hardly say that John was written to such as had conscious possession of eternal life, because he avowedly wishes that they may be conscious.<a name=5:5></a> I think there are two sides to the truth, the gift side and the appropriation side.<a name=5:6></a> It is undeniable that God has given 'eternal life' to every one that has the Holy Spirit, i.<a name=5:7></a>e.<a name=5:8></a>, to every christian.<a name=5:9></a> The christian is 'in the Son', having left, morally, the flesh and the world, and there he has eternal life -- shares that blessedness which has been embodied in the Son, as Man, before the Father.<a name=5:10></a> But though this be true of every believer I think there are very many not awake to it -- and this I thought was the point at Witney -- they haven't it as part of their practical christianity, i.<a name=5:11></a>e.<a name=5:12></a>, the enjoyment of it.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is, of course, the source of life -- the last Adam -- a quickening Spirit -- and we all live by Him, but this is, I think, a different thought to His being the eternal life "which was with the Father".<a name=5:14></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:2">1 John  1:2</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to exhibit the life of Christ here in patience and suffering -- but 'eternal life' is all blessedness, it is what is in the Son with the Father.<a name=5:15></a> I quite think with you that in John it is 'in the Son', and in Paul in the risen glorified Man.<a name=5:16></a>

		November 25th, 1889.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reply to Mr.<a name=6:2></a> W.<a name=6:3></a> J.<a name=6:4></a> Lowe.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- Your putting 'formally' before me the proofs of the systematic character of evil teaching with which I am charged necessitates some reply as I suppose it to be on your part a preliminary to other steps.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finding this I accept your disavowal of personal feeling and expression of unfeigned affection and I think I can avow the same toward you.<a name=6:7></a> It has been a trying experience to me to find myself in a position of antagonism toward you.<a name=6:8></a> I had thought after the meeting at Oliphant's more than a year ago that there was but little substantial difference of thought between us and I know of nothing which has since come to light to justify the extreme expression with which your letter closes.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In examining your letter I must first remark on the slender premises on which the charge of an evil system of doctrine is based: a passage from a letter -- a supposition of something said at a reading -- an expression from a paper written two years ago (as to which paper you spoke to me at the time taking no exception to it) an extract from a letter to a brother -- a statement at a reading: these are for the most part taken out of their connection: read in their place their meaning is clear enough, but stated by themselves their meaning may not be apparent.<a name=6:10></a> No brother can pretend to inspired accuracy of language and if a charge of heresy is to be based on such premises as these, no teacher would be safe.<a name=6:11></a> It is a human way of proceeding and not a movement of the Spirit of God and ought, I believe, to be resisted to the utmost.<a name=6:12></a> The practice of teachers watching one another to find out proofs of heresy is not of God.<a name=6:13></a> I do not for a moment pretend that my thoughts on the points in question are absolutely right or the thoughts of others absolutely wrong.<a name=6:14></a> I apprehend they are matters on which with patience
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		light might be obtained from Scripture: but I affirm that what I have expressed as to them at one time and another has had simple reference to each point in itself and is not the outcome of any system existing in my mind save the system of Scripture so far as it has been formed there.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before referring to the main points of righteousness, relationship and life, I touch on some points of detail: as to life and its manifestation in the Son of God I need say but a few words.<a name=7:2></a> What you state has mostly reference to the testimony which He who was the Light of the world bore to the Father here, and it is with this that the responsibility of the world was connected.<a name=7:3></a> They could not be won by the greatest testimony that could be presented to them.<a name=7:4></a> The prominent thought in the gospel of John is the revelation of the Father in the Son with the gift of eternal life to those given of the Father to the Son and the promise of the Comforter.<a name=7:5></a> Eternal life is a subject elsewhere unfolded.<a name=7:6></a> I can only express here what I have felt in regard to statements advanced by others that to make eternal life (which in its main force in Scripture refers to purpose of blessing for man) to be descriptive of all that was seen in Christ is on the one side seriously to obscure His true Deity (which is the prominent subject in John's gospel) and on the other the real part which He took in human life in its conditions down here and which in death He gave up never to resume.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point is that of knowledge in connection with <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>, and here I have some difficulty in apprehending your meaning.<a name=7:8></a> You say that knowledge belongs to the revelation made and is received in faith and when so received is possessed: and again that the knowledge which is implied in the revelation made is received by faith and is a perfect thing in itself.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit and so does everybody that the revelation is complete and is received in faith and that knowledge
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is inherent in the revelation.<a name=8:1></a> The revelation is received because it commends itself to the heart and conscience as God's word not because it is known and I am at a loss to understand the idea of knowledge being received by faith, and that as a perfect thing in itself Knowledge is in part and will always be so here (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:12">1 Corinthians  13:12</a>) and is in proportion as the revelation is wrought in us by grace.<a name=8:2></a> All knowledge is in the revelation but certainly not yet in us.<a name=8:3></a> I doubt not that a man's spiritual stature is pretty much the measure of his real knowledge though all be his to be known.<a name=8:4></a> But I do not think this explains <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The verse gives the form and character to us of eternal life and the 'know' means, I judge, the knowing which involves a kindred nature as "I know my sheep and am known of mine, as the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:15">John  10:15</a>) though the objects must have been revealed to be thus known.<a name=8:6></a> I do not reject here the conclusion to which you seek to push me that the verse involves the presence of the Spirit in the believer.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This effort to make knowledge entirely objective I regard as very erroneous and tending to destroy the formative value of revelation.<a name=8:8></a> As to the expression 'moral state' or 'state of blessing' in connection with eternal life, I only remark that eternal life means for us a wholly new order of things for which we have to eat Christ's flesh and drink His blood and the seat of which is in Him who is the Resurrection and the Life.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to what is implied in the distinctive names of the Father and Jesus Christ, His sent One, I say that as to what is distinctive, which was my point in my lecture at Quemerford, grace in its counsels and movements is what is distinctly connected with the Father's Name: while the accomplishment of those counsels belongs to the Son and for this end He has become Man and died and all judgment is committed to Him to secure His being honoured by all as is the Father.<a name=8:10></a> Your quotation from <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:17">1 Peter  1:17</a> is nothing to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		point -- it is simply that the God who judges according to every man's work is invoked as Father by christians.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the main points of your letter, namely, righteousness, life and relationship: and here I am bound to say that the defect which is apparent in your apprehension of these subjects really disqualifies you for passing judgment on what I have put forward.<a name=9:2></a> But to begin with, the peculiar force of the expression "in Christ" (and I do not think 'with Christ' in your sense is found in Ephesians) as denoting the distinctive position of the church in connection with eternal calling in the heavenly places and in the ages to come is frittered away.<a name=9:3></a> Your enquiry 'Where in Scripture is "in Christ" or "in Him" used to denote our conformity to Christ in glory?<a name=9:4></a>' is in the face of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a> perfectly astounding.<a name=9:5></a> At the same time our becoming the righteousness of God in Christ as the fruit of Christ's having been made sin for us is levelled down to the truth of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>, and made to be a mere question of justification in respect of guilt eked out by a vague reference to new creation.<a name=9:6></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a> the subject.<a name=9:7></a> is a wholly distinct one not of guilt but of state.<a name=9:8></a> Again by reasoning from nature, relationship and eternal life are made by you to be the consequence of new birth.<a name=9:9></a> I say they are the consequences of the gospel though a man must be born to see or believe the gospel.<a name=9:10></a> Relationship and eternal life do not belong to the old man but to the new, and though of the grace of God and received through the gospel they are true to the believer only in the having put off the 'old man' and put on the new and this is more than new birth.<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But your system is ruinous for it cuts away the whole fabric of experimental christianity.<a name=9:12></a> Life and relationship are detached from the great characteristic truth of our salvation, namely, the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, in other words, from heavenly ground and heavenly state.<a name=9:13></a> The entry

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		by Christ's death and resurrection on to new and heavenly ground with consequent deliverance from flesh and the world, as well as the formation of Christ in the christian (as to which the apostle travailed again in birth in regard to the Galatians) by the testimony presented to him, is all swept away.<a name=10:1></a> For you all has been effected by new birth and yet as to relationship the testimony of Scripture is "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>) and it is by the Spirit of adoption that we cry "Abba Father".<a name=10:2></a> I know the effort to exclude from John's writings the light of Paul's -- but in principle there is no difference between them.<a name=10:3></a> With John eternal life is in the Son (not said to be in us): the three witnesses to us are the Spirit and the water and the blood, and it is not until the Spirit is received that the results of redemption, the power and efficacy of the water and blood, are really known.<a name=10:4></a> The one who eats Christ's flesh and drinks His blood has eternal life.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Without indulging in any strong language I believe you to be wholly wrong; your doctrine appears to be new birth, perfect knowledge received as a whole by faith and then known by the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:6></a> I do not accept it: it savours to me far too much of Mr.<a name=10:7></a> Grant's system.<a name=10:8></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Referring to our conversation of yesterday I send a line to say that, while adhering to the substance of my letters to you of May 1st and 6th, and June 6th, 1888, there is an expression in that of June 6th which I would wish to withdraw -- it is as follows, 'if it means anything it means that sin is to be completely displaced in us by divine righteousness, and this cannot be until the Lord comes'.<a name=10:15></a> The sentence as it stands involves confusion between a state in us conformable to God's righteousness and that righteousness

	<div class="paragraph">
		in itself.<a name=11:1></a> In doing this I express my regret at any difficulty the expression may have caused in any mind, though the circulation of the letters is not my responsibility.<a name=11:2></a> What I had in my mind was, as I think the tenor of my letters shows, that the full answer in us to Christ having been made sin for us is in our being perfected after His order in glory.<a name=11:3></a> The difference in present application to the believer between <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a> and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>and 4 seems to me the difference between a place in Christ in the holiest and a place of acceptance as at the brazen altar down here.<a name=11:4></a> Both belong in God's righteousness to the believer.<a name=11:5></a> That I ever held that any state in the believer constituted his righteousness before God I absolutely deny, Christ is made that to us of God.<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take the opportunity of adding a word in regard to eternal life.<a name=11:7></a> Were I now writing on the subject I should lay more stress on a point touched in my letter of June 6th, viz.<a name=11:8></a>, the Son being in us as life in the power of the Spirit, and in connection with it the relationship of children (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>) into which we are brought through redemption and as the fruit of the manifestation of the Father's Name by the Son to the men given to Him of the Father out of the world.<a name=11:9></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Mr.<a name=11:18></a> Stoney has sent on to me a letter of yours bearing no date -- nor am I sure to whom it is written -- but I feel I cannot allow it to pass without sending a line to remonstrate against the injustice both of its basis and of its reasonings and conclusions.<a name=11:19></a> All is based on extracts of letters obtained from me by a brother eighteen months ago, and these extracts (which you have not taken the trouble to authenticate) are treated as though they were a careful exposition of a

		system of doctrine.<a name=12:1></a> I never knew a brother judged before on such premises.<a name=12:2></a> Then as to the reasoning, I venture to say that in regard to both subjects in question it is fallacious, and leads to unjust conclusions.<a name=12:3></a> Eternal life is said to be the eternal Person of the ever blessed Son of God.<a name=12:4></a> Thus the Son of God and eternal life are made strictly equivalent, and expressions used in reference to the latter are tested by their applicability to the former, I am sure such reasoning will not hold.<a name=12:5></a> On the one hand the Son of God is more than eternal life, He is God the Giver of eternal life -- and on the other hand expressions may be used in speaking of eternal life which cannot be applied to Christ personally.<a name=12:6></a> The righteous go into eternal life, you cannot here substitute Son of God.<a name=12:7></a> John in his first epistle declares unto us eternal life -- manifested in the Son of God -- in the character in which we possess it here.<a name=12:8></a> It is God's Son and we are in Him that is true.<a name=12:9></a> He is the true God and eternal life.<a name=12:10></a> It is what He is to christians.<a name=12:11></a> Eternal life viewed as a subject by itself has also other bearings.<a name=12:12></a> Further, as to divine righteousness.<a name=12:13></a> It is reasoned that because it is maintained that divine righteousness in its fullest sense sets and displays us in glory in the life and state of Christ, that therefore that life and state are held to constitute our righteousness before God.<a name=12:14></a> This latter idea is, I believe, Cluffism, but never had a place in my thoughts.<a name=12:15></a> The former I have no doubt is the truth, and gives the fullest place to redemption.<a name=12:16></a> The righteousness of God which is upon us (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>) has reference to our responsibility, we are freely justified in His grace through redemption, but this is not beyond the brass of the tabernacle.<a name=12:17></a> The glad tidings of God's glory are far beyond the question of our responsibility, and through righteousness set us in a wholly new state and place for man -- and here we come to the gold of the tabernacle.<a name=12:18></a> It is the fruit of Christ having been made sin for us.<a name=12:19></a> This is <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>.<a name=12:20></a> We

		<a class="footnote" name="#15:f2"><sup>++</sup></a>In Ephesians the believer is seen in Christ, according to the sovereign purpose and counsels of God who has raised Christ from the dead and set Him at His right hand by the working of His mighty power. Hence, as 'in Christ,' the believer is looked at as quickened together with Him by the same power of God. He is thus of a new order, morally of a new creation, which is outside the present creation or order of things in which he actually is, though the character and beauty of it are to come out in every sphere owned of God. In Romans the believer is, on the other hand, seen as alive on earth. He is justified, has peace with God, the Holy Spirit is given to him, he is dead to sin, and to reckon himself so and alive to God in Christ Jesus, and sin is not to reign in his mortal body to obey its lusts; he is dead to the law to be to Christ; not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, the righteousness of the law is to be fulfilled in him, and not a debtor to the flesh to fulfil flesh's lust; has to do with the groaning creation, though he has the firstfruits of the Spirit. It is the life of responsibility here, though carried out in divine power. Truths which view the christian in one aspect cannot be used to weaken the force of the truth about him in another aspect. A christian is of God in Christ, a new creation, where old things have passed away and all things become new, in which is neither male nor female; but the truth which describes him in that aspect does not describe what he is in himself. At the same time, what he is in Christ is for faith as positively true as what he is and is recognised to be in himself as a man down here in the world.

		My Dear Brother, -- I will endeavour to answer your questions, though it must be shortly, for I am much pressed.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) I should not like to say that Christ was not eternal life until after the resurrection, because all in which eternal life essentially consists in being and relationship was as true in Him before His death as after.<a name=20:11></a> Still it is when eternal life is in the heavenly, glorious condition, which the counsels of God purposed, that Christ is said to be "the true God and eternal life".<a name=20:12></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=21>[Page 21]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) All I meant by 'in essence' was that it was not in form with the Father until the Son became Man, but, as I said, the being, and, in a sense, the relationship was there, but I judge the thought of eternal life always had man in view.<a name=21:1></a> The wonderful thing being that the Son should connect Himself with manhood (become Son of man), and that we should be brought into that which is morally divine.<a name=21:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) I do not like the expression 'exhibition of eternal life', but if used at all, it could only apply to Christ as He is now -- the last Adam -- the glorious Man.<a name=21:3></a> When here in the flesh He had taken part in the life and circumstances of the first man (though as to His Person, the second), and hence in that condition it was no question of exhibition of eternal life, but of its manifestation by divine grace to chosen vessels, and to this John refers in the beginning of his epistle.<a name=21:4></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>the Lord speaks of Himself as "the Son of man which is in heaven", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>) though bodily He was on earth.<a name=21:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(4) In <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a> you could not make 'Jesus Christ' and 'eternal life' reciprocal.<a name=21:6></a> It is predicated of Him that He is eternal life in the same way as He says of Himself, "I am the resurrection", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:25">John  11:25</a>) etc.<a name=21:7></a> Eternal life is a condition, but existing and expressed in such a way in a person, that it can be said of Him He is it.<a name=21:8></a> But then that same Person is the true God and the only-begotten Son.<a name=21:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(5) What I meant by condition in 1 John was heavenly condition of relationship and being before the Father, which was manifested in the Son, and which we have in having Him.<a name=21:10></a> This is the subject of the epistle.<a name=21:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(6) When I think of the only-begotten Son, I think of Him in His own peculiar glory (we beheld His glory as of an only-begotten one with the Father) and the Giver of eternal life.<a name=21:12></a> If I think of Him as the eternal life, I think of Him as the glorious Man, though

		what gives its character to His manhood is what He was eternally and in a sense divinely.<a name=22:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(7) If we apprehend eternal life to consist in a condition of heavenly relationship and being, such as was ever in the Son, we can readily see that if He takes part in man's responsible life here on earth, the two things must be distinct.<a name=22:2></a> It is the difference between what He brought and what He entered into here, and this last He left to enter into a new condition wholly suited to what He brought.<a name=22:3></a> I do not quite like the sentence you quote as the substance of a letter written by me early last year.<a name=22:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eternal life when Christ was here was still with the Father; but this life before men was wholly consonant with it, and in words and works He bore testimony to the Father.<a name=22:5></a> I add that I have never wished any letters of mine to be kept secret, but at the same time I very much doubt the propriety of all correspondence between brothers becoming public property.<a name=22:6></a> It will soon put an end to all liberty of communication between brethren.<a name=22:7></a>

		I am not surprised at his being unable to understand my statements as to eternal life, for we look at things from different points of view.<a name=24:1></a> As far as I can gather he regards eternal life as the life of the Son as a divine Person, as, in fact, equivalent to "In him was life", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>) while I regard it as a condition which, although ever existing essentially in the Son, is presented in Scripture as characteristic of the second Man.<a name=24:2></a> In fact, it is difficult for me to understand that he sees in Christ a real Man, the pattern (though the 'Firstborn') of the many sons God is bringing to glory.<a name=24:3></a> The failure to see the position of mediation which belongs to "the man Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>) is the cause of half the present difficulty.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I fail to find in any of the gospels the statement that Christ is eternal life.<a name=24:5></a> On the contrary, eternal life there refers without exception to something given to man, or into which man is to enter.<a name=24:6></a> In 1 John the object appears to be to unfold the eternal life, which had been revealed in Christ, in order that saints might know that they had it.<a name=24:7></a> I do not believe that the idea of its being an essential personal title of the Son can be maintained; not but what God's purposes of grace and eternal life for man were in Him.<a name=24:8></a> He has this glory, He is a quickening Spirit.<a name=24:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if eternal life means a condition which (though existing eternally in the Son) characterises the second Man, it is evident that the full revelation of it could not be until Christ was wholly separated by death from the first or responsible man lifted up from the earth.<a name=24:10></a> In His own Person He was of course the eternal life, the second Man, when here in the days of His flesh (and was manifested as such to the apostles), but the revelation was veiled by the part which He had taken in the responsible life of man on earth, "made in the likeness of sinful flesh", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>) so that He might become a sacrifice for sin; and this condition was real, so that He was a real Babe, grew in wisdom and stature, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the communication of eternal life, I have no question for a moment that a soul is spiritually alive as the result of new birth: still new birth is only a foundation, and is not necessarily in itself the reception of Christ.<a name=25:3></a> Eternal life is in Christ, and in receiving Christ eternal life is received, but it is in Christ (the second Man) "God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son".<a name=25:4></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:11">1 John  5:11</a>) He that has the Son has life.<a name=25:5></a> But eternal life is to live in Christ, and though it may be said that a soul in receiving Christ is alive in Him, there is no power by which the believer can be formed in the heavenly man until the Spirit is received.<a name=25:6></a> Hence in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>the communication of the Spirit was connected with the breathing of Christ.<a name=25:7></a> Eternal life for us is not simply 'a vital principle', but a new man.<a name=25:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards speaking of eternal life as a sphere or order of blessing, I think it is justified by such scriptures as <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:36">John  4:36</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:25">John  12:25</a> and <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>; but it is as living in Christ we enjoy the sphere.<a name=25:9></a> I may speak of my home as being objectively my life, but I live in it.<a name=25:10></a>

		The way in which he strings together <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:26">John  5:26</a> and <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:2">John  17:2</a> is to me most extraordinary.<a name=28:11></a> I could not make "So hath he given to the Son to have life in himself" and "eternal life" to be the same.<a name=28:12></a> The former is what is proper to the Son (though because He is Man said to be given), and involves self-existence and the power to call the dead into life, while eternal life is what is given to us, and is what is true in Christ and in us, and does not involve self-existence or the quickening of the dead.<a name=28:13></a> Christ is Man, and the pattern of the heavenly family; at the same time He is a quickening spirit (in Him is life), and I could not draw a line between the two.<a name=28:14></a> So, too, in regard to 'eternal life' and the having life in Himself: but I see things in Scripture in certain connections -- life in Himself when the Son is seen as a divine Person in John's gospel -- and eternal life (which He gives) when He is seen as Man ("from the beginning", "handled", etc.<a name=28:15></a>) in connection with others, the pattern of the heavenly family, the children -- when He is manifested we shall be like Him.<a name=28:16></a> Hence I conclude that eternal life is a truth which is connected with man, whether in

		Christ or in us; but, as I said, when I think of Christ, though I see certain things connected with Him as Man -- firstborn among many brethren, Head of the church, etc.<a name=29:1></a>, and other things with Him as divine, such as life-giving, etc.<a name=29:2></a>, I could draw no line between the human and the divine.<a name=29:3></a> I believe eternal life is what He is now as Man, but then it takes its character from what He was eternally as divine.<a name=29:4></a> But I believe eternal life to be the life of man according to the purpose of God and what has come out fully in Christ in resurrection, though manifested in Him even before.<a name=29:5></a> In a word, I believe eternal life to mean a new man in a new scene for man.<a name=29:6></a>

		It is, I judge, a grave mistake to make any essential difference between eternal life as presented in Paul's writings and in John's.<a name=29:16></a> It is the same subject wherever presented.<a name=29:17></a> The apostleship of Paul was especially connected with eternal life.<a name=29:18></a> (See <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:1">2 Timothy  1:1</a>.<a name=29:19></a>) It is evident that he unvaryingly connects it with the second Man -- Christ in glory.<a name=29:20></a> "The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:23">Romans  6:23</a>) the One who has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel.<a name=29:21></a> We have in principle the same truth taught in John's first epistle, "God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son".<a name=29:22></a> Christ is seen in this epistle as with the Father (an advocate, etc.<a name=29:23></a>), and in the last chapter God's Son is carefully identified as Jesus Christ who has come through water and blood, and it is of Him that it is predicated "He is the true

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is also taught in John that that eternal life which was with the Father had been manifested to the apostles.<a name=30:2></a> Now, though this unquestionably refers to the days of Christ's flesh, it is distinct from what He was in His own Person, and had ever been, though this now gave its character to manhood.<a name=30:3></a> He was when here the last Adam, the second Man, though not yet clothed according to the counsels of God, in a condition commensurate with what He was spiritually in life.<a name=30:4></a> What was morally life in Him was what He was with God in spiritual being and relationship (as well as Himself being God), but this was for the moment clothed in a condition pure and immaculate in itself, but not commensurate with the spiritual being.<a name=30:5></a> The truth of His humanity is clearly seen in the meat-offering; there was pure humanity -- the fine flour mingled with oil -- the divine and spiritual principle.<a name=30:6></a> Hence with the Lord here, there was, as we see in the garden and elsewhere, "The days of His flesh".<a name=30:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what came under the eye of God and before the eyes of men, apart from fruits and power of the anointing of the Holy Spirit for service and glimpses of divine glory, was the perfect setting forth of man (and in a sense Israel too) after the flesh.<a name=30:8></a> Every detail of life down here was pervaded and governed by the spiritual principle which men knew not of -- the divine nature.<a name=30:9></a> What they saw was man after the flesh in divine perfectness before God, and thus everything in Christ was light; there was no part dark.<a name=30:10></a> But all this perfectness as man here after the flesh, in which Jesus abode alone, was to end in death, that not only might He become the sin-bearer, but in resurrection enter on manhood in a glorious condition suited to what He ever was and had been in heavenly being and relationship, even when here after the flesh.<a name=30:11></a>

		to which, in Christ, all after the flesh was, so to say, subjected, was made manifest by divine grace to the apostles, together with the Father's name.<a name=31:1></a> They saw that though Jesus had a condition in the flesh here, with the relationships and obligations connected with it, He was at the same time "the Son of man which is in heaven", and it was confirmed and verified to them in His resurrection.<a name=31:2></a> Hence there was the revelation to them of eternal life in its true heavenly character in God's Son.<a name=31:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see how in itself eternal life was outside all after the flesh, so that what was after the flesh could be laid aside, while the human soul remained, and the Son of man which is in heaven could take life again as Man, but not as after the flesh, but in a totally new condition suited to what He ever was as out of heaven; and thus He is said to be eternal life.<a name=31:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this is utterly confused by such a statement as that He never ceased to be the exhibition of eternal life from the Babe in the manger to the throne of the Father.<a name=31:5></a> The exhibition of eternal life is reduced to the lowest and weakest point of man after the flesh.<a name=31:6></a> Christ is not honoured by it; and the perfect setting forth (in the power of the divine nature) of man after the flesh is ignored in order to connect the display of eternal life with the details of human life down here -- the life of the first man -- instead of apprehending the truth conveyed in the fine flour mingled with oil of which the memorial was burned with the sacrifices.<a name=31:7></a>

		As it gradually became clear to me that in its full sense and display divine righteousness is connected in Scripture with Christ in glory, and the believer as a new creation in Him -- and that eternal life implies not only a divine nature but a new and heavenly being, formed by the Holy Spirit in the believer, and also the relationships, objects, knowledge, and sphere proper to it, outside this scene of sight and sense -- I doubt not that I blundered in expression, which I much regret.<a name=35:9></a> I was not disposed to print or publish

	<div class="paragraph">
		Writing to a brother at Ealing, in June, 1889, I commented thus on this statement: -- 'Then again as to life, he says that Christ never ceased to be the exhibition of eternal life from a Babe in the manger to the throne of the Father.<a name=38:3></a> Think of a helpless infant being the Exhibition of eternal life, whatever might be there.<a name=38:4></a> Infancy and all connected with it does not find place in John.<a name=38:5></a> It is simply there "The Word became flesh".<a name=38:6></a> The fact is there is a tendency to lose sight of the truth that as well as being eternal life Jesus was God, and exercising divine prerogatives down here, "The Word was God"; and further that in taking part in human life down here (the life to which sin attached) He took part in that which in Him was brought to an end judicially in death, and this assuredly was not eternal life'.<a name=38:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some time after, another paper by Major M.<a name=38:8></a> appeared, entitled 'Is the Snare Broken?<a name=38:9></a>' and beginning as follows: '"Fancy a helpless Babe an expression of eternal life".<a name=38:10></a> The above in reference to our blessed Lord is taken from a circulated document among christians'.<a name=38:11></a>

		When we come to the New Testament we find the thought of eternal life evidently having a certain place in the minds of the Jews; and in the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) though connected by the Lord with the coming age, the testimony as to it does not generally go, in its scope, beyond life and blessing in this world.<a name=42:1></a> I have said 'generally' because the Lord spoke in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:29">Matthew  19:29</a>, and parallel passages, not only according to what had been predicated in the Old Testament, but according to His perfect knowledge of the fulness of the words.<a name=42:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come to the later writings of Paul (Timothy and Titus) we not only find peculiar prominence given to the truth of eternal life, but a scope and bearing connected with it, such as is not found in the Old Testament or hardly even in the synoptic gospels, though the same thought remains of a life and state of blessing in contrast to man's transitory life here under the power of sin, and liable to death.<a name=42:3></a> It is shown as promised of God that cannot lie before the world began, connected with a purpose and grace given to us in Christ Jesus before the world was, and Paul speaks of himself as apostle according to the hope of it.<a name=42:4></a> But what gives to it its peculiar and distinctive character, and even contrast to the thought in the Old Testament, is that it is life 'in Christ Jesus' -- the risen, glorified Man, the heavenly Man in contrast to the earthly, the new man in contrast to the old.<a name=42:5></a> Eternal life is to be known and enjoyed in Him in the glorious scene into which He has entered as Man, in the virtue and power of redemption.<a name=42:6></a> "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=42:7></a> The consequence of this is that we must connect eternal life now with the new and heavenly condition of man in glory, as is seen in Christ glorified, instead of (as will be the case hereafter) with man in human life and circumstances down here.<a name=42:8></a>

		Hence new birth, always necessary if man has to say to God, does not wholly bring in that of which I have spoken.<a name=43:4></a> Christ, the heavenly Man, must be received, and that too through the testimony to a work by which He has removed, as before God, all that we were morally in the flesh that every one believing in Him might not perish but have eternal life.<a name=43:5></a> Thus we begin in Christ, having received Him, and live in Him where He is, in the Spirit, not in the flesh -- we begin thus as babes, and by the ministry of Christ to our souls, increase and grow up in Him, and Paul always looks to our being full grown in Him; but it is evident that this, in itself, is distinct from human life, circumstances and relationships here below.<a name=43:6></a> It is a life which has its source and spring and seat in Christ, and in which the believer, in the power of the Spirit, realises by faith the new and heavenly being which he is in Christ for God, in which he grows from the babe to the man, and in which he will be perfected in glory according to the image of the heavenly.<a name=43:7></a> It is Christ.<a name=43:8></a>

		But there still remains to be considered the way in which eternal life is presented to us in the writings of John.<a name=43:9></a> I doubt if a complete idea of what eternal life is can be gathered from any single statement, as very often two sides of a truth are shown separately in Scripture, and this appears often to be the case in John's gospel.<a name=43:10></a> For instance, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, we have the statement that the Son of man must be lifted up as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, pointing

		It may be added further that with John eternal life is seen in its essential nature rather than in form, and this, whether as in Christ, or as given to believers -- and it is for this reason I judge that we do not find quite the same line taken in regard of growth, though the principles are the same.<a name=44:12></a> Eternal life is given, and is

		My Dear Brother, -- I return you R--'s papers.<a name=49:2></a> In the larger one there is nothing very new; we have had the same things in England.<a name=49:3></a> There are many statements in it as to Christ which I should readily accept in themselves apart from the object with which he makes them.<a name=49:4></a> But the defect which marks his paper is that he does not rightly divide Scripture.<a name=49:5></a> His object is to identify eternal life with the life of the eternal Son as a divine Person (in Him was life).<a name=49:6></a> If this were meant simply in reference to what the life is morally I would make no objection, but there is no hint with Mr.<a name=49:7></a> R.<a name=49:8></a> of any such limitation.<a name=49:9></a> As a consequence of this he confounds the revelation (in John's gospel) of a divine Person, as such, with the unfolding (in the epistle) of the features of eternal life in the Son as man -- that which is true in Him and in us.<a name=49:10></a> My conviction is that what the Son ever was in nature as divine gives its character to manhood in Him (and in us).<a name=49:11></a> But I do not believe that the Son has therefore ceased to have life in Himself in the conditions suitable to Deity.<a name=49:12></a> He is "The true God and eternal life".<a name=49:13></a> The statements as to the Son in the gospel are not all to be merged and lost in the truth of eternal life.<a name=49:14></a> Mr.<a name=49:15></a> R -- in his zeal for eternal life seems to me to be fast letting go the true deity of Christ.<a name=49:16></a> He says the eternal Son "Ever was, is, and ever will be in His own glorious Person and eternal being the eternal life".<a name=49:17></a> The phrase is high-sounding, but where does he find it in Scripture?<a name=49:18></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am very glad indeed that you have written to me in reference to Mr.<a name=54:30></a> G.<a name=54:31></a>'s construction of statements of mine -- but first I have a right to ask
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=55>[Page 55]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that you should not adopt other people's constructions of my statements.<a name=55:1></a> In this way anything and everything may be grossly perverted.<a name=55:2></a> For instance, in a printed letter of his which I saw, he would make it appear -- because I have used the expression 'in essence' or 'essentially' -- that I have talked of 'essences' in reference to Christ.<a name=55:3></a> Now anyone a little versed in language would know that the two expressions are commonly used with quite distinct force and sense.<a name=55:4></a> It is the effort to fasten on me a term or idea which, applied to the Lord, is offensive.<a name=55:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have not by me the paper of his to which you refer -- but I think I can show you where he is at fault.<a name=55:6></a> He seems unable or unwilling in his mind to distinguish, in regard to the second Man, between the form and habit (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:7">Philippians  2:7</a>,8) of manhood -- and what gives character morally to the manhood.<a name=55:7></a> The first (the form and habit -- the real human soul) Christ took of a woman and it was 'perfected' in resurrection, the second (what gives character to the manhood) He brought into it -- hence as incarnate He was the living and true bread from heaven -- the second Man is "out of heaven".<a name=55:8></a> The same distinction we have to make as to ourselves for we are 'heavenly' in nature as is the heavenly (holy and without blame before God in love) while still here in the form and habit and condition of the earthy.<a name=55:9></a>

		I think the above will answer the points you have put to me -- Mr.<a name=55:10></a> G.<a name=55:11></a>'s assertion of what I believe I wholly refuse.<a name=55:12></a> All that he says seems to me marked by assumption and ignorance.<a name=55:13></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I will do my best to answer your questions according to such light as one has on Scripture.<a name=56:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) It seems to me that all the statements as to eternal life in John's gospel are really grounded on the death of Christ and the gift of the Spirit (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a>, and <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>).<a name=56:6></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>seems to give the rights of His Person (Son of God) and <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>the great truth of incarnation -- and as to these, they were there before or after death -- <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a> - 22 surely means the same thing -- but I would not wish to weaken the force of the 'now is'.<a name=56:7></a> It seems to me that the Lord in John recognises nothing save the heavenly things He brought which however involved the power of the Spirit (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:63">John  6:63</a>).<a name=56:8></a> How far Christ fulfilled when here the office of the Spirit I cannot say -- the Spirit another Comforter.<a name=56:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) A soul is not quickened by faith.<a name=56:10></a> It comes into salvation by faith and receives the Spirit.<a name=56:11></a> This latter is on the responsibility side.<a name=56:12></a> When the soul is once there, i.<a name=56:13></a>e.<a name=56:14></a>, in salvation, God can and does view the whole thing as His own work (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:5">Ephesians  2:5</a>), for indeed He was foremost in it.<a name=56:15></a> I do not think the gospel and new birth are ever mixed up in Scripture.<a name=56:16></a> It appears to me that those who are in the faith of the gospel are told that they are born again, i.<a name=56:17></a>e.<a name=56:18></a>, that the real foundation in them is of God.<a name=56:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a> is the great truth that life and incorruptibility have been brought to light by the glad tidings entrusted to Paul.<a name=56:20></a> It appears to me that this refers to an actual heavenly conviction of life in a man.<a name=56:21></a> This life came out in a moral way in Christ as a Man here and the eyes of the apostles were opened to see it.<a name=56:22></a> They saw it because they were in His company(saw Him, too, in resurrection).<a name=56:23></a> It was a different thing from the testimony addressed to the world, and could

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be discerned only, I judge, by those familiar with Him.<a name=57:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(4) I do not think John by his testimony takes us into Canaan -- his great thought is eternal life here on earth though it is heavenly -- "He that eateth me even he shall live by me", comes after "he that eateth my flesh", etc.<a name=57:2></a> I think that as being here we have to appropriate and to be abidingly in touch with Christ's death so that we may be in the sense of deliverance -- and at the same time such appropriates and enjoys and digests the heavenly grace expressed in His incarnation and thus lives on account of Him.<a name=57:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(5) Life in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>, 4, refers, I think, to life in the sense of its sphere, associations, objects, joys, what we live to -- and these for the believer are hid with Christ in God.<a name=57:4></a> The object is to lead the mind there -- and hence I should rather say it is objective though it involves our being quickened.<a name=57:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(6) I believe the expression 'this life is in His Son' conveys an abstract thought, viz.<a name=57:6></a>, that it is life distinct and morally apart from what we are and have naturally as men down here.<a name=57:7></a> I believe it to refer to what there is in actuality in the Son and not yet in actuality in us -- to the relationship and knowledge in which eternal life practically consists and into which faith enters.<a name=57:8></a> He that has the Son has life.<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(7) "The Spirit is life" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>), I take to be potential.<a name=57:10></a> He cannot be life in any objective sense -- Christ is this -- but He is the answer in the believer to what is true for him in Christ.<a name=57:11></a> I would connect it with <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>.<a name=57:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(8) I believe <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:59">John  12:59</a> refers to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:3">Psalm  133:3</a>, and I think the same idea is found in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:8">1 John  2:8</a>.<a name=57:13></a> Commandment is, so to say, the ordinance of God -- what He has ordained, what it has been in His will to establish, and to this faith bows.<a name=57:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(9) I entirely agree with you.<a name=57:15></a> Eternal life is connected with manhood in Scripture -- but what in the second Man gives character to manhood was ever
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=58>[Page 58]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in essence in the Eternal Son.<a name=58:1></a> I say 'in essence' because it was not in human form or condition.<a name=58:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(10) I think life is used in Scripture in two distinct though connected senses -- both in implied contrast to death morally, first in the sense of blessing and thus given, and secondly in the sense of character, i.<a name=58:3></a>e.<a name=58:4></a>, what is moral, and in connection with this of what is inherent in God.<a name=58:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The close of your letter was an encouragement to me.<a name=58:6></a> Many statements of mine have been thought bad because opposers did not see the sense in which I was using life.<a name=58:7></a> On the other hand I am convinced that in their own minds is an entirely wrong thought as to life.<a name=58:8></a> They conceive of it as the life of the Eternal Son and as something having a substantive existence so that it can be communicated as water into a vessel, thus virtually setting aside the reality of quickening and ignoring the truth that the Eternal Son who was in the form of God now lives as man.<a name=58:9></a> The fulness of the Godhead resides in Him bodily.<a name=58:10></a>

		As regards what you say as to John, I believe we.<a name=58:20></a> have there what is essentially heavenly, i.<a name=58:21></a>e.<a name=58:22></a>, what is out of heaven, and what is out of heaven is heavenly and cannot change its character.<a name=58:23></a> It does not bring before us the exaltation of man in virtue of redemption,

		as does Paul, but the moral excellence of what has come forth from heaven -- the living bread and the Father's love.<a name=59:1></a> Hence eternal life is to know the Father and Jesus Christ His sent One (not exactly His glorified One), and into all this heavenly grace which has come out of heaven we enter while we are here; but it does not lose its heavenly character; and by Christ's death we are free from the system in which flesh has its life.<a name=59:2></a> I think that to enter into and enjoy what is essentially heavenly, as having come thence, is greater privilege than to enter into the divine counsels which have their place in Christ in glory, which is more Paul's line.<a name=59:3></a> If a concordance were consulted I take it heaven would be more often found in John than in Paul, only with the former it is more what comes thence, but without changing its character, and with the latter, what goes there.<a name=59:4></a> This may be rough, but I think it gives the idea.<a name=59:5></a><hr>

		As regards your question as to the distinction between 'the kingdom of God' and 'the kingdom of heaven', the two expressions strike me as follows, viz.<a name=63:22></a>: the kingdom of God refers to the moral sway of God as such; a man must be born again to see or to enter into it.<a name=63:23></a> Our souls as christians are under the influence of what God is morally, as revealed in grace.<a name=63:24></a> Hence the Son could say when here, "the kingdom of God is among you", and we read in Romans that "the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".<a name=63:25></a> These are the portion of the soul under the moral sway of God.<a name=63:26></a> I think the tenth leper (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>) who returned to Jesus to give glory to God in a sense illustrates it.<a name=63:27></a> The kingdom of heaven refers (it appears to me) to constituted authority, as the Lord said, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth".<a name=63:28></a> It seems to carry out the principle indicated in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:17">Genesis  1:17</a>, 18, viz.<a name=63:29></a>, that the earth should be in the light and under the rule of heaven.<a name=63:30></a>

		I should not for one moment be inclined to contest the position that the word of Christ in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a> refers to His assembly in its full extent.<a name=65:2></a> It is that which He, rejected of His people, would build on the revelation and confession of Himself as the Son of the living God.<a name=65:3></a> Hence it takes in all saints from Pentecost to the coming of the Lord -- in other words, the whole period during which in our point of view the church has been on earth, and it will come out perfected in glory.<a name=65:4></a> But I cannot think that J.<a name=65:5></a>N.<a name=65:6></a>D.<a name=65:7></a> could have intended that we should find no present status for the assembly in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=65:8></a> On the contrary, I have often heard him identify <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>with <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>, and surely a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, is true of the saints now.<a name=65:9></a> In the same way the whole building, fitly framed together, grows to an holy temple in the Lord; but saints are already God's temple.<a name=65:10></a> They have that status and privilege.<a name=65:11></a> Though statements in Scripture may leave room for what may go on during an extended period, I doubt if it is the bearing in which truths are in general presented to us in the New Testament.<a name=65:12></a> I have heard it said that New Testament scriptures do not usually contemplate things beyond the lifetime of those addressed.<a name=65:13></a> The ten virgins who went forth to meet the Bridegroom are here when the Bridegroom comes.<a name=65:14></a> So the assembly that Christ builds would (as appears to me) have place here consequent on Christ's rejection, and the gates of hell could not prevail against it.<a name=65:15></a> The gates of hell are hardly in heaven.<a name=65:16></a> So that I think we are justified in taking our thought of Christ's assembly from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=65:17></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I have received your letter of 10th inst.<a name=72:4></a> and send a few lines in answer to it.<a name=72:5></a> As far as I have an understanding of Scripture on the subject, it seems to me that there is a measure of confusion between two things which are presented in distinctness in Scripture -- viz.<a name=72:6></a>, Eternal Life -- and the work of God in the soul by which eternal life is apprehended and entered on.<a name=72:7></a> The first of these (eternal life) as presented in Scripture comprises two essential elements, viz.<a name=72:8></a>, relief from death (morally or physically), and introduction into positive blessing ordained of God, earthly or heavenly.<a name=72:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>we see the earthly in the blessing commanded in Zion -- the restoration and unity of Israel -- in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a> the heavenly in the knowledge of the Father and the Son.<a name=72:10></a> It is evident that in either case there must be a state of soul produced in the saint suited for and corresponding to the blessing, and this is the work of God.<a name=72:11></a> For the christian we see the elements of this work in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:4">John  3:4</a>.<a name=72:12></a> They consist in new birth, faith, and a well of water in the believer.<a name=72:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) New birth -- for it is evident that God must begin, there being nothing in man to be trusted -- no anchoring ground so to say for truth.<a name=72:14></a>

		Thus we have the work of God in the believer by which, though still on earth, he enters into heavenly things -- eternal life.<a name=73:3></a> All this is, so to say, summed up in chapter 5, in which we find that the hour now is where the (spiritually) dead hear the voice of the Son of God, speaking in their souls, and they that have heard live -- and in chapter 6 we find the soul entering into eternal life in the enjoyment of the love expressed in the incarnation and death of the Son of man which has placed what is divine and heavenly within the reach of its appropriation (eating).<a name=73:4></a> Thus we have the truth of eternal life solved -- and now God abides in us and we in Him.<a name=73:5></a> There is, so to say, the reciprocity of life and spiritual affections as far as can be between God and a creature.<a name=73:6></a> I trust that the above may at any rate make my thought plain.<a name=73:7></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to send a few lines in answer to your letter, not as laying down the law on the subject on which you write -- but as giving you what seems to me to be the teaching of Scripture on the subject.<a name=77:9></a> I may begin by saying that if 'the communication of divine or spiritual life' in 'new birth' is understood to designate that initial and effectual work of the Spirit in the soul of man which forms the point of moral affinity with God, and is therefore the point of departure for any blessing into which that soul may be ultimately conducted, I should have no objection to the expression, and should not certainly quarrel with it -- though it is undeniable that Scripture does not speak of 'life' in direct and immediate connection with new birth -- thus in our doing so I think there is considerable danger of disconnecting life, in our thoughts, from the One in whom man is or can be justified -- and who as having borne the judgment of death that rested on man is now as last Adam a quickening Spirit towards men.<a name=77:10></a> I apprehend that though, in any case, man must be born again, yet that life connects itself now with faith in Christ's Person (as raised again for our justification)

		I am glad to send you a few lines in answer to your note.<a name=88:2></a> The idea of "spiritual" in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>is as to the question of perception, as evidently the mind of man is not competent in things entirely beyond the range of its powers, and hence the necessity of the spiritual man for entering into God's things.<a name=88:3></a> The thoughts connected with the "temple" and the "body" in 1 Corinthians are that they are privileges proper to christianity, and to which christians can therefore ever return.<a name=88:4></a> The truth of the temple (i.<a name=88:5></a>e.<a name=88:6></a>, of the Spirit being here) shuts out man as such as to all his importance, he is not to be gloried in; and the thought of the body brings in the positive place of the saints to be descriptive here, by His grace and gifts, of another Man -- the Christ.<a name=88:7></a> One man is put out, and another brought in.<a name=88:8></a> 1 Corinthians gives us the present responsible place of the saints.<a name=88:9></a> Ephesians shows us their place in the thoughts and counsel of God; hence everything begins from the Head and the body, and the temple is seen as going on to completion, and there is added in a kind of supplementary way the present status of saints as built together for a habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=88:10></a> 1 Corinthians takes in general the present responsible side of the truth and Ephesians the counsel side.<a name=88:11></a> <hr>

		The real point in the case is the question of <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:7">Philippians  2:7</a>.<a name=90:7></a> I really prefer the authorised version, for the expression 'emptied Himself' suggests to the English mind -- 'emptied of what?<a name=90:8></a>' and I question if this can be definitely answered.<a name=90:9></a>.<a name=90:10></a> .<a name=90:11></a>.<a name=90:12></a> I should not like, in the face of <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:58">John  8:58</a>, to say that He emptied Himself of the status of God.<a name=90:13></a> I am sure it is better left alone.<a name=90:14></a> But behind all this the question remains, Was Christ here as Man or as God?<a name=90:15></a> I am content to take the testimony of the apostles to Jew and gentile on which christianity was founded (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:22">Acts  2:22</a>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:32">Acts  13:32</a> - 39), and I need not say that they knew He was in Person divine, "The word became flesh", the Son revealing the Father; I think I am as distinct about that as any, and that adequate evidence of it was given; but none the less it remains true that His glory was veiled, and that He entered here into all that was suitable to man and to the servant, that God might be glorified in the Son of man, and I am not inclined to surrender this.<a name=90:16></a> I trust things may make for peace and not disturbance.<a name=90:17></a> I am content to be in the shade, and to wait on God.<a name=90:18></a> I know of no divergence of thought between myself and J.<a name=90:19></a>B.<a name=90:20></a>S.<a name=90:21></a> <hr>

		I think that in approaching the subject of atonement we must remember that of necessity Scripture regards man here on earth from God's standpoint, and that is with the sentence of death on him from God, and nothing could free him of that sentence save death having been borne for him.<a name=91:6></a> This has been effected in Christ, who has tasted death by the grace of God, and the blood is the witness that death has been suffered.<a name=91:7></a> Hence God can have to say to man here in grace.<a name=91:8></a> He sets forth Jesus a mercy-seat through faith in His blood.<a name=91:9></a> But then death, though the penalty resting on man here, is not the bearing of the wrath of God, for which sin calls, nor the real clearance of sin from before God, though without shedding of blood is no remission.<a name=91:10></a> Hence in the nature of things, I think we must distinguish between death and the wrath of God, which in man's case is the second death, the lake of fire.<a name=91:11></a> Now I believe that Christ in being made sin bore the wrath

		What I see is that the assembly is actually here both vitally and responsibly, that is, as Christ's body and God's house.<a name=94:9></a> All would allow that the body is here in completeness (co-extensive with the Spirit) and that christendom has the responsibility of the house, hence my objection to the assumption by any company of christians of assembly status, etc.<a name=94:10></a> Even in early days before ruin came in, I imagine that there were comparatively few who entered into the proper privilege of the church as united to Christ, and hence I can see no reason why those privileges should not be enjoyed by a few now, but they are spiritual and do not necessitate the assumption of assembly status; but I do not believe we could enjoy them but as having departed from iniquity.<a name=94:11></a> This is of all moment.<a name=94:12></a> As to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>, I believe it was spoken for the saints when the assembly was in order, but I judge it would stand equally good for two or three now in the truth of the assembly, and apart from evil in a day of ruin.<a name=94:13></a> We constantly and I should say rightly come together in the faith of it, but I doubt if it was intended to constitute the two or three "the assembly" as referred to in verse 17.<a name=94:14></a> It seems to me that verses 19 and 20 are a distinct point from verses 15 to 18.<a name=94:15></a>

		I will endeavour to answer your questions according to such light as I have.<a name=95:7></a> I think that in the history of a soul (I do not for the moment speak of new birth) the first thing is that it is enlightened, in other words it receives by faith the testimony of Christ, and has thus the place of a son before God (though not yet conscious of it), because God's purpose for us is sonship.<a name=95:8></a> I need hardly say that without a work of God in us we never should have received light.<a name=95:9></a> Thus the first step is gained.<a name=95:10></a> The soul is in the light of Christ, and in Christ in the eye of God.<a name=95:11></a> Then the Spirit is received by whom we cry, Abba, Father -- but as yet Christ has not been formed in us, but all is secured to us in the Spirit given, and we are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.<a name=95:12></a> The receiving of the Spirit is the proof that we are in Christ, God's seal on a man's faith.<a name=95:13></a> Then begins by God's power in us (which is well described in the two passages you quote from the Synopsis) a work by which a life, a character, a moral condition of being -- a new man is

		I have received your letter of November 10th, and am glad to reply to it.<a name=111:8></a> I am thankful that you have the little paper 'The Person of the Christ' -- and have found any profit in it.<a name=111:9></a> Some have found fault with it, but I am more and more convinced that it presents only what is substantially right.<a name=111:10></a> That others might have put the points better is likely enough, but they have not done so.<a name=111:11></a> My use of the term 'divine Person' in reference to our Lord was not from any lack of faith or sense on my part that He is God, but to avoid the idea of His being God in such an absolute and exclusive sense as to trench on the unity of the Godhead.<a name=111:12></a> That 'God is one' may be said to be the backbone of Scripture, but in the New Testament we have the additional light that in that unity are three Persons all equally divine, and I should speak of the Holy Spirit being a divine Person in the same way as I should speak of the Son being so.<a name=111:13></a> I have no doubt that you know something of Greek and that in the use of a noun as a predicate it makes a distinction by the use or omission of the article, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=112>[Page 112]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we cannot so well make in English.<a name=112:1></a> When a noun is used as a predicate and has the article the preposition is reciprocal and the subject and predicate may be reversed, for instance it says "sin is lawlessness" -- it may equally be said 'lawlessness is sin'.<a name=112:2></a> When, however, the article is not inserted before the predicate the predicate is characteristic, and the preposition is not reciprocal.<a name=112:3></a> This is the case in the expression "the Word was God", there is no article before God, God is characteristic of the Word but the expression is not reciprocal -- for if God were the Word you would exclude the Father and the Spirit from the thought of God, and thus set aside the unity of the Godhead.<a name=112:4></a> It is only in this sense that I would apply the term 'divine Person' to Christ, in the same way that I would apply it to the other persons of the Godhead, viewing each in His distinctiveness and yet with the sense in the soul that each is as truly and characteristically God as the others.<a name=112:5></a> The passages in my paper in which the term occurs would not admit of the substitution of 'God' in its place.<a name=112:6></a> For instance 'We have thus a divine Person presented' -- I mean here the particular person who became man.<a name=112:7></a> So too 'the truth of a divine Person assuming human condition' -- in neither sentence could I rightly say 'God'.<a name=112:8></a> The statement would not then be right.<a name=112:9></a> What I understand by 'God has been manifested in the flesh' is that all that God is (Father, Son and Spirit) has been set forth down here in words and works -- all the fulness was pleased to dwell in Christ.<a name=112:10></a> I do not think that Deity and divinity mean the same thing in common language -- the former applies exclusively to God as such.<a name=112:11></a> The latter is often used in a much more general sense as of writings, etc.<a name=112:12></a> I have no difficulty in saying that Jesus is God, but in the same way that I have referred to in the expression

		It is, I think, clear that the church is viewed in two lights -- as identified with Christ in the presence of the Father (all of one), He being Firstborn of many brethren, and as the vessel in which God sets forth the riches of His grace; and I think it is in this latter line that the thought of the body and the bride comes in.<a name=113:11></a> The church is Christ's fulness, and the vessel (in Him) in which God shows the exceeding riches of His grace.<a name=113:12></a> Jew and gentile are reconciled to God in one body, but they are also one new man created in Christ Jesus.<a name=113:13></a> Christianity, as in the thought of God, becomes increasingly wonderful to me, and I can fully echo the thought that one is only in the infancy of it.<a name=113:14></a> Had it been maintained according to God, what a wonderful thing it would have been in the world!<a name=113:15></a> Certainly it was wiser on the part of the enemy to corrupt rather than to oppose it.<a name=113:16></a> <hr>

		My Dear Brother, -- I was very glad to have your letter of January 2nd and to hear that you were once again safe in Orange.<a name=128:16></a> Both Glenny and myself were much interested in your account of things in Australia which is as satisfactory as I expected to hear; I fancy that your estimate of brethren out there is just.<a name=128:17></a> I have not seen in those who have printed or written much evidence of originality or of spiritual apprehension of

		<a name=134>[Page 134]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		an equivalent of 'new birth', which has not the same force.<a name=134:1></a> The form which quickening takes at the present time is in (the power of) an indwelling Spirit.<a name=134:2></a> The Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, "It is the Spirit that quickens".<a name=134:3></a> I could say in principle of every one that has received the Spirit that he is quickened, but I think that quickening in the real power of it is rather in what the Spirit effects in a man (when received) than in the mere fact of the reception of the Spirit.<a name=134:4></a> In Paul's writings it is said only to the Colossians and Ephesians "you hath he quickened".<a name=134:5></a> In John's the Father and the Son and the Spirit are all said to quicken but it must be in oneness of action.<a name=134:6></a> In result it makes the subject of it alive in a position and state in which he was not before, and thus anticipates what will take place in the coming of the Lord; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:22">1 Corinthians  15:22</a>.<a name=134:7></a> This will show how far it goes beyond the thought of new birth.<a name=134:8></a> As regards the other point, the place of children in the meeting, we have fought strongly in England against their being made to sit outside the board.<a name=134:9></a> It is certain to me that in baptising them we recognise that they belong to the Lord and so to the congregation.<a name=134:10></a> They are not unclean but holy.<a name=134:11></a> Outwardly we come together as the congregation, and the place of the children is with the parents.<a name=134:12></a> Many who do not see baptism for their children recognise this, and I should be very sorry for any arrangement that went against it.<a name=134:13></a> On the other hand I would not put children outside because their parents do not see baptism.<a name=134:14></a> I do not care for running principles to extremes in such a way.<a name=134:15></a> After long labour at Hull I hope that things there may be approaching a solution, but Klein and his work there have been much in the way of it.<a name=134:16></a> Many are carried away with the excitement of revivalistic work, instead of being exercised as to putting their house in order.<a name=134:17></a> We had a letter from Glenny from Aden.<a name=134:18></a> He was

		My Dear Brother, -- On Saturday evening a brother whom I had known in times past, named Allinson, from Sheffield, called on me.<a name=149:13></a> He would not shake hands as, he said, he was out of fellowship.<a name=149:14></a> In course of conversation he told me that some eighteen months ago he had been asked to sit outside on the supposition of unrighteousness in regard to his business -- but that this being proved to be groundless he was afterwards put out of fellowship on a charge of railing -- he says further that he does not know in what the charge consists, and wrote in October last asking for information, but has had no answer to his letter.<a name=149:15></a> Can you tell me if there is any ground for withholding this information?<a name=149:16></a> I do not know if I should have written in the matter, but for knowing something of yourself.<a name=149:17></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am very sorry to have been so long in answering your letter, but have been for three weeks very poorly, and unable to apply myself to anything.<a name=151:2></a> In regard to the opening of John's gospel, I do not know that I can say much more than I have said in the little paper in the 'Food'.<a name=151:3></a> All appears to me to depend on the standpoint from which the evangelist regards Christ.<a name=151:4></a> If, as I judge from verse 14, John is writing from the point of the apostle's apprehension, and the term 'Word' conveys what Christ was in their thought, there the passage is simple enough.<a name=151:5></a> The One commonly known and designated as 'the Word' is traced back to His true source, "He was with God and was God", and, being such, He became flesh.<a name=151:6></a> It is, in a word, His genealogy.<a name=151:7></a> I am very much inclined to doubt if any presentation of Christ is intended in the passage in any light in which the apostles had not apprehended Him when on earth.<a name=151:8></a> By 'intelligent' I understand, as you say, the mind that thinks, and by 'intelligible', the expression of that mind, the latter is essential to the idea of Word.<a name=151:9></a> I am thankful to say that we are all nicely on the mend.<a name=151:10></a> Hope you are well and remain,

		In reference to above notice, at an interview with the two most prominent brothers (Tunks and House) responsible for it, it was emphatically stated: that it was never meant as an assembly judgment or supposed to have the force or endorsement of the gathering and that it was meant to be an authoritative dictum of brothers to close up finally what was ever a source of disunion and scandal, claiming that a brothers' meeting was a tribunal contemplated in Scripture for just such a purpose and this on the ground of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>and the passage in 1 Corinthians where it speaks of the least esteemed judging between brethren -- and others supposed to be equally to the point.<a name=154:13></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to answer to the best of my ability your enquiry.<a name=168:12></a> The difficulty is in that we use words in a loose way, and often Scripture words with a sense not quite in accord with that in which they are used there.<a name=168:13></a> I have looked up the word 'sanctuary' and find that in the Old Testament it means 'chapel, hallowed place, holy place'.<a name=168:14></a> This evidently conveys the idea that it meant that which was, so to say, enclosed.<a name=168:15></a> David was charged to build a house for the sanctuary.<a name=168:16></a> In the New Testament there is no distinct word for sanctuary, it is simply an adaptation of the adjective 'holy'.<a name=168:17></a> The plural word indicates the 'holiest'.<a name=168:18></a> In regard to the word 'temple', two words are employed, namely, one signifying the whole including the courts, and another signifying the building.<a name=168:19></a> These words are used carefully and never confounded.<a name=168:20></a> It is clear that the
	</div>

		<a name=169>[Page 169]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sanctuary answered to the latter view of the temple.<a name=169:1></a> Hence we cannot take the temple and sanctuary as synonymous.<a name=169:2></a> My impression is that the sanctuary is presented to us objectively, as that into which we enter: we are not spoken of as being the sanctuary, as we are of being the temple.<a name=169:3></a> We are not the holiest.<a name=169:4></a> I imagine that that is the revelation of God and of His will in Christ.<a name=169:5></a> Evidently in Hebrews the idea is objective.<a name=169:6></a> Yet we are said to be the temple, and that in the sense of the actual building.<a name=169:7></a> The conclusion to which one is compelled to come is that there were two ideas in the temple, one as the sanctuary, and the other as where God dwells among men, so as to put Himself in touch with them.<a name=169:8></a> We retreat into the sanctuary, and there learn the secret of God: this thought comes out frequently.<a name=169:9></a> On the other hand, the temple is where God puts Himself in touch with men.<a name=169:10></a> In times of distress in Israel faith was taught to look to God's holy temple.<a name=169:11></a> This thought is realised in the church, the Spirit of God dwells there.<a name=169:12></a> As you say, 'house' is a more general idea, and consists of those that have access to God's courts, and thus come under His discipline.<a name=169:13></a> The temple is a type of the church as a building, but I cannot quite see the tabernacle is this, it refers more exclusively to Christ.<a name=169:14></a> I do not know whether the above is plain but I trust that it will serve to make plain what is in my mind in regard to a very interesting point.<a name=169:15></a> I hope that you are well, and remain, with love in the Lord.<a name=169:16></a>

		I think that the action of Phinehas in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#25">Numbers  25</a>was hardly in itself a priestly act, for Moses commanded the judges of Israel to take the heads of those that sinned, and I do not suppose that these judges were priests.<a name=172:6></a> But if what Phinehas did was not a priestly act, it was one that could only be done with the same readiness by a priest, for none but a priest would have seized the gravity of the moment in the same way.<a name=172:7></a> It is the man that is in the enjoyment of access to God who is alive to the moment and what it calls for.<a name=172:8></a> It proved that Phinehas was a true priest, and therefore the priesthood is confirmed to him by an everlasting covenant.<a name=172:9></a> It was the same with the tribe of Levi.<a name=172:10></a> They acted for God in a critical moment, not in any way connected with their peculiar function, but in a way that proved their fidelity to God, and to the best interests of the people, and therefore their privilege is confirmed to them.<a name=172:11></a> What tended, at that time, to corrupt Israel was evil associations, through the counsel of Balaam, and this kind of thing has been repeated in the experience of the church.<a name=172:12></a> It was so with the Corinthians, and the apostle detected it.<a name=172:13></a> It was really because he was in the reality of priesthood that he had discernment of that which was working to corrupt, and he takes action accordingly.<a name=172:14></a> This was hardly priestly work only, it was because the apostle was a priest that he had perception of the effect that the evil would have on the people.<a name=172:15></a> I have thought that the two things that mark a priest are access, and consequent on that, discernment.<a name=172:16></a> The one naturally follows on the other, but any action one might have to take consequent on discernment might not have a distinctly priestly character, for it might be a question of common responsibility.<a name=172:17></a> The detection and exposure of the evil is the real point and this power

		intention of a brother to lay stress on the intensely moral force of the expression 'Word of God' in its use in Scripture, in contrast to the formal liberal thought, or on the contrast between revelation and inspiration, I could sympathise with him, but this would in no wise deny that the Scripture is the Word of God.<a name=185:1></a> It is probably the fact that there never was any revelation of God or of His mind that was made directly through Scripture.<a name=185:2></a> In the earliest, God spoke on mount Sinai, or to Moses from off the mercy-seat, then holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, then the Word of God came to John the baptist in the wilderness, then He whom God sent spoke the words of God, for God gave not the Spirit by measure to Him, then the mystery was made known to the apostles and prophets by the Spirit.<a name=185:3></a> The true idea of revelation is the direct communication of God's mind to man without the intervention of any agency.<a name=185:4></a> And in the present time the truth is maintained here by the Spirit of truth.<a name=185:5></a> God in His mercy has been pleased to give an inspired record of His communications, and of the circumstances in which they came, and the effects produced by them, and this as being inspired and authoritative is the Word of God and cannot be broken; but this cannot set aside the living way in which God has seen fit to put Himself in communication with men, especially in 'the Son'.<a name=185:6></a> I only throw this out as possibly the meaning of the brother to whom you refer, though I have no idea who it may be, and do not intend to hold myself responsible for his statements, but only suggest what may have underlain his thoughts.<a name=185:7></a> May the good Lord give us grace to follow the things that make for peace and whereby we may edify one another.<a name=185:8></a>

		There is much that is interesting in the distinction drawn in General H.<a name=211:12></a>'s letters in the Indian extracts, but it seems to me that what I would call the moral element is wanting in the force which he attaches to both the words psuche and zoe, and to the latter he gives, I judge, a too exclusively objective import.<a name=211:13></a>

		Psuche appears to me to be the actual living principle in a creature which animates the body, and uses it as a vehicle.<a name=212:1></a> Hence it is common between man and the brute creation -- the difference with man being that psuche was in his case derived from the breath of God, and was therefore a living soul with moral elements and characteristics, and hence immortal.<a name=212:2></a> A character of responsibility also attached to it, and inseparable from this is the idea of individuality.<a name=212:3></a> Every man has his own soul, and soul is commonly used for person and to imply individuality.<a name=212:4></a> "The soul that sinneth it shall die".<a name=212:5></a> Zoe on the other hand, though employed in more senses than one, is a general idea, not in itself conveying the idea of individuality.<a name=212:6></a> We can speak of our life or life in general.<a name=212:7></a> I may be mistaken, but my impression is that, like light, life is employed relatively in Scripture, i.<a name=212:8></a>e.<a name=212:9></a>, in actual or implied contrast to death.<a name=212:10></a> Now death comes before us in two aspects, viz.<a name=212:11></a>, moral and actual, hence we read "has annulled death and brought to light life and incorruptibility" -- death here meaning distance from God and the power of the devil.<a name=212:12></a> In another scripture we have "Son, thou in thy lifetime".<a name=212:13></a> Here life is evidently the period of a man's natural life on earth, bounded by and closing in death or dissolution.<a name=212:14></a> Zoe is evidently, therefore, used both in a moral and actual sense.<a name=212:15></a> Now in the vast proportion of cases in which zoe is employed in the New Testament its force is undoubtedly moral.<a name=212:16></a> It is unquestionably used for life in the subjective sense, as "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=212:17></a> Men saw One in whom was (morally) the life of God, and those who followed Him had the light of life.<a name=212:18></a> Hence I can well understand the thought of life being communicated to a soul: it is quickened, i.<a name=212:19></a>e.<a name=212:20></a>, made to live in the appreciation and enjoyment of another (the Son), and it is said having

		I would like to make a few remarks in the hope of elucidating a passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>which sometimes presents a difficulty to the minds of christians -- "A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh".<a name=251:5></a> It appears to me evident that the 'flesh' is brought in here instrumentally as the means by which the way has been made.<a name=251:6></a> The flesh served as a 'veil' in the case of Christ, hiding from men's eyes the glory of God which was present in Him, until the time came of His death, in which the love of God was fully declared.<a name=251:7></a> Short of the cross there was not the full declaration of God's love.<a name=251:8></a> "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=251:9></a> On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that they who are to approach still have sin in them, and are in mind naturally legal.<a name=251:10></a> They are not perfect in themselves.<a name=251:11></a> Now both these difficulties are met in the way of entering the holiest.<a name=251:12></a> The answer to the first is in the blood of Jesus, the witness as before God of death -- the removal of the man that was unsuitable to Him through sin, in the righteous One; while the answer to the second is in the new and living way which Christ has made in the revelation to us

		The Head is mentioned first because the ground of reconciliation existed, and the members of the body were to enter into the fact, or "Christ in you the hope of glory" would not be true of them.<a name=280:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So each member is to accept the blessedness of what Christ has done, and to accept the suitability in which he is regarded by God, this is, as suitable to Him, not only accepted (for I might in grace accept a thing not altogether suitable to me), but regarded positively suitable, and the blessedness of what Christ has done could not stop short of making me suitable.<a name=280:9></a> I am to accept this and to enter into the meaning of it.<a name=280:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God looks upon the whole body with a perfect complacency, and each member is to enter into it in the displacement of all that is inconsistent; putting off the old man in very fact, we lose sight of self and as we do we come to one man presented to the soul by God -- "by him to reconcile all things to himself".<a name=280:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From knowing this the soul is encouraged to turn to account so much grace, and leaving those things which are behind and which once held me so that my feet were spiritually in fetters.<a name=281:5></a> I now press toward the mark and count all natural advantages but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.<a name=281:6></a> Thus having begun by losing sight of myself in Another, the things which helped to keep me back I lose sight of, also other things now present themselves to draw me on.<a name=281:7></a>

		We have in these three passages three distinct incidents in the life of the apostle John.<a name=282:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first, the Lord's call is evident.<a name=282:11></a> James and John are attracted to Jesus; and feeling this attraction, they abandon their nets and leave their father Zebedee in the boat.<a name=282:12></a>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second, John is leaning on Jesus' breast, and in the sense of His love, the beloved disciple has the consciousness of the Lord's affection.<a name=283:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the third, the apostle falls as dead at the feet of Jesus, struck by His majesty.<a name=283:2></a> But the Lord lays His right hand upon him, saying, "Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=283:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now apply these grand truths to ourselves.<a name=283:4></a> The beginning of our christian path is attraction to Jesus.<a name=283:5></a> He calls us; we are attracted to His blessed Person, and thus we leave all to follow Him.<a name=283:6></a> In our case, we leave all that is perishable in this world to follow the blessed Saviour.<a name=283:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, secondly, we find out that He loves us.<a name=283:8></a> He makes us feel His love toward us.<a name=283:9></a> No doubt the full expression of His love to us is seen in the cross, but He would have us to feel His love now.<a name=283:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To make an application of the third incident to our own case, we must think of death.<a name=283:11></a> If the Lord come not first, we shall fall asleep, and so this passage may be taken figuratively.<a name=283:12></a> But He will raise us up with His mighty right hand.<a name=283:13></a> He is the resurrection and the life; He has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel.<a name=283:14></a> Death is conquered, and Jesus, who holds the keys of death and hades, will know where to find our souls and bodies in the day of resurrection.<a name=283:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This third incident, then, is a figure of the crowning joy and triumph of those who have been attracted to Jesus, and kept in the sense of His love.<a name=283:16></a> They shall rise and be glorified to be with Him for ever.<a name=283:17></a>

		What strikes one as the great witness of the Scriptures being the Word of the living God is the one great voice that is speaking all through them in powerful moral accents.<a name=292:5></a> It is evidently from beginning to end the same voice, speaking different things, but never things that are really inconsistent with one another.<a name=292:6></a> It is a mighty voice with no uncertain sound, always addressing itself to men.<a name=292:7></a> Had sin not come into the world there might not have been the necessity for this voice to speak, but since the time that man departed from God this voice has never been silent.<a name=292:8></a> This voice will at times address the most solemn questions to man, questions which man must at some point or other furnish an answer.<a name=292:9></a> It may be well to consider the earliest of such questions, which indicated an estrangement of man from God.<a name=292:10></a> The first is that addressed by God to Adam, when the latter had in the sense of shame hid himself from the voice of the Lord God in the trees of the garden in which God had placed him.<a name=292:11></a> It was a very pertinent question "Where art thou?<a name=292:12></a>" Nothing could be more strange than that the man that God had just created should be hiding himself from God.<a name=292:13></a> It indicated an immense moral revolution in the man.<a name=292:14></a> And it was a very poor answer
