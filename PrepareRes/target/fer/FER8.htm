		THE CARDINAL FEATURES OF CHRISTIANITY

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to say a word trusting that the Lord may use it to lead us on a little into the apprehension of what may be described as the cardinal features of Christianity.<a name=1:1></a> There are two most important and characteristic truths in Christianity, the one is a new man in a new place, and the other, that the Spirit is given.<a name=1:2></a> What the Galatians did was to slip away from the first, and with that they were disregarding and ignoring to a great extent the presence of the Spirit here.<a name=1:3></a> The two truths are bound together, for we can know nothing whatever about the new man and the new place except by the Spirit.<a name=1:4></a> More than that, I do not see how the truth of a new man in a new place could come out while the Lord was here on earth, nor until He had passed out of our place of responsibility.<a name=1:5></a> Nothing <i>fully</i> came out until Christ was entirely separated by death from us and from our place.<a name=1:6></a> Then the truth came out by the Holy Spirit, the cardinal truth of Christianity, a new man in a new place; and the Spirit came down from that place to form us down here for that place.<a name=1:7></a> That is what I understand to be the true character of Christianity.<a name=1:8></a>

		I desire if the Lord enable me to enlarge a little on this chapter.<a name=1:9></a> In this and the two succeeding ones we have three points especially to be noticed.<a name=1:10></a> The great point in chapter 3 is that the curse is gone and that the blessing of Abraham has come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus.<a name=1:11></a> In the next chapter we get liberty.<a name=1:12></a> Until you know the blessing you know nothing about liberty.<a name=1:13></a> "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=1:14></a> Then in the succeeding chapter we have

		walk, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit".<a name=2:1></a> We are dependent on the Spirit at every point and can get nothing apart from the Spirit.<a name=2:2></a> Liberty lies in the Spirit, there is none apart from Him.<a name=2:3></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=2:4></a> So the apostle exhorts in chapter 5, "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free", and in the latter part of the same chapter we have "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh".<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point then is that the blessing of Abraham has come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus.<a name=2:6></a> What for?<a name=2:7></a> "That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith".<a name=2:8></a> I do not think the blessing of Abraham goes beyond the thought of justification.<a name=2:9></a> That is what is referred to, that we might be justified before God.<a name=2:10></a> But the point is this, we are justified that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, and when we come to the closing part of the chapter we see how it works out.<a name=2:11></a> In verse 23 we read "Before faith came we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<a name=2:12></a> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith".<a name=2:13></a> What follows?<a name=2:14></a> "Ye are all God's sons"; all sons of God "by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=2:15></a> "In Christ Jesus" marks our place.<a name=2:16></a> "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.<a name=2:17></a> And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise".<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus the place and state and inheritance of those justified.<a name=2:19></a> Now beloved friends, the first thing is, Christ Jesus is the new Man in the new place.<a name=2:20></a> The beginning of the truth is that He came into our place, not only to bear our judgment, but that He might glorify God in that place.<a name=2:21></a> The cross was not the place of man's responsibility, but the earth.<a name=2:22></a> Christ came to glorify God on the earth.<a name=2:23></a> That is the first thing in

	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel for myself how poorly one can speak of it.<a name=4:13></a> The end was that the "blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith".<a name=4:14></a> The barrier between Jew and Gentile is broken down, the Gentiles are completely relieved.<a name=4:15></a> The judgment of death was universal, the curse was limited to those under the law; but in the removal of it the blessing of Abraham has come to the Gentiles.<a name=4:16></a> This is justification.<a name=4:17></a> We are relieved of the burden of judgment lying on man.<a name=4:18></a> So long as Christ was here, the barrier remained, but in His death it is gone, and now the blessing of Abraham has reached us, and the Gentile

		Do you know what it is to be a son of God?<a name=5:10></a> We talk of relationship, but we are apt to take too much from human analogy.<a name=5:11></a> It is to be the object of God's love; that is "In Him we stand".<a name=5:12></a> Does anybody ask me where my place is?<a name=5:13></a> I answer in the love of God.<a name=5:14></a> I am the object of His love and formed by it.<a name=5:15></a> I am more and more convinced we are all formed by the place in which grace has set us.<a name=5:16></a> If the grace of God has set us in the love of God, we are formed by that love, and He looks for us to be formed thus.<a name=5:17></a> Why are we so little formed?<a name=5:18></a> Because we have so little sense of the place.<a name=5:19></a> If we knew, in our souls, the good of the gospel in the light of the love of God, that love would be far more formative through the Holy Spirit in us.<a name=5:20></a> If in the place, I must have the enjoyment of the place; and you have not only a title, but you are in the place; and if in the place you are formed by it.<a name=5:21></a> Formed in the ways of heaven, and it is a great place to be in, not only in the acceptance, but in the love revealed in Christ; a place man was never in before till Christ

		The next verse brings in our state "For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ".<a name=6:12></a> It is what we are with God in Christ, all one.<a name=6:13></a> Why?<a name=6:14></a> Because we all have one common Spirit of life.<a name=6:15></a> We have our individualities, but not different Spirits.<a name=6:16></a> All one power of life, all alive in the Spirit, for we have all received the same Spirit, and therefore we are one in Christ Jesus.<a name=6:17></a> I know as long as we are down here we cannot get wholly out of earthly distinctions, but in what we possess in Christ, we are all one, because we have all one Spirit.<a name=6:18></a> Then "if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise".<a name=6:19></a> Now we come to the lower thing, the inheritance.<a name=6:20></a> Sonship is greater than inheritance, though that will never so appear to one who does not know sonship.<a name=6:21></a> It is the greatest thing with God.<a name=6:22></a> What is the meaning of sonship?<a name=6:23></a> You are the objects of the love of God.<a name=6:24></a> The next chapter brings out

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not touch on the latter part of this chapter, it shows us the way in which the Spirit of God connects Himself with the experience of the saints.<a name=8:1></a> I desire to say a word, looking to the Lord to enable me, in reference to the Spirit, and in connection with what I sought to speak on two afternoons since, what is really the essential truth of Christianity; a new man in a new scene.<a name=8:2></a> I did not say much then as to the Spirit.<a name=8:3></a> Here we have the office of the Spirit in us as individuals, to make good <i>in</i> us that which is already true <i>of</i> us, before God.<a name=8:4></a> I do not say one word this afternoon as to what is corporate or collective, only as to what is individual.<a name=8:5></a> It has often been remarked as to the epistle to the Romans, that it never goes beyond what is individual for the Christian.<a name=8:6></a> The apostle takes up the Christian in his individuality, and carries that thought through the epistle.<a name=8:7></a> In other places we get the Christian circle, and what the Christian is as united to Christ.<a name=8:8></a> I would make one remark more, every epistle without exception I believe assumes the complete work of God in the Christian in principle.<a name=8:9></a> Every Christian does not know it.<a name=8:10></a> The epistles are not given us to <i>explain</i> the work of God, they <i>assume</i> the work of God.<a name=8:11></a> Every Christian is regarded as justified and as having the Holy Spirit, and is by the Holy Spirit united to Christ.<a name=8:12></a> Every epistle assumes that, but the object of the epistle is to make practically good <i>in</i> souls what is already true of them in principle before God.<a name=8:13></a> As I said, not to teach the work of God, it assumes that.<a name=8:14></a> The epistles are all written to Christians, to those who had everything God confers; forgiveness of sins, justification, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and if I have the Holy Spirit I get no more from God.<a name=8:15></a>

		Henceforth, all is the work of the Holy Spirit in me.<a name=9:1></a> To anyone who understands what Christianity is, this is an important point.<a name=9:2></a> There is another point I would mention, and I trust nobody will be startled by it; that is, that Christianity is not a system of actualities, it is a system of realities, but not of actualities.<a name=9:3></a> As to the positive side of it, it is a system of actualities in Christ, and of faith in us by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:4></a> People who try to turn Christianity as to our side into actualities, get on to a kind of millennial ground which is not the truth.<a name=9:5></a> To saints on the earth during the millennium the blessing of God will be in actuality, but Christian blessing is not actuality but is reality to faith by the Holy Spirit; and I believe anybody who accepts that will find it a great help in understanding the Scriptures.<a name=9:6></a> It leads on to what I have to say as to the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:7></a> In the passage before us we have the Holy Spirit presented to us in three aspects -- for deliverance, for life, for sonship.<a name=9:8></a> I ask anybody who would tell me that Christianity is a system of actualities, whether for all sense of deliverance, life, and sonship, he is not entirely dependent on the Spirit?<a name=9:9></a> Could you tell me then that Christianity is a system of actualities while you are entirely dependent on the Spirit for all sense of what it is?<a name=9:10></a> I think there are many Christians who know little or nothing about sonship.<a name=9:11></a> They may have received everything God can confer upon them, but they are not in faith, and therefore do not understand.<a name=9:12></a> I am not saying the Spirit is not in them, but they are not in the <i>power</i> of the Spirit, and outside of that power we can know nothing at all about sonship.<a name=9:13></a> It does not belong to earth, "Ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=9:14></a> Therefore it is not a blessing connected with earth, it belongs to heaven.<a name=9:15></a> I get into the reality of it on earth, just as far as I am in the power of the Spirit of sonship.<a name=9:16></a> The apostle in announcing the truth says, "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=9:17></a>

		Then afterwards he says, "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.<a name=10:1></a> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=10:2></a> That is, we cry, "Abba, Father", exactly in proportion as we are under the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:3></a> Now, beloved brethren, what I say is immensely important, and why?<a name=10:4></a> Because christendom has practically put out the Holy Spirit.<a name=10:5></a> I know they cannot do it actually, but practically they have.<a name=10:6></a> Look at the dark days of christendom and see how the Holy Spirit was put out; He had little or no place with men, and in the present day what does the prayer for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit mean, but practical unbelief in His presence here?<a name=10:7></a> But the true secret is unbelief in Christ's Person.<a name=10:8></a> If there was real faith in Christ, the presence of the Holy Spirit would be known.<a name=10:9></a> But when you see the Holy Spirit thus practically displaced by christendom, it is no great wonder if people do not enter into the character of the Christian's place.<a name=10:10></a> It is important to insist upon the presence of the Holy Spirit with the saints.<a name=10:11></a>

		I desire just to say a few words on these three points in the passage I have read, the Spirit for deliverance, the Spirit for life, and the Spirit for sonship.<a name=10:12></a> In the second verse of the chapter we read "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death", and in verse 10, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness".<a name=10:13></a> And in verse 14, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God".<a name=10:14></a> Now just think what are the three things necessary to you as Christians.<a name=10:15></a> You first want deliverance, then life, and with that sonship, and you get all in the Spirit.<a name=10:16></a> First, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from

		the law of sin and death".<a name=11:1></a> Now life in Christ Jesus is to my mind an objective thought.<a name=11:2></a> What the expression reveals to me is this, that before God, there is a complete new order of life in man in a new scene, life in Christ Jesus.<a name=11:3></a> We can understand what life in man down here is.<a name=11:4></a> It really is death morally.<a name=11:5></a> Talk of life in this world, while the sentence of death is upon man!<a name=11:6></a> For the Christian, Christ has "annulled death, and brought life, and incorruptibility to light through the gospel".<a name=11:7></a> What hinders entering into life is because people are not free of death.<a name=11:8></a> The two things must go together, but nine out of ten do not realise the fact that death is the judgment of God upon man.<a name=11:9></a> The infidel says, Yes, he must die, but man was ever mortal.<a name=11:10></a> He thus denies the moral aspect of death, and proves what a fool he is, for when you look at death in its connection with relationships down here, it is evident man does not die as the beast.<a name=11:11></a> Death breaks up the whole system of human relationships here with the affections proper to them, and brings a whole course of serious changes in its train, and yet you deny any moral aspect of death in connection with God.<a name=11:12></a> You accept the moral aspect of death in relationships down here, and know that when a beast dies there is nothing of the kind, and yet refuse to accept it in connection with God.<a name=11:13></a> Death is the judgment of God upon man.<a name=11:14></a> It is not that men were made to die, or pass away by natural dissolution.<a name=11:15></a> It is the sentence of God upon man by reason of sin, and until free of death he does not enter into life.<a name=11:16></a> It is not to get rid of death in its actuality, but we pass out of death into life.<a name=11:17></a>

		I desire to say a word in reference to one point which has been before us this morning.<a name=16:1></a> It is in connection with the subject of these chapters -- namely, deliverance.<a name=16:2></a> The point I want to refer to for a moment is that it is of the very essence of Christianity that you must 'change your man'.<a name=16:3></a> I have no doubt whatever that we are all hindered through failing to apprehend the first lesson impressed upon us in connection with the wilderness.<a name=16:4></a> It is of vital moment to apprehend that we must change our man, the simple reason for that being that God has changed the man before Him.<a name=16:5></a> Scripture presents to us two men; that is a truth so familiar that there is no question about it; and my point is that God is no longer testing the first man, but has revealed the second.<a name=16:6></a> He has changed the man.<a name=16:7></a> I think that comes out in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=16:8></a> People talk about this chapter and about death in connection with it, but they do not understand its bearing.<a name=16:9></a> I believe the object is to show how death is effected in us.<a name=16:10></a> We do not apprehend what it is to die except as we apprehend the Man that is before God; therefore we must change our man.<a name=16:11></a> There is no doubt about what God has done, and what He has done with regard to us.<a name=16:12></a> Our old man has been crucified with Christ.<a name=16:13></a> Then of necessity we change our man.<a name=16:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will try to draw the contrast for one instant between chapters 5 and 6.<a name=17:2></a> In chapter 5 Christ is viewed entirely, and the Spirit, too, on the divine side.<a name=17:3></a> We have expressed in Christ and in the Spirit the attitude in which God is toward the Christian.<a name=17:4></a> Everything comes to the Christian through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=17:5></a> He is presented as the last Adam, through whom all the grace of God is ministered to us, and it is remarkable that even the Spirit of God is brought in, in the same way as on God's side: "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit".<a name=17:6></a> It is the only allusion to the Spirit in that chapter.<a name=17:7></a> You run down the chapter at your leisure and find how everything comes to us from God, and all through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=17:8></a> It is the last Adam come in.<a name=17:9></a> If I want to know what God is to the whole believing family I have to learn it in the One who is Head to the family.<a name=17:10></a> I have sometimes said, though it is not always accepted, that I would not admit that the child could be greater than his father -- that is, as before God.<a name=17:11></a> It is not the way of God, for properly the child derives all from his father.<a name=17:12></a> What God is to the head He is to the family.<a name=17:13></a> With the head (Adam) of the human family came in sin and the judgment of death, and sin and death became true to the whole family.<a name=17:14></a> So also if I want to know what is true to the believer I have to learn what is established in the Head, the last Adam.<a name=17:15></a> We learn thus in chapter 5 what God is toward the believer through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=17:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 6 we are on different ground altogether.<a name=17:17></a> Christ is brought in as second Man, not as last Adam.<a name=17:18></a> The same divine Person, but in another aspect.<a name=17:19></a> In connection with this you have to change your man;

		the second Man is to fill the vision of the Christian.<a name=18:1></a> I not only have to learn that I am superseded in God's sight, but I am superseded in my own sight -- a much more difficult thing.<a name=18:2></a> I am not very apt at illustrations, but I can give you one from Scripture.<a name=18:3></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the woman of Samaria was superseded in her own sight; she went to the men of the city and said, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?<a name=18:4></a>" The proof to me that it was so is in her boldness in going to the men of the city.<a name=18:5></a> If her vision had not been filled by another I do not believe she would have thought for a moment of doing what she did.<a name=18:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two points on which I touch in connection with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=18:7></a> We have there Christ entered in as man in resurrection to the perfect, eternal satisfaction of God, and in divine acceptance.<a name=18:8></a> These two points I want to dwell on for a moment.<a name=18:9></a> Christ has entered in as man on the ground of the work He has accomplished for God's glory as typified in the burnt-offering.<a name=18:10></a> He fills the eye of God.<a name=18:11></a> He is "raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=18:12></a> One could not find a stronger expression.<a name=18:13></a> He has entered into perfect acceptance with God on that ground.<a name=18:14></a> "He lives to God".<a name=18:15></a> People say, Did not He ever live to God?<a name=18:16></a> Of course He did, but it is not simply a question here of Himself in His personal perfectness.<a name=18:17></a> The point is that He lives to God in connection with having died to sin.<a name=18:18></a> How otherwise could we live to God?<a name=18:19></a> Because the point of the chapter is to pave the way for the family to come in.<a name=18:20></a> He "lives to God" on ground on which we can come in with Him.<a name=18:21></a>

		I have sometimes thought that the chapter presents to us the idea of the tree of life, but there is one difficulty to my mind.<a name=18:22></a> There is the thought in Scripture in connection with the tree of life that it is, so to say, indigenous -- it is proper to the scene in which it is.<a name=18:23></a> The tree of life was proper to Eden; when you

		get it again it is in another scene to which it is proper -- the paradise of God.<a name=19:1></a> Christ is there the tree of life.<a name=19:2></a> But you get the principle, I think, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=19:3></a> A Man has come in who has perfectly solved the question of good and evil, unvaryingly maintaining the good in the presence of evil.<a name=19:4></a> He has put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself; He has been raised again from the dead, and to man is now the tree of life.<a name=19:5></a> You have the whole question of the two trees settled, and in this chapter you have the One who is the tree of life to the Christian, in the divine, eternal satisfaction in which man is as raised from the dead.<a name=19:6></a> That is God's man.<a name=19:7></a> He lives unto God.<a name=19:8></a> That brings in the thought of acceptance.<a name=19:9></a> I ask you to carry your mind back to the moment when Christ rose from the dead.<a name=19:10></a> Do you not think He came out from the dead to the infinite satisfaction of the Father, and that He entered into the acceptance that was due to Him on the ground of the work He had accomplished for God's glory?<a name=19:11></a> That is the ground for us.<a name=19:12></a> But I do not think anyone will accept it unless he is delighted with the Man who has entered in upon that ground.<a name=19:13></a> When it is accepted we reckon ourselves dead to sin.<a name=19:14></a> We part company with the first man because we are satisfied with the second Man.<a name=19:15></a> It is a hard lesson.<a name=19:16></a> I know it as well as anybody.<a name=19:17></a> It is a long time before we learn it.<a name=19:18></a> We are superseded in our own sight by another; and He is the One who has entered in to the eternal satisfaction of God.<a name=19:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just a word further.<a name=19:20></a> In chapter 6 I think sin is regarded as the great dominating principle in the first man.<a name=19:21></a> I part company with that man because now the thought in my soul is to join the One who has died to sin and who lives to God.<a name=19:22></a> In chapter 7 is another point -- we are joined to Him.<a name=19:23></a> It is a question of law and husband now, that is, of a bond that God has formed.<a name=19:24></a> We die to sin, and we die to the world; but we are "become dead to the law by the body of

		Christ".<a name=20:1></a> The first bond is dissolved by the death of Christ, that a new bond may be formed that "ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God".<a name=20:2></a> It conveys to me a great deal.<a name=20:3></a> The Christian is lawfully subject to Christ, and is to take character from the One to whom he is joined.<a name=20:4></a> That is the idea of a wife.<a name=20:5></a> She is to take character from the one to whom she is united.<a name=20:6></a> The one who has been raised by the glory of the Father lives to God.<a name=20:7></a> It is not only that I have found an object of delight and admiration in Him, but that I am joined to Him, and I am going by Him to bring forth fruit unto God.<a name=20:8></a> I am to be a living representation of Him here, because I take character from Him.<a name=20:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		All here this morning would be very tenacious of this point -- that we are joined to Christ.<a name=20:11></a> Every Christian is joined to Christ.<a name=20:12></a> Can we all say we have taken character from Christ in order that we might bring forth fruit unto God?<a name=20:13></a> Or, as it puts it lower down (verse 6), "That we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter".<a name=20:14></a> Not under law, like Israel, but in newness of spirit, all according to the pattern of Christ.<a name=20:15></a> I believe Christ inaugurated a wholly new order of things for man here.<a name=20:16></a> He was a man on earth, truly here as man; but such a man as He could not have been unless He were a divine Person.<a name=20:17></a> And now He has entered in according to what He has accomplished for God -- He lives to God.<a name=20:18></a> That is the man for God, and that is the man now for the Christian.<a name=20:19></a> To take your character from Him and bring forth fruit unto God is not preaching; it is not testimony (it is testimony in one sense), but it is love.<a name=20:20></a> As we read in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:22">Galatians  5:22</a>,

		I have read the above scriptures, counting on the Lord to supply anything in the way of exposition that may tend to the better understanding of them.<a name=24:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would begin with pointing out that in studying Scripture you have to distinguish between the way in which God presents Himself to man and the way in which man is presented before God.<a name=24:2></a> I am sure that throughout the word of God the distinction is maintained, and that a good deal of confusion arises from overlooking it.<a name=24:3></a> It is in the first instance the work of the evangelist to present, as light to souls, the truth of what God is toward man, for the greatest evangelist that ever lived could do no more than enlighten, and all we have, or can have now in grace, comes to us as light from God to our souls.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When once we are established in grace then there is the blessed truth of what we are for God, but unless we are clear as to the first we cannot apprehend rightly the second, and it is natural for man to suppose that God is toward him according to what he feels towards God, and that is the way he judges.<a name=24:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in connection with what I have said there is another point, and that is as to what Christ is personally.<a name=24:6></a> We find that He is presented to us in Scripture in two aspects, and this holds good not only in what He is now but in what He was here <i>as Man</i> on earth.<a name=24:7></a> It is hardly necessary to say that all that He was or is as Man, takes its character and has its lustre from what He is as divine.<a name=24:8></a> The two aspects to which I have referred are as presenting God to man, and as presenting man to God.<a name=24:9></a> The distinction may, I think, be put in a very short and simple way, i.<a name=24:10></a>e.<a name=24:11></a>, in

		the two terms, the "last Adam" and the "second man".<a name=25:1></a> The "last Adam", the Lord Jesus Christ, is the One through whom the grace of God is presented to man, the mediator between God and men.<a name=25:2></a> In the second Man we get the first and the pattern of the heavenly family -- we see what man is before God.<a name=25:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>, the way in which Christ is presented to us in what I may call the economy of grace.<a name=25:4></a> To us there is "one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him".<a name=25:5></a> This has its true force and application to Christians, because the fruits of the grace of God have been administered to them mediatorially through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=25:6></a> I may say that it is not a question here of the truth of His Person, but of the place He has taken in the administration of grace.<a name=25:7></a> Hence I can very well understand Paul and Silas saying to the jailor, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved".<a name=25:8></a> He is thus an object of faith; and if Christ were not divine He could not be presented as an object for faith, but nonetheless He is presented in what He has become.<a name=25:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find the same principle coming out in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, which is occupied in presenting what God is to the believer, and so we have constantly in the chapter the expression, "through our Lord Jesus Christ", peace with God, favour, joy in God, reconciliation, and eternal life.<a name=25:10></a> Every good thing made ours from God must necessarily come to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=25:11></a> The point in this chapter is not what the believer is before God, but what God is to the believer.<a name=25:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we have, on the other hand, what Christ is before God <i>as Man</i>, and such as we can be, and hence we have "in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God", and we can be on this ground.<a name=25:13></a> He is the first of the heavenly family to enter in, and that in His personal excellence.<a name=25:14></a>

		I think you can see the two aspects I have mentioned illustrated in the head of a family; if I am what I ought to be in my house in a sense I represent God to my family.<a name=26:1></a> I stand there for the Lord, and I ought to present a true testimony on the part of God to my household, but on the other hand my house is identified with me in the presence of God.<a name=26:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To refer now to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>you will find in verse 10 the divine proposition brought out, that which God has proposed to Himself to accomplish, the counsel of His will, to bring many sons unto glory; but so far as believers are concerned, I do not think you get it effected in their souls till we come to chapter 10, that is, the purpose is not made good in us until then, it is here that the believer is brought to what God started from in chapter 2.<a name=26:3></a> In connection with this, I think that I see Christ presented in chapter 2 on God's part as in the communion of His counsel, and in chapter 9 in what He is to God on our part, as having entered into heaven to appear in the presence of God for us, and then in chapter 10 we come to our privilege, that is, we have boldness to enter into "the holiest", by the blood of Jesus, through the veil.<a name=26:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Scripture makes clear the thought of God toward you, are you never going to respond to it?<a name=26:5></a> Is He to have no part?<a name=26:6></a> When I take up my privilege to enter the "holiest", God then gets His part; I apprehend my privilege and answer to the great love which God has made known to me; I enter into the scene of divine rest and glory in the blessed apprehension of what God is toward me.<a name=26:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was ever the pleasure of God to be known by man, and it is to this end He is bringing many sons to glory, and they are those who are close to God, who can enter into His wisdom and respond to His love.<a name=26:8></a> It is a poor son who does not respond to the father's love.<a name=26:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to go back for a moment to verses 11 and 12 of chapter 2, we see, as we have said, the communion of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=27>[Page 27]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ in the divine proposition.<a name=27:1></a> "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=27:2></a> Being thus in the communion of the divine counsel, in verse 12 He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=27:3></a> The place He takes there is not on our behalf but on the behalf of God.<a name=27:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son makes known the Father's love, and the Holy Spirit makes it effective in us, and thus the perfect unity of the Godhead in action is maintained, apart from which there is no work of God.<a name=27:5></a> That is the blessed way in which God presents Himself to us in connection with the divine proposition, and it all had its rise in the counsel of God.<a name=27:6></a> All is for God.<a name=27:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to refer a little to the other side of the truth, namely, how in Christ man is presented before God, and that leads me to chapter 9, particularly verses 11, 12.<a name=27:8></a> "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption".<a name=27:9></a> Now you can well understand the difference between Christ's coming out and His entering in.<a name=27:10></a> He came forth from God, but now I get the wonderful truth that He has entered in, "having obtained eternal redemption".<a name=27:11></a> He has entered in as Man, to the eternal satisfaction of God, on ground on which we can enter in, too.<a name=27:12></a> Suppose it were simply a question of saints entering in, I would ask, Who would be bold enough to enter in first?<a name=27:13></a> Christ has entered in first, as Man, to occupy this ground, to the glory of God, and to His eternal satisfaction; and now we can be bold to enter in.<a name=27:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Even when on earth Christ presented in perfection man before God in the place of man's responsibility.<a name=27:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=28>[Page 28]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He now presents man according to the counsel of God.<a name=28:1></a> And that, blessed be His name, is the ground on which we can go in.<a name=28:2></a> He has entered in, having obtained eternal redemption, having established that ground according to the will of God -- He is the Forerunner.<a name=28:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would here notice, in regard to chapter 9: 24, "For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us": that the idea is not quite the same as in verse 12, where "neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption".<a name=28:4></a> In this passage it is the moral idea, the ground He has taken; while in verse 24 He has entered into <i>the place</i>, "heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us".<a name=28:5></a> I think it is the idea of the high priest, as the representative of the priestly family in the place where they are not yet; it is the place we belong to, and He is there for us.<a name=28:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 10 we are brought back to the thought of chapter 2 in our apprehension of the will of God.<a name=28:7></a> "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once".<a name=28:8></a> You come now to the effectuation in us of the 'divine proposition', we are sanctified and thus "of one" with the Sanctifier.<a name=28:9></a> Now we have the believer, as perfected for ever, brought into the place of the divine will through the offering of Jesus Christ.<a name=28:10></a> He is "a son", that is the will of God; and that is the place we are brought into; our place of sanctification is the place that God has willed for us; and being by one offering perfected for ever there can be no imputation of sins, nor any question of our responsibility raised, because all has been completely and eternally settled.<a name=28:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have boldness by the blood of Jesus to enter the holiest, the blessed scene of the divine glory, where it is not a question of the actings of men, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=29>[Page 29]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		where the very glory of God reposes; surely <i>there</i> no such subject as sin, defilement or aught of that character can find place.<a name=29:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the home, too, where divine love finds its satisfaction in man, and you enter into "the holiest" to respond to that love that has displayed itself in Christ, and that now rests on Him as Man.<a name=29:2></a> He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren".<a name=29:3></a> That scene is filled with the glory of God.<a name=29:4></a> What I understand by the glory of God is the effulgence of God in the accomplishment of the purposes of His love.<a name=29:5></a> His wisdom and love have shone out in their accomplishment, and God has thus reached the purpose of His will, not only in Christ, but also in us.<a name=29:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, it is by the new and living way, which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say His flesh, that we enter.<a name=29:7></a> That is, you enter in on entirely new ground.<a name=29:8></a> If we are in the company of Christ we must be correspondent to Him on the ground of the glory of God.<a name=29:9></a> He has been raised from the dead by the glory of the Father; and our place is not after the flesh at all: it is "a new and living way .<a name=29:10></a>.<a name=29:11></a>.<a name=29:12></a> through the veil, that is to say, his flesh", which refers to His death, and in that death the responsible man has been ended as before God.<a name=29:13></a> As the risen and glorified Man He has taken up new ground in the presence of God according to God's counsel, for God's eternal glory; and that is the ground on which we go in.<a name=29:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is utterly impossible to bring man in the flesh "into the holiest", where everything is of God; and it is nothing but divine power that can sustain us there.<a name=29:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is not only that we are brought into the place of sons, but we are called to the enjoyment of the heavenly scene to which that relationship belongs.<a name=29:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is thus that not only is the grace of God ministered to us through Christ, but that He now represents believers before God in heaven.<a name=29:17></a> You go in

		I feel constrained to follow up what we have had before us by adding a few thoughts in connection with "the man of God".<a name=31:1></a> It is very important to understand the import of this expression, and to see how the man of God is formed morally for the place that he has to occupy.<a name=31:2></a> The expression is not limited to New Testament times.<a name=31:3></a> The course and action of the man of God in any one day being what was suited to that day would not however be descriptive of the man of God in another day.<a name=31:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by "the man of God" in the present time is characteristically what continues till the Lord comes.<a name=31:5></a> Timothy represents the ministry until the Lord should come.<a name=31:6></a> He is to continue in the truth till the appearing of Christ.<a name=31:7></a> Paul being an apostle is not designated a man of God.<a name=31:8></a> <i>We</i> cannot be apostles, but we can be men of God, and for this we need to be more individual.<a name=31:9></a> It is not sufficient to maintain in a collective way what is orthodox.<a name=31:10></a> I think we have, in the present time, in the ruin all around, to be to a large extent individual.<a name=31:11></a> We shall not be any real help if we are not this, for we shall be looking for support from others.<a name=31:12></a> If we are not strong individually there is not much power in our fellowship.<a name=31:13></a>

		One thing is certainly true of the man of God -- he becomes manifest in a day of apostasy -- he stands in the breach.<a name=31:14></a> We see this in the case of Moses when Aaron had made the golden calf, and afterwards in Elijah and Elisha in the darkest days in Israel, they had to stand in the truth of God in the apostasy of Israel.<a name=31:15></a> I think, as I said before, that the man of God in this day abides until the Lord comes.<a name=31:16></a> He can stand in the ruin of Christianity, when all has become like a

	<div class="paragraph">
		What comes in in connection with this is that the church is now God's object here.<a name=32:7></a> A man will not have much experience of divine support if he has not God's object in view.<a name=32:8></a> A man of God is one who can act for God because he is in the truth of the calling.<a name=32:9></a> It is noticeable that in the first epistle Timothy is addressed as "<i>thou</i>, O man of God", in the second the man of God is more general, that is, typical of a class.<a name=32:10></a> It is of great moment in our time.<a name=32:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will refer now for a moment to the qualifications of the man of God.<a name=32:12></a> The first thing is that his soul must be consciously in the full light in which God has shone out.<a name=32:13></a> There are comparatively few who are in the enjoyment of the place in which God in His grace has set them before Him.<a name=32:14></a> In Romans I see a sort of progress in apprehension in chapters 4 and 5.<a name=32:15></a> In chapter 4 we get deliverance from the judgment of death by Christ risen.<a name=32:16></a> I am in the light of this.<a name=32:17></a> In chapter 5 we get a point further, we joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.<a name=32:18></a> I am now in the light as God is in the light.<a name=32:19></a> The distance which was the effect of sin has been removed, and God has made himself known in the greatness of His love.<a name=32:20></a> As I understand it, that is the light in which we are -- God has come out.<a name=32:21></a> The second point is, that to be a man of God you must have gone in.<a name=32:22></a> You cannot come out <i>from</i> God if you have not gone in <i>to</i> God.<a name=32:23></a> This is not quite so simple as the truth that God has come out.<a name=32:24></a> If you are to go in you must travel the path by which Christ has gone in.<a name=32:25></a> He has gone in for us by death
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		and resurrection, and we go by that road.<a name=33:1></a> Death and resurrection have to be realised in the soul, not simply accepted doctrinally.<a name=33:2></a> You have to die to sin, to part company with the man that is here both as to his nature and his culture.<a name=33:3></a> The former is more simple than the latter.<a name=33:4></a> But by human culture you can never get hold of the clear knowledge of the mystery of God.<a name=33:5></a> This is not gained but by conflict.<a name=33:6></a> We get hold of it in apprehending the purposes of God centred in the Head.<a name=33:7></a> You must die as to the man that is here.<a name=33:8></a> When I die, I cease to live in regard of the judgment and culture of man.<a name=33:9></a> I reckon myself dead, and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=33:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two points are simple.<a name=33:11></a> The first that God must be known as revealed in love.<a name=33:12></a> The second that if you go in you must go in by the way that Christ has gone in.<a name=33:13></a> We heard in the former address that life was that by which imitators such as Jannes and Jambres were confounded.<a name=33:14></a> It is in this way that I understand the admonition to Timothy to "lay hold on eternal life".<a name=33:15></a> You must first go in <i>to</i> God if you are to come out <i>from</i> God.<a name=33:16></a> You can then stand <i>for</i> God in the breach.<a name=33:17></a> A man who is always looking for props for himself is no help to others.<a name=33:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And in regard to difficulties that arise in the assembly -- where do you expect to get light?<a name=33:19></a> From men or with God?<a name=33:20></a> The great importance of what I have said, that is, of going in to God, is that you get true light in regard to things here.<a name=33:21></a> Moses had light as to what was going on in the camp before he came down to it.<a name=33:22></a> Many are content with Christian privileges who have not been exercised as to the thought of going in.<a name=33:23></a> It is blessed to know that if I am with God I can stand here supported by God.<a name=33:24></a>

		What is before me in speaking at this time is summed up in the expression, "the testimony of our Lord" -- not that I have any idea of attempting in the course of an hour to compass that; but I want to take up one great feature of it, that which is spoken of here as "God's glad tidings".<a name=34:1></a> I hope on another occasion to speak of the ministry of the new covenant, but at this time I confine myself to what the apostle opens with in this epistle, "God's glad tidings .<a name=34:2></a>.<a name=34:3></a>.<a name=34:4></a> concerning his Son .<a name=34:5></a>.<a name=34:6></a>.<a name=34:7></a> Jesus Christ our Lord", and desire to give an idea of God's glad tidings, looked at not from our point of view, but from God's point of view.<a name=34:8></a> It is perfectly natural for us to look at everything from our point of view; but here the gospel is looked at from God's point of view, for it is "God's glad tidings .<a name=34:9></a>.<a name=34:10></a>.<a name=34:11></a> concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead)".<a name=34:12></a>

		Now there are three points which come before us as characteristic of God's glad tidings: first, they are "concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord"; secondly, He is "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness"; and thirdly, "by resurrection of the dead".<a name=34:13></a> That is, there are in the passage three thoughts first, position or relationship; secondly, order or condition; and thirdly, what I might call (using the expression for want of a better) line or generation.<a name=34:14></a>

		Now, if we look at things from God's standpoint, what God has in view is the recovery of everything, not to set things again on the old footing, but the reconciliation of all through Christ.<a name=35:3></a> That is brought out clearly in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, and you get it figuratively in what took place on the day of atonement.<a name=35:4></a> And there is another thing intimately connected with it, and that is the introduction of life into all, because there could be nothing for God in the universe if life were not brought in.<a name=35:5></a> If I look abroad on earth, everything is under death.<a name=35:6></a> The more you know about things the more you see that.<a name=35:7></a> Where then is life to come from?<a name=35:8></a> I think this passage shows us.<a name=35:9></a> A great many people failing to apprehend the figurative sense in which birth is used in the New Testament, and arguing from the analogy of nature, fancy that they have in new birth the solution of the question of life.<a name=35:10></a> <a href="#35:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> I do not believe it.<a name=35:11></a> I do not think there is life without new birth, it is the beginning of all for God.<a name=35:12></a> If Christ is to be written in the heart, there must first be fleshy tables; but new birth does not, in divine things, solve the question of life.<a name=35:13></a> If you want to reach that solution, it is essential to see the conciliation in Christ of the two trees in the garden of Eden, and that is not what is effected in new birth.<a name=35:14></a> The two trees stood out from the beginning: one, the tree with which responsibility was connected; and the other, the tree of life.<a name=35:15></a> And man having taken of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the question of life depends upon the clearing of the question of

		responsibility by one in whom the knowledge of good and evil was perfect.<a name=36:1></a> And I say that what is represented by those two trees is conciliated at one point, and at one point only; for there was only one who could meet the question of man's responsibility, and at the same time be a source and sustenance of life to man, and that is what Christ is, and what none other is or can be.<a name=36:2></a> And therefore if you want to understand anything about life, or the reconciliation of all things, you must begin from the top, that is, from Christ.<a name=36:3></a> The last Adam is a quickening spirit.<a name=36:4></a> It is no use beginning from you or me; you will get no understanding at all -- you have begun at the wrong end.<a name=36:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will try and make the matter plain to you.<a name=36:6></a> When I look at Christ, the first thing I see about Him is that He is the living bread come down from heaven, and it is for man to eat; so that you have a completely new and distinct source and sustenance of life for man, as the Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>"He also who eats me shall live also on account of me".<a name=36:7></a> He was the living bread that came down from heaven, not as their fathers ate manna in the desert and died, "He that eats of this bread shall live for ever".<a name=36:8></a> But there was another thing in connection with Christ, He entered on a condition down here in which, Himself perfect, He could take up the question of our responsibility.<a name=36:9></a> He connected Himself here with man in becoming the Son of man, so that having met the question of man's responsibility He could remove the judgment of death which lay upon man.<a name=36:10></a> Thus you get the conciliation of the two trees.<a name=36:11></a> And what marks the present moment is this, that the responsibility question has been met, and Christ as Man, as the living bread come down from heaven, is the source and support of life to all those who are drawn to Him of the Father.<a name=36:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you come to man's part, we have of necessity to appropriate His death before we can appropriate Him as the living bread come down from heaven: "Except

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore in Christ, as He has met the question of our responsibility and removed the judgment that lay upon us, we get the conciliation of these two trees, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, with which responsibility was connected, and the tree of life.<a name=37:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dare say some may not quite understand the point; but I want you to think over it, for I see increasingly that we have all been dreadfully obscure as to the whole question of life, because we have been so accustomed to begin at the wrong end.<a name=37:4></a> If you want to get a right idea of the teaching of Scripture with regard to life, you must begin where God begins, that is in Christ.<a name=37:5></a> For when God propounds His gospel, it is not about us, nor even simply about the work of Christ, but it is His glad tidings "concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead) Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=37:6></a> Therefore I take up those three points, because my conviction is that "God's glad tidings .<a name=37:7></a>.<a name=37:8></a>.<a name=37:9></a> concerning his Son .<a name=37:10></a>.<a name=37:11></a>.<a name=37:12></a> Jesus Christ our Lord", is the basis of all His ways in blessing for man -- the germ of all lies there.<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before dwelling on the three points, I would notice this, that the necessary links according to the flesh are duly maintained in Christ.<a name=37:14></a> These links, in regard to Israel, are very important, and as I have said, they are maintained in Christ.<a name=37:15></a> Although Christ has died and risen again, yet He does not lose anything which properly belonged to Him according to promise, and therefore He is spoken of as the seed of David according to the flesh.<a name=37:16></a> He is not only David's root, but He is the offspring of David, as He speaks of Himself in the Revelation, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star".<a name=37:17></a> That belongs to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Him.<a name=38:1></a> The question whether Israel could trace their genealogy would not exercise me very much, because the true genealogy for Israel is traced now in Christ.<a name=38:2></a> There is no mistake about His genealogy.<a name=38:3></a> It is noticeable how careful Scripture has been to trace and record it.<a name=38:4></a> And it will stand good for Israel in the future, because genealogy in regard to an earthly people is excessively important.<a name=38:5></a> He is "of the seed of David according to the flesh".<a name=38:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the first great point now is this -- He is "declared to be the Son of God with power", because the bearing of God's glad tidings is wider than Israel.<a name=38:7></a> And therefore, in the apostle Paul's testimony, everything is placed on a much broader platform.<a name=38:8></a> Directly after he was converted we are told that "straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God".<a name=38:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1">Galatians  1</a>we get his own account of it, "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen".<a name=38:10></a> So, too, here, it is "God's glad tidings", it does not say 'about Christ', but about "His Son"; He is "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead".<a name=38:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me say here in order to guard it, that is not a question of the eternal relations between the Father and the Son; that is carefully enough stated in other parts of scripture, but the point here is of the relation that subsists in Christ as Man, that is, as Man He is spoken of as God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=38:12></a> Really, the passage is the bringing into view the last Adam.<a name=38:13></a> It reveals that man is placed in that position now in relation to God in the Person of Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=38:14></a> And mark this -- everything really hinges upon it.<a name=38:15></a> It is not only a question of Christianity, but that all blessing for the universe hinges upon the great truth of "God's glad tidings .<a name=38:16></a>.<a name=38:17></a>.<a name=38:18></a> concerning his Son .<a name=38:19></a>.<a name=38:20></a>.<a name=38:21></a> Jesus

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ our Lord".<a name=39:1></a> And I will tell you why.<a name=39:2></a> When I speak about God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord, the first thing I think of is this, God is revealed, the love of God has come to light, "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us", God "spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all".<a name=39:3></a> There was the proof of divine love.<a name=39:4></a> Divine love has come out, and having found its rest in Christ is now the basis of all.<a name=39:5></a> Everything in blessing is secured, because all rests on the full revelation and satisfaction of God's love.<a name=39:6></a> "God so loved the world", is the great basis of everything now for heavenly or for earthly blessing.<a name=39:7></a> It is not the question of how far people may enter into it, but I am looking at the thing from God's side, it is "God's glad tidings .<a name=39:8></a>.<a name=39:9></a>.<a name=39:10></a> concerning his Son .<a name=39:11></a>.<a name=39:12></a>.<a name=39:13></a> Jesus Christ our Lord", and the first point is that God is perfectly revealed, and revealed as love towards the world.<a name=39:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another thing connected with it, and that is, that there is now a point where God's love has its perfect rest and satisfaction in man.<a name=39:15></a> This is a very great point.<a name=39:16></a> Not only has the love of God towards the world been manifested, but it has its adequate object in man, the Person of God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord -- that is the starting point.<a name=39:17></a> When it comes to Christianity, we are called into the "fellowship" of God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord, to be companions of Christ; so that a Christian can say in the language of the apostle at the end of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, "I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=39:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I say that the same revelation of God in Christ will hold good for earthly blessing.<a name=39:19></a> All earthly blessing depends upon the revelation of God as God has revealed Himself in His Son.<a name=39:20></a> Earthly saints will not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		enter into the revelation in the same way that we do; but the revelation stands good for them.<a name=40:1></a> I have often said that what is displayed in the church is the pledge of the stability of all blessing, because all now rests on what is known in the church, that God has been pleased to reveal Himself, according to all that He is, and in the perfect satisfaction of His love in Christ -- that is the real starting point of everything.<a name=40:2></a> Every family will not be put upon the same platform.<a name=40:3></a> There will be a difference of families even in heaven.<a name=40:4></a> The church will be one circle, and there will be other circles in heaven.<a name=40:5></a> There will be different families, too, upon earth.<a name=40:6></a> Each will enjoy what is peculiar to itself, but the basis of the blessing of all is the revelation which God has been pleased to give of Himself in the Person of His Son.<a name=40:7></a> Every family is named of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=40:8></a> I believe that every revelation of God that has ever been given will be made good, but all will be coloured by the supreme revelation.<a name=40:9></a> The supreme revelation is of His love in the Person of His Son, and every other revelation of His name, whether it be Jehovah, or Almighty, or Most High -- all take their place, and come out in the light of what I have called the supreme revelation.<a name=40:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point which I only touch upon now, and that is that every family derives its character from Christ.<a name=40:11></a> What is peculiar to Christians, as I hope to show when speaking about the new covenant, is this, that it is not the law, but Christ written in the heart, as the apostle says, "Ye are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink", -- referring to the two tables of stone -- "but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables" -- like the law -- "but on fleshy tables of the heart".<a name=40:12></a> That is, that what had come to pass so far in the Corinthians was that there was a writing of Christ in their hearts as plain as the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ten commandments upon the two tables of stone.<a name=41:1></a> That is the ministry of the new covenant in Christianity.<a name=41:2></a> The tables of stone given to Moses were hard enough, and what was written upon them was written with ink by the finger of God; but in Christians, the tables are rendered soft and fleshy by the power of God, and then it is they take an impress of Christ, Christ is written in the heart, that is, the heart comes to know and welcome and delight, in some little degree, in what God has revealed in Christ, how that every question of responsibility has been met, the judgment that lay upon man completely removed, and the will of God established, and further, the living bread come down from heaven is placed within the reach of faith's appropriation, so that the believer eats and lives.<a name=41:3></a> All the good of heaven has been brought into manhood in Christ, and the soul becomes familiar with the grace that meets it there.<a name=41:4></a> I have no great pleasure in man as he is here in this world, for I see that he is bent on exalting himself; I do not see any thought of going down in man.<a name=41:5></a> And I find other elements there, such as lust, the desire to use all to gratify himself, a violent will which would carry everything before it, and hence man does not please God.<a name=41:6></a> But when I look at Christ, I see the very contrast to all this.<a name=41:7></a> I see One who is divine content to become a man, because that is what coming down from heaven meant for Him.<a name=41:8></a> And instead of lust, the very principle of His being was love.<a name=41:9></a> He came down here full of love.<a name=41:10></a> He did not come down for His own will, but to do the will of Him that sent Him -- everything just the contrast to man here.<a name=41:11></a> That is what has come down from heaven, and that is what the soul of the Christian feeds upon: we eat Him, and we live by Him.<a name=41:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have so far spoken of two things -- one, God's revelation of Himself in Christ, and the other the satisfaction of His love in man in the Person of Christ.<a name=41:13></a> All blessing starts from that point, and the more I

	<div class="paragraph">
		have to do with that point the more conscious my soul is made of blessing.<a name=42:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the second point, namely, the order or condition -- for I do not know what better expression to use -- "according to the Spirit of holiness".<a name=42:2></a> That is in contrast to the "according to flesh" in the previous verse.<a name=42:3></a> "According to flesh" Christ was of the seed of David.<a name=42:4></a> "Flesh" is constantly used in Scripture to denote an order or condition, and Christ entered upon that condition, and in entering upon it He was of the seed of David.<a name=42:5></a> But now we get another condition fully revealed in Christ risen, and that is "according to the Spirit of holiness".<a name=42:6></a> Now what I want to make clear is this, that every family in blessing, whether in heaven or upon earth, is to derive from the Head, from Christ, for He is Head over all, and that the Spirit of holiness is that by which they derive from Him.<a name=42:7></a> In a Christian, the Spirit of holiness is an indwelling Spirit.<a name=42:8></a> That is peculiar to Christianity; it never was true before; the power of the Spirit came upon men, but there was no indwelling Spirit in Old Testament times, nor will there be in the millennium, though there will be the pouring out of the Spirit upon all flesh.<a name=42:9></a> It is perfectly certain to me that every family in blessing in heaven and upon earth is going to live by Christ in greater or less spiritual power, and every family will present some feature, some trait, of Christ.<a name=42:10></a> The earthly family will bear this trait, the law written in the heart.<a name=42:11></a> That was true of Christ, "Thy law is within my heart".<a name=42:12></a> But what is peculiar to the church is this, it is <i>the fulness</i> of Christ; every feature of Christ is written there, and everything proportioned.<a name=42:13></a> That is what the Spirit is effecting in you and in me.<a name=42:14></a> He dwells in us and feeds our souls with Christ, and in that way He practically forms Christ in the heavenly one; and then by being occupied with Christ we grow up into Him in intelligence as to all things.<a name=42:15></a> Every feature of Christ is reproduced in the church.<a name=42:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to call attention to the connecting link, "the Spirit of holiness", the great subduing power in blessing.<a name=43:1></a> Power is connected here with Christ; He is "marked out Son of God in power"; He has power to subdue all things to Himself.<a name=43:2></a> But in the administration of blessing, the immediate subduing power is the Spirit of God.<a name=43:3></a> We have the Spirit as an indwelling Spirit; and that is of the greatest importance, because in connection with it is the forming of Christ in the believer.<a name=43:4></a> It is the Spirit of Christ in the Christian that forms Christ in him.<a name=43:5></a> The apostle says to the Galatians, he travailed in birth as to them until Christ was formed in them.<a name=43:6></a> They had the Spirit indwelling, the power was in them that could form Christ in them, but Christ was not yet formed in them.<a name=43:7></a> The truth of an indwelling Spirit in the Christian is of the last moment, for in connection with it is the renewing of the Holy Spirit.<a name=43:8></a> With an earthly family, as Israel in the millennium, the Spirit of God is upon them, but there is no question of forming them at all.<a name=43:9></a> What will be effected in them by the power of the Spirit is that the law will be written in their hearts; that will be their measure; not only will they consent in mind to the law of God that it is holy, and delight in the law of God after the inward man, but they will have a nature which is really according to and therefore capable of fulfilling the law.<a name=43:10></a> Thus they derive from Christ, from the Head, but not in the way in which the church does.<a name=43:11></a> He is the Head of everything, and the Spirit is to be poured out upon all flesh.<a name=43:12></a> What I want you to consider is this, that if you desire to understand things aright, you must see things as God sees them, and measure things from the top; you must get to the point where the questions of responsibility and life have been conciliated, that is, in Christ, and every thought must start from there.<a name=43:13></a> There are families which are nearer to the Head than others, like the church, which is united to Him, there
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=44>[Page 44]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are other heavenly families, and there are earthly families; but in God's ways in blessing, they all derive from the Head, from Christ.<a name=44:1></a> And therefore it is "God's glad tidings .<a name=44:2></a>.<a name=44:3></a>.<a name=44:4></a> concerning his Son", which is presented to us.<a name=44:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one point more, "By resurrection of the dead".<a name=44:6></a> That is in contrast (and the contrast helps greatly in understanding it) to "of David's seed according to flesh", or -- using the expression for want of a better one -- it is the lineage or genealogy, the line on which we trace our descent.<a name=44:7></a> The point to my mind is this, though I dare say some here may find a difficulty in understanding it -- we trace our descent really from the dead.<a name=44:8></a> Even Christ is declared <i>in resurrection</i> to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=44:9></a> He begins again in resurrection in connection with man.<a name=44:10></a> It is not at all a question of His divine Person, that is not the point for a moment; but that as Man He starts again from the resurrection; He is the last Adam and the second man.<a name=44:11></a> But He does not come out in that way until the resurrection, until the judgment had been removed that lay upon the first man.<a name=44:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as regards ourselves, we trace our lineage from death.<a name=44:13></a> If I understand that the judgment of God once lay upon me, how can I attach importance to my genealogy in this world?<a name=44:14></a> A man may have a long pedigree in this world, and be able to trace back his ancestors for many generations, but what is the use of attempting to trace my pedigree when I see that I was under death?<a name=44:15></a> Scripture traces it back as far as death, and if I have come out of death, that is the proper beginning of my real existence for God; I have passed out of death into life in the resurrection of Christ; and that is where every one of us began with God.<a name=44:16></a> And if that is the case, you cannot make very much of genealogy.<a name=44:17></a> As I said before, the true line of genealogy for God in this world is maintained in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these great principles are brought to light in the glad tidings of God's Son, and I have sought to show their application to us, and not only to us, but to every family which receives blessing from God.<a name=45:7></a> But the point of the passage before us is that all these principles are demonstrated in God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=45:8></a> The resurrection of Christ according to the Spirit of holiness, is the starting point of all God's ways in life, and reconciliation, and blessing; and that is, I judge, the reason that Scripture speaks in the way it does here of "God's glad tidings .<a name=45:9></a>.<a name=45:10></a>.<a name=45:11></a> concerning his Son .<a name=45:12></a>.<a name=45:13></a>.<a name=45:14></a> Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=45:15></a> I want you to see what God has substantiated in Him, not what God has effected in you; because if you are looking at that, you are looking at the wrong end.<a name=45:16></a> If you see what God has effected in Christ, you will understand what your part is to be in it.<a name=45:17></a>

		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, when Christ was raised again from the dead, the first thing He did was to send an announcement to His disciples by Mary Magdalene that they were on a completely new footing before God, that He ascended to His Father and their Father, to His God and their God.<a name=45:18></a> Later on He comes into the midst and announces to them "peace", that every question of responsibility had been settled and judgment completely removed from them, so that there was peace towards them.<a name=45:19></a> And then He breathes on them, and by the gift of the Spirit livingly connects them with Himself, so that it might be true of them, "not I live, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=45:20></a> Everything was solved, the two trees were conciliated, the question of man's

	<div class="paragraph">
		And if you want to get right thoughts of things according to God, and rightly to understand God's glad tidings, you must not look at yourself or the effect in yourself; but you must see what God has brought to pass in His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=46:3></a> Then you will learn the application of it to yourself -- that the platform upon which each of us stands is the revelation of the love of God, and that we have a living link with the One in whom the love of God is satisfied.<a name=46:4></a> Now, is that true of everybody here?<a name=46:5></a> Is your soul conscious that the love of God is revealed?<a name=46:6></a> I trust that is the case; but are you conscious, too, that by the Spirit you are eternally and livingly linked with the One in whom that love has its perfect satisfaction, and that nothing can "separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord"?<a name=46:7></a> And if you want to trace your genealogy, you can trace it back just as far as death, and no farther, because you are linked with Christ as risen from the dead.<a name=46:8></a>

		I wish I had been able to bring it more distinctly before you; but the point here is to see how in the ways of God these two great principles of responsibility and life are conciliated in Christ, and God delights to bring under the attention of saints the truth of what He has brought to pass here in His Son, and that all these principles which are true in Him are true now in those who believe in Him, and they indicate the ground upon which we are with God.<a name=46:9></a>

		Another time, if the Lord enable me, I shall have a little more to say as to the ministry of the new covenant, which enables us to see not only the great principles which have come to pass in Christ Jesus our Lord, but the application of them to us -- not the law written in the heart, but Christ in the heart, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.<a name=46:10></a>

		THE NEW COVENANT MINISTRY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My subject tonight is the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=47:1></a> There are two aspects in which the apostle speaks of ministry in this epistle -- in chapter 3 the ministry of the new covenant, God "has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant"; and in chapter 5 "the ministry of reconciliation".<a name=47:2></a> The first is, in a sense, more positive than the second, because it speaks of what is substantive; the ministry of the new covenant is in effect, "the Spirit quickens", that is, makes alive.<a name=47:3></a> What I understand by the word of reconciliation is the testimony that all that which was contrary to God or that stood in the way of the accomplishment of God's purposes of grace has been completely removed on God's part.<a name=47:4></a> At the close of chapter 5, we have "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him".<a name=47:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not purpose at this time to go on to the ministry of reconciliation, but to say a little about the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=47:6></a> The apostle is led to it by the thought of a letter of commendation.<a name=47:7></a> The question which he raises in the beginning of the chapter is, Do we need to be commended to you, or do we want a letter of commendation from you?<a name=47:8></a> The answer to it is, You are our letter, because you are manifestly declared to be Christ's letter, "ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart".<a name=47:9></a> The writing was of Christ, made legible in the power of the Spirit, and is in contrast to the writing of the law on the two tables of stone; and this leads the apostle to speak of the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=47:10></a> The ministry of the new covenant is

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the spirit in contrast to the letter, and the Lord is the Spirit.<a name=48:1></a> It is not simply an announcement, for it is said in connection with the Lord, "the Spirit quickens".<a name=48:2></a> It is not exactly the Holy Spirit that is spoken of here, but the Lord is the Spirit.<a name=48:3></a> It is the spirit in contrast to the letter; the letter kills, the Spirit quickens.<a name=48:4></a> I will draw attention to that presently, because it does not do to confound the spirit with the thought of the Holy Spirit.<a name=48:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three distinct thoughts in the chapter.<a name=48:6></a> The first is the writing of Christ, you are Christ's epistle, His writing.<a name=48:7></a> The second is, "the Lord is the Spirit".<a name=48:8></a> And the third is, "looking on the glory of the Lord".<a name=48:9></a> And on those three points, I desire to speak, for the ministry is a very important matter.<a name=48:10></a> But first let me say one word about the gospel, as spoken of in chapter 15 of the first epistle.<a name=48:11></a> It is an announcement of facts; the ministry is not simply an announcement, but refers to patient labour, which never ceases until the saints are alive in Christ.<a name=48:12></a> It is distinct as far as I understand it, from the truth of the church.<a name=48:13></a> It may lead on to it, but in itself it is a perfectly distinct ministry, the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=48:14></a> The work of the ministry is not done until you can say of saints that they are alive in Christ.<a name=48:15></a> There is a new plant there.<a name=48:16></a> I may illustrate it by Israel in the millennium.<a name=48:17></a> When the law is written in the heart of Israel in that day, then it is that Israel will live.<a name=48:18></a> I could not say that they will live in Christ, because the expression "in Christ" is hardly applicable to them, but they live, and that to God, in a state of things on earth in which life is possible.<a name=48:19></a> To use a figure which is employed in the gospels, they will carry their bed.<a name=48:20></a> The Lord said to the paralytic at the pool of Bethesda, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk".<a name=48:21></a> And that points to what Christ will do for Israel in the future, and refers to the moment when spiritually they will live.<a name=48:22></a> But the contrast to it here is Christ written

		in the heart.<a name=49:1></a> In the old covenant the law was written on two tables of stone, which were put in the ark.<a name=49:2></a> It is not that now, and it will not be that in the millennium.<a name=49:3></a> Then it will be the law written "not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart".<a name=49:4></a> Now it is not the law, but Christ written.<a name=49:5></a> You are Christ's epistle "ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart".<a name=49:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Last week, in connection with the two or three introductory verses of the epistle to the Romans, I dwelt upon the glad tidings, seeking to show that what God has to say to us is His glad tidings concerning His Son.<a name=49:7></a> Christ is the resource of God, and God's power of redemption or recovery is in Him; and therefore what God has to say to man in the glad tidings is concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=49:8></a> There is the point of recovery; not only has He effected the work of reconciliation, but all is to be reconciled <i>in Him</i>.<a name=49:9></a> Then I dwelt a little on some of the detail which comes out there, that He is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness; by the resurrection from the dead", and referred to those three expressions as really giving to us the great principles of God's ways in grace.<a name=49:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the ministry with a remark which I believe to be of great importance, that is, that while God speaks to us from the height of His glory, no one can at first take in the full import of what He says.<a name=49:11></a> The same thing may be seen when the Lord Jesus spoke to the woman of Samaria.<a name=49:12></a> He spoke according to the height of the glory of His Person, but she could not take it in.<a name=49:13></a> God can speak to man of His glad tidings concerning His Son, but you cannot at once take it all in.<a name=49:14></a> Every one of us in our history with God has to begin at the beginning, and the beginning is small.<a name=49:15></a> I have heard it said that a soul has to go back from Christ in glory to Christ at the cross.<a name=49:16></a> I do not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		believe there is any truth in it, for the simple reason that a newly awakened soul cannot take in all that God presents in the gospel.<a name=50:1></a> The apostle speaks in chapter 1 of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among the Corinthians by himself and Silas and Timotheus; but you do not really take in the thought of the Son of God when first converted.<a name=50:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will tell you in a few words what I believe is the real progress of the soul in that respect.<a name=50:3></a> I am not speaking now of what people can repeat as a creed.<a name=50:4></a> Most of us have been familiar in that way with Christian doctrines from the time we could speak, because we have been brought up in the midst of Christianity.<a name=50:5></a> Anyone can repeat a creed, and in a country like this, where people are instructed in Scripture, they could tell you a great many of the truths in it.<a name=50:6></a> A class of children could do so, if they were catechised, and they might be simple and not question that they are truths.<a name=50:7></a> But when it comes to what a man's soul really apprehends, it is quite another matter.<a name=50:8></a> The first thing which a soul under exercise really takes in in regard to God is the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=50:9></a> At the beginning, Abel, divinely taught, came to God through sacrifice; he brought the firstling of his flock and of the fat thereof, and there was no type of resurrection there; the fat simply refers to the excellency of the offering.<a name=50:10></a> And so now, if a soul comes to God, it comes by the sacrifice of Christ: that is the beginning, and in that stage of its history it is all that a soul can really take in.<a name=50:11></a> God has set forth Jesus to be a mercy-seat through faith in His blood.<a name=50:12></a> The thought that God has to be met by sacrifice is almost innate in man, and when he is brought into exercise as to his responsibility to God or as to his state, his first apprehension is that God has provided a sacrifice.<a name=50:13></a> The first thing for faith is the blood, and I do not believe anybody really begins except there.<a name=50:14></a> People may say that they have apprehended other truths, but I doubt it.<a name=50:15></a> They may

	<div class="paragraph">
		think so, but their real beginning with God is that they have apprehended the sacrifice of Christ, that is, they approach God, like Abel did, by sacrifice.<a name=51:1></a> I quite admit there must be a work of God in them antecedent to this, but I do not go into that now.<a name=51:2></a> I am speaking of what the soul apprehends.<a name=51:3></a> You find the same order in the history of the children of Israel.<a name=51:4></a> The first thing they learned was shelter from the judgment of God, that they were under the shelter of the blood of the lamb when the destroying angel was passing through the land of Egypt.<a name=51:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I venture to say that until the work of Christ is apprehended, that is, until the thought of the offering is taken in, a soul cannot really apprehend the truth of the resurrection.<a name=51:6></a> It is not natural to man to believe in resurrection.<a name=51:7></a> Resurrection is of the supernatural power of God, and the real moral link with resurrection is in the value of the sacrifice.<a name=51:8></a> I doubt if any person really has faith in the resurrection of Christ if he has not first learned that He was delivered for their offences.<a name=51:9></a> The Scripture order of it is this, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.<a name=51:10></a> What brings about the resurrection is, that as sin came in by man, so sin has been removed in man.<a name=51:11></a> There was no annulling or setting aside of death until sin was gone.<a name=51:12></a> Sin brought death into the world, and therefore if death is to go, sin must be taken away.<a name=51:13></a> Sin is taken away from before God by the offering of Christ, and therefore death is annulled.<a name=51:14></a> "By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead".<a name=51:15></a> When the offering is apprehended, when the value of the sacrifice is seen, then the truth of resurrection, and the victory over death is taken in.<a name=51:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing which I believe a soul apprehends according to God is the lordship of Christ.<a name=51:17></a> Its eyes are opened to see that Christ is the revelation, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=52>[Page 52]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		embodiment, so to say, of all God's thoughts with regard to man.<a name=52:1></a> It thus gets peace; but no soul ever gets peace until it apprehends Christ as Lord, and Christ is apprehended as Lord when the truth of His resurrection is accepted.<a name=52:2></a> We believe on Him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.<a name=52:3></a> His lordship is based in Scripture on resurrection.<a name=52:4></a> For this purpose Christ both died and lived again, that He might have dominion, might be Lord, over both the dead and the living.<a name=52:5></a> I can understand resurrection when I apprehend sacrifice; and when I see the resurrection of Christ, then I understand His lordship, that He is in dominion as man in order that He may administer to men in power all the good that is in God's thoughts for men.<a name=52:6></a> It is not now His going about in the world doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him, but the bringing in of good in power, for lordship implies power.<a name=52:7></a> If you want it detailed, you can read the beginning of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also" -- that is, by our Lord Jesus Christ -- "we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=52:8></a> "We are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation".<a name=52:9></a> Peace, grace and reconciliation are through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=52:10></a> He has brought to us with authority as Lord all the good that God has for man.<a name=52:11></a> He is the true ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat, the One in whom God addresses Himself to man, and the recognition in my soul of His authority brings into it all the good of which I have spoken.<a name=52:12></a> It is a practical truth, for just in proportion as your heart is subject to Christ as Lord you are really in the enjoyment of <i>all</i> the good which God has brought into effect in Him.<a name=52:13></a> It is a wonderful thing to be subject to Him, so that "whatsoever

	<div class="paragraph">
		ye do in word or deed", you "do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him".<a name=53:1></a> The administration of all that God has for man is vested in Christ as Lord; all power is given to Him in heaven and upon earth -- and what for?<a name=53:2></a> To subjugate all evil, and to introduce peace, and grace, and blessing, and joy, and reconciliation.<a name=53:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is the third great truth which the soul learns in regard to Christ, but not I think till the Spirit is received -- He is the Son of God, that is His glory.<a name=53:4></a> The soul then apprehends His glory.<a name=53:5></a> It sees that were He not the Son of God, there would not have been virtue in the sacrifice, there would not have been ground of resurrection, nor suitability for His place as Lord; the whole stands together, and for the support and filling out of the other thoughts, it is really necessary to apprehend His glory, and His glory is that He is the Son of God.<a name=53:6></a> He is the last Adam, a quickening spirit.<a name=53:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that is the way in which the soul is led on.<a name=53:8></a> And a simple illustration of it is seen in the case of the woman of Samaria.<a name=53:9></a> The Lord speaks to her according to the height of His glory.<a name=53:10></a> He says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink" -- Who was it said that to her?<a name=53:11></a> It was the Son of God, the Giver of the Holy Spirit.<a name=53:12></a> That is brought out in chapter 1 of John's gospel.<a name=53:13></a> The Spirit abode upon Christ, and John the baptist says, "I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptise with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Ghost.<a name=53:14></a> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God".<a name=53:15></a> The Lord spoke to the woman according to the height of His Person, but she does not take it in in that way.<a name=53:16></a> The first thought she gets about Him is that He is a prophet.<a name=53:17></a> The second is that He is the Christ, the Anointed.<a name=53:18></a> She says, "Come,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=54>[Page 54]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		see a man which told me all things that ever I did" -- that is the prophet -- "is not this the Christ?<a name=54:1></a>" She is led on thus, but as far as we can tell from the chapter, she did not then apprehend the glory of His Person, and I doubt if she was in a condition to do so until she received the gift.<a name=54:2></a> There is a great deal of difference to be made between the mode in which God addresses Himself to us, and the power for apprehension in our souls, because each of us has to begin in a very small and feeble way; but we are led on by these steps, first to take in the sacrifice, then the resurrection, then the authority or lordship, and then that which is the final thought in a certain sense, and the background of all -- His glory, He is the Son of God.<a name=54:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say this much by way of introduction, and pass on to speak of the three great points that come out in this chapter, which are very intimately connected with what I have been saying -- the first point being the writing of Christ in the heart; the second, the Lord is that spirit; and the third and final point, "looking on the glory of the Lord" we are all "transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle could say to the Corinthians, 'You are Christ's epistle ministered by us'.<a name=54:5></a> Mischief had been at work among the Corinthians, and there had been an effort on the part of evil workers to undermine the authority of the apostle.<a name=54:6></a> But it is not possible to efface what is written by "the Spirit of the living God".<a name=54:7></a> I do not know whether all quite apprehend the force of that expression.<a name=54:8></a> The writing is not exactly spoken of as the work of the Spirit of God, but the Spirit of God is put in contrast to the ink; that is, that every line of Christ which is written in the heart of the believer is written efficaciously, so to say, in spiritual lines; that, I take it, is the idea of the expression.<a name=54:9></a> The writer is Christ; you are Christ's epistle, the letter that He has written, "ministered by us", for

		the apostle was the agent; and as to the manner of the writing, not with ink, but with "the Spirit of the living God", and then, "not in tables of stone", referring to the two tables of the first covenant, "but in fleshy tables of the heart".<a name=55:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fleshy tables of the heart show the work of God as the foundation of all at Corinth.<a name=55:2></a>, This was not the apostle's work.<a name=55:3></a> Man's heart is hard enough by nature, and if God had not prepared man's heart, you could not speak about "fleshy tables of the heart".<a name=55:4></a> It indicated a divine preparation for the ministry; it was not the ministry, but the preparation of God for the ministry.<a name=55:5></a> So, too, we get the same thing prophetically spoken of in regard to Israel; God takes away the heart of stone and gives them a heart of flesh.<a name=55:6></a> Before anything can be written for God in the heart of man, the heart must be prepared.<a name=55:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you read the many things that the apostle has to disapprove in the first epistle, it is striking that he can say to the Corinthians, that they were "Christ's epistle", and "manifestly declared" to be that.<a name=55:8></a> What do you suppose Christ writes?<a name=55:9></a> It was not the law in their hearts, the time has not come for that.<a name=55:10></a> I believe that in the issue of God's ways, every family will bear some trait of Christ.<a name=55:11></a> When the law is written in the heart of Israel, they will bear that trait of Christ.<a name=55:12></a> But the present is not the moment for writing the law in the heart; but if Christ writes in the heart, He writes Himself; it was Jesus Christ that the apostle ministered; Christ was written in the heart of the Corinthians, and Christ was the writer.<a name=55:13></a> The result was real faith in Christ.<a name=55:14></a> He was appreciated in their hearts.<a name=55:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that involves a very great deal.<a name=55:16></a> It involves, to begin with, the practical displacement of self; for it Christ is come in, it is another man, from another source, another character of man altogether; that is what is presented to us in Christ.<a name=55:17></a> In Christ, as here in the world, we see a man anointed of God, bringing

		to man every thought of good that God had toward man, going about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him.<a name=56:1></a> We see Him, a Man here in the power of the Holy Spirit, for the will of God, maintaining what was due to God, and at the end offering Himself by the eternal Spirit without spot to God.<a name=56:2></a> That is what Christ did and was.<a name=56:3></a> We see the perfect contrast to all that was here in the world -- man here seeking his own things and his own will, and Christ here simply and exclusively for the will of God.<a name=56:4></a> The One that had title to please Himself did not please Himself, but the reproaches of them that reproached God fell on Him.<a name=56:5></a> We see Him here in the presence of the hatred of man, bringing heavenly good and grace into this world, full of zeal for God, maintaining the righteousness of God, and bringing to man relief from all the pressure under which man lay.<a name=56:6></a> The Lord could say, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=56:7></a> That is what He was here for.<a name=56:8></a> And then He offered Himself to God to put away what was contrary to God, giving Himself for us "an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour".<a name=56:9></a> That is what Christ was, and that is another man; for, although men had often acted in the power of the Holy Spirit before, there never had been a man anointed by the Holy Spirit and thus characterised by the Spirit.<a name=56:10></a> But that is what the Lord was.<a name=56:11></a> Every word He spoke, every act He did, and every miracle He performed, was by the Spirit of God; and He could say, "I do always those things that please him", speaking of the Father.<a name=56:12></a> That is the Christ, the anointed of God, who has effected all for God and for man.<a name=56:13></a>

		May God give us all grace to accept it, because it is not God's thought that something is to be seen of Christ, and something of us; but we are an epistle of Christ known and read of all men.<a name=57:15></a> If you have any estimation of what Christ is, you cannot fail to delight in Him.<a name=57:16></a> The apostle says at the close of the first epistle: "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha".<a name=57:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My first thought was to have turned at this time to another subject; but I felt that something more was to be said on the subject of ministry.<a name=63:1></a> And what led me to it was this, that we get two distinct parts of ministry spoken of in this epistle.<a name=63:2></a> One I referred to last week in connection with chapter 3: the new covenant ministry.<a name=63:3></a> In this chapter it is "the ministry of reconciliation".<a name=63:4></a> The apostle evidently presents the two things as distinct the one from the other.<a name=63:5></a> Of course they are both parts of one ministry; but they are treated as distinct.<a name=63:6></a> I desire now to say a little, as the Lord may enable me, in regard to the ministry of reconciliation, and its object.<a name=63:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may in passing observe that the ministry of the new covenant connects itself with the eighth chapter of Hebrews, and the ministry of reconciliation with the tenth.<a name=63:8></a> I do not want to go largely into that point now, but some may care to follow it up at their leisure.<a name=63:9></a> If you read <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>in connection with <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>, you will find that there is a certain correspondence.<a name=63:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>we read that Christ has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as "He is the mediator of a better covenant"; the terms of the new covenant are then given, but to show that the first has grown old.<a name=63:11></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>the apostle says that God has "made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit", and he shows its application to Gentiles.<a name=63:12></a> Because, as Gentiles, we could not be strictly under the terms of the new covenant, and yet we have the good of it.<a name=63:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>the point is, that the first covenant having grown old, was ready to vanish away.<a name=63:14></a> Christians could not be before God on ground which

		was ready to vanish away; but we are with God on the ground of the new covenant.<a name=64:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 10, in connection with this, the result of reconciliation is presented to the Hebrews in language to which they had been accustomed, "the holiest", and so on.<a name=64:2></a> They were familiar with the idea of the tabernacle and the holy place, and the priests, and they are now taught that they have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus".<a name=64:3></a> I think we get practically the same thing taught in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>in the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=64:4></a> The apostle deals with Jews in divine wisdom, according to where they were, and the thoughts with which they were familiar.<a name=64:5></a> But in dealing with Gentiles he presents things in a rather different way; but I think he presents practically the same things.<a name=64:6></a> I have just indicated the correspondence between these passages, and will leave anyone to follow it out at his leisure.<a name=64:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If anyone were to ask me what the great object of the second epistle to the Corinthians is, I should say that it is to lead the saints into the apprehension that they are a company of priests, a worshipping company.<a name=64:8></a> I very much doubt if the Corinthians had yet learnt it.<a name=64:9></a> I think in the first epistle saints are taught that they are "a spiritual house", and in the second epistle that they are "a holy priesthood", both which thoughts are taken up as regards Jewish Christians in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>, "To whom coming, as unto a living stone .<a name=64:10></a>.<a name=64:11></a>.<a name=64:12></a> ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood".<a name=64:13></a> In chapter 3 of the first epistle, the apostle had said, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=64:14></a>" And in chapter 12 he brings forward the truth of the body, but in connection with the manifestations of the Spirit, because all the gifts of the Spirit are set in the assembly, but in the assembly as the body; and I do not think that apart from the truth of the body the presence of the Spirit in the temple can be understood.<a name=64:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=65>[Page 65]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have referred to the temple as being the great point in the first epistle.<a name=65:1></a> The saints were a spiritual house, the dwelling-place of the Spirit.<a name=65:2></a> I think that Christians up to the time that the apostle laboured at Corinth, had been accustomed in their minds to connect all light with Jerusalem as a centre, not with the temple, but with Jerusalem.<a name=65:3></a> When a difficult question arose at Antioch, the matter was referred to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem for decision.<a name=65:4></a> And after that, Paul and Silas went about confirming the different assemblies by the decrees of the apostles and elders.<a name=65:5></a> And this was doubtless according to divine wisdom.<a name=65:6></a> But in 1 Corinthians Paul takes the ground of having laid a foundation as a wise master builder, and presses upon the saints the truth that they were the temple of God, that the Spirit of God dwelt in them; and therefore there was not occasion to refer to Jerusalem, because where the temple of God was, and the Spirit of God in the temple, there was light.<a name=65:7></a> That is I judge the great idea connected with the presence of the Spirit of God in the temple -- the light of God was there.<a name=65:8></a> The epistle to the Hebrews has the same character really, for we there have, "Whose house are we", that is, Christians.<a name=65:9></a> The temple at Jerusalem had ceased to be God's house, He dwelt not in temples made with hands, but the apostle says We are God's house.<a name=65:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second epistle to the Corinthians, as I have said, the object of the apostle is to lead the Corinthians into the apprehension of the truth that they were a holy priesthood, and he would bring their souls thus into contact with God, and it is for that purpose he brings in, in the way he does, "the ministry of reconciliation" as leading to new creation, where all things are of God.<a name=65:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I can understand it, he could not unfold to them properly the ministry of reconciliation unless he first unfolded to them the ministry of the new

		covenant.<a name=66:1></a> I do not think anybody can really understand reconciliation if he does not know something about the new covenant.<a name=66:2></a> I was bringing out last week how the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth of Romans unfold to us all the good that we get from God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, that the Lord is the spirit.<a name=66:3></a> He is the spirit of Scripture, the spirit and (if I may use the expression) the principle of God's ways towards men.<a name=66:4></a> Nobody will get a right thought of the new covenant if he does not see that all the good which is in the heart of God towards man is administered in power by the Lord Jesus Christ, and there is no other way by which anyone can get it; it is God's way of administration.<a name=66:5></a> The first introduction of Christ as Lord is at the close of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>, where it says, "If we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification"; that is, that when every effect of sin had been annulled in Christ by His resurrection from the dead, for the last effect of sin in that way was death, then you find He is Lord as risen: I do not say He was not Lord before, but it is in resurrection that He is thus presented to us.<a name=66:6></a> The first covenant was one of requirement on God's part; the new covenant does not speak of requirement, but of what God has effected for men and ministers to them through the Lord, who is the spirit of Scripture -- I do not say the spirit of the new covenant, that is hardly the thought, but the spirit of Scripture.<a name=66:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to what completes the ministry, that is the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=66:8></a> And this connects itself in my thought very intimately with "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus".<a name=66:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last item of blessing referred to in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>is that "we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement", i.<a name=66:10></a>e.<a name=66:11></a>, reconciliation.<a name=66:12></a> The effect of receiving the reconciliation

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=67>[Page 67]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is that we joy in God.<a name=67:1></a> I will try and give you the idea presently if the Lord enable me, of what reconciliation means.<a name=67:2></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a>, 18, we read, "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new; and all things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation".<a name=67:3></a> It is a strong expression that is used there, new things have come to pass; the word employed for "new" is the same word as that in new covenant; and it is "new" in the sense of different, not only new things, but different things have come to pass, things that have a completely different character.<a name=67:4></a> One thing is very evident in the passage, that there is a most intimate connection between reconciliation and new creation, because in new creation "all things are of the God, who has reconciled us to himself" -- that is what new creation means.<a name=67:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What the apostle referred to as the old things was, I think, the things connected with the responsible man.<a name=67:6></a> The apostle had done with the old man, and all the system of things with which the first man was identified.<a name=67:7></a> The first man was man on the footing of responsibility before God, and in that sense Christ came after the flesh, He came on to that ground "made of a woman, made under the law".<a name=67:8></a> Now the apostle says, "Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more".<a name=67:9></a> With the apostle it was practically true that he had put off the old man and put on the new, and the new man was created after God, was a new creation, in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=67:10></a> When you get on to that ground you apprehend that new things have come to pass, that God has begun completely anew, and that the starting-point with God is Himself; God has begun from Himself by Christ in all these new things.<a name=67:11></a> God did not begin in that way at the first; man was made out of the earth, earthy, and God breathed into his nostrils the breath

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of life.<a name=68:1></a> Now, in new creation, God has begun from Himself; "all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation" -- that is the starting-point, I have no doubt it will be carried out to the utmost limits.<a name=68:2></a> We read that there are to be new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells; everything will be from God.<a name=68:3></a> And so the new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth; there is a new creation.<a name=68:4></a> But the point is that we are to reach the knowledge of God who is acting in this way; and the way by which we come practically into that knowledge of God is by reconciliation -- that is what I want to bring before you.<a name=68:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will tell you the great idea of reconciliation -- reconciliation means the removal of moral distance.<a name=68:6></a> God has by the judgment of sin removed the distance that existed between Himself and man by reason of sin.<a name=68:7></a> He was the only One who knew the distance or could measure it, and He has removed it.<a name=68:8></a> When Adam and Eve were turned out of Paradise, although God clothed them in coats of skin, yet the distance was immeasurable, and so far as man was concerned, irremediable.<a name=68:9></a> Man had fallen under the power of sin, and the distance between God and man was infinite.<a name=68:10></a> When I come to the ministry of reconciliation, I find that all that is gone.<a name=68:11></a> It is not that man has bridged the distance, nor has God bridged the distance, but God in grace has removed it.<a name=68:12></a> If you want to know the great proof that the distance is gone, it is that He has raised Christ, who was made sin, from the dead.<a name=68:13></a> There could be no resurrection to life if sin had not been put away -- that is perfectly certain, because resurrection is the annulling of the sentence of death, and the sentence of death could not have been annulled if sin, which brought death in, had not first been put away.<a name=68:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral settlement of the question of sin was upon the cross, where Christ was made sin, and death

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having spoken about reconciliation, I want now to convey a general idea of the purpose of it, what the great end of reconciliation as to persons is; and you will see how it connects itself with the thought of man going into the holiest.<a name=69:11></a> The first thought in reconciliation is that God may have His pleasure in man; the other is that man may joy in God.<a name=69:12></a> The apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, "We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement", i.<a name=69:13></a>e.<a name=69:14></a>, reconciliation.<a name=69:15></a> The reception of the reconciliation, the knowledge that God has annulled the distance that stood between Himself and man, enables us to joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=69:16></a>

		I will give you just one illustration of it which is so perfectly simple and familiar that no one can miss the idea; that is, the case of the prodigal son.<a name=69:17></a> He was reconciled outside the house, but he was brought into the house in order that the father might have his delight in him, that he might be there to the father's entire pleasure and satisfaction, and that he might joy in the father.<a name=69:18></a> That is the good and gain of

		There are two expressions to be noticed in this passage, first, "the ministry of reconciliation", and then "the word of reconciliation"; and as I understand it, the ministry is the larger thought of the two.<a name=70:12></a> The apostle says, "All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation".<a name=70:13></a> Then in verse 19 you see what the ministry is, "to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath

		committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=71:1></a> Mark those two parts.<a name=71:2></a> There is first that "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them".<a name=71:3></a> As I understand it, the coming of Christ into the world put everything for the moment on a completely new footing.<a name=71:4></a> Previously the Jew had been on the footing, so to say, of law, but the presence of the Son of God without abolishing law, put things on a new ground.<a name=71:5></a> When He was born into the world, the angels sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=71:6></a> God was not pressing home the claims of law and prophets, but "was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them".<a name=71:7></a> I believe we little understand how the very fact of Christ being born as man into this world altered for the moment the whole aspect of things before God.<a name=71:8></a> I believe that in the coming of Christ God overlooked in His people the broken law and the persecution of the prophets, and everything else.<a name=71:9></a> He gave them Christ, and if they had accepted Christ they would have come into the promises.<a name=71:10></a> But they rejected Him, and the rejection of Christ served to increase the responsibility they had previously been under; God exacts from them the ten thousand talents, the whole debt.<a name=71:11></a> We can understand this from the parable of the king that would take account of his servants in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=71:12></a> The Jew did not act as he had been acted to.<a name=71:13></a> But then the fact that the world rejected Christ, and that things therefore go back in a sense to the old ground does not alter the great truth that "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses"; that is, that in the presence of Christ here upon earth there was a way of reconciliation; that had it been possible for the world to have accepted Christ, the world might have been reconciled; but God knew that it was not so to be.<a name=71:14></a> That is the first part.<a name=71:15></a>

		Then the second part is that he had given to the apostles the word of reconciliation.<a name=72:1></a> I understand that to be the testimony that reconciliation has been effected.<a name=72:2></a> You could not talk about reconciliation if reconciliation had not been effected.<a name=72:3></a> "The word of reconciliation" is the testimony that it exists, because things are much in advance of what they were when "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses".<a name=72:4></a> What marks the present moment is that reconciliation has been effected, and that the great distance that existed between God and man, as the result of sin, has been annulled by the Lord Jesus Christ, and in order that God may have in Christ His pleasure in man, and that man may find his joy in God.<a name=72:5></a> If you do not understand the new covenant, as the footing on which you are before God, that Christ has ministered to you every benefit from God, I do not think you can enter into the great truth of reconciliation.<a name=72:6></a> I may be asked, Did not the apostle preach reconciliation to unconverted people?<a name=72:7></a> I admit it; but no unconverted person could enter into it.<a name=72:8></a> Many people take up the idea of reconciliation as though it meant a change of feeling in them.<a name=72:9></a> I do not believe that is the thought.<a name=72:10></a> You must reach the ground of the new covenant, and learn the great good which God has brought to you in the Lord Jesus Christ before you can understand that reconciliation has been effected, that God has annulled the infinite distance that stood between Himself and man, in order that He may have pleasure in man, and that man may joy in God.<a name=72:11></a> That is what I understand the apostle to mean in beseeching people, on the part of the Lord Jesus Christ, to be reconciled to God.<a name=72:12></a> If you want to know either the measure of God's delight in man, or to understand anything about joying in God, you must look at the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=72:13></a> It is there you learn the whole truth of it.<a name=72:14></a> To enter the father's house, the best robe had to be put on the prodigal.<a name=72:15></a> And it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that into which you are to enter.<a name=73:1></a> The apostle says, "We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us"; we want you to enter into all that greatness which is displayed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and the reconciliation which God has effected through Him.<a name=73:2></a> "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=73:3></a> That is what the apostle brought to people, and he brought it to them as an ambassador for Christ.<a name=73:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the great climax of it is that God will display saints as the expression of His righteousness.<a name=73:5></a> If we want to understand what the righteousness of God is, we must learn it in Christ; there only can we see an adequate expression of the righteousness of God.<a name=73:6></a> I do not speak of righteousness being shown when Christ was a substitute for us, when He bore our sins.<a name=73:7></a> It was holiness in God that led to His being forsaken, but righteousness comes out, to my mind, in the resurrection and glory of Christ.<a name=73:8></a> And therefore the Lord says the Spirit will convict the world concerning righteousness, "because I go to my Father and ye see me no more".<a name=73:9></a> But the point here is He was made sin <i>for us</i>, and we get all the results that flow from His having been made sin for us, and it is in the church that the righteousness of God will be perfectly displayed and vindicated; that is, that when the universe sees the church in glory with Christ then it will understand the righteousness of God, in the great answer which He has given to the work that Christ accomplished for us when He was "made sin".<a name=73:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I know what people will say, You put it off to the future.<a name=73:11></a> No; I say everything that will be displayed in the future is true to faith now.<a name=73:12></a> The great principle of the present moment is that God gives us now as heavenly light what soon will be our part.<a name=73:13></a> Therefore it is good to faith, although as to the actual display of it I do not doubt at all it refers to the time when Christ

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God give to us to see the greatness of the apostle's ministry, that the great end and aim of it was not simply that the saints might know that they were a forgiven people here in the world, but that they might know how God had annulled the distance which existed between Himself and man, that everything might be put on an absolutely new footing, "All things are become new.<a name=74:5></a> And all things are of God".<a name=74:6></a> That is what I want you to understand.<a name=74:7></a> It is a new starting point from God Himself; the whole thing originated in the thought of God, and God has brought it into effect.<a name=74:8></a> I would to God every one of us might enter into the thought.<a name=74:9></a> It is the knowledge of reconciliation which really constitutes us a holy priesthood.<a name=74:10></a> May God give to us to understand it better in His great grace, and to see the great purpose and end of the apostle's ministry in the gospel, which I think comes before us in this second epistle.<a name=74:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On previous occasions we have had before us the subjects of the gospel and the ministry.<a name=75:1></a> In regard to the gospel, what I was anxious to make clear was the importance of apprehending the truth of it from God's side, as God's glad tidings concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=75:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We had before us on two occasions the subject of the ministry, first the ministry of the new covenant, that is, in the spirit of it, "the Spirit quickens"; then the ministry of reconciliation, how that God had by Christ completely cleared the distance that existed between Himself and man by reason of sin, to the intent, that, on the one hand, He may have His pleasure in man, and on the other hand, that the believer may joy in God.<a name=75:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I purpose touching on another subject.<a name=75:4></a> I think anyone can see that there is in Scripture the idea of a certain progress, and an order in the apprehension of the truth in souls; and the points I want to dwell upon, by the grace of God, are what come before us in this passage, namely, progress and growth.<a name=75:5></a> The first comes out in verse 13, "Until we all arrive".<a name=75:6></a> That I call, for want of a better word, progress, moving forward.<a name=75:7></a> Then in verse 15 we have growth, "That we .<a name=75:8></a>.<a name=75:9></a>.<a name=75:10></a> may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ".<a name=75:11></a> The apostle is speaking here of the purpose for which the gifts are given, but first refers to the exaltation of Christ, for it is one great point in the epistle to the Ephesians that Christ is viewed in His exaltation as Man, as the One who is to fill all things.<a name=75:12></a> We read in chapter 1, the church is "the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=75:13></a> And so here in chapter 4: "He that descended is the same also that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=76>[Page 76]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=76:1></a> I want you to bear the two thoughts in mind, that He is the One that fills all things, and that the church is His fulness.<a name=76:2></a> What I understand by the expression 'His fulness', is that which is proportioned to Himself.<a name=76:3></a> You can understand that if my body were out of proportion to my head, it would be a malformation.<a name=76:4></a> But it is proportioned to my head.<a name=76:5></a> So the church is proportioned to the Head, it is "the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=76:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thought is that Christ has "ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=76:7></a> And then the gifts are given till we all come "unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"; that is, the church is to be proportioned to Him who fills all things.<a name=76:8></a> I would like everybody to get hold of that thought.<a name=76:9></a> I do not know anything much more important than to learn to look at things from the divine side.<a name=76:10></a> The fact is, that we always err when we judge of things from our point of view, we never get a true thought.<a name=76:11></a> To look abroad at the present time on the confusion of christendom and at what is passing under the name of Christ upon earth, would only confound one.<a name=76:12></a> I should get no right or true thought of anything, and should not be any help in the midst of it.<a name=76:13></a> Anyone would be bewildered by the confusion, and division, and strife.<a name=76:14></a> The relief is to see the church in the thought of God.<a name=76:15></a> So also to understand the gospel we must look at it from God's standpoint.<a name=76:16></a> Further, to understand the responsibility of man before God, we must look at man from the point of his departure from God.<a name=76:17></a> And the truth as to the church is not gained by looking at the church, or the history of it, as man might describe it, but by looking at it from the divine point of view, and it is only then one can really be of any help.<a name=76:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak about the gifts in that way, and the purpose of them; for we are told what they
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=77>[Page 77]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are given for, the end in view.<a name=77:1></a> It says, "He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=77:2></a> You see that the first and general object of the gifts is "the perfecting of the saints", by which I understand their completion.<a name=77:3></a> The verb from which the word comes is used sometimes in the sense of restoration.<a name=77:4></a> Evidently that is not the thought here -- but that the saints might be so fitted or complete as that there should not be any deficiency.<a name=77:5></a> The gifts are given for that end; they all come down from the One who fills all things.<a name=77:6></a> He has "ascended up far above all heavens", that is, as I understand it, He is exalted to the right hand of God, to fill all things.<a name=77:7></a> What belongs to Him, is that He is to fill all things, for not only have we to see what has been removed in Christ, but what is established and effectuated in Christ.<a name=77:8></a> Christ is the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world; but there is another thing true also of Him; He baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=77:9></a> The One who removes all that is contrary to God, brings in what is of God, He baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=77:10></a> That is the office of Christ.<a name=77:11></a> Everything is to be brought into moral accord with God; He fills all things; He has ascended up far above all heavens for that purpose.<a name=77:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we learn from 1 Corinthians that every gift is set in the church.<a name=77:13></a> And while the first object of the gifts is "for the perfecting of the saints", their effectiveness branches out in two directions, has a twofold bearing, "for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ".<a name=77:14></a> Not only have the gifts their application to individuals, but the ultimate purpose which is served by them is the edifying, or building

	<div class="paragraph">
		up, of the body of Christ.<a name=78:1></a> All the gifts are to that end; not merely one gift; you cannot in that way distinguish between different gifts as though they had different ends; they are all the evangelist as much as the apostle, and the pastor, and the teacher, for "work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ".<a name=78:2></a> If souls are converted, it is that they may be brought into the body by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=78:3></a> If they have part in the Holy Spirit they must be in the body.<a name=78:4></a> Every believer who receives the gift of the Holy Spirit is baptised into the body.<a name=78:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the point at which we are to arrive, and I dwell on the verse because of its importance.<a name=78:6></a> "Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=78:7></a> There are three main thoughts in the verse.<a name=78:8></a> The first is unity; the second is perfection, maturity or full growth, a perfect man; and the third is stature, that is, the height (we are accustomed to speak of the stature of a man), "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=78:9></a> I wish that I might be enabled to make these three thoughts clear to everyone, because a real apprehension of them will be of great good to us, we shall be more useful here.<a name=78:10></a> It might be said, But what little opportunity there is for carrying out the truth.<a name=78:11></a> I admit it, but it is a very great thing to be in the mind of God down here.<a name=78:12></a> The opportunity for carrying out the mind of God may be very limited; that is just according as God may appoint; but to be here in the mind of God is very important for every one of us.<a name=78:13></a> It is really the only light there is.<a name=78:14></a> And whether the sphere which God appoints to me be small or great, what I covet is to be here in His mind.<a name=78:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the gifts are till we all arrive at unity, that is the first thing, and that is a very great point in Scripture, "Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God".<a name=78:16></a> By "the

	<div class="paragraph">
		faith" I understand the revelation on which Christianity is based, the system of Christian truth; as we get earlier in the chapter, "There is .<a name=79:1></a>.<a name=79:2></a>.<a name=79:3></a> one Lord, one faith, one baptism".<a name=79:4></a> We are to arrive at the unity of the faith, that is, the unity which lies in the apprehension of the faith in the soul, that which the faith is calculated to produce, and there is another point: "of the [clear] knowledge of the Son of God".<a name=79:5></a> The thought of unity governs both ideas; it is "the unity of the faith, and of the [clear] knowledge of the Son of God".<a name=79:6></a> Some would tell us that we are not to know the Son of God at all; that no one can know the Son; but the very point of the passage here is, "the unity of the faith and of the [clear] knowledge of the Son of God".<a name=79:7></a> I accept as fully as anybody that no one can grasp or comprehend the mystery of His Being; "no one knows the Son but the Father"; but "the [clear] knowledge of the Son of God" is of vital importance, for in Him is the revelation of the love of God; no one can understand the love of God except by the clear knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=79:8></a> Peter speaks in connection with Christ of the righteousness of God and the faithfulness of God; but to know anything of what is essential in Christianity, that is, the love of God, we have to get to the Son of God, for it is in the Son that God's love is revealed: "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son".<a name=79:9></a> And then again it is in the Son that we see the satisfaction of God's love, where that love rests in man.<a name=79:10></a> The grace of God attracts our souls to the point where the love of God finds its rest and perfect satisfaction in the One in whom the judgment has been removed.<a name=79:11></a> We sing sometimes
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'Eternal love their portion is, <br>Where love has found its rest'.<a name=79:13></a><a name=79:12></a> (<a href=".<a name=79:14></a>.<a name=79:15></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=79:16></a>htm#178:3">Hymn 178</a>)</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I need hardly say, that just in proportion as the faith and the clear knowledge of the Son of God govern the soul, so far, of necessity, unity is produced;

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		we come to the unity of the faith and of the clear knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=80:1></a> Why do you think that differences exist among saints?<a name=80:2></a> Why do divisions come in?<a name=80:3></a> I believe it is because souls are not going on to the unity of the faith and of the clear knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=80:4></a> Then again, we are often distressed at failure on the part of individuals, cases calling for discipline; do you think any discipline would be needful if souls were really gaining ground in the clear knowledge of the Son of God?<a name=80:5></a> I am convinced of this, that it is the unspiritual who bring in trouble, it is not those who are advancing in the knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=80:6></a> If we were really gaining ground in that knowledge it would have a mighty effect upon us.<a name=80:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing then to be produced by the action of gifts is unity, the unity of the faith and of the clear knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=80:8></a> It is not common agreement, it is not alliance or any expedient of man, but it is unity in the soul, unity in faith, unity of heart.<a name=80:9></a> The more we know of the Son of God and of all that has come to light in Him, the closer we are drawn the one to the other.<a name=80:10></a> The secret of unity evidently, from this passage, lies in "the faith" and in "the [clear] knowledge of the Son of God".<a name=80:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then we come to "a perfect man", a figure taken, I do not doubt, from the human body; that is, a man where there is not only what one might call perfect articulation, the perfect junction of every member, but where every joint, every member, is in vigour; that is what I understand to be "a perfect man", and I connect the thought with chapter 2: 15: "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace".<a name=80:12></a> I understand by it that the divine thought is -- and here again we are reminded of the great importance of viewing all these things from the divine standpoint -- that there is to be one man here, not many men; it

		does not speak of our coming unto 'perfect men', but unto "a perfect man".<a name=81:1></a> And that is what made me refer to chapter 2: 15, it is "one new man".<a name=81:2></a> Looking at things from God's point of view, He sees one man down here; many saints I quite admit, but one man.<a name=81:3></a> You get the same thought in another passage in the same chapter: "That ye put off .<a name=81:4></a>.<a name=81:5></a>.<a name=81:6></a> the old man .<a name=81:7></a>.<a name=81:8></a>.<a name=81:9></a> and that ye put on the new man".<a name=81:10></a> It is not that you have become new men, but you have put on the new man.<a name=81:11></a> The thought of a perfect man takes in, I judge, the whole company of saints in God's point of view.<a name=81:12></a> You may say that such a thought as that can hardly be realised down here; but I say, that is not my business.<a name=81:13></a> My business is to see what the mind of God is, and, as far as God helps me, to seek to promote it; and therefore when I see this truth, I certainly would not connect myself with anything down here upon earth which systematically tends to divide Christians, because we are all to come in the first place to unity, and in the next place to a perfect man.<a name=81:14></a> People may retort upon me, But have you not helped to divide by the very fact of separating from all you were once connected with?<a name=81:15></a> My answer is, the reason that led me to do it was, that I declined to be identified with what <i>in its nature</i> divides Christians.<a name=81:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The perfect man is really where the Spirit is in full vigour and energy in the saints; that is to say, they recognise the bond that binds them one to another: "There is neither Greek nor Jew, .<a name=81:17></a>.<a name=81:18></a>.<a name=81:19></a> Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all".<a name=81:20></a> I think that is a very important point, and I would like the question to be raised with every one of us, whether we are here in the power of the Spirit, whether our souls are really in healthy vigour.<a name=81:21></a> You know what it is for the body to be in healthy vigour; a man then has not his attention drawn to any particular member.<a name=81:22></a> So it is a very great point as Christians for the soul to be in healthy vigour, that is, in the power of the Holy

		There is another point still: "Unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=82:2></a> This shows what the stature is to be, the measure of the stature.<a name=82:3></a> Can anything be more wonderful than that it was the thought of God really to bring that to pass down here?<a name=82:4></a> For the passage, as far as I understand it, has not reference to heaven; but to a result to be effected down here upon earth; that by the ministry of gift there was to be a perfect man here, perfect unity, and the stature of the man was to be the fulness or completeness of Christ; everything, as I said before, to be proportioned to Christ; a man large enough in that sense for every moral quality of Christ to be portrayed in.<a name=82:5></a> That is the idea to my mind of the fulness of Christ; nothing to be displayed there but the moral excellencies of Christ.<a name=82:6></a> The idea is beautifully brought out in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>; seven traits of Christ are enumerated there, beginning with "bowels of mercies", and finishing with love, "which is the bond of perfectness"; making up, so to say, the perfectness of Christ; and then there is "the word of Christ", and "the peace of Christ".<a name=82:7></a> I think that gives to us an idea of what I would call the completeness of Christ, all the moral excellencies and beauty of Christ really portrayed, as it were, in one man down here upon earth, and that one man taking in the thought of all Christians.<a name=82:8></a>

		I pass on now to the thought of growth.<a name=83:11></a> It says, "That we henceforth be no more children" -- the word 'children' would be better rendered 'babes' -- "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ".<a name=83:12></a> We leave the idea of a perfect man, and come now to another thought, and that is growth to the Head, we are no longer to be babes.<a name=83:13></a> I think anyone can understand the idea of a babe; a babe is one who is very easily blown over; a strong wind would suffice: we are no longer to be babes, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every

		wind of doctrine.<a name=84:1></a> One of the most painful things we see, when troubles come along, is the sad way in which people listen to what this person says and that person says.<a name=84:2></a> The fact is, they are not established in the truth of God, and therefore they are liable to be blown over by any "wind of doctrine" and by "unprincipled cunning" -- that is what is spoken of here -- "with a view to systematized error".<a name=84:3></a> I believe that if we were established in the truth of God, we should reject all these efforts.<a name=84:4></a> Nothing is more pernicious to saints than the practice of listening to what everybody has to say, instead of seeking to get a judgment of things from God.<a name=84:5></a> We are no longer to be "babes", "but speaking the truth in love".<a name=84:6></a> Now that word "speaking the truth" is a difficult expression; "speaking the truth" or "holding the truth" does not give exactly the idea; the idea is nearer to this, being true in love; not simply being sincere, that would not adequately convey the thought; but being true as the effect of being under the power of truth.<a name=84:7></a> It may be asked, What is truth?<a name=84:8></a> I do not know that everybody has quite solved that question; but I will give you a very simple definition of truth which I could prove to you from Scripture: truth is what may be known of God.<a name=84:9></a> Therefore there may be a certain measure of truth even where there is no revelation; and God holds man responsible on that ground, because there is a manifestation of truth even in created things; I do not mean truth which could save a soul; that is not the point, but truth which forms a basis for the responsibility of man.<a name=84:10></a> "What is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them"; that is truth.<a name=84:11></a> But the principle holds good in regard to revelation; truth is what may be known of God; that is, what is revealed of God; hence Christ is the truth.<a name=84:12></a> So, too, we have "the word of the truth of the gospel"; that is, the gospel is a revelation of God.<a name=84:13></a> Now what I understand by being true,

		or holding the truth, is this, that the soul is under the power of truth, it is in the light of the blessed revelation of God, it holds the truth in love.<a name=85:1></a> I know what God is; the love of God is shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit that is given to me; I am in the joy of the truth, the light of the knowledge of God has penetrated to and governs my heart, and I am in it and in response to the love, and I hold the truth, in that sense, in love.<a name=85:2></a> That is the first condition, what I should call the divine nature in exercise in the Christian.<a name=85:3></a> You have to begin there; you cannot talk about growth until you have got the first condition needful to growth, holding the truth in love.<a name=85:4></a> The word "holding the truth" is only used twice in Scripture.<a name=85:5></a> The apostle uses it also in Galatians, where he says, "Am I .<a name=85:6></a>.<a name=85:7></a>.<a name=85:8></a> become your enemy because I tell you the truth?<a name=85:9></a>"

		By growth I understand growth in intelligence; I do not think it is connected exactly with a perfect man; but you grow in spiritual intelligence to the head; because the head, as I understand it, represents the intelligence.<a name=85:10></a> My head represents my intelligence, but my intelligence really comes out through the body.<a name=85:11></a> And I think the same holds good with regard to the body of Christ, the Head is the intelligence; all the light is there, as is brought out in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>"Ye are complete" in Christ; all spiritual, all divine light is there.<a name=85:12></a> If you want to understand Scripture, the thought which must govern your soul is Christ, because all the Scriptures testify of Christ, all the light and intelligence of Scripture is expressed and centred in Christ; the Lord expounded to the disciples out of the scripture "the things concerning himself".<a name=85:13></a> Holding the truth in love, we are to grow up in spiritual intelligence, to be according to the head; we are to comprehend "the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know" -- mark those two words, "to comprehend" and "to know", in the prayer in

		Looking abroad, I could not understand readily that the body of Christ is cared for.<a name=86:13></a> But I should make the mistake of looking at things from my standpoint.<a name=86:14></a> We must look at things from the divine standpoint; and when we do that, we understand that the Head cares for the body.<a name=86:15></a> My head cares for my body; what would my body do without the thought of the head?<a name=86:16></a> And so it is in regard to the body of Christ, the body would be very poorly cared for but for the Head.<a name=86:17></a> The confusion and division of Christendom does not alter the relation of the body to the Head, or of the

		We have had before us, on former occasions, first the truth of the gospel as presented in the beginning of Romans; then the ministry of the new covenant and of reconciliation; and last time we had the subject of growth and progress in the saints.<a name=88:1></a> What I desire to speak of now as a close is the subject of display, because it is there that hope has its place in the hearts of saints.<a name=88:2></a> The apostle in the epistles to the Thessalonians introduces the three words, 'faith', 'love' and 'hope', in more than one connection.<a name=88:3></a> He remembers their "work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope"; and at the close of the first epistle he exhorts them to "put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation".<a name=88:4></a> In the passage I have read the hope is again in view in connection with the government of God and the coming of the Lord, "when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe .<a name=88:5></a>.<a name=88:6></a>.<a name=88:7></a> in that day".<a name=88:8></a> It is that point I want now to dwell upon, the hope of the Christian; that is, the coming of the Lord.<a name=88:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But when I speak about the coming of the Lord, you must not misunderstand what I mean.<a name=89:6></a> I am not referring to the rapture, but to the coming of Christ in glory; He comes to establish the kingdom.<a name=89:7></a> For though it is well to be here in faith, and to cherish the privileges of Christianity, yet the apostle says, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable".<a name=89:8></a> It is well for the Christian to have on "the breastplate of faith and love"; but he wants "for an helmet, the hope of salvation"; he awaits in hope the crown of it all; if he is to suffer here with Christ, he needs to know that he is going to reign with Him.<a name=89:9></a> The Christian is not to be left out in the day of His glory, when He comes "to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed".<a name=89:10></a> The two marks of the people of God at the present moment are, they are saints, holy, and they believe.<a name=89:11></a>

		Now it is needful to remark first that the present is not a time of display, save in a moral sense, and more than that, that display is not the great subject of the New Testament.<a name=89:12></a> It is necessarily brought in to complete the revelation; but the great part of the writings of the New Testament refer to Christianity, that is, to what is connected with the presence and power of the Spirit here.<a name=89:13></a> When we get to heaven, we shall not want Scripture; then we shall know as we are known, we shall not want guidance and instruction then as to Christianity and as to present things, the time of it will all be passed; but now we have Scripture as our

		There are one or two passages in Scripture which will, I think, substantiate what I have said.<a name=90:3></a> For instance, in the parable in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>of the treasure hid in the field, the Finder who buys the field hides the treasure, it does not come out into manifestation.<a name=90:4></a> You get the same thought in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>, "Your life is hid with Christ in God"; it is not yet manifested.<a name=90:5></a> And again, in chapter 3 of the first epistle of John: "What we shall be has not yet been manifested".<a name=90:6></a> That marks the position of the Christian, and the position of the Christian properly answers to the position of Christ, for Christ is hid; Christ has been called to sit at the right hand of God until His foes are made His footstool; He is hid in God.<a name=90:7></a> The moment Christ leaves the Father's throne it will alter everything; there will be no more church here, the Spirit will have gone, but there will be the development of other things entirely.<a name=90:8></a> When Christ begins to exercise power, everything is changed.<a name=90:9></a> The first effect of His power is seen in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>.<a name=90:10></a> He will change our vile bodies into the fashion of His body of glory.<a name=90:11></a> But for the present, Christ is hid in God; and therefore it is the time when the treasure is hid.<a name=90:12></a> When in fact, Christianity became conspicuous in the world, it was inflated and corrupt.<a name=90:13></a> When it appeared as a mustard tree it was a corrupt system; it was "like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened".<a name=90:14></a> The fact of Christianity being a great conspicuous system in the world is nothing to glory in.<a name=90:15></a> It proves it to be false to the truth that the treasure is hid.<a name=90:16></a> Christianity is not a thing of the world, it does not belong to the world, it does not, in a sense, properly belong to time, but to another scene.<a name=90:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is a very great point to bear in mind that there is to be display.<a name=91:6></a> What I mean by that is that Christ is to be glorified in the scene from which He has been rejected.<a name=91:7></a> And the heart of the Christian cherishes the thought that He should be glorified here.<a name=91:8></a> The apostle says, "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing".<a name=91:9></a> The expression, "all them also that love his appearing" does not, I judge, refer to any particular class in Christianity; it is a description of the proper, normal feeling of the Christian; that is, the Christian loves the appearing of Christ.<a name=91:10></a> The same may be said of the passage, "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation".<a name=91:11></a> The point on which I am dwelling is, that the Christian loves and looks for the appearing of Christ; and if a person does not, I should doubt that person being a real Christian, he is but a counterfeit.<a name=91:12></a> There is another passage, giving us the voice of the bride, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=91:13></a> All these expressions refer to His appearing, His coming in glory; John's great point in the Revelation is to bring Christ again to the earth, which is to be for God.<a name=91:14></a> In the beginning of John's gospel Christ is seen as "the Lamb of God,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now for a moment to show how the coming of the Lord connects itself with the righteousness of God; it is so looked at in this chapter, and especially in regard to the saints.<a name=92:7></a> You do not get the display of the righteousness of God until the coming of the Lord; though faith may know it now.<a name=92:8></a> The apostle expected the crown of righteousness; he had not got it yet; he was justified by faith, but he waited, having finished his course here, for the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, would give him at that day; he looked for the consummation of the righteousness of God.<a name=92:9></a> As far as I understand the matter, the righteousness of God in its application to the saints is connected with two thoughts, namely, grace and government, and it is very important indeed to distinguish the two.<a name=92:10></a> When it is a question of grace, righteousness is seen in the answer which God gives to the work of Christ, and that is common to every Christian.<a name=92:11></a> When it is a question of government, the righteousness of God gives the answer to the Christian's course here, and thus connects itself with the kingdom.<a name=92:12></a> The one thought is connected with the coming of the Lord, and the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>: "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=93:3></a> That is not a question of government, but of grace; "Whom he justified, them he also glorified"; "glorified" follows in the line of "justified".<a name=93:4></a> And the simple reason of it is this, that the glory of saints is just as much as justification the righteous fruit of and answer to what Christ has suffered for them.<a name=93:5></a> There is another scripture in which the righteousness of God is identified with grace; "so also grace might reign through righteousness".<a name=93:6></a> That is not a question of government: there is nothing of government in it; but it is the economy of grace founded on righteousness.<a name=93:7></a> God has already given the answer in Christ, to the work which Christ accomplished.<a name=93:8></a> We find in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him; if God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him".<a name=93:9></a> But then it is not enough that the answer should be seen in Christ's glory, because "He hath made him to be sin FOR US, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him"; and therefore the answer is displayed in those for whom Christ was made sin.<a name=93:10></a> And I understand that God appeals to it as His righteous answer to Christ's work.<a name=93:11></a> Now that is no question of government, but to us of pure grace, which gives to every Christian a place in glory.<a name=93:12></a> That is the sense in which I understand the apostle to be waiting on the principle of faith for the hope of righteousness.<a name=93:13></a> It is a great thing to be distinct and clear in your thoughts of grace and government, and to distinguish between the righteousness of God as connected with grace and as connected with government; otherwise you may get into great confusion.<a name=93:14></a> I heard only today

		that it is becoming a very common idea that only those who are really looking for the coming of the Lord will be caught up at the rapture.<a name=94:1></a> Such an idea is an entire falsification of the righteousness of God, because our place in heaven does not hang on our faithfulness, but is the pure fruit of the grace in which we are justified; it is of the righteousness of God, which gives full effect and a full answer in the saints to what Christ has accomplished; it raises the question of His having been made sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=94:2></a> And to mix up the rapture with the question of our faithfulness, or anything of the kind, is practically to deny the truth of new creation; because if we are going to heaven, we do not go in connection with our faithfulness here; we go there as a new creation, "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation".<a name=94:3></a> There is even now the putting on "the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness".<a name=94:4></a> And it is in that connection that you are made fit for your place in heaven, that you are really glorified.<a name=94:5></a>

		But in looking at the righteousness of God as it connects itself with the thought of government, I quite admit you have the answer in it to the path of the Christian here.<a name=94:6></a> This principle continually comes out in Scripture: "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him", "If .<a name=94:7></a>.<a name=94:8></a>.<a name=94:9></a> we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together".<a name=94:10></a> The same principle is brought out in this chapter: "It is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with us".<a name=94:11></a> It comes out here as a question of righteousness.<a name=94:12></a> What we get in the kingdom is the recompense of God to our pathway here.<a name=94:13></a> God does not give up His government in regard to saints.<a name=94:14></a> It has been said of the thief on the cross that he has as good a place in paradise as any other, because that is a question of God's answer to the work of Christ; but he will not

		be conspicuous in the kingdom, for his suffering here could not be spoken of as suffering with Christ; he was suffering for his misdeeds, and that is not suffering with Christ.<a name=95:1></a> We become conspicuous in the kingdom just in proportion to our faithfulness in suffering with Christ down here; but then it is a question of the kingdom, and the righteousness of God in His government; it is not a question of grace because that is founded on the work which Christ has accomplished, and is in a new creation.<a name=95:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this point of the righteousness of God in His government is a very important truth to maintain.<a name=95:3></a> It comes out very specially in this chapter, and is what led me to take up the subject.<a name=95:4></a> These poor Thessalonians were thought nothing of upon the earth; they were persecuted on account of their faith and faithfulness; but the apostle gives them as the answer to it that Christ was "to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe".<a name=95:5></a> They were but poor things down here; persecution had been stirred up by the Jews, and had fallen upon them; but they stood firm, and their faith and patience in the persecutions which they endured were an evident token of the righteous judgment of God, that they should be "counted worthy of the kingdom"; it is not a question of grace, but of God's righteous government.<a name=95:6></a> Doubtless it was the power and grace of God that maintained them in faith and patience!<a name=95:7></a> Faith and patience are not principles in repute in the world; they will not tend to worldly progress, and the world does not appreciate them; but in faith and patience the power of God is displayed.<a name=95:8></a> You find the same thing in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>; what comes out in the main part of that chapter is the endurance of faith.<a name=95:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I have now said enough to show you the great importance of distinguishing between the rapture and the appearing of the Lord.<a name=95:10></a> It is in the rapture that we get the answer to what Christ has accomplished;

		<a name=96>[Page 96]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it is in the rapture we get our place in heaven, it is then we are caught up to be with the Lord.<a name=96:1></a> The rapture does not raise the question of government, but is, as I understand it, a pure question of grace, that by which saints are ushered into heaven.<a name=96:2></a> Then comes the question of government; first, the judgment-seat of Christ, and then the kingdom.<a name=96:3></a> It is after we are taken to heaven that we have to pass before the judgment-seat of Christ, and that our places relatively are determined; after that we come with Christ when Christ comes "to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe".<a name=96:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I return to the thought that Christ is coming to be glorified and to be wondered at.<a name=96:5></a> In a certain sense, He was wondered at when He was down here upon earth, but He was not glorified; He was personally despised, but He is going to be glorified and to be wondered at in the saints.<a name=96:6></a> I think every Christian heart welcomes the thought that Christ is going to be glorified.<a name=96:7></a> He has been dishonoured here, and in every way treated with ignominy, known only as put to reproach and shame; but He is going to be glorified in the saints, those who come with Him, and to be wondered at in all them that believe, those who have suffered with Him.<a name=96:8></a> The universe, I suppose, will be astounded at what will be manifest in that day when the saints come in His company.<a name=96:9></a> Enoch prophesied of it: "The Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints".<a name=96:10></a> Those who have been thought nothing of here upon earth, and who have been looked upon and despised as saints and as believing, come with Christ, and He is glorified in them.<a name=96:11></a> Why?<a name=96:12></a> "Because our testimony among you was believed".<a name=96:13></a> It was the apostle's testimony which brought the Thessalonians into the place of faith; and now they had to look forward to the coming of the Lord.<a name=96:14></a> It is that with which the work of grace is connected, and hence you get the apostle's prayer in consequence of it, that God

		would fulfil in them "all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power".<a name=97:1></a> If you and I thought that Christ was to be glorified in us, we should covet that the work of faith might go on, that His name might be glorified in us now.<a name=97:2></a> And if Christ is going to be glorified in me, I do not want to be glorified in myself, I do not want to have any present glory, to be conspicuous in the present; I would be content to be hid.<a name=97:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And mark this, He is to be wondered at in <i>all</i> them that believe; which proves that all must have part in it.<a name=97:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to say a word or two as to the effect of the coming of the Lord.<a name=97:5></a> To begin with, He comes as Lord, and as Lord He brings into the world the blessings which He administers from God, which faith enjoys now.<a name=97:6></a> What is true to faith now in the Lord will then be brought in a public way into the world; for instance, peace and favour and reconciliation are all true to faith now; but when the Lord comes to reign, He destroys the oppressor, and He comes in as the Prince of Peace; He brings peace and the favour of God into the scene, and all is reconciled in Him, the distance which separated the world from God is removed, and God is brought, as it were, into complacency with the scene, because all is administered here by the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=97:7></a> It is the day of His glory; and, as I have sought to bring out on previous occasions, He is the minister of all the good which is in the heart of God towards man; He brings that good here into the scene.<a name=97:8></a> How could it be otherwise?<a name=97:9></a> He is "the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world", and the One who does that is "He who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=97:10></a> The two trees, the tree of responsibility and the tree of life are conciliated in Him; He took up the responsibility, and He is the Prince of Life; the two things meet in His Person.<a name=97:11></a> The good which is now known to faith He will bring
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in a public way into this world; and that is what His coming means.<a name=98:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then He brings into this world the blessings of God's kingdom.<a name=98:2></a> We are told that "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost"; but those things that we enjoy in the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ will administer in a public way in the world: righteousness, peace, and joy will reign in the world in that day.<a name=98:3></a> It will be the reign of righteousness, "judgment shall return unto righteousness", and the effect of righteousness is peace and joy.<a name=98:4></a> When good is maintained publicly in power, and evil is repressed, then you get peace and joy, which are the proper effects of righteousness.<a name=98:5></a> To maintain what are called the rights of man in the present day needs very elaborate and constant legislation.<a name=98:6></a> Parliament has to meet, session after session, and for long sessions, not to seek to maintain the rights of God but the rights of man, and legislation becomes increasingly cumbrous and elaborate as the relations of men become more artificial.<a name=98:7></a> What does that prove?<a name=98:8></a> That God has not got His rights, and therefore legislation as to men is difficult and unsatisfactory.<a name=98:9></a> Supposing God had His rights, and men loved God with all their hearts, do you think elaborate legislation would be wanted as between men?<a name=98:10></a> When man loves God with all his heart it becomes simple to love his neighbour as himself; and when man loves his neighbour as himself, then you will not want elaborate legislation to maintain the rights of man; it will all be simple.<a name=98:11></a> But that means the establishment of righteousness; righteousness is to rule, and what the Christian enjoys now in the power of the Holy Spirit will then be publicly ministered in this world by the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=98:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And there is another thing which will come to pass then.<a name=98:13></a> Christ is the Mediator of the new covenant which He will establish then.<a name=98:14></a> The law will be written

	<div class="paragraph">
		in the heart of Israel in that day, and the effect of it will be the knowledge of God in mercy and forgiveness, and a nature which is capable of keeping the law.<a name=99:1></a> It is not like a man in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>that delights in the law of God after the inward man, and consents to the law of God with his mind; but the law is written in their heart, and the consequence is that they not only delight in the law of God but they fulfil it: "I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more".<a name=99:2></a> Jesus comes in as the Mediator of the new covenant; He bore the transgressions which were under the first covenant in order that He might be the Mediator of the new covenant.<a name=99:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come to one point more, the effect of the Lord's coming on creation itself.<a name=99:4></a> The earnest expectation of the creature will be realised, will have its answer, when Christ comes "to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe", and not till then.<a name=99:5></a> I suppose there will be an immense relief in this scene from the bondage of corruption.<a name=99:6></a> The whole creation labours in bondage until now; but we are told it will be brought "into the liberty of the glory of the children of God".<a name=99:7></a> Not into the glory of the children of God; it never can have that place, for the children of God properly belong to heaven; but into the liberty, as I understand it, which belongs to the children of God.<a name=99:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have referred to these things just to show what the effect will be of the coming of Christ again into this scene.<a name=99:9></a> I think it is a point of the greatest moment, and what Christians ought to have before them.<a name=99:10></a> One would be thankful to see revived in all our souls the truth of the coming of the Lord, and what His coming means.<a name=99:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Only one word more and I have done.<a name=100:5></a> The practical outcome of it to us is this, to seek that what is spoken of here, the good pleasure of God's goodness, may be fulfilled in us.<a name=100:6></a> It is a beautiful expression, "the good pleasure of his goodness"; I think the apostle delighted in expressions of that character.<a name=100:7></a> It is a great thing to get the idea in the heart that there is goodness in God, and that He fulfils in us "the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power".<a name=100:8></a> It is not simply believing certain truths, but there is "the work of faith", that is, there is a process going on in saints, what may be called the work of the Spirit in them.<a name=100:9></a> The work of faith cannot begin till the Spirit of God is in the saint; but once He is there, then the work of faith begins, and the object of it is "that the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified in us, and we in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=100:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God give us really a great interest in what is going on at the present moment, and in the whole range of ministry.<a name=100:11></a> It is very important to understand what ministry is, and to see what the present effect of it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to dwell a little on this and succeeding occasions, as the Lord may enable me, on the truth of the church, looked at in its different aspects, for it is very evident that the church is presented to us in Scripture in more aspects than one.<a name=102:1></a> For instance, in this chapter (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>) it is noticeable that the apostle, beginning from the top, that is, Christ exalted as Head over all things, presents the church as His body, and afterwards as growing into a holy temple -- just the reverse order to Corinthians, where he begins with the temple, and goes on afterwards to speak of the body.<a name=102:2></a> In Ephesians the apostle presents first the body; then he gives us the temple at the close of chapter 2; and finally Jew and Gentile "builded together for an habitation of God by the Spirit".<a name=102:3></a> And I think I can understand the object in this order, for in unfolding the whole scope of what God has effected in Christ, it is necessary to begin from the Head, and then the thought of the body is introduced as His fulness, and from the body the Spirit works down to what is the present status of the church, that is Jew and Gentile "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit".<a name=102:4></a> Each successive truth is dependent on the preceding.<a name=102:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Tonight I take up the truth of the body, first as it is seen in Ephesians, and then as it is viewed in Corinthians.<a name=102:6></a> The distinction is this: in Ephesians we get the truth of the body on the heavenly side, in what it is to Christ; in Corinthians we get it more on the earthward side (I do not know how better to put it), in its present aspect as the vessel of the Spirit here upon earth.<a name=102:7></a> For it is introduced in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, as I understand it, in connection with the manifestations of the Spirit, "Ye are the body of Christ, and
	</div>

		members in particular"; and then, God has set various gifts in the assembly viewed in that way as the body.<a name=103:1></a> The subject of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>is the manifestations of the Spirit.<a name=103:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want just to notice, what I may enlarge upon on another occasion, that if we look at the apostle Paul's work (I do not speak now about his work in the gospel, but his church work), we find a foundation spoken of as laid in Corinth, and the chief corner-stone presented in Ephesus.<a name=103:3></a> Corinth was the beginning of the apostle's work when he went distinctly on his own line.<a name=103:4></a> Up to that point he had been working, to a very large extent, in connection with Jerusalem as a church centre.<a name=103:5></a> But Corinth appears to be the distinct starting-point of his work upon the line of the particular revelation given to him.<a name=103:6></a> In the first epistle to the Corinthians the apostle speaks of himself "as a wise master builder"; we sometimes render the word in English, by 'architect'.<a name=103:7></a> What I understand by the expression is, that when he laid the foundation he had the plan of the edifice before him.<a name=103:8></a> In natural things, when the first stone of the building is laid, the architect sees the whole building, while other people, who know nothing about the plan, merely see the first stone.<a name=103:9></a> Then he tells us what the foundation was, "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ".<a name=103:10></a> Ephesus was the climax of the apostle's work and testimony in connection with the church, and that is necessarily the point of departure when failure comes in.<a name=103:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It exercised my mind somewhat, in speaking of the church, on which side I should begin, whether from the top or the bottom.<a name=103:12></a> But I thought it better to begin from the top, that is, from the body as presented to us in Ephesians, and then to work down to Corinthians, because I think that is the divine way.<a name=103:13></a> If anyone wanted to understand in the type of the tabernacle what the brazen altar imported, he would
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=104>[Page 104]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		have to begin properly from the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat.<a name=104:1></a> If you were approaching God from man's side, you must come by the brazen altar; but if you want to have intelligence about the brazen altar, then you have to begin from the divine end, from which God began in describing the tabernacle and its furniture, from the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat.<a name=104:2></a> And therefore, on the same principle, in speaking of the body of Christ, I prefer to begin from the top, from what it is in its relation to the Head, as presented to us in the Ephesians.<a name=104:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By the Lord's help, I will try to give you two or three suggestive thoughts in connection with what comes out in these two chapters of Ephesians, and will then speak a little on the other side of the truth as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, where the truth of the body comes out in a very practical way.<a name=104:4></a> I do not think that Christians who ignore that chapter make very much progress.<a name=104:5></a> Sects and systems, it is very evident, ignore it, for the simple reason that they are avowedly sectarian.<a name=104:6></a> Every Christian denomination is sectarian.<a name=104:7></a> No state church can be universal, because it cannot properly go beyond the limits of the particular country to which it belongs.<a name=104:8></a> The only universal system is Roman Catholicism, which in the Christian point of view is apostasy.<a name=104:9></a> It is clear that in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>you cannot find sectarianism, or any justification of it; it is "one Spirit .<a name=104:10></a>.<a name=104:11></a>.<a name=104:12></a> one body".<a name=104:13></a> And I have no hesitation in saying that where there is the ignoring of this truth, and where restrictions are placed upon the liberty of the Spirit of God, Christians will not get much light.<a name=104:14></a> I do not un-christianise them for a moment; for if there had not been some light to be got, none of us would be where we are, nor even converted.<a name=104:15></a> But the professing church has lost the truth of the body completely, and has in fact ignored the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=104:16></a> And until Christians leave sectarianism, and all of that order, and come to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=105>[Page 105]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		where there is liberty for the Spirit of God to act, they will enjoy but little light.<a name=105:1></a> Depend upon it, no greater evil has been done, no greater insult offered to the Lord than in ignoring the presence of the Spirit sent by Him from the Father.<a name=105:2></a> And it is astonishing how easily we too may drop into it.<a name=105:3></a> People will substitute all sorts of things for the Holy Spirit: a clergy, or a ministry, or formality or order; but I trust we have returned to the recognition of the presence of the Holy Spirit here, and with it to the manifestations of the Spirit.<a name=105:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire now to suggest two or three thoughts in connection with the truth of the body as it is presented to us in Ephesians.<a name=105:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The beginning of it is the Head; and the first thought that is introduced is the power which has set the Head in His place.<a name=105:6></a> That is, the power that "wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places", and "gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=105:7></a> It is the power of God which has been effective in Christ, to set Him in the place of Head over all.<a name=105:8></a> There could not be any church until Christ was set in this place of Head; you could not talk about the body until the Head was there.<a name=105:9></a> God's power has come out in two special things: first in raising Christ from the dead, and secondly in setting Him at His own right hand as man in the heavenly places, far above all principality and every name; and He has given Him "Head over all things", which is the accomplishment, as has been often pointed out, of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, "to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him which filleth all in all".<a name=105:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I dare say we are all instructed as to the Head; but I am sure one cannot do harm in recurring for a moment to the truth.<a name=105:11></a> It was in the eternal purpose of God that He was to be Head to the body: but now
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has set Him in His place as such, and every Christian is united to Christ.<a name=106:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I pass on to speak of the body, I want to give an idea of what union means, for it is a great point to start with.<a name=106:2></a> And I would remark here that we have no option whatever about our place in the church.<a name=106:3></a> A great many people in the present day -- I do not speak of people that we are more intimately connected with -- are taken up to a large extent with Christian activity, and ignore the church.<a name=106:4></a> But I say you have no option as to the church, because every Christian is united to Christ, though every Christian does not understand union, and does not get all the present good of it.<a name=106:5></a> But no one can rightly ignore the truth of the church as Christ's body, because whether you know it or not, you are united to Christ if you have the Holy Spirit.<a name=106:6></a> And hence the apostle can say to the Corinthians, "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit".<a name=106:7></a> It is certain, in regard to the most uninstructed Christian, that he is united to Christ if he has received the Holy Spirit.<a name=106:8></a> It is a great thing to know the value of union, but that does not touch the fact of union.<a name=106:9></a> I should not be entitled to seek to understand union if I were not united; I could not understand it if I had not the thing itself, but being united I may seek to understand what the import of union is.<a name=106:10></a>

		Now to guard against misapprehension, I feel it needful to say this -- that when I speak of union, I do not mean union in the sense of marriage.<a name=106:11></a> Marriage has sometimes been spoken of as the declaration of union, but I do not get that now.<a name=106:12></a> The church is espoused as a chaste virgin to Christ, and has the bride-place in that way; but when I speak of union I mean organic union as of the members of a body to the head.<a name=106:13></a> It is very evident the Head was there before ever there was the body at all.<a name=106:14></a> Christ was set at God's right hand in the heavenly places before the

		Holy Spirit was given; and when the Holy Spirit was given, then union was effected; it took place on the day of Pentecost.<a name=107:1></a> I do not think the 120 in the upper room on the day of Pentecost understood union, but they were nonetheless united; for every one received the Holy Spirit, and by the fact of receiving the Holy Spirit, they were united to the Head in heaven.<a name=107:2></a> The revelation of the truth of it had not yet come out.<a name=107:3></a> It was given to Paul, not to Peter or John, to complete the word of God; and he completed the word of God, I believe, by the truth of the body.<a name=107:4></a> That had not come out at first, and yet the body was formed.<a name=107:5></a> And it is most important to hold this fast; because if union is made dependent on the intelligence or understanding of union, it would be turning things upside down.<a name=107:6></a> It is a very important principle in divine things, that you understand the words by the thing, and if you have not got the thing, you cannot understand the words.<a name=107:7></a> Unless a man is born again, he cannot understand what being born again means.<a name=107:8></a> It is so with a great many other things.<a name=107:9></a> And unless a man is united to Christ by the Holy Spirit, it is totally impossible that he could understand what union means.<a name=107:10></a>

		The first great truth which comes out here as to the church is that it is the fulness of Christ; that is the place which the church has, "his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=107:11></a> What I understand by it is this, that the church is proportioned morally to the One that fills all in all, it is His fulness -- a very wonderful thing.<a name=107:12></a> I do not think any vessel will adequately display Christ save the church.<a name=107:13></a> And when it comes out, no one will be able to say that the body is disproportioned to the Head; it will all be the work of God.<a name=107:14></a> The Head fills all in all -- that is what I might call the function of the Head; He will fill all things; Christ will fill the universe with good and with blessing, the fruits of redemption.<a name=107:15></a> He is the tree of life, and every family will live by Him; but every family will

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think that anything short of the body could display the Head, or that Christ could be displayed in one saint.<a name=108:2></a> Christ may be displayed in every saint in measure, but for an adequate display of Christ you must have the whole body.<a name=108:3></a> The body is His completeness -- it is that which is adequate for the display of the Head.<a name=108:4></a> The thought of the body here is not as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>there it speaks of the body at any given moment upon earth; but here it is the body in the very fullest sense, it tells you what the church is, its proper place, the completeness of Him that fills all in all.<a name=108:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to the next point, to see how the truth of the body has been effectuated in saints.<a name=108:6></a> It says in verse 5 of chapter 2, "Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=108:7></a> There is one expression in this passage used as to us which is not applied to Christ.<a name=108:8></a> And there are two expressions applied to us which are first stated of Christ.<a name=108:9></a> Christ is not here spoken of as quickened, but as raised and seated at God's right hand in heavenly places.<a name=108:10></a> And we get in regard to the saints, "hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"; that is, that the power which has been applied to Christ has operated in us, and what God has effected in Christ is true for the saints.<a name=108:11></a> Therefore you have to take the statement in two parts; first, as to what has been effected in us, in that we are quickened together with Christ, and then that what has been effected in Christ is true also for the saints.<a name=108:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I desire to show you where the truth of union lies.<a name=108:13></a> I tried to make it plain at the beginning that every saint is united to Christ, because every saint is

		<a name=109>[Page 109]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in possession of the Spirit.<a name=109:1></a> But where the truth and secret of union lies is in the fact of a moral being in the saints, which has been derived from Christ; that is, that having been quickened together with Christ, we have received a being which puts us in association with Christ.<a name=109:2></a> In other words, it is like Eve being taken out of Adam; she got, in a sense, her being from Adam.<a name=109:3></a> So, too, the church gets its being from Christ: it has often been said that the church does not add anything to Christ, because it is derived from Christ.<a name=109:4></a> And that is what, I judge, the apostle means when be says, He "hath quickened us together with Christ".<a name=109:5></a> It does not say, as in Romans, the Spirit is life; but in Colossians and Ephesians the saints are viewed not only as having received the Spirit of life, but the power of the Spirit has taken effect in them, and the apostle can go so far in regard to them as to say that they are quickened together with Christ, can view them as in a faith state in anticipation of what will be their actual state at the coming of Christ; and in this state they live with God in association with Christ, according as Christ lives with God; and that is where the secret of union really lies.<a name=109:6></a> As I said before, I am not denying the fact that every one that has the Holy Spirit is united; and the principle of everything that God has for us lies in the Holy Spirit.<a name=109:7></a> The apostle adds afterwards, "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them".<a name=109:8></a> He touches another side of the truth there; they had put off the old man, and put on the new, which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth, they were now partakers of the divine nature.<a name=109:9></a> The power of the Spirit had become not only effective towards them, not only were there fleshy tables of the heart, and a real writing of Christ, as in the Corinthians, but there was the actual formation of a moral being, in virtue of which they now lived in association with Christ.<a name=109:10></a>

		The apostle is leading on to it when he says to the Galatians, "I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you", that is, until they were brought into the true Christian state.<a name=110:3></a> And that is what the apostle was continually labouring at.<a name=110:4></a> What a wonderful thought it is that a believer not only has the Holy Spirit communicated to him, but that the power of the Holy Spirit in him has made him a partaker of the divine nature.<a name=110:5></a> Union could not be but on that ground.<a name=110:6></a> How could you be joined to Christ save as quickened together with Him?<a name=110:7></a> I admit that the same power which quickens you together with Him unites you to Him; but I say the enjoyment or understanding of union with Christ could not possibly be if you were not conscious that you were of a new order by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=110:8></a> Union is not in the flesh; we are not united to Christ in the flesh, or as men in the flesh; "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit", and the truth of union clearly lies in the Spirit.<a name=110:9></a> If the fact of being quickened together with Christ is once apprehended, I can soon take in the other points, that the power of God which has been put in operation in regard to Christ applies to me as being part of Himself and united to Him: Jew and Gentile have been raised up together, and made to "sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=110:10></a> We never could have been united to Christ simply as Jew and Gentile, but we are united in connection with a totally new spiritual being from Christ, who is at God's right hand.<a name=110:11></a> You can understand it as I said from the figure of Eve.<a name=110:12></a> God took her out of the man, and builded her into a woman.<a name=110:13></a> And so it says of the church, "We are members of his body"; and that is where the truth of union lies.<a name=110:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		and that is, that God has effected all this for His own satisfaction.<a name=111:1></a> It says in verse 7, "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus".<a name=111:2></a> The fact is, that the motive spring which led God to do it was love.<a name=111:3></a> God would have us in His own company, in His own place.<a name=111:4></a> It has been said that what love values is company.<a name=111:5></a> God acted from love.<a name=111:6></a> I could not possibly tell why God loved us in that way, but that is what Scripture states, "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us", would have us there, in His own abode, in heavenly places; and therefore it is really for His own satisfaction.<a name=111:7></a> If you accept the truth that God is absolutely good and blessed, then what He does for His own pleasure must be absolutely good and blessed too, and He has done this for His own pleasure.<a name=111:8></a>

		I hope you will bear in mind, by the grace of God, the two or three thoughts I have tried to bring before you in regard to the church on what I may call the heavenly side; for the more you enter into it, the better you will understand God, and the better you understand God, the more you will be able to apprehend the truth.<a name=111:9></a> It is remarkable how things act and re-act.<a name=111:10></a> The more I understand the truth of the church, the more I see that the springs are in God, and the more I enter into the knowledge of God, "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him", the better I can understand the truth of the church.<a name=111:11></a> The first thing is the Head, and where God has set Him.<a name=111:12></a> Then the body, which is His fulness, proportioned to Him where, and as He is; and then how God has wrought to make it effective in us.<a name=111:13></a> And all is eventually for His own satisfaction.<a name=111:14></a> That is what the church is, as presented to us in Ephesians, and that is the climax of the apostle's work.<a name=111:15></a> Here you have unfolded the counsel of God, and how God has given effect to His counsel.<a name=111:16></a>

		If you turn now to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, we shall view the body on the other side.<a name=112:1></a> The subject of the chapter is concerning spiritual gifts -- "spiritual manifestations", gives more the right idea -- "concerning spiritual manifestations, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant"; the proof of this is in verse 7: "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal".<a name=112:2></a> Then in verse 11 it says, "All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will".<a name=112:3></a> Then the apostle brings in the truth of the body, because the great point is that the manifestations of the Spirit are in the body, that there are no manifestations of the Spirit, nor are there any gifts, but what are set in the church as the body.<a name=112:4></a> He goes on to say, "For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=112:5></a> For the body is not one member, but many".<a name=112:6></a> And then in verse 27: "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<a name=112:7></a> And God hath set some in the church".<a name=112:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think anyone reading the chapter would see that the prominent idea in it is not the body, but the Spirit.<a name=112:9></a> But as I understand it, the body is introduced as the vessel where the manifestations of the Spirit are set.<a name=112:10></a> I think the great subject of the first epistle to the Corinthians is the temple, and that God is actually here; but that identical with the temple there is a body in which are set the manifestations of the Spirit; they all come out in the members of the body.<a name=112:11></a> The idea I judge is, that the church is the glory of Christ.<a name=112:12></a> Some may not quite understand what that expression means, but I will tell you.<a name=112:13></a> The woman is the glory of the man, that is, that all that is of the man is reflected in the woman.<a name=112:14></a> There was no such complete reflection of man in any of the brute creation, God could not find anything among the inferior creation which was suited to be a helpmeet to the man.<a name=112:15></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I venture to say, whatever God has for man comes out by the Spirit in the church as Christ's body.<a name=113:11></a> In the early days of Christianity if gifts of healing came to men, they were set in the church; or if God had light for men down here (and I think that is the great idea connected with the temple), it came out through the body.<a name=113:12></a> And that extends even to the revelation of God; for every bit of light that we get as to Christianity,

		all the New Testament scriptures, came out through members of the body; "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets".<a name=114:1></a> All that God has to say to men and to bestow upon men, the relief which God has in grace granted to man, was set in the church.<a name=114:2></a> I think it is in that sense the apostle introduces the body here, as the vessel of all the beneficence of God to man; all these various distributions of the Spirit were in the church; all that which really displayed the good of God coming out through Christ to men was set in the church, because the church is the body of Christ.<a name=114:3></a> Christ was no longer here personally, but the body of Christ was here.<a name=114:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>we get the earthly side of the church; it is not the church looked at as the fulness of Christ, and it is not union which is taught in the chapter, though unity is taught there, but the church as the body is the vessel in which are set all the manifestations of the Spirit; and it makes us all dependent one upon another.<a name=114:5></a> When I hear people saying, 'I never learnt anything from man', that is a pretty good proof to me that they do not know much.<a name=114:6></a> If they simply mean that they never learned anything from man as man, that may be the case; but if they mean that they never learned anything through the instrumentality or medium of man, then I say they must be very ignorant persons.<a name=114:7></a> Because had they known anything of Christianity, they must have known it through members of the body.<a name=114:8></a> Paul and John were members of the body, though they were apostles, and all the light that comes to us, the very Scriptures themselves, come to us through the apostles, and the apostles were set in the church.<a name=114:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical application of it in the present day is this, that we should recognise the truth of the one body, "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", "and have been all made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=114:10></a> That was not a kind of mystical idea; it was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a reality down here which saints were to recognise, that is, that they were one body by the baptism of the Spirit, so that the apostle could say to the body of saints at Corinth, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular".<a name=115:1></a> Christ could not have two bodies at Corinth, any more than Christ can have two bodies in London.<a name=115:2></a> There is Christ's body in London, and it is a very great point to recognise that fact.<a name=115:3></a> Because, if once I recognise it, I say I have done completely with anything which takes up distinctive sectarian ground.<a name=115:4></a> I will not be identified with apostasy, like popery, nor with a state church, nor with denominations, for the simple reason that I recognise the fact, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular", and "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", and the one body is the vessel here for the manifestations of the Spirit.<a name=115:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one point more, and it is that there must be room given for the Spirit, you must not place any kind of restriction upon the Spirit.<a name=115:6></a> For instance, if you have an appointed minister, if you do not give liberty of ministry, you put restrictions on the Spirit.<a name=115:7></a> You can never tell who may be a vessel for the manifestation of the Spirit, for the Spirit sometimes uses very unlikely people; He does not always employ the kind of vessel that would be naturally approved by man, because the Spirit is sovereign, and uses whom He will.<a name=115:8></a> You must recognise the truth of the one body, which sets aside all idea of sectarianism, and you must leave room for the free action of the Spirit, who distributes to every man severally as He will.<a name=115:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this truth is as to the church on its earthward side, but it is vastly important; for if you do not recognise it, you cannot understand anything about the assembly as convened.<a name=115:10></a> The instruction is given to the Corinthians for the regulation of the assembly as convened, and to avoid confusion.<a name=115:11></a> We come together as mutually dependent, for we are all one body,

		I am going to speak first as to what is presented as to it in the Ephesians, and then to look a little at what comes before us in the Corinthians, because the latter brings out what one might call the practical bearing of the truth, which is very important to us.<a name=119:2></a> It is very helpful in the present day to understand aright the truth of the temple, to recognise the presence of the Spirit of God here, and its consequences, for the practical result of it is that you become vessels for the manifestation of the Spirit.<a name=119:3></a> The practical denial of the presence of the Spirit is the great sin of Christendom.<a name=119:4></a> One can see all around in professing Christianity men really gifted of God, but not in the truth of the temple, not apprehending the presence of the Spirit.<a name=119:5></a> I do not deny for a moment that they are gifted men, and that God uses them.<a name=119:6></a> He uses them up to the measure of the light they have; but the light which should come through them is greatly obstructed, and the saints of God do not get from such persons the benefit which they ought.<a name=119:7></a> The light is obstructed to a very large extent by the human mind, for where the presence of the Spirit of God is not recognised the human mind is allowed, it is in activity in the things of God, constructing them into a system, and the consequence is that the light of the Spirit is very greatly obstructed.<a name=119:8></a>

		As I pointed out last time, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>the apostle is working down from the truth of the body, or I should rather say, from the truth of the Head to the truth of the temple.<a name=119:9></a> He says, "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord".<a name=119:10></a> We find here much

		the same contrast of thought to Corinthians that I referred to in connection with the body.<a name=120:1></a> The temple, as I understand it, is here identified with the glory of the kingdom.<a name=120:2></a> You get the same connection in the Old Testament.<a name=120:3></a> When God's people were wanderers, moving about from place to place through the wilderness, God walked with them in a tent; God did not dwell in a temple then.<a name=120:4></a> The idea of a temple did not connect itself with the wanderings of God's people in the wilderness, but with a city and a fixed habitation.<a name=120:5></a> It speaks of the temple in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>, "He built his sanctuary like high palaces".<a name=120:6></a> But so long as the people of God were wanderers in the wilderness, God dwelt in a tent, that is, in grace He came down to their condition.<a name=120:7></a> There is a beautiful feature of grace in that.<a name=120:8></a> The temple connected itself in the Old Testament with the glory of the kingdom, and it was not until the man of peace, Solomon, reigned, that the temple was built.<a name=120:9></a> David was not allowed to build God a house, because he had shed much blood; but when the enemies were subdued, and the kingdom was established in peace in Solomon, then Solomon builds God a house.<a name=120:10></a> David and Solomon both form a type of Christ -- David as subduing the enemies, Solomon as reigning in peace.<a name=120:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe what I say as to the connection between the kingdom and the temple is confirmed by the fact that when the eternal state is spoken of in the Revelation, the kingdom having been delivered up, the idea of a temple is dropped, and the expression employed is that "the tabernacle of God is with men".<a name=120:12></a> God does not cease to dwell with men, He is their God and they are His people.<a name=120:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of the temple in Ephesians connects itself, as I understand it, with the counsels of God in their accomplishment in the kingdom, "the administration of the fulness of times", which is identical with the kingdom.<a name=120:14></a> So we find a later allusion to the kingdom

		in chapter 5, that "no .<a name=121:1></a>.<a name=121:2></a>.<a name=121:3></a> idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God".<a name=121:4></a> In the kingdom Christ is supreme, Christ is Lord.<a name=121:5></a> It is the mediatorial kingdom, which, though not exactly a Scripture term, is one which conveys the idea well, for Christ is the Mediator, and all the good which God has for man is administered in power through Christ.<a name=121:6></a> What is true now to faith will be true then in a public way.<a name=121:7></a> <i>We</i> get the blessings of the kingdom; "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost"; but when the kingdom is established, righteousness, peace, and joy will rule in a public way through the Lord Jesus Christ; He will reign; and it will be the kingdom of God and of Christ; "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever".<a name=121:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we find here that "all the building fitly framed together groweth".<a name=121:9></a> The temple is not here looked at as complete, but as growing, that is, growing spiritually, "unto an holy temple in the Lord".<a name=121:10></a> The expression "in the Lord" appears to me to connect the temple with the kingdom.<a name=121:11></a> As I said before, what will mark the kingdom will be the glory and supremacy of Christ.<a name=121:12></a> He is Lord to faith now, Lord to those who believe, and in the kingdom He will be publicly supreme and Lord.<a name=121:13></a> What faith gets now, peace, and grace, and reconciliation, will be for the earth then, for God's people down here; He will be Head and Husband of His people, and Head of the Gentiles; and these blessings which faith now enjoys will be brought into the world through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=121:14></a> Here we have, that the whole building "fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord".<a name=121:15></a> When it is viewed in the light of the kingdom, there is no hand of man seen in it, there is no work of man recorded at all; it is "fitly framed together", it "groweth", indicating that there is a divine energy in

		every part of it -- it "groweth unto an holy temple", where there is nothing which can defile, "an holy temple in the Lord", in the One Who is supreme in the administration of the kingdom.<a name=122:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the view which is taken of the temple here; and we are further told this, it is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets", that is, on the foundation of their testimony, for apostles and prophets are viewed as identified with their testimony, and the chief corner-stone is Jesus Christ.<a name=122:2></a> Paul speaks in Corinthians of Jesus Christ as the foundation that had been laid; and in Ephesians Jesus Christ is the chief corner-stone.<a name=122:3></a> There is no decline in the character.<a name=122:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just one thought in corroboration of this which we can gather from the Revelation in the heavenly city.<a name=122:5></a> I am not confounding the two ideas, for no two ideas presented to us in Scripture are to be confounded; many ideas in Scripture run parallel, and every idea is distinct and unique, but one often serves to illustrate another.<a name=122:6></a> Now in the heavenly city, the new Jerusalem, the foundations are garnished with all manner of precious stones; that is, distinctiveness is maintained, but everywhere there is refracted light; that is the idea of a precious stone.<a name=122:7></a> And the gates of the city "were twelve pearls, every several gate was of one pearl".<a name=122:8></a> The foundation is the beginning, and the gates are the completion of a city, as we read in the Old Testament, that the foundations of Jericho were laid in Hiel's firstborn, and the gates set up in his youngest son.<a name=122:9></a> It is exceedingly beautiful thus to see that there is no diminution in the perfectness of the city.<a name=122:10></a> So, too, in the temple the foundation is Jesus Christ; and Jesus Christ is the chief corner-stone.<a name=122:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think we have exactly the same idea in Corinthians.<a name=122:12></a> It says there, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=122:13></a>" I doubt if that will be the form in which God will dwell in the temple in the kingdom; but it is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=123>[Page 123]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the form in which God is now dwelling.<a name=123:1></a> The verse in Corinthians which I have just quoted connects itself to a certain extent with the thought in the last verse of this chapter, "In whom ye also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit"; that is present.<a name=123:2></a> It is the status of Jew and Gentile as builded together by human instrumentality; it is not "fitly framed together"; that is connected with the temple.<a name=123:3></a> There are thus two ideas; one is of the temple, which connects itself with the kingdom, and the other of the habitation of God, which is present; that is, that God is dwelling here Spirit-wise, by the Spirit.<a name=123:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not propose to say much more on that side.<a name=123:5></a> My object in referring to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>was rather to show the church as the temple of God; and I believe it is the temple of God, as being the body of Christ.<a name=123:6></a> Everybody here may not quite grasp the connection of the two thoughts; but each successive truth which comes out in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>flows from the truth of the body, or rather of the head and the body, with which the subject begins.<a name=123:7></a> The church could not but be the temple of God if it is the body of Christ, as the Lord's own body when He was down here could not but be the temple of God, for the simple reason that of necessity God was there.<a name=123:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we will turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=123:9></a> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are".<a name=123:10></a> I trust the Lord may enable me to suggest a few thoughts in connection with this passage, which is of great importance to us practically.<a name=123:11></a> Here you come on to different ground from that in Ephesians.<a name=123:12></a> The counsel of God is not the prominent thought here; it is the prominent thought in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, and therefore the whole building is said to be fitly framed together, and to grow
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=124>[Page 124]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		unto a holy temple.<a name=124:1></a> Here it is somewhat different; the building is looked at in connection with the responsible work of man, and this is another side of the truth.<a name=124:2></a> It is a very great thing to see the two sides of a truth in Scripture; the same truth may be presented on the one side in connection with the counsel of God, and on the other in connection with the responsibility of man.<a name=124:3></a> Hence being viewed on the latter side you get here the possibility of the temple of God being defiled, and judgment coming upon the defiler.<a name=124:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I can understand the question being asked, in fact I have asked it myself many times, Why is the thought of the temple introduced in Corinthians?<a name=124:5></a> I believe it is because the kingdom is true to faith, though no one would venture to say that the kingdom is yet manifested.<a name=124:6></a> Christ is Lord to faith, and so the kingdom is true to faith.<a name=124:7></a> Therefore, on the same principle, the temple is true to faith; that is, that what will have its accomplishment, its full result hereafter in the day of the glory of Christ, is already true for faith.<a name=124:8></a> That is a great principle in Christianity.<a name=124:9></a> Everything that is established for God in Christ, is true to faith.<a name=124:10></a> Otherwise, how would you understand the passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>, "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel".<a name=124:11></a> You could not understand that passage if you did not see that every item in it is established in Christ; you could not otherwise be said to have "come" to it; but the fact is, that having come in faith to Christ, you have come to all which is established in Christ.<a name=124:12></a> Therefore you have come to the kingdom in that sense: "We receiving a kingdom

	<div class="paragraph">
		which cannot be moved".<a name=125:1></a> It is my conviction that so far as God is concerned, every purpose and counsel is settled and established in Christ: "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us"; that is, by faith.<a name=125:2></a> You are entitled in faith to take up all these things; they are all good for faith, the kingdom is good for faith, and so, too, the temple, for Christ is in glory, and the glory of God is displayed in Him; and the Spirit of God being here, the apostle takes up the thought of the temple in connection with man's responsibility.<a name=125:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point in connection with the church which I would like to bring forward by the grace of God, and that is, it forms as the temple a link between the past and the future.<a name=125:4></a> Do you think that if God has once established His temple upon earth He gives up the idea of a temple?<a name=125:5></a> Once God has set up His temple here, you may be sure man cannot abolish it.<a name=125:6></a> The temple at Jerusalem was God's sanctuary, in the place of His choice.<a name=125:7></a> One of the most instructive studies that I know of in the Old Testament is the close of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>.<a name=125:8></a> God had rejected Shiloh, and the tabernacle in which He dwelt among men.<a name=125:9></a> He chose not the tribe of Ephraim with which Shiloh was connected; but He "chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved"; He chose David; He took him from the sheepfolds to feed Jacob, His people, "and he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever".<a name=125:10></a> That is what God did; and nothing can set it aside.<a name=125:11></a> Because of God's temple at Jerusalem, kings are to bring presents unto Him.<a name=125:12></a> But God could say to a stiff-necked people, "the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands", and hence in the setting aside of Jerusalem, the church, as God's temple, forms a link between the past and the future; that is, the thought of the temple is not given up, only instead of the temple being local and material, as it has been and

		will be, it is now composed of living stones; "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=126:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point of interest in connection with the church; you do not find the thought of the temple coming out until in a certain sense there was freedom from Jerusalem.<a name=126:2></a> In the first phase of the church, as is seen in the earlier part of the Acts of the Apostles, Jerusalem was looked upon as a church centre; and when a serious question arose at Antioch it was referred to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, and Paul and Silas went about afterwards in every direction carrying the decrees of the apostles and elders.<a name=126:3></a> Doubtless divine wisdom was in it, but I think saints had to learn the truth that the Holy Spirit was sufficient for the assembly apart from Jerusalem.<a name=126:4></a> And that is the ground which Paul takes in the epistle to the Corinthians, when he says, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you".<a name=126:5></a> I think Paul was the first who began to build distinctly on that foundation, and a very important foundation it was, too; for the time came when, in the judgment of God, Jerusalem could be no longer a centre.<a name=126:6></a> God allowed it at first in divine wisdom, that the work should be consolidated in Jew and Gentile; but it was a state of things which was not destined to continue.<a name=126:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noticed that in the first epistle to the Corinthians there are three leading truths: the first is the temple; the second is the body -- "the Christ" really; and the third is the victory over death, in connection with the prophecy, "Death is swallowed up in victory".<a name=126:8></a> And these privileges, which belong to God's people upon earth in a literal way, belong now to the church in a spiritual way; for saints are the temple of God, a privilege which is proper to Israel; they have the Christ, for they are His body; and they have the victory given them over death.<a name=126:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=127>[Page 127]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said that in Corinthians the temple is connected with man's responsibility; the warning is introduced, "If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy".<a name=127:1></a> In the point of view in which the building is looked at in Ephesians, "fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord", there is no possibility of defilement coming in.<a name=127:2></a> But in any case, "The temple of God is holy"; that is, the temple of God has that character, and woe be to the man that corrupts it.<a name=127:3></a> I have no hesitation in saying that the temple of God has been corrupted, and the worst principles have been introduced into it; no one can know the history of the professing church without knowing that.<a name=127:4></a> But the consequence of it will be that judgment will come upon the corrupters.<a name=127:5></a> If anyone were to ask me who is the great corrupter of the church of God, I should say the Pope, because he is the head of the great corrupting system; and I do not doubt that system will specially come under the destruction of God.<a name=127:6></a> Depend upon it, God will vindicate the holiness of His temple.<a name=127:7></a> But man is responsible to maintain it; that is the point here.<a name=127:8></a> There is no responsibility in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>; but there is responsibility here; that is, that saints are responsible to maintain the holiness of God's temple, because the Spirit of God dwells there.<a name=127:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to give you one or two ideas connected with the temple.<a name=127:10></a> The first and by far the most important point is this, that God is there.<a name=127:11></a> That is the great idea of the temple, and that is the very thing which Christendom has practically lost.<a name=127:12></a> They have gone back to material things, to a bygone age, and have lost the sense of the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=127:13></a> What must be the first principle with us is that God is here.<a name=127:14></a> If you ask me what has the responsibility of being <i>the house</i> of God, I say that Christendom has that responsibility, though it has become like a great house in which are all kinds of vessels; but God is

		<a name=128>[Page 128]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		here by the Spirit.<a name=128:1></a> There are two very important points connected with the temple of God which flow from this -- grace is there and light.<a name=128:2></a> I see these two principles in the shewbread and in the candlestick in Israel's temple.<a name=128:3></a> Go back for a moment to Corinth, and think of its condition, and of the idolatrous people there.<a name=128:4></a> If anyone desired to get any light as to God, or any idea of the grace of God, where could it be found?<a name=128:5></a> In the Christian company and nowhere else; it came out there, because they recognised the presence of God, that God was dwelling here by the Spirit, and what characterised the dwelling of God was grace and light.<a name=128:6></a> To know anything about law people might have gone to Jerusalem; but to know anything about grace and light, they would have to go to the Christian company, where alone they would find it expressed.<a name=128:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with that, while fully admitting that Christendom has the responsibility of being the house of God, still if you ask me where the manifestations of the Spirit come out, I reply that the manifestations of the Spirit come out through the body.<a name=128:8></a> Many persons in early days evidently fell under the power and influence of the Spirit, who had no part in the Spirit.<a name=128:9></a> But it is of real Christians it is said, "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body .<a name=128:10></a>.<a name=128:11></a>.<a name=128:12></a> and have been all made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=128:13></a> The manifestations of the Spirit are set in the church as the body of Christ.<a name=128:14></a> I see many a gifted man who is undoubtedly in the body of Christ, and yet knows nothing at all about the truth of the body nor of the presence of God here by the Spirit; he looks upon the house of God as a material building; a building of brick or stone, a place of worship; and therefore, although he is a member of the body of Christ, he is not very serviceable; there may be a manifestation of the Spirit there, but the light of the Spirit is greatly obstructed, because he allows, to a large degree, his mind to work.<a name=128:15></a> If the presence of the Spirit is not recognised, man
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		always allows his mind to work.<a name=129:1></a> Men are sent to college to train them for the ministry, and to study systems of theology and the like, which are the work of men's minds.<a name=129:2></a> And they feed upon these things and get their ideas formed by them, and the light is thus greatly obscured.<a name=129:3></a> I do not deny that the manifestation of the Spirit may be there, but it is greatly marred where the presence of the Spirit is not recognised, and if you recognise that God is dwelling here by the Spirit, you will recognise that it is only the spiritual person who can appreciate His presence.<a name=129:4></a> You can bring nothing but what is of God into contact with the Spirit of God.<a name=129:5></a> And that is what the apostle urges at the close of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>, it is the spiritual man discerns all things; and the Corinthians were not spiritual.<a name=129:6></a> They were the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelt in them, but everything was in confusion among them, because they were not spiritual.<a name=129:7></a> It raises a very important question with us as to what "spiritual" means.<a name=129:8></a> It is a very simple word to my mind; it is not attainment, I should reject the thought of attainment; it is clearly the normal and proper condition of every saint.<a name=129:9></a> What I understand by a person being spiritual is that the flesh is subdued and the Spirit is the power of apprehension and the source and spring of thought and feeling.<a name=129:10></a> And that ought to be the case with every one of us; we all have part in the Spirit, the Spirit of God dwells in us, and therefore the Spirit of God ought to rule completely in us.<a name=129:11></a> The Spirit of God is to be the spring of activity, as well as the power of understanding, for you cannot understand anything of God by the natural mind.<a name=129:12></a> There is nothing I dread more in the things of God than the activity of my mind.<a name=129:13></a> I know that the instant my mind begins to be active in divine things I am in danger; I never get anything lasting by it.<a name=129:14></a> I do not set aside the mind; but in the Christian the mind is simply an eye, it lets in light, that is all.<a name=129:15></a> I could not understand the

		things of God without a mind; but if you want to understand the things of God, you must guard against the activity of the mind; what you want is to be subject to the Spirit of God and to judge the flesh, and then you will very soon get an understanding in the things of God.<a name=130:1></a> You get understanding by the Spirit, because the Spirit brings the mind of Christ.<a name=130:2></a> I understand all the things of God by the Spirit of God.<a name=130:3></a> The first point I recognise is this, the Spirit of God is here, the saints "are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=130:4></a> Then I recognise, that not only is the Spirit present, but that there are the manifestations of the Spirit, and they are all placed in the church as the body of Christ.<a name=130:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am no longer speaking of the temple in connection with the glory of the kingdom, I am speaking of the temple in connection with man's responsibility.<a name=130:6></a> Of course the very fact of saints being the temple of God is an immense privilege; but the thing is viewed also upon the responsibility side.<a name=130:7></a> The first practical thing for us is that we should covet by the grace of God to be spiritual.<a name=130:8></a> We ought all to covet to be spiritual, that is, that the Spirit of God should be really in us the power of understanding, and the spring of thought and activity, governing the mind and feelings.<a name=130:9></a> If the presence of the Spirit is recognised in the soul, then I say where the Spirit of God is, there is wonderful sense of light and grace.<a name=130:10></a> Then, as belonging to the body, we are vessels for the manifestation of the Spirit.<a name=130:11></a> But take care you do not obstruct the light.<a name=130:12></a> You are to be here a vessel of light and grace; do not let anything hinder the light which ought to shine out through you, and the grace that ought to be manifest in you.<a name=130:13></a>

		The thought before me is to bring under your attention the truth of the house of God, and the features which should mark God's house.<a name=132:1></a> What I have to say will come pretty much under those two heads.<a name=132:2></a> I first want to give an idea of the force of the expression, "the house of God", as we gather it from Scripture.<a name=132:3></a> The house of God is the church of the living God.<a name=132:4></a> Two expressions are used as to the church; it is the body of Christ, and it is the house of God.<a name=132:5></a> The latter occurs in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3">1 Timothy  3</a>, where the apostle says, "These things I write unto thee .<a name=132:6></a>.<a name=132:7></a>.<a name=132:8></a> that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God".<a name=132:9></a> It is a great point for us, and where the truth becomes practical, to see the moral features which were to characterise the house of God; because whatever may be its present ruin, we may return to those moral features when we cannot revive the house of God as it was at first.<a name=132:10></a> And when the house of God has become practically what is spoken of in the second epistle to Timothy, "a great house", and it has now that character, and you have to purge yourselves from vessels to dishonour, the call is to return to the truth as it was from the beginning.<a name=132:11></a> Thus it is very important to know what are the true characteristics of the house of God.<a name=132:12></a> It is for that purpose that I read the passage in 1 Timothy.<a name=132:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, my practical difficulty is to distinguish between the temple of God, on which I dwelt last time, and the house of God.<a name=132:14></a> There is evidently a connection in the two thoughts, but also a clear distinction between them.<a name=132:15></a> Both are true; there is the temple of God, and there is the house of God; and I trust to be enabled

		<a name=133>[Page 133]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to make the distinction clear before I pass on to speak of what characterises the house of God.<a name=133:1></a> Referring for a moment to the truth of the temple, I notice that the temple of God is not spoken of <i>as a present thing</i>, except in connection with a local assembly; and on the other hand, a local assembly is not spoken of as the house of God.<a name=133:2></a> I can understand <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:22">Ephesians  2:22</a>, where it says, "In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit", being advanced against this.<a name=133:3></a> But I think the idea there is not that of a local assembly, but the more general one of Jew and Gentile builded together for a habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=133:4></a> And wherever else the house of God is spoken of, it is either in the catholic epistles or in the epistles to individuals.<a name=133:5></a> You find it in Hebrews, in the first epistle of Peter, and in the first epistle to Timothy, and perhaps in the second; but in no case is it referred to in an epistle written to a particular church; that is, the idea of the house of God is more general and extended.<a name=133:6></a> On the other hand, it is important to remember that, as I said, the temple of God is not spoken of as a present thing, except in connection with a local assembly.<a name=133:7></a> Of course there is the other thought, in the epistle to the Ephesians, "all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord"; but that does not present the temple as a present complete thing here.<a name=133:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle's point in bringing forward to the Corinthians the truth of the temple is to show them that they lacked no kind of privilege which properly belonged to the people of God down here.<a name=133:9></a> God's temple, the Christ, and the victory over death were theirs, for the kingdom was established, at all events the kingdom in mystery.<a name=133:10></a> Now I deduce from this, that the idea of the temple is privilege; privilege belonging to a local assembly.<a name=133:11></a> What the privilege meant I tried to indicate last week -- that the grace and

		<a name=134>[Page 134]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		light of God were present in the company in whom the Spirit dwelt.<a name=134:1></a> And the apostle brings this forward in order to meet the evil of attaching importance to man as such.<a name=134:2></a> Light from God and grace were present in the temple, and therefore man and man's mind were nowhere there; the one who dwelt in the temple was the Spirit, and the spiritual man was the only man of any account in the temple of God.<a name=134:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The house of God is on the other hand a truth of wider bearing.<a name=134:4></a> Let us go back for a moment to the Old Testament; the tabernacle was the house of God, but then the thought of the house of God took in not merely the tent, but the whole surroundings; the court of the tabernacle was as much a part of the house of God as was the tabernacle itself.<a name=134:5></a> So, too, with the temple; the courts of the temple were of the house of God as well as the temple itself, though the scripture is careful to distinguish between the building, that is, the actual temple, and the more general idea.<a name=134:6></a> For instance, I think I might say that the Lord never went into the temple, that is, into the actual building -- the shrine, so to speak -- because He was not of the priestly family: "If he were on earth, he should not be a priest".<a name=134:7></a> Morally, too, the temple was superseded by His presence here; He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"; "but he spake of the temple of his body".<a name=134:8></a> But He still acknowledged the temple as His Father's house, and He taught in the courts of the temple; He was ever to be found, when He went to Jerusalem, teaching in the courts of the temple whither the Jews resorted.<a name=134:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage I read in Mark, "He taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer?<a name=134:10></a>" That was the proper character of God's house.<a name=134:11></a> The house takes in the whole idea; not simply of the building, but of the courts which surrounded the building; and in that sense it was God's house, a house of prayer for all
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=135>[Page 135]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		nations.<a name=135:1></a> I think if you have followed me you will see the distinction there is between the temple and the house of God; that the temple, properly speaking, refers to the building, and in this sense it is used in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>, and the house of God is a larger thought, which takes in not only the actual building, but the precincts of the building.<a name=135:2></a> Then again, as to the house of God, we gather from what is written that it was not simply to be the place of priestly service, but to be characterised by being a house of prayer for all nations.<a name=135:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think I can point out to you the same distinction both in Corinthians and in the Revelation, and if I succeed, it will give you a pretty clear idea on the one hand of the temple -- which is connected with privilege, the grace and light of God being there -- and on the other hand of the house of God, which refers to profession.<a name=135:4></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>: "To the assembly of God which is in Corinth" -- mark the next part of the verse -- "to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints" -- and then mark -- "with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=135:5></a> Now it is perfectly clear that you get two distinct ideas in that verse; on the one hand, those addressed are seen as "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints"; on the other hand, there is the recognition of profession, but of profession in the right and true sense, not the kind of profession which is abroad in the present day; "with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=135:6></a> What I make of it is this; in the first part of the verse is the principle of the temple; in the latter part I see the principle of the house.<a name=135:7></a> Because I do not understand the temple of God to be composed of anything but living stones; it is a "spiritual house".<a name=135:8></a> The Corinthians are looked at in that sense as "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints", and the apostle can say
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=136>[Page 136]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that they are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelt in them.<a name=136:1></a> But then the apostle recognises also in a general way the profession of those who call on the Lord, that is, that they were the house of God; I think the first part of the epistle goes largely on that ground.<a name=136:2></a> In chapter 3, in speaking about the temple, I think the apostle alludes to what was their spiritual privilege.<a name=136:3></a> The word which is used for "temple" in that chapter is not the general idea of the building and its courts in the external sense, but a word which is specially applied to the building itself, the shrine.<a name=136:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>there is a passage which I think gives us the same thought.<a name=136:5></a> John says, "There was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein".<a name=136:6></a> Now mark, there you have what is real; it is not Christianity which is in view, but at all events real saints.<a name=136:7></a> And the temple is distinguished from the altar, although both temple and altar were included in the house.<a name=136:8></a> It is the temple of God, and the altar, and the worshippers; in other words, it is those who had a real living link with God.<a name=136:9></a> "But", he says, "the court which is without the temple" -- which is included in the general idea of the house -- "leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles" that is, the outward profession of Judaism in that day is given up unto the Gentiles -- "and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months".<a name=136:10></a> The Spirit of God first distinguishes real saints, and then speaks of the public outward profession, which is included in the idea of the house, just as the court was included in the idea of the house, and that is given up to the Gentiles for the last half week of Daniel.<a name=136:11></a> I bring the passage forward, because it is a very distinct recognition of the inward and outward, and both included in the general idea of the house of God.<a name=136:12></a>

		temple of God in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>as analogous to the house of God; but I do not think it is.<a name=137:1></a> The apostle brings before the Corinthians in chapter 3 their proper privilege, as being God's temple, just as in the similar thought of "the Christ" in chapter 12; it was not simply that they had the temple of God, but they were the temple of God.<a name=137:2></a> And I think the idea of the temple as a spiritual house just accords with the first epistle of Peter; "a spiritual house", "a holy priesthood", and so on.<a name=137:3></a> In the first epistle to the Corinthians the truth is brought out that they were a spiritual house; in the second epistle that they were a holy priesthood.<a name=137:4></a> But in chapter 1 of the first epistle he joins with them all that call on the name of the Lord Jesus, "both theirs and ours".<a name=137:5></a> Now if you want me to put it in simple, plain language, the house of God, as I understand it, is the profession of Christianity.<a name=137:6></a> Just bear in mind that the expression "house of God" is not found as far as I am aware, in connection with the local assembly any more than the kingdom is.<a name=137:7></a> It is the profession of Christianity here upon earth which has the responsibility of being the house of God.<a name=137:8></a> I fully admit it has lapsed into the character of "a great house"; but in its normal condition, it was properly those who called on the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=137:9></a> In speaking of profession, I do not, as I have said, mean unreal profession, but what the world could take account of; it was public.<a name=137:10></a>

		There are some verses in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>which perhaps will give us the thought of it: "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.<a name=137:11></a> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<a name=137:12></a> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.<a name=137:13></a>

		And Moses verily was faithful in all his house" -- that is, God's house -- "as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; but Christ as Son over his house" -- not "His own house", but God's house -- "whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end".<a name=138:1></a> There are two or three very important thoughts in this passage; and the first is that the house of God in the largest extent of it is all things.<a name=138:2></a> The tabernacle was the pattern of the universe of God, that is, the universe in which the ways of God are displayed in their result.<a name=138:3></a> It has often been remarked that there was a sort of picture there of the three heavens; but I take it that what was taught in the tabernacle was the way in which God connected Himself with the universe, and that the tabernacle in that sense was the pattern of all things.<a name=138:4></a> I believe it will come out in that way; and that, as the issue of the ways of God, the whole universe will have the character of being the house of God.<a name=138:5></a> Then there is another thought connected with the passage, that Christ is Son over God's house.<a name=138:6></a> Moses was a servant, and faithful in the type and figure of it; but Christ is Son over God's house; that is His place in connection with the universe of God.<a name=138:7></a> Then we get a third thought, that at this time Christians constitute the house of God.<a name=138:8></a> As the apostle says, "whose house are we, if we hold fast" -- we are on the ground of responsibility -- to "hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end".<a name=138:9></a> It is the recognition of Christian profession, and of its place of privilege.<a name=138:10></a> And it is to be remarked that the epistle to the Hebrews is not an epistle addressed to a particular church, but a kind of treatise for Jewish Christians.<a name=138:11></a> The house of God is not spoken of as the privilege of any particular local assembly; but the apostle is speaking generally of Christianity.<a name=138:12></a>

		I desire now to give you some of the marks and features which are proper to the house of God.<a name=140:8></a> The verse in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#11">Mark  11</a>gives us, I think, a great idea of the house of God: Jesus taught them, saying, "Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer?<a name=140:9></a> but ye have made it a den of thieves".<a name=140:10></a> There is not any allusion in that passage to anything connected with the worship of God or the temple service; but the Lord speaks, as in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#56:7">Isaiah  56:7</a>, of the house of God as being a house of prayer for all nations.<a name=140:11></a> It is really, if I understand it, the point where God put Himself in contact with those who were outside His people; it was a house of prayer for all nations.<a name=140:12></a> I think we get the same principle in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>, in these verses: "I exhort therefore, that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark now the verses that follow.<a name=141:5></a> "For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth".<a name=141:6></a> The truth resided in the saints, in the house, but the thought of God went out to all men.<a name=141:7></a> It has been said that if the meetings were indifferent to the gospel, to the thought of "all men", they would wither.<a name=141:8></a> Such was not the thought of God at all; and the church was in the place of intercession on behalf of all men on the ground that God "will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth".<a name=141:9></a> The apostle goes on to say, "For there is one God, and one mediator" -- not between men and God, but -- "between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all".<a name=141:10></a> The truth of it was in the house, and it was in the house that the attitude of God toward all men was known; and therefore the church was to make intercession for all men, "that we might live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty"; that is, that there might be no hindrance to the promulgation of God's thought and will in regard to all men, that God "would have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth"; there was adequate ground for it in that Christ had given Himself "a ransom for all".<a name=141:11></a> Nothing is a greater hindrance to

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have said gives you, I think, the position of the house of God.<a name=142:9></a> And here it is not a question of a local assembly, it is the position of Christian profession, on the one hand in regard to God, and on the other in regard to all men; and the first great characteristic of Christian profession is prayer; the house of God is to be marked by prayer.<a name=142:10></a> You get no idea here of the temple or of the holiest, but the marks of the true profession of Christianity; the men are to pray everywhere.<a name=142:11></a>

		I often think how little we carry out these things, how little the men are characterised by prayer.<a name=143:5></a> It is not 'men' simply, but "the men"; that is, the men who are within the sphere of the house of God, Christian profession.<a name=143:6></a> I think it refers to prayer in public, and not merely in private; but the point is not exactly the occasion of it, but what is to characterise the men.<a name=143:7></a> When we come together to pray, it puts all of us to shame that we are so little prepared for prayer; and yet the men in the house of God are to be marked by prayer.<a name=143:8></a> So, too, in regard to women; there is to be the absence of the adornment that passes current in the world, "but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works".<a name=143:9></a> The point is that the adornment of the women is not to be external but moral; and a beautiful adornment it is!<a name=143:10></a> Elsewhere, the adornment mentioned is that of "a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price".<a name=143:11></a> A woman is not to be conspicuous, because she has to bow her head in remembrance that Eve was in the transgression.<a name=143:12></a> Adam was not deceived, the woman was deceived.<a name=143:13></a> "The serpent beguiled Eve by his subtilty"; the man entered into the transgression; and the woman, as having been in the transgression, has to accept it, and is to be adorned -- you can understand the contrast -- by good works, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two other features given in the third chapter which mark the house of God, oversight and ministry.<a name=144:3></a> You could not conceive God's house being a scene of confusion, or uncared for; such a thought would not be worthy of God; "God is not the author of confusion".<a name=144:4></a> When I speak of ministry, I do not refer to ministry in a spiritual sense, but as meeting temporal needs.<a name=144:5></a> There was to be oversight in regard to men's souls, and ministry in regard to their bodies; those were the two things which were to be seen in the house of God, for the house of God was regulated of God; it was where God was.<a name=144:6></a> Hence it says, "If a man desire the office of a bishop" -- that is, an overseer -- "he desireth a good work".<a name=144:7></a> A man was justified in coveting the office of an overseer.<a name=144:8></a> And the marks of the overseer are given in order that one who was competent to be such might be recognised.<a name=144:9></a> Then, too, there was ministry for temporal needs; and not on the part of men only, but on the part of women; for there is the recognition, not only of deacons but of deaconesses, and the qualifications are given here also.<a name=144:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no such thing as an appointing power now; but the qualifications are given in order that an elder or a deacon might be recognised.<a name=144:11></a> A man who desired the office of an overseer desired a good work, but he must have the necessary marks; he must be a married man and have children, he proves his competency to exercise oversight in the house of God by the way in which he rules his own family.<a name=144:12></a> If a man had a disorderly family, if he had not his own children in subjection, though he might be a teacher or might have some other gift, yet he was not competent to be an elder and to care for the house of God.<a name=144:13></a> So, too, with regard to a deacon; a deacon was to be a married

		man, or else he could not well enter into his work, and he was to have an orderly house.<a name=145:1></a> There is an important word in connection with the deacon, that those who exercise "the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=145:2></a> It has often been noticed, and I think truly, that this was exemplified in the case of Stephen; he began by being a deacon, and afterwards he became a most distinguished witness of Christ; he purchased to himself "a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=145:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle tells Timothy the reason he writes.<a name=145:4></a> He writes, "hoping to come unto thee shortly: but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth".<a name=145:5></a> It is a very great thing for a man to know how he is to behave himself in the house of God, that is, in the sphere of Christian profession, especially one in the place of a servant.<a name=145:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a further thought.<a name=145:7></a> Even in the apostle's day, alas!<a name=145:8></a> you see profession parting company from possession, and the house of God becoming "a great house"; and hence the apostle saw the need of saints purging themselves from vessels to dishonour.<a name=145:9></a> You cannot get out of the house, for you can get out of Christian profession only by apostasy; but you have to purge yourselves from vessels to dishonour, and to "follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=145:10></a> Most of us have had to leave associations in which perhaps we were born and brought up, to purge ourselves from vessels to dishonour and to find out another path, that is, to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=145:11></a> But then, if you have done that, you want guidance; and the only guidance which you have from God is the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is our path, beloved friends.<a name=146:4></a> One of the greatest privileges that I know of is that we can return to first principles.<a name=146:5></a> When I first came away from other associations, I remember being confronted with the idea that what you find in Scripture as to early days is impracticable now.<a name=146:6></a> But what is of God and God's direction can never be impracticable.<a name=146:7></a> The Spirit is still here, and the point is to go back to what was from the outset; it is the only guidance you have.<a name=146:8></a>

		I trust by the grace of God I have made the thought of the house somewhat plain.<a name=146:9></a> I think anyone who has followed me can conceive the idea of the house, as well as of the temple.<a name=146:10></a> Both are presented to us in Scripture.<a name=146:11></a> But alas!<a name=146:12></a> the house of God is going on to judgment.<a name=146:13></a> It will be left by all that is of God, and the heaviest judgments from God will fall upon that which has had the responsibility of being the house of God.<a name=146:14></a> Thank God we have been awakened to see it, and to purge ourselves; and may God give us grace that in lowliness of mind we may go on pursuing "righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", guided by the true principles of the house of God.<a name=146:15></a> May God stir the men up to prayer; I am sure we need to be stirred up to it; and the women to care less about outward adornment, but that they may be adorned with good works.<a name=146:16></a> That is the adornment for God, and that is the true adornment in the presence of men.<a name=146:17></a>

		On previous occasions we have had the opportunity of looking at the church as presented to us in three aspects in Scripture, namely, as the body of Christ, as God's temple, and as God's house.<a name=147:1></a> We began with the body, and then we saw something of the truth of the temple, as a spiritual house composed of living stones; and then we had the thought of the house of God as formed of Christian profession.<a name=147:2></a> The house so viewed evidently does not go on beyond the present dispensation.<a name=147:3></a> When once the body of Christ is taken away, and the Spirit leaves the scene, the house is like the temple at Jerusalem, "Your house is left unto you desolate"; it is no more owned of God; Christian profession is no longer regarded in that light; it is apostate and disowned.<a name=147:4></a> But when you come to the close of the Revelation, though you do not get exactly a new phase of the church, for that is not the idea, yet you get the church in its aspect earthwards as the seat of heavenly light and rule.<a name=147:5></a> In the passage I read from <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, you must pre-suppose that the church has been caught up to heaven: because the point in that chapter is that the city comes down from God out of heaven, and therefore it must have been put before God in heaven.<a name=147:6></a> And that is where, properly speaking, the ministry of Paul put the church; that was the end and effect of his ministry, to put the saints, those who compose the church, in their true place before God in heaven.<a name=147:7></a> John brings the church from God out of heaven, and shows to us its bearing outwards.<a name=147:8></a> He does not show us what the church is in the sense in which Paul speaks of it, nor the relation of the church to Christ, which is Paul's ministry; but he shows us the church as the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before speaking about the detail, which comes out in this chapter, I want to say a word about the relative places of John and Paul in regard to the church.<a name=148:3></a> John had no <i>distinctive</i> church ministry.<a name=148:4></a> Peter had, and Paul had: the commission to Peter was to feed and shepherd the lambs and sheep of Christ, and Peter was to pass off the scene; the Lord revealed to him by what death he would glorify God.<a name=148:5></a> Paul's commission is conveyed in what he says, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ".<a name=148:6></a> John laboured in testimony in common with the twelve; but had no distinctive mission -- I lay stress upon the word 'distinctive' -- because when you come to the twelve foundations of the heavenly city the twelve apostles of the Lamb are all included there.<a name=148:7></a> In the beginning of the Revelation, what is revealed to John is the ruin and decay of what Paul had laboured to build, especially at Ephesus.<a name=148:8></a> You cannot study the Acts of the Apostles without seeing that Ephesus is the climax of Paul's work.<a name=148:9></a> When the seven churches of Asia are passed under review as representative, and the Lord reveals to John by them the state of the church, he begins with Ephesus, because the point of departure is seen there.<a name=148:10></a> What it means is this; the church had fallen away from the truth of its espousal; as to the state of the affections it had left its first love, it had left the point where Paul had placed it.<a name=148:11></a> But it was, so to say, Paul's church, built especially upon the foundation of his testimony.<a name=148:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what comes to pass is this, that John is shown what Paul never saw.<a name=148:13></a> You do not find in Paul's writings the idea of revival in the church here.<a name=148:14></a> In his second epistle to Timothy Paul gives instruction as to what one is to do when the church has become "a great house", that a man has to purge himself from

	<div class="paragraph">
		vessels to dishonour and to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart"; but he does not give the idea at all of any revival of the truth of the church in souls.<a name=149:1></a> But in John, though the Lord shows to him the departure, the truth comes out in the latter part of the addresses to the seven churches of a certain degree of revival.<a name=149:2></a> It is that which made me read the address to the church in Philadelphia; because undoubtedly you have there a revival of the truth, not only as truth, but in the apprehension and practice of it.<a name=149:3></a> Philadelphia does not describe to us a company characterised by holding certain truths, but it stands representatively before the Lord in the truth of the church.<a name=149:4></a> It might be reduced to very narrow limits; it might be a very diminutive company; but the whole value of Philadelphia is that it stands in the truth of the church; and the Lord speaks not of something peculiar to Philadelphia, but of what is proper to the church.<a name=149:5></a> The position of Philadelphia was this: "Thou hast .<a name=149:6></a>.<a name=149:7></a>.<a name=149:8></a> kept my word, and hast not denied my name".<a name=149:9></a> That was characteristic.<a name=149:10></a> Then He says, speaking of those of the synagogue of Satan, "I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee".<a name=149:11></a> I do not think that means Philadelphia simply, but states what is true of the church.<a name=149:12></a> "Christ .<a name=149:13></a>.<a name=149:14></a>.<a name=149:15></a> loved the church".<a name=149:16></a> Then He says, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience" -- here again I think Philadelphia is looked upon as representative -- "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation".<a name=149:17></a> The Lord is really speaking in spirit to the church.<a name=149:18></a> I decline altogether the idea of attaching any peculiar value to a particular company because that company holds something distinctive.<a name=149:19></a> The only value of any company in the present dispensation is that they return to what was from the outset; that is that they represent morally the church as before Christ.<a name=149:20></a> Then the Lord can speak to them; and I think that is the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=150>[Page 150]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		position of Philadelphia.<a name=150:1></a> It comprehends those who are morally in the truth of the church's position before Christ.<a name=150:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would add that I have no doubt it is the special line of truth which is opened to us in John's writings that really brings about the position of Philadelphia.<a name=150:3></a> So that John does not set aside Paul, but comes in his own particular line to make effective the truth of Paul.<a name=150:4></a> For my conviction is that in the present day it is the special line of truth which John opens up as to the revelation of the Father and the Son, and the gift of eternal life and the Holy Spirit, which brings souls into the truth of Philadelphia; and when you have got there you have really returned to the point of departure, to the truth of the church.<a name=150:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you read the addresses to the last three churches, you will find that neither Sardis nor Laodicea has got back to Christ; the Lord is distant in both of them; but in Philadelphia He is the holy and the true, and they keep His word and do not deny His name.<a name=150:6></a> It is of great importance to see how John's ministry substantiates Paul's.<a name=150:7></a> You have to remember that although John was the latest writer in Scripture, as is supposed, yet it was given to Paul to complete the word of God; so that you cannot have any further dispensation brought out beyond Paul.<a name=150:8></a> The Lord revealed to John the decay and ruin of the church of which Paul had laid the foundation; but at the same time there is, as we have seen, at the close a certain measure of revival of the truth, which Paul did not foresee.<a name=150:9></a> The Lord showed to John the whole history of the church in a sense, under the description of "the things that are", and made known the end of "the things that are" in order to make way for "the things that are about to be after these"; for the two cannot overlap.<a name=150:10></a> When "the things that are" have come to a close, then "the things that are about to be after these" come to pass.<a name=150:11></a> Then the twenty-four elders are seen in heaven, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		the seven Spirits are before the throne; the church is no longer here, nor is the Spirit of God; and the things about to come to pass are the judgments which are premonitory to the coming of the Lord; because John's great point is to bring Christ in glory into the scene from which He has been rejected.<a name=151:1></a> John claims the world for God.<a name=151:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was given of the Lord that as the revelation to Paul had placed the church in heaven, so John should see the church coming down from God out of heaven.<a name=151:3></a> That will take us to chapter 21, where he says, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.<a name=151:4></a> And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<a name=151:5></a> And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<a name=151:6></a> And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away".<a name=151:7></a> These verses should be read in conjunction with the previous chapter, because they follow on quite in the line of it.<a name=151:8></a> John had been led on to see the final resurrection and judgment, every moral question settled; and then as a close he sees the holy city coming down from God out of heaven, and the tabernacle of God is with men.<a name=151:9></a> That is where we get the holy city connected with the eternal state; it is not a new subject, but what I may call the proper issue.<a name=151:10></a> As I understand it, the kingdom, what we commonly speak of as the millennium, is the means to an end.<a name=151:11></a> The kingdom is in view of the eternal state; after the repression of all evil, and the final dealing with it, the kingdom is delivered up, and God is all in all, and then it is that you get the holy

		city coming down.<a name=152:1></a> And the import of it is that "the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them", and will be their God, and they shall be His people; former things are passed away, and there is no more death.<a name=152:2></a> All that state of things is at an end; all things are new, the tabernacle of God is not with Israel, but with men; there is no distinction between races.<a name=152:3></a> Those few verses are much more properly attached to the preceding chapter; I touch on them because they give the proper sequence.<a name=152:4></a> The truth that is revealed to the apostle John leads on to the eternal state, and what comes to pass there.<a name=152:5></a> What I have said proves this much, that John is shown the church in its outward aspect as the place of God's tabernacle among men.<a name=152:6></a> We get the same idea in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>.<a name=152:7></a> On the day of atonement, beside the sin-offering for Aaron and his house, which was connected with approach to God, the blood of the goat, the sin-offering of the people, was necessary, because the tabernacle of God remained among the children of Israel in spite of their uncleanness.<a name=152:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that closes up in verse 6, and in verse 9 you come to a kind of supplementary detail: "There came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=152:9></a> In the beginning of chapter 17 it says, "And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters".<a name=152:10></a> "So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness".<a name=152:11></a> I refer to that only to show the connection; it was one of the seven angels that had the seven last plagues that showed John the harlot, the great whore, the false apostate church, and it is one of the same seven angels that talked with John, saying, "Come hither; I will shew thee the bride,
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Lamb's wife".<a name=153:1></a> He was carried away into the wilderness to be shown the whore.<a name=153:2></a> Now he is not taken into the wilderness, but to "a great and high mountain".<a name=153:3></a> That means that you must get very much above the earth if you are to understand anything at all about the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=153:4></a> You can understand the great whore in the wilderness; but you must, like John, get to a mountain great and high if you want to know anything about the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=153:5></a> But notice this, John does not see the bride, the Lamb's wife, in her relations to the bridegroom, but in the character of a city.<a name=153:6></a> It is the same city, I suppose, which had been spoken of previously in the chapter as "a bride adorned for her husband"; here it is the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=153:7></a> "He shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God".<a name=153:8></a> The great whore could not rise above the wilderness; there was nothing heavenly about her; but the bride, the Lamb's wife, comes down from God out of heaven.<a name=153:9></a> She must have been taken there in the first instance, and this was the power of the ministry of Paul; John sees her coming from God out of heaven, having the glory of God.<a name=153:10></a> It is a wonderful result, and particularly to one like John, to whom the ruin of the church had been revealed, the decay of everything down here, all ending really in Thyatira and Laodicea.<a name=153:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will very briefly notice the details which are given to us as distinctive of the heavenly city; though I do not attempt to interpret details or symbols, but only just to give three or four leading ideas in connection with them, for it is of the very deepest interest to us to see the features which distinguish the city as coming down from God out of heaven.<a name=153:12></a> The city is the heavenly metropolis, and the first point about her is that she has "the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; and had a wall great and high, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

		had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel".<a name=154:1></a> "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb".<a name=154:2></a> So far you get, I think, the marks of identification: the first is the glory of God, the expression of His infinite satisfaction, the second is the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the third is the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=154:3></a> They are the links with what is past, and the marks of identification by which the city is known.<a name=154:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is the glory of God.<a name=154:5></a> Ever since sin came into the world, what has been in view has been the glory of God.<a name=154:6></a> What I understand by the glory of God is the complete and perfect satisfaction of the divine attributes in the accomplishment of God's counsels of grace.<a name=154:7></a> The God of glory appeared to Abraham; there you get the first idea of counsel in the way of promise.<a name=154:8></a> Stephen saw the glory of God in the presence of Jesus.<a name=154:9></a> And in Paul there shone forth "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=154:10></a> In the church is seen the complete and perfect satisfaction of the divine attributes in the accomplishment of God's counsels of grace.<a name=154:11></a> And this is what characterises the heavenly metropolis, "Jerusalem above".<a name=154:12></a> Her shining is like unto a stone most precious, and she is resplendent with the glory of God.<a name=154:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second mark is the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=154:14></a> That conveys to me the thought that in the church you cannot ignore the twelve tribes of Israel; they have their place in the counsel of God, and salvation came out from them to the Gentiles.<a name=154:15></a> We have become partakers of their spiritual things.<a name=154:16></a> The twelve tribes are represented in the city, and a correspondence exists between them and the gates.<a name=154:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the third mark is that, looked at in the aspect in which it is here presented, as the city, the church is founded on the work of the twelve apostles; in the

		The next point is the measure of the city: "And the city lieth four-square, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.<a name=155:4></a> The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.<a name=155:5></a> And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel".<a name=155:6></a> That is the measure of it.<a name=155:7></a> It has often been pointed out that it is a cube, the breadth, and the length and the height of it are equal; it is all measured, all taken into account.<a name=155:8></a> You get the idea of measuring also in chapter 11, the temple of God, and the worshippers, and the altar, were to be measured.<a name=155:9></a> What does the measuring mean?<a name=155:10></a> I believe it is the demonstration that every demand of divine righteousness is answered; it is really the fulfilment and display of what is spoken of in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>"He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=155:11></a> In the church all is equal and exact; there is no adjustment wanted; the length and breadth and height of it are all equal.<a name=155:12></a> There are two ways in which righteousness is presented to us in Scripture; one as the ground of our justification as here upon earth, and the other in the ministry of reconciliation that, as the result of Christ having been made sin for us, we have boldness to enter into the holiest.<a name=155:13></a> Here you get the whole thing completed and displayed; that is the measure of the city.<a name=155:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the next point, the preciousness of what is there.<a name=155:15></a> "And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear

		glass.<a name=156:1></a> And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones" -- I need not enumerate them -- "And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass".<a name=156:2></a> The idea which that conveys to me is that it is the precious result of the formative work of God individually in the saints.<a name=156:3></a> The light is refracted in the precious stones.<a name=156:4></a> No precious stone gives light, but refracts light, it throws off light.<a name=156:5></a> And that is the preciousness of the church in that sense.<a name=156:6></a> But then each is the fruit and result of the work of the lapidary, everything that would obstruct light has been removed.<a name=156:7></a> The idea of preciousness in each individual part is carried on to the gates.<a name=156:8></a> The foundation was the beginning, and the gates the completion.<a name=156:9></a> "Every several gate" is of one pearl; each was unique of its kind.<a name=156:10></a> It all conveys, I think, the idea of the work of the Spirit of God in the saints; the practical result of which is that every saint is bright in the light which comes from Christ.<a name=156:11></a> That is what ought to be here, every one of us should reflect some trait of the perfectness of Christ.<a name=156:12></a> That is the preciousness.<a name=156:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to the fourth point, to what I may call the characteristics of the city.<a name=156:14></a> It says, "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.<a name=156:15></a> And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.<a name=156:16></a> And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.<a name=156:17></a> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.<a name=156:18></a> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.<a name=156:19></a> And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but they which are written in the Lamb's book of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		life".<a name=157:1></a> These are the distinctive marks.<a name=157:2></a> The first is, there is no temple.<a name=157:3></a> I doubt if there ever was before a city without a temple, but the heavenly city has no temple, because the city itself is really the church, and is composed entirely of living stones, profession has no place; and hence there is no temple -- "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it".<a name=157:4></a> You could not have a temple in the heavenly city, where God dwells and is approached without a veil, a temple would be out of place.<a name=157:5></a> You can have and do have a temple here upon earth, for in the present dispensation, saints, living stones, are the temple in the midst of profession, and the city is not yet.<a name=157:6></a> In heaven there is no temple.<a name=157:7></a> Those who constitute the city were the temple down here.<a name=157:8></a> That is the first characteristic.<a name=157:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is, that there is no need of natural light; they have no need of the sun nor of the moon; the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.<a name=157:10></a> It is enlightened by what is displayed of God in what God has secured for Himself for His own glory, for the display of His own attributes; and all made known in the Lamb; it is that which is the light of the temple, and they do not need natural light.<a name=157:11></a> A man who is a great natural light is no good as such in the temple of God.<a name=157:12></a> The Corinthians were looking for natural light, cultivated men, men of parts.<a name=157:13></a> And that is where Christendom is at the present time; but what is suited for the temple is the spiritual man; and as to the city, the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof, the lamp-bearer.<a name=157:14></a> What they are enlightened by in the heavenly city is all the good of God; divine attributes in their display and satisfaction, all shine out there.<a name=157:15></a> That is the second great characteristic.<a name=157:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third is, that the nations get the good of it.<a name=157:17></a> Just as in regard to the temple the Lord could say, "My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations", that is, the nations were to get the good of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=158>[Page 158]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what was established in Israel, so when you come to the heavenly city, the nations are to walk in the light of it; that is, all the light which comes out in the church is good for the nations.<a name=158:1></a> The revelation of God and of what God is, which is centred in the church, holds good in blessing for the nations down here; and how it is effectual is in the sense, that if God could make known in the church "the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus", how good God must be!<a name=158:2></a> That will hold good for the nations here upon earth, they will walk in the light of the city.<a name=158:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there is one more point, the gates of it are not shut.<a name=158:4></a> The reason is that there is no night there; the very power of good and light excludes the entrance of anything that is of darkness; there is the opposite element to darkness, and when this is so then no darkness gains entrance, there is no night there.<a name=158:5></a> That is the last characteristic of the heavenly city.<a name=158:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have touched upon four: the first is, there is no temple in that blessed scene, there is nothing into which God retreats.<a name=158:7></a> Then they have no need of natural light, neither sun nor moon, the greatest natural light is all out of place there.<a name=158:8></a> Then it is good for the nations; the nations walk in the light of it.<a name=158:9></a> Finally, there is no night there, and therefore the gates are not shut by day; evil and darkness are kept out by the power of good.<a name=158:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt, beloved friends, that all these characteristics ought to be seen in the church on earth; that what will come out in the heavenly city ought in principle to have marked the temple of God down here.<a name=158:11></a> The church ought to have known its own privilege, that Jew and Gentile by one Spirit had access to the Father; there was no temple in that sense; and that the greatest natural lights were entirely out of place where the Spirit of God was; that what was wanted was the spiritual man.<a name=158:12></a> Then
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=159>[Page 159]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		again, the nations ought to have got the good, because the church was to be in the place of supplication and prayer and intercession and giving of thanks for all men.<a name=159:1></a> Then again, evil ought to have been excluded by the very power of the good and light in the temple; there should not have been any night there.<a name=159:2></a> Night and darkness came in by the work of the enemy, affinity existed, and thus it was that things became corrupted.<a name=159:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wonderful that God has been pleased to show to us not only what the temple will be -- "all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord" -- but how the church will come out in its public, outward aspect as the city, and all the features and characteristics which will mark it when it does come down from God out of heaven.<a name=159:4></a> It is worthy the name of a great city, the true metropolis.<a name=159:5></a> May God give us grace that faith may lay hold of it.<a name=159:6></a> I do not think you can take in the truth of it without its having some present effect upon you.<a name=159:7></a> The features which will come out perfectly then, ought to mark those who, through grace, have really returned to the first principles of the church.<a name=159:8></a> It is a great thing that God should have brought us back to it; and my conviction is this, that it is really the truth which God has been pleased to give us in a special way through John, that has brought us back in some little degree to the apprehension of what God gave originally through Paul, the truth of the church in its relations to Christ.<a name=159:9></a> And depend upon it, the more we enter into the truth of the church's place in relation to Christ, the more we shall enjoy the thought of the wonderful display which God is going to make in the heavenly city.<a name=159:10></a> May God give us to understand it spiritually.<a name=159:11></a> What is made known to us is but the completion of what exists; I could not say it is the completion of the word of God, because the revelation of the church as the body is that; but it is the completion in glory of that which is formed here.<a name=159:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My object, beloved friends, is briefly to run over this scripture.<a name=160:1></a> This epistle is very important and has a place peculiar to itself.<a name=160:2></a> The first two chapters are introductory.<a name=160:3></a> Chapter 1 shows us the scene morally of Christian fellowship, namely, the light as God is in the light, and the blood of Christ that enables us to be there.<a name=160:4></a> It is fellowship with the Father, with His Son, with the apostles, and with one another, and all in the light.<a name=160:5></a> In chapter 2 the apostle shows the hindrances and snares to which saints at different stages of spiritual growth are exposed.<a name=160:6></a> Chapters 3 and 4 unfold the substance of our blessing, the eternal life, and the way in which it works out in character and practice.<a name=160:7></a> Chapter 3 brings in relationship, and chapter 4 the Spirit and knowledge.<a name=160:8></a> Chapter 5 gives us the witness of the Spirit and of the water and blood all uniting in this, that eternal life is connected with the last Adam, not the first.<a name=160:9></a> It is the <i>present</i> blessing of saints which is before us.<a name=160:10></a> Eternal life is not as with the apostle Paul, viewed as the end.<a name=160:11></a> If I speak of having a thing in possession, I ought to be able to give some account of it, and to enable us to do this is the object of the great part of the epistle, especially chapters 3 and 4.<a name=160:12></a> If it were in promise, it would be secure to me; but if I have it in possession and am unable to give some account of it, it proves that I cannot have really entered into it.<a name=160:13></a>

		Every one would admit the importance of rightly dividing the word of truth.<a name=160:14></a> You can hardly present a greater hindrance to the effect of the word of God than in taking divine ideas out of the connection in which they are set in Scripture.<a name=160:15></a> The word must be patiently and diligently studied in detail, for there is no royal

		road to learning.<a name=161:1></a> Study Scripture in detail to get an idea of it as a whole.<a name=161:2></a> The Spirit of God alone can put it together as one in the soul, so that you apprehend it as a whole, while you see each part in its proper place.<a name=161:3></a> The apostle Paul says it was given to him to fulfil the word of God, and hence it is complete.<a name=161:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say a few words to show the contrast between John's epistle and John's gospel; these distinctions are of very great importance.<a name=161:5></a> First, as to the different way in which the same person is presented to us in each.<a name=161:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel the Son, though become Man, is presented on the divine side; and in the epistle mediatorially <i>as man</i>, though at the same time the true God; and it is in this connection eternal life to us comes in.<a name=161:7></a> To prove it to you, I have only to call your attention to the beginning of each book.<a name=161:8></a> (See <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>, etc.<a name=161:9></a>) "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=161:10></a> The first thirteen verses present an epitome of what He was, and the effect of His manifestation down here; it is not till verse 14 we get incarnation stated.<a name=161:11></a> The object of what is recorded is seen in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>.<a name=161:12></a> "These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name".<a name=161:13></a> Jesus (His personal name), the lowly Man, is the Christ, in whom is the accomplishment of the hopes and promises presented in the Old Testament, and at the same time the Son of God who has revealed the Father.<a name=161:14></a> He is thus the object of faith, that you might have life through His name.<a name=161:15></a> The object for which the gospel was written was to unfold the truth as to the only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, who has declared God.<a name=161:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle the same Person is presented to us on another side, as I have said, mediatorially as Man.<a name=161:17></a> We have what is true in Him and in us.<a name=161:18></a> You must have Christ as Man for that.<a name=161:19></a> In the gospel it is rather
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=162>[Page 162]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what is true in the Father and the Son.<a name=162:1></a> I have no part in Him as God, for I never cease to be a creature, though I may be richly blessed as such; it is on the human side only we can have any part in Christ.<a name=162:2></a> In the gospel He takes the ground, "before Abraham was, I am".<a name=162:3></a> Here in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1">1 John  1</a>it is what He was from the outset, that is, of that which the apostles had seen and heard of in Him as Man down here, from a point of which they could take account: the passage may possibly go on to resurrection, but refers to Him down here, as they had actually seen and known and been familiar with Him; but while presenting this, the epistle closes with the positive statement of the divine glory of His Person, He (Jesus Christ) is the true God and eternal life.<a name=162:4></a> (See chapter 5: 20.<a name=162:5></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point of difference between the gospel and the epistle is in the way in which eternal life is spoken of.<a name=162:6></a> In the gospel it is referred to as given, and viewed chiefly on the gift side.<a name=162:7></a> In the epistle, we have the experimental side, the progress and apprehension of the soul.<a name=162:8></a> You must hold to what Scripture teaches on both sides: for instance, in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1">1 Peter  1</a>we have saints "called", "redeemed" and "born again" -- this is all what God has done, while in chapter 2: 2-5 we have the advance and progress of the soul to salvation and the apprehension of corporate privileges.<a name=162:9></a> The epistles generally are for the instruction and leading on of believers, unfolding the features of their blessings that they may be able to give an account of them.<a name=162:10></a> The difference of intent between the gospel and the first epistle of John is seen by contrasting <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a> already quoted, and <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:13">1 John  5:13</a>: "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life".<a name=162:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more point of difference is as to the position of Jesus.<a name=162:12></a> In the gospel the glory of His Person is unfolded; but He appears as Man here in humiliation, having taken that form in order to suffer and thus
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=163>[Page 163]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		glorify God.<a name=163:1></a> We have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:31">John  13:31</a>, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him".<a name=163:2></a> He took suffering to glorify God.<a name=163:3></a> En the epistle, on the other hand, He is seen as Man with the Father.<a name=163:4></a> He does not go <i>as Man</i> to the Father till every question in which man was involved was settled.<a name=163:5></a> He was equally perfect as Man down here as now in glory.<a name=163:6></a> He came from the Father, and it was open to Him to go back at any moment to the place whence He came; but He had become the woman's seed, and before going back He removed every reproach that rested on man, all the judgment was removed.<a name=163:7></a> He can say in resurrection, "Peace be unto you".<a name=163:8></a> In the epistle Jesus is no longer seen in humiliation but in glory.<a name=163:9></a> He is as Man with the Father.<a name=163:10></a> When He is manifested we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.<a name=163:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I must return to chapter 1, the point in which is fellowship, and the scene to which it belongs, and in which alone it is realised.<a name=163:12></a> Fellowship is what we are called to, it is incidental to our blessing.<a name=163:13></a> Our starting point is Jesus Christ as Man with the Father, that is, there could be no fellowship with the Father apart from this.<a name=163:14></a> God having been fully revealed, and all that stood between God and man removed: we are admitted to fellowship because of it.<a name=163:15></a> The apostle says, "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ".<a name=163:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here self-interest has no place.<a name=163:17></a> In the world everything is more or less tinged by selfishness, we are ever looking after our own interests; but in the light we have all in common-common joys and interests with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, and with one another in the blessed circle of love.<a name=163:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to make plain where morally this blessed circle of love exists, where this fellowship is realised.<a name=163:19></a> We are told that God is light, but we have another thought added, namely, that He is in the light.<a name=163:20></a> "If we walk in the light, as he is <i>in</i> the light"; God is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=164>[Page 164]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		light, that is His nature, but now He is in the light of revelation, fully revealed in the blessedness of His being.<a name=164:1></a> God is in the light, and our privilege as believers is to walk in the light as He is in the light.<a name=164:2></a> All Christians are in the light, brought out of darkness into His marvellous light.<a name=164:3></a> The Son perfectly revealed the Father, and could say, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father", and we are placed in the presence of the Father perfectly revealed in the Son.<a name=164:4></a> The Holy Spirit does not reveal the Father.<a name=164:5></a> He makes good to us the revelation of the Father in the Son, so that we may enjoy and enter into the blessedness of it.<a name=164:6></a> We are brought into the light, and have fellowship one with another, and are clear of imputation, for the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.<a name=164:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One great consequence of Christ being as Man with the Father is, as we have seen, that we have fellowship with the Father, with His Son, and with one another.<a name=164:8></a> A second is that if anyone sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=164:9></a> Advocacy is brought in because the effect of sin is to hinder fellowship.<a name=164:10></a> The difference between a priest and an advocate is that the priest is for our infirmities that we may not fail, and the advocate, if we have sinned; He is the propitiation for our sins.<a name=164:11></a> And now the apostle says, "A new commandment I write unto you", that which is consequent upon redemption, "which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing, and the true light already shines".<a name=164:12></a> We stand in the presence of God as fully revealed as He can be, not only in His thoughts, but in His heart and affections.<a name=164:13></a> It is wonderful the blessing we are brought into.<a name=164:14></a> At the same time the light that reveals exposes all that is in me, but I am not afraid of it, for the light which exposes me has revealed how completely the work of Christ has removed all, and thus it is we enter into fellowship.<a name=164:15></a> If I have any truth or light on the word it is not only for myself, but for all, that all may

		benefit by it; fellowship shares all with others, no selfishness nor separate interests.<a name=165:1></a> The effect of the fall was to introduce selfishness, and in order to be free of it, we want the sense of being in the light as God is in the light, where all the blessed love of God is revealed, and we love Him because He first loved us.<a name=165:2></a> "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us".<a name=165:3></a> One of the last things we really accept is that we love Him because He first loved us.<a name=165:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great help to the understanding of the epistle to see the contrast it presents to the gospel.<a name=165:5></a> The gospel presents the Son in His rights as a divine Person; though become flesh, He is seen as the Giver, and as such greater than the gift He gives.<a name=165:6></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a> we read, "Thou wouldest have asked of him, and <i>he</i> would have given thee living water".<a name=165:7></a> If she had known the character of God as giving, and who it was that said unto her, "Give me to drink", she would have had both courage and confidence to ask Him, and He would have given her living water; and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:51">John  6:51</a>, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world".<a name=165:8></a> He gives to His sheep eternal life.<a name=165:9></a> The gospel takes the gift side, and hence there are no gradations in saints, for the question of apprehension or progress is not brought in.<a name=165:10></a> Gift is to all alike, and is the link with God.<a name=165:11></a> If one has not now the gift he has not properly any link with God.<a name=165:12></a> There may be a work of God's Spirit preparatory in a person, but it is as receiving a gift that my soul is linked through grace with the giver.<a name=165:13></a> I am a sheep.<a name=165:14></a> I have received a gift and He is the Giver.<a name=165:15></a> The epistle,

		It has often been noticed that with John eternal life is in the main viewed as present, and with Paul as future.<a name=173:7></a> The fact is this -- in either case it connects itself with the particular line of teaching.<a name=173:8></a> Paul is always leading on to the full result in glory; he looks at the saint as associated with a glorified Christ according to the eternal purpose of God, who has predestinated us "to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Christ in glory), "that he might be the firstborn among many brethren"; and hence, speaking generally, we find that in Paul's writings eternal life is referred to the future, "the end" is "eternal life".<a name=173:9></a> But with John it is different.<a name=173:10></a> John's point is that in connection with the lifting up of the Son of man, and the revelation of the Father's name, the blessed truth of eternal life had come out as a present thing here upon earth; and it is the substance of it which he unfolds in chapters 3 and 4 of this epistle.<a name=173:11></a> Nobody,

		Now the leading point in chapter 3 is relationship, and in chapter 4, knowledge.<a name=174:2></a> In the one statement in Scripture which professes to give the form and character of eternal life as present blessing, we are told, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".<a name=174:3></a> Anyone can thus see what an exceedingly important element knowledge is in Christian blessing; for the Lord Himself has told us that eternal life is <i>to know</i> the Father and Jesus Christ His sent One.<a name=174:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what comes out in chapter 3 is relationship, and what is connected with it; for if God puts us into a new and heavenly relationship, He gives us at the same time the moral being which is suited to the relationship, and the being which is suited to the relationship will come out in the way of character here upon earth, for it is myself.<a name=174:5></a> And that is what I want to bring out; I want to show you, if I can, that we are in Christ for blessing, and Christ in us for character.<a name=174:6></a> The two things are bound to go together, and cannot properly be separated; because if we have His place before the Father, His character is to come out in us before the world.<a name=174:7></a> It is just the substance of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>in regard to the disciples; He puts them in His own place before the Father, and before the world.<a name=174:8></a> Thus there are the two things, relationship, and the moral being which is suited to the relationship, and it is impossible to have the one without the other.<a name=174:9></a> You will find those are the two great points which come out in this chapter.<a name=174:10></a>

		upon us, that we should be called the children of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.<a name=177:1></a> Beloved, now are we the children of God.<a name=177:2></a> I change the word 'sons' to 'children', for the word 'sons' rather obscures the sense; the real word is that commonly used in the New Testament for 'children'.<a name=177:3></a> I will give you two other passages where the word occurs.<a name=177:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>-16: "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<a name=177:5></a> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<a name=177:6></a> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God".<a name=177:7></a> Here we have both words, 'sons' and 'children'.<a name=177:8></a> We can understand, if we think for a moment, that the Spirit is the Spirit of sonship, because the Spirit has come down from Christ as Man in glory; to give effect to the purpose revealed in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=177:9></a> "It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory".<a name=177:10></a> The Spirit is not spoken of as the Spirit of children; but "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit" -- not that we are sons, because the Spirit is the Spirit of sonship -- but that we are children, and that is what I should speak of as the present relationship.<a name=177:11></a> I do not mean to deny that "sons" is also present relationship, but 'sons' carries the thought of complete likeness to Christ in glory, which is hardly the force of "children".<a name=177:12></a>

		Another passage in which we find the word 'children' is <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a>: That ye may be blameless and harmless, the children of God -- not here the 'sons' of God, for the word is 'children' -- children "of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world".<a name=177:13></a> My conviction is that the title 'children' conveys the idea in Scripture of association with a rejected, suffering Christ.<a name=177:14></a> "If so

		I have said sometimes that there is one peculiarly blessed thing which Christ did, and that is, He brought the affections of the Father here into this world.<a name=178:8></a> I dare say you will ask me how.<a name=178:9></a> Why, by Himself being the object of them.<a name=178:10></a> How could He be here upon the earth without the Father's affections being here?<a name=178:11></a> By the very fact of His becoming Man He brought the Father's affections here to the earth, resting upon Himself as their blessed and sufficient Object.<a name=178:12></a> But I find also another thought, and that is that He left those affections here, not that He has ceased to be the object of them now that He is in glory; but He has left objects of them here in those for whom He gave Himself.<a name=178:13></a> That is the meaning of the prayer at the close of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<a name=178:14></a> How little we enter into it!<a name=178:15></a> or rather, I will speak of myself, and say, How little I enter into

		The truth of relationship comes out in the preface of John's gospel.<a name=179:14></a> In chapter 1: 10-12 it says, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<a name=179:15></a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<a name=179:16></a> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons [children] of God".<a name=179:17></a>

		We have gained immensely, if I might so say, by the rejection of Christ.<a name=180:1></a> If He had been received, there would have been blessing for men upon the earth, the kingdom and temporal blessings, the fulfilment of the promises, and so on.<a name=180:2></a> But what He has done consequent upon being unknown of the world and not received of His people, has been to put those who believe in Him into the blessed place of children before the Father by revealing to them the Father's name!<a name=180:3></a> That is what came out in the pathway of the Lord Jesus down here (for He was that eternal life which was with the Father), and was shown to men in what He was, even when here upon earth.<a name=180:4></a> It was manifested to men by grace that the Father stood in relationship to a Man here upon earth.<a name=180:5></a> The eternal life which was manifested to the disciples was with the Father; and that is what was permitted to be seen.<a name=180:6></a> And now the apostle himself, and others, stood in this blessed place before the Father, and had to make it known for the benefit and blessing of others.<a name=180:7></a> So I can understand the apostle saying, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons [children] of God".<a name=180:8></a>

		One word more about it.<a name=180:9></a> This calling is the gift of the Father, the Son brings us into it, and the Holy Spirit witnesses to it.<a name=180:10></a> That is the office of each divine Person in connection with this present relationship.<a name=180:11></a> It is the gift of the Father, that is the way in which the apostle speaks of it here, "What manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us"; and Jesus brings us into it, to as many as received Him to them He gave the title to take the place of the children of God; and the Holy Spirit "beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God", and then the character is to come out.<a name=180:12></a> It is not a relationship in which we are contemplated as being perfected.<a name=180:13></a> What I mean is this: it says, "Every man that hath this hope in him" -- it is a relationship to which a hope is attached.<a name=180:14></a>

		What is the hope?<a name=181:1></a> That we shall be fully like Christ when He appears.<a name=181:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle lays stress on the relationship being present, and he says, "Now are we children of God".<a name=181:3></a> It is a great point to bear that in mind.<a name=181:4></a> You will never have the relationship more really than now, and the Holy Spirit witnesses to it.<a name=181:5></a> A Christian will never be more entitled to enjoy the Father's affections than he is at the present moment; but I am looking forward, and so I trust is every Christian, to being in the actuality of likeness to Christ as sons in glory, "When he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is".<a name=181:6></a> Beloved friends, when we see Christ as He is, we shall be in His likeness.<a name=181:7></a> You will be made in His likeness by His word when He comes; you will be conformed to His likeness in order that you may see Him as He is.<a name=181:8></a> "And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure".<a name=181:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus there are three great things in this passage connected with our blessing, the foundation, the superstructure, and the hope.<a name=181:10></a> I believe that in glory the relationship of children will be merged as it were in that of sons; 'sons' is the term which describes the relationship in full result, though now the Spirit is spoken of as the Spirit of sonship; and we are "God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=181:11></a> But I have been trying to bring out the line of truth developed in John.<a name=181:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the things of which I have spoken are the blessings we have in Christ.<a name=181:13></a> We have no title to them in ourselves.<a name=181:14></a> If I look at myself as created for earth, I could not have title to be a child of God, it is what I have through grace in the Son; and to enjoy it we must abide in the Son.<a name=181:15></a> We have no sense of the relationship or of the blessings connected with it except as we abide in the Son.<a name=181:16></a> Faith must come in for the enjoyment of it, for it is in Him we have it.<a name=181:17></a>

		But again, in this relationship which we have with the Father, another truth comes in -- We have passed out of death into life, for the relationship is expressive of life.<a name=182:14></a> And that is really what the expression "eternal life" conveys in Scripture.<a name=182:15></a> I have thus left by faith all connected with death, have passed out of death into life.<a name=182:16></a> Speaking about myself in flesh down here, I could not say I have passed out of death into life.<a name=182:17></a> Speaking of myself in the glory of a child of God, I say I have passed out of death into life; that is, faith has passed into a new place and relationship before the Father, where it is totally impossible for death ever to come.<a name=182:18></a> How could death ever touch what Christ was with the Father?<a name=182:19></a> Death could, when God so willed it, touch His life as a man down here upon earth, what He was after the flesh (though there was no liability to death), but death could not touch His relationship as Man with the Father.<a name=182:20></a> And so it is with the Christian.<a name=182:21></a> Death will touch me unless the Lord comes: but death cannot touch what I am with

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have noticed, beloved friends, in the previous part of the epistle, the contrast between the way in which the same thing is in general presented to us in the gospel and in the epistle, and the principle applies, I think, to the other gospels and epistles.<a name=190:7></a> In the gospels you will commonly find that whatever blessing is presented,

	<div class="paragraph">
		it is referred to on the divine side, and hence in an absolute way: it is the grace or gift of God's will, where properly speaking the idea of experience does not come in.<a name=191:1></a> It is specially the case in the gospel of John, in which the Saviour is presented to us as the only-begotten Son, revealing God, and Himself the Giver of the gift; He gives the living water, He gives eternal life to His sheep, and the gift is looked at in the absoluteness of the giving.<a name=191:2></a> It is not there a question of experience; to mix up the question of experience with gift would be to invalidate the giving.<a name=191:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you come to the epistle, the case is different.<a name=191:4></a> There things are looked at on the experimental side; because the object of the epistles is, I suppose, to lead us into the present reality of what is given to us.<a name=191:5></a> We are formed by the revelation.<a name=191:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have remarked on previous occasions that the first two chapters of the epistle are introductory, while the last is supplementary.<a name=191:7></a> The first chapter takes up the ground of our fellowship, and the second speaks of saints according to their spiritual progress.<a name=191:8></a> Both chapters look at saints practically as in the world.<a name=191:9></a> The closing chapter is supplementary to the apostle's witness, introducing the three witness bearers, which prove that the gift that is given to us is in the last Adam and not in the first.<a name=191:10></a> But the substance of the epistle, as I might say, really lies in chapters 3 and 4.<a name=191:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 3 we had before us last time, and chapter 4 is so tonight.<a name=191:12></a> My first object is to point out the essential difference between chapters 3 and 4, and to show you that looked at on the experimental side (not the gift side), chapter 4 is an advance on chapter 3.<a name=191:13></a> Perhaps a person might say, You cannot have chapter 3 without chapter 4, and vice versa.<a name=191:14></a> Well, I admit that in a sense.<a name=191:15></a> Still, for all that, in the way in which the truth is unfolded here, chapter 4 presents to us an advance on chapter 3.<a name=191:16></a> It is really more objective in its bearing.<a name=191:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord helping me, I will show you the leading features of chapter 4; but before I pass on to that, I will say a word or two further about chapter 3.<a name=192:1></a> The leading point in chapter 3, as we saw last time, is the truth of relationship; for relationship has come in.<a name=192:2></a> In chapter 1 we find the truth of forgiveness; but in our positive blessing as Christians, the first great feature and element is relationship; we are brought by the Father's gift into a relationship which for man never had any existence before.<a name=192:3></a> There were in previous dispensations saints of God, and in a way there was relationship before; but the peculiar form of relationship which is referred to in chapter 3 had no existence here until Christ came.<a name=192:4></a> It is a relationship which is peculiar to John, and though intimately connected with the relationship of sons, is described as that of children.<a name=192:5></a> I have said often that the thought prominent in it is association with Christ, unknown and rejected here, because Christ is looked at in that way, and we as children are brought into association with Him; children of God, the objects of the Father's affection, in a world from which Christ has been rejected.<a name=192:6></a> The world knows us not even as it knew Him not.<a name=192:7></a> We are associated with Him for glory as sons, that is the full height of the relationship to which we are called; but the idea of children, although sometimes presented in Paul, is more peculiar to John.<a name=192:8></a> It is what comes out in chapter 1 of the gospel, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<a name=192:9></a> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<a name=192:10></a> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons [children] of God".<a name=192:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is one point in chapter 3, and another is the moral being which is suited to the relationship.<a name=192:12></a> And it is in virtue of these two points that we abide in God and God in us; as to the relationship, we abide in God, and as to the moral being, from which the character springs, God abides in us.<a name=192:13></a> I want to say a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=193>[Page 193]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		word about the moral being because, if you desire to understand Scripture, your minds must be capable of grasping the thought of moral being as something distinct from our present actual being as men upon earth, an inner man.<a name=193:1></a> We have part in a new moral being, which is really ourselves, but is not yet clothed in a suitable condition, a house out of heaven.<a name=193:2></a> We shall be clothed, but the new being exists now, and you could not have the new relationship without it.<a name=193:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable to me that the new being is expressed in one word in chapter 3: 7, "Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous".<a name=193:4></a> The point here is not that you are accounted righteous, it is not a divine reckoning, but it is a being -- I do not know a better term to use.<a name=193:5></a> He that doeth righteousness is righteous after the same order as Christ; as in the expression (I only use it as an illustration), "The new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness".<a name=193:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point comes before us in the chapter: that the righteous one loves.<a name=193:7></a> It is an interesting connection which has only lately been brought before me.<a name=193:8></a> The righteous person, that is, the person in whom God has His place, loves.<a name=193:9></a> The righteous one owns the obligation to love, for, "This is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another"; and finds power to carry it out, and in that way proves that he has "passed from death unto life".<a name=193:10></a> I do not go further into the point tonight, because I do not know enough about it to unfold it thoroughly, but you may take it for granted -- the righteous one loves.<a name=193:11></a> Christ was the righteous One; He is continually spoken of in that way in this epistle; and He loved.<a name=193:12></a> It is beautifully brought out at the close of chapter 3, "Hereby perceive we the love .<a name=193:13></a>.<a name=193:14></a>.<a name=193:15></a> because he laid down his life for us".<a name=193:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have just referred to what is thus presented to us in chapter 3, because I did not feel I could pass on to chapter 4 without a few words on it.<a name=194:9></a> And you see, beloved friends, the great importance of that chapter, because it gives us the substance of the blessing.<a name=194:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what marks chapter 4 is first the Spirit, and secondly knowledge, but knowledge, I think, more in the sense of what I may call consciousness.<a name=194:11></a> I will go into detail presently, but I want those two points to be impressed upon your minds -- the Spirit, and with the Spirit, knowledge.<a name=194:12></a> If you read chapter 4 attentively, you will find that knowledge has a great place; I look to the Lord to enable me to show you how it works out, and how extremely important it is.<a name=194:13></a> And it is that which makes me say that in a sense it is an advance on chapter 3; not morally exactly, because you can have nothing better than the relationship, and the being suited to the relationship, but in privilege.<a name=194:14></a> The Spirit and knowledge are of the greatest possible moment to us, for we do not get into the reality of our privilege apart from the Spirit and the knowledge which the Spirit brings.<a name=194:15></a> All real Christian knowledge is by the Holy Spirit.<a name=194:16></a> If we say "we know", as in "we know that we have passed from death unto life", "we know that he abideth in us", and so on, it is all evidently by the Holy Spirit; you cannot talk about
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=195>[Page 195]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christian knowledge really, apart from the Holy Spirit.<a name=195:1></a> "The spiritual discerns all things".<a name=195:2></a> There is no such thought in Scripture as the knowledge of divine things, the knowledge of God, or what is of God, except in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=195:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to enlarge upon those two great points -- the Spirit, and knowledge which is consequent upon the possession of the Spirit.<a name=195:4></a> What you come to in the last verse of chapter 3, the point you begin with, is certainty; and you never get the idea of certainty apart from the Holy Spirit.<a name=195:5></a> For the Holy Spirit is the seal of God upon the believer, and, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his".<a name=195:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just contrast with the last verse of chapter 3, verse 24 of chapter 2, "Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning.<a name=195:7></a> If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you" -- 'continue' and 'abide' and 'remain' are the same word, but they are changed in the translation for the sake of euphony -- "ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.<a name=195:8></a> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life".<a name=195:9></a> In the latter part of verse 24, an 'if' is introduced, just as we find a similar 'if' in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>.<a name=195:10></a> "You .<a name=195:11></a>.<a name=195:12></a>.<a name=195:13></a> now hath he reconciled .<a name=195:14></a>.<a name=195:15></a>.<a name=195:16></a> if ye continue in the faith".<a name=195:17></a> It does not call in question the reality of reconciliation, but as long as saints are down here an 'if' is attached to it, because you have to continue in the faith, continuance is the test.<a name=195:18></a> Now contrast that with what you get at the close of chapter 3: "He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him"; that is, as I understand it, we continue in God, as to our place and relationship, and God continues in us, as to what is presented in the way of moral being and character.<a name=195:19></a> And mark what follows: "And hereby <i>we know</i> that he abideth in us" -- it is no longer an 'if', the thing is no longer put in connection with our responsibility; "hereby we know that

		<a name=196>[Page 196]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us" -- there is certainty.<a name=196:1></a> The Spirit brings to the soul the sense of certainty in the new position and in the new connections in which the saints are found.<a name=196:2></a> The Spirit is in accord with, and the seal of, the blessing.<a name=196:3></a> That is the first point.<a name=196:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is this, that you are in a completely new order of things.<a name=196:5></a> It gives me the idea of being, as it were, in a vessel let down from heaven; that is, I am morally apart from the world, and supported from heaven.<a name=196:6></a> I abide in God, and God abides in me.<a name=196:7></a> I am independent in that sense of all here; I have no link with God as connected with the earth, but I abide in that blessed relationship with God which is of a heavenly character.<a name=196:8></a> And more than that, God abides in me, that is, I do not depend on man, or human resources, or my own ability; God abides in me.<a name=196:9></a> I do not know how better to illustrate it than by the idea of a person supported in a vessel let down from heaven.<a name=196:10></a> We are in entirely new associations, which are divine in character, for in John we have not only what is heavenly, but divine in character, and God abides in us.<a name=196:11></a> And now, I have come to this point, I am conscious of it.<a name=196:12></a> I have to learn it in a certain sense, and, having learnt it, I am conscious of it, I know it by the Spirit that dwells in me.<a name=196:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is a wonderful place to be in, beloved friends.<a name=196:14></a> I would to God that everyone here might apprehend it.<a name=196:15></a> I will go on now to show the marks of it, how it works out.<a name=196:16></a> Because John is careful in every point of truth he brings out, to show how it works out in the life and testimony of saints.<a name=196:17></a> John is essentially practical, although so abstract.<a name=196:18></a> Whatever place and blessing we are brought into before God, with its consequent association and intimacy, all with John is to work out into practice here.<a name=196:19></a> And I want to show the way in which it is to work out.<a name=196:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see in what follows that three things are contemplated,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=197>[Page 197]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		first (in the beginning of chapter 4) we find the power to try spirits, the detection of spirits; secondly, that we come out as disciples of Christ; and thirdly, that we have part in the testimony of grace, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<a name=197:1></a> These three points I want to speak of in detail.<a name=197:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<a name=197:3></a> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.<a name=197:4></a> Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<a name=197:5></a> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.<a name=197:6></a> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us.<a name=197:7></a> Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error".<a name=197:8></a> That is the first point.<a name=197:9></a> And we get here that greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world: that is, that we have no occasion to be afraid of the world, or of the influences at work there, of the spirits which act there, because we have got this principle now, the Holy Spirit is in the believer, "greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world".<a name=197:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, I get the power of detection, for things are resolved; in the eyes of the one that has the Spirit of God, all is traced back to its source.<a name=197:11></a> For instance, if I saw the world busy with so-called Christian literature, popular books which everybody was reading, I should conclude that it is of the world, and therefore the world heareth it.<a name=197:12></a> On the other hand, the apostle says, "He that knoweth God heareth us", there is the test.<a name=197:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=198>[Page 198]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, if I want to know the people that are of God, I look for the people that hear the apostles.<a name=198:1></a> There are two great sources -- the world of one class of literature, and the apostles who are of God of another; and the world hears what is of the world, and those who are of God hear what is of the apostles.<a name=198:2></a> "Hereby", says the apostle, "know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error".<a name=198:3></a> It is deplorable to see saints reading the books which are popular in the world.<a name=198:4></a> The world is not altogether averse to so-called religious books; but if they suit their taste, it proves the books are of the world.<a name=198:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And allow me here to offer a word of warning; and I would not attempt to warn anyone in regard to what I have not gone through in experience for myself.<a name=198:6></a> Our danger is in taking things second-hand, instead of from the source, the fountain; for after all, what you want to hear is the apostles.<a name=198:7></a> That is what the apostle says here, "We are of God", and I believe great force is to be attached to that expression; none could say in the same sense as an apostle, "We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us".<a name=198:8></a> And I advise everybody here, get your ideas direct from the fountain-head.<a name=198:9></a> I do not undervalue periodicals, and writings; but at the same time I would much prefer to see saints paying more attention to what comes direct from the fountainhead, from Scripture itself.<a name=198:10></a> That is what the apostle says, "He that knoweth God hears us".<a name=198:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the first point here is the ability to trace things to their source, to detect spirits, and thus not to be taken in by different things which present themselves to us in the world.<a name=198:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the next thing, to something more positive -- we come out as disciples of Christ.<a name=198:13></a> "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<a name=198:14></a> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<a name=198:15></a> In this was manifested the love of God

		I desire to dwell upon this, for it is an excessively beautiful thought.<a name=199:10></a> The two great points in the latter part of <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>are God glorified in the Son of man (I dare say most will remember the verse, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him"), and the new commandment.<a name=199:11></a> That is, the Son of man was to take a new place in the glory of God; He was not to be publicly glorified yet, but glorified in God; Man, in the Person of the Son of man, was to have a completely new place with God.<a name=199:12></a> And the divine character was to come out in the saints down here; they were to be known as disciples of Christ, because they had love one to another.<a name=199:13></a> Do you understand what it is to be a disciple?<a name=199:14></a> I think discipleship is more than faith, because discipleship implies this, that I have learnt of my teacher.<a name=199:15></a> No man can teach what he does not know.<a name=199:16></a> And it is a fact, that the best teacher is the man most competent to teach the elements.<a name=199:17></a> Christ could teach perfectly because He knew what He taught.<a name=199:18></a> He knew perfectly the love of God.<a name=199:19></a> He was God, but as man He knew the love of God and therefore He could make it known.<a name=199:20></a> And if the disciples

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us get the lesson taught in the passage.<a name=200:2></a> I can understand the question, How can we walk in love, how can we practise love?<a name=200:3></a> The answer is, Because we have found out the love of God.<a name=200:4></a> And that is why the apostle speaks in this way.<a name=200:5></a> He says, "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<a name=200:6></a> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<a name=200:7></a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<a name=200:8></a> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another".<a name=200:9></a> You see the cardinal point here is this, that "we know", we have made discovery of the way in which the love of God has come out towards us.<a name=200:10></a> I dwell upon that only to show that God was completely first with us.<a name=200:11></a> The two points brought out in verses 9 and 10 are that the condition in which we were was that of being spiritually dead as regards God, and sinners, and when that was the case the love of God was toward us; He loved us and sent His only-begotten Son into the world that we might live through Him, that He might be the propitiation for our sins.<a name=200:12></a> Now we can look that blessed truth in the face.<a name=200:13></a> The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.<a name=200:14></a> It is not that I am discovering these wonderful things for the first time, but I now enjoy them.<a name=200:15></a> And I find in this blessed truth, that which has given me a motive for my own practice, for it is positive unrighteousness in me to act differently from what God has acted to me.<a name=200:16></a> That I lay down as an unquestionable principle.<a name=200:17></a> It was that which brought upon the man who owed ten thousand talents the exaction of all the debt, because he did not act as he had been acted to.<a name=200:18></a> God has shown to us the most boundless love, and "If God so loved us, we

		<a name=201>[Page 201]</a>

		ought also to love one another".<a name=201:1></a> And we make manifest in that way that we are disciples of Christ, in that we have love one to another.<a name=201:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a blessed thing to come out as a disciple of Christ, because it proves that I know God, not only have I made discovery of the goodness of God, but I can now enjoy the wonderful revelation of God.<a name=201:3></a> At the first I had to find out the grace of God when I was a sinner; but thank God, it is not that now.<a name=201:4></a> I can now see how God was beforehand with us, and that we owe everything to the sovereign love of God.<a name=201:5></a> "If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another".<a name=201:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And we have a further word, still connecting itself with our coming out as disciples of Christ.<a name=201:7></a> The apostle uses the same form of expression here as in the gospel of John.<a name=201:8></a> There it is, "No man hath seen God at any time.<a name=201:9></a> The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=201:10></a> Here it is, "No one hath seen God at any time.<a name=201:11></a> If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us".<a name=201:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the third point, "Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us" -- we have this "we know" again; it is almost a repetition of the passage at the close of chapter 3, but a little fuller, because it includes the thought of our abiding in Him.<a name=201:13></a> "Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.<a name=201:14></a> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<a name=201:15></a> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God".<a name=201:16></a> Now we have part in the blessed testimony of grace.<a name=201:17></a> But you are not really clear for it unless you understand the new, and blessed, and divine character of the association into which you are brought.<a name=201:18></a> I believe the man who would be the most effective evangelist is the man who is most clear of the world, because he then really approaches the world

	<div class="paragraph">
		from the divine side.<a name=202:1></a> As we have seen, we have the ability to judge of the character of things, to test spirits.<a name=202:2></a> We come out as disciples of Christ, and approach the world with the blessed testimony that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<a name=202:3></a> And you cannot in a certain sense go higher.<a name=202:4></a> We may be led by the grace of God into the enjoyment of our own portion -- that is perfectly true -- but as to the moral height of things, you cannot go beyond the gospel, the testimony of divine love to the world.<a name=202:5></a> It is the witness of the sovereignty of that love in which God has been pleased to approach the world, to send His Son to be the Saviour of the world; "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=202:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see thus, in some measure, the effect of the consciousness of the new and blessed association into which we are brought, in our ability to go through the world superior to it, because greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world, to come out here shining brightly in the blessed character of disciples of Christ, having learnt from Him of the love of God, and to bear our part too in the testimony of grace.<a name=202:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everybody will agree with me as to the mode in which the apostle brings everything out in a practical shape in the Christian.<a name=202:8></a> But how is it we come out in this way?<a name=202:9></a> Because, by the grace of God, we know how completely we are free of all that is here.<a name=202:10></a> We abide in God and God in us, and know it by the Holy Spirit.<a name=202:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If there is one thing I am ashamed of as to myself, it is the little degree in which Christianity takes practical shape with me.<a name=202:12></a> I honestly own it, because whatever faults one may have, one would not care to be a hypocrite.<a name=202:13></a> I have a sort of consciousness of the blessing into which we are brought by the grace of God, but it fills me often with shame to think in how

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have only a few words more to say, and that is as to the succeeding verses, in which you will find some wonderful truth unfolded, for the apostle will not stop until he has fully shown the way in which the love of God connects itself with the saint through the whole of his responsible course.<a name=203:3></a> It is striking how the apostle connects every thought with us as saints down here, not as saints in glory.<a name=203:4></a> It is true that when He is manifested we shall be like Him.<a name=203:5></a> But in this chapter he shows us divine love in connection with us in our course down here, and therefore goes on to the day of judgment.<a name=203:6></a> He begins with the time when we were spiritually dead, and sinners, for we were responsible because we were sinners; then he shows the connection of the love with us as saints, and then speaks of the day of judgment, which is the wind-up and end of the entire chapter of our responsibility.<a name=203:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just point it out, because I had much rather your attention were fastened on the scripture than on anything I can say.<a name=203:8></a> He says, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=203:9></a> God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him".<a name=203:10></a> Now, beloved friends, that is the love which God has to us as saints, the love in which we abide.<a name=203:11></a> We abide in God, and to abide in God is to abide in the sense that I am in the blessed place of relationship before Him, and loved as Christ was loved.<a name=203:12></a> That is the consciousness in which we are entitled to be.<a name=203:13></a> It is the answer to the closing prayer of the Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me" -- that is, as a man upon earth -- "may be in them, and I in them".<a name=203:14></a> Now, says the apostle, "we have known and believed the love that God has to us".<a name=203:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=204>[Page 204]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the greatest joy and delight to know that upon earth we are the objects of the Father's love, of love such as that with which the Son was loved as a man down here.<a name=204:1></a> The apostle could say, "We have known and believed the love that God has to us" -- that is as saints.<a name=204:2></a> "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him" -- I abide in the consciousness of the love of God toward me; and more than that, God abides in me, so that the character of God comes out in my relations to the saints down here.<a name=204:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we come to what closes up this subject.<a name=204:4></a> He says, "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment".<a name=204:5></a> I think why he carries the thought on to the day of judgment is that he is still looking at the saint in connection with his course here upon earth; and therefore he says, "That we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is" -- though there is responsibility, and must be Christian responsibility so long as we are here, yet it cannot invalidate the truth for a moment -- "as he is" -- that is, as the Judge is -- "so are we in this world".<a name=204:6></a> Whatever He is to the Father, as Man, the object of the Father's delight, and affections, and favour, I say that is true to the saint, although there be at the same time the question of responsibility, which will be closed for ever at the day of judgment.<a name=204:7></a> "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=204:8></a> The object with which he introduces it is that all fear may be dispelled from the hearts of saints, because "fear hath torment", and "he that feareth is not made perfect in love".<a name=204:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And we come back at the close of the passage to this, "We love him, because he first loved us".<a name=204:10></a> I believe that the last and most difficult thing for a saint to learn is that God first loved him.<a name=204:11></a> We sometimes think that God loves us as we love Him.<a name=204:12></a> Scripture puts it the other way, "We love him, because he first

	<div class="page-number">

		loved us".<a name=205:1></a> When I am free of self, and of the thought of what I am for God, then I learn this blessed truth, that after all, if I love God at all, it is because He first loved me.<a name=205:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think I have strained the truth before us.<a name=205:3></a> I return to what I started with in the chapter, that I think it introduces the two great thoughts, of the Spirit, and of the knowledge and certainty which are connected with the presence of the Spirit.<a name=205:4></a> I am completely marked off from the world, because by the Spirit I am conscious of being in this new and blessed association, dwelling in God and God in me.<a name=205:5></a> I have power to go through the world, and to detect the form and character of evil which is presented to me there, and to come out in testimony for God as a disciple of Christ, and as bearing a part in the blessed gospel of grace, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<a name=205:6></a> And then, beloved friends, we have nothing to fear.<a name=205:7></a> What a great thing it would be for the mind and spirit to get free of all restlessness and effort, and to come to this -- to sit down and meditate when no eye is upon me but the eye of God -- here I am the object of the Father's perfect love, as the apostle says, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=205:8></a> God's love will never be greater to you than at this moment.<a name=205:9></a> You may have more entrance into it, you may see what that love brings to you, but God's love will never be more perfect to you than it is now.<a name=205:10></a> "Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=205:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May it have the effect, beloved friends, with every one of us, of producing the sense of certainty in the soul -- I do not mean a dogged kind of certainty, I think that is a bad kind of certainty -- but the certainty which flows from the presence and power of the Holy Spirit in the saints; to be really settled and assured in the blessed consciousness of what the love of God is,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May God establish all our hearts in His great grace, that we may know what it is to feast and to revel in the consciousness of what the love of God is toward us, who are brought into this blessed place of children in the Father's presence.<a name=206:2></a>

		I desire to make clear, if I can, the bearing of this chapter, and in order to do so it is necessary to bring before you what marks the testimony of the twelve and distinguishes it from that of Paul.<a name=206:3></a> Paul's witness is distinctive in that he began from Christ in glory.<a name=206:4></a> He knew the Lord only in glory; the Lord appeared to him from glory; and it is that which gives a character to the whole of Paul's testimony.<a name=206:5></a> He could not take the ground that the twelve did.<a name=206:6></a> Peter could say, "We are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost"; so that they put themselves in a sense as witnesses distinct from the Holy Spirit.<a name=206:7></a> They could do this on the ground of what Jesus had said to them; after speaking of the coming of the Comforter to bear witness, He added, "Ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning"; that is, He gives a distinct reason why they should bear witness, which had no application to Paul.<a name=206:8></a> He had not been with Christ from the outset.<a name=206:9></a> But there was to be also the continuous testimony of the Holy Spirit, come down to bear witness to Christ in glory.<a name=206:10></a> You will see in a few moments how what I have said connects itself with this epistle.<a name=206:11></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the writings of Peter and John you find the distinction I have alluded to maintained.<a name=207:1></a> I refer, for a moment, to illustrate it, to the writings of Peter.<a name=207:2></a> In both his epistles, Peter recalls that of which he had been a witness when Christ was here upon earth.<a name=207:3></a> In the first epistle the leading point is that the saints had come as living stones to a living stone; and Christ had been revealed to Peter as the living stone when here upon earth.<a name=207:4></a> The "living stone" was Christ as made known to Peter by the Father as the Son of the living God.<a name=207:5></a> Peter confesses Him thus, and the Lord says to him, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven"; which means, I judge, that the flesh and blood condition even in Christ had not in itself revealed it.<a name=207:6></a> It was a revelation of the Father to Peter when Christ was here upon earth; and hence Christ was to him a living stone, and the saints had come to Him as a living stone, and were being "built up a spiritual house", and so on.<a name=207:7></a> It is not the truth of the body, nor the thought of union with Christ in glory, but Peter's own peculiar line of truth -- Christ's assembly here.<a name=207:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second epistle Peter recalls the vision which he, with James and John, had seen on the mount of Transfiguration; so that both his epistles bring before us what had been made known to him when Christ was here upon earth.<a name=207:9></a> It was the effect of the Holy Spirit bringing all things to his remembrance.<a name=207:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That proves the point sufficiently with regard to Peter; and when I come to the apostle John, I find there the same principle.<a name=207:11></a> What John sets to work, in the greater part of his first epistle, to declare is what they had seen and heard and contemplated from the outset; as he says, "that which was from the beginning", what had been manifested in Christ seen and known when here.<a name=207:12></a> And that, I judge, is the reason why he speaks of eternal life in the abstract way that he does in chapter 1 of his epistle, for eternal life was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=208>[Page 208]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not what was outwardly expressed in the flesh and blood condition, for that condition was for God's will to come to an end in death; but still eternal life was there, and hence John has to speak about it in an abstract way as "that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us".<a name=208:1></a> It was really the Person of Christ, but in a sense apart from what He took in partaking of blood and flesh; for it was what He brought into manhood as the living bread come down from heaven; as the Lord brings out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me", for He was the living bread come down from heaven for a man to eat.<a name=208:2></a> What I have said explains why the apostle says, "was manifested unto us".<a name=208:3></a> Let the sun shine as brightly as it may, if all the people in the world were blind the sun would not be manifested; but if these blind people felt the heat of the sun, the sun would be manifested to them.<a name=208:4></a> It was not what the Lord was as seen on the surface; that was not the point at all; but what He was with the Father and was manifested to be to the apostles; by the grace of God, this was made manifest to them in Christ.<a name=208:5></a> They knew Christ distinct from what He was as Man here after the flesh.<a name=208:6></a> They saw "that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us".<a name=208:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to that in connection with John's testimony; and I believe what I have said is important to bear in mind if you want rightly to apprehend the epistle.<a name=208:8></a> John is calling, by the Spirit of God, to remembrance what they had seen and witnessed and heard in Christ down here; as the Lord said to them in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, "The Holy Ghost .<a name=208:9></a>.<a name=208:10></a>.<a name=208:11></a> shall .<a name=208:12></a>.<a name=208:13></a>.<a name=208:14></a> bring all things to your remembrance".<a name=208:15></a> Now I do not think that what comes out as to eternal life in the chapters we have had before us goes beyond what had been manifested in Christ when He was here.<a name=208:16></a> It is not, as yet, shown to us <i>where</i> it is.<a name=208:17></a> Take for instance what is found in chapter 3.<a name=208:18></a> There we get the principle of righteousness.<a name=208:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=209>[Page 209]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous".<a name=209:1></a> Righteousness first came out in Christ on earth.<a name=209:2></a> Innocence was in Adam; lawlessness came in with the fall, but Christ comes in, the righteous One, and He meets all in righteousness.<a name=209:3></a> And another principle comes out in connection with it, that is, perfect love, as displayed in laying down His life.<a name=209:4></a> Righteousness is first shown, because lawlessness was here, and was met by righteousness; and then in contrast to hatred as shown in Cain, perfect love comes out; "He laid down his life for us".<a name=209:5></a> So John recalls by the Spirit of God what had been manifested in Christ upon earth, righteousness and perfect love.<a name=209:6></a> Then the way in which he works it out as to us is this, that we are put in the relationship of children; and that every one doing righteousness is righteous as He is righteous, and hence the obligation to love according as Christ loved.<a name=209:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 4 we have seen how completely the believer is viewed as separate from the world, he is abiding in God, and God in him.<a name=209:8></a> This is a remarkable expression, and how perfectly true it was in principle in the Lord down here; I mean how perfectly separate Christ was morally from all that was here.<a name=209:9></a> He says, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?<a name=209:10></a>" That was the height of it.<a name=209:11></a> He was in the Father the object of the Father's affection and delight, and the Father was in Him.<a name=209:12></a> It was that which gave character to Christ here, for His object was not to display Himself, but to reveal the Father, and therefore He could say to Philip, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father"; the moral characteristics of the Father came out in Christ here.<a name=209:13></a> I think anyone can understand how perfectly distinct in that way Christ was from the world even when down here upon earth.<a name=209:14></a> He had His links after the flesh, but they did not interfere with that.<a name=209:15></a> In Christ faith was perfect, so that the communion proper to

		what He was was perfectly unhindered.<a name=210:1></a> Now the same principle comes out in chapter 4 in regard of us; "Hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit".<a name=210:2></a> The Spirit comes perfectly in accord with what we have and are in Christ, what the Father has given to us, and hence we are conscious of our place because the Spirit is in accord with all; He witnesses of all.<a name=210:3></a>

		To return to what I was saying at the beginning.<a name=210:4></a> The apostle, in order to bring to light what I have spoken of, recalls by the Spirit of God what had been manifested in Christ down here.<a name=210:5></a> He says, "We .<a name=210:6></a>bear witness"; he was bearing witness of what had been from the outset; and hence says, "If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.<a name=210:7></a> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life".<a name=210:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have referred to that to enable me to show the distinctiveness of chapter 5, in which the point is not that the apostle is witness, but that the Spirit is witness.<a name=210:9></a> What you find in chapter 5 is Christ as last Adam in glory; and hence it is not the recalling of what Christ was on earth, or what was manifested in Christ on earth, but of showing the true scene and present connection of eternal life.<a name=210:10></a> And hence we find, as I said, that the Spirit is the witness, that is, as I understand it, as come from Christ in glory.<a name=210:11></a> Chapter 5, in a certain sense, puts all on different ground; it speaks about the same person and the same thing; but it speaks of it in its connection, rather than in its characteristics, and therefore I get in chapter 5 a statement beyond chapter 1, and that is, "He [Jesus Christ] is the true God and eternal life".<a name=210:12></a> Eternal life was manifested in Him when here upon earth; now it goes further and says, "He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=210:13></a> All is now declared.<a name=210:14></a> That is, when I look at Christ in glory I have in Him the full revelation,

		not only of the true God, but of eternal life in its proper scene.<a name=211:1></a> And yet it had been manifested in Him when here upon earth, because it was of Himself, and it was bound to come out, though His glory was veiled.<a name=211:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think anybody can understand chapter 5 if they do not apprehend that the apostle leaves the ground he had been upon in the previous part of the epistle, namely, his own witness by the Holy Spirit calling to remembrance, and takes other ground, in which, as I have said, the Spirit is the witness, not exactly the apostle, but the Spirit by the apostle.<a name=211:3></a> The Spirit alone can be witness of Christ in glory.<a name=211:4></a> That is what I suppose the Lord meant at the close of <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>, "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father .<a name=211:5></a>.<a name=211:6></a>.<a name=211:7></a> he shall testify of me".<a name=211:8></a> The apostles lost sight of Christ in the cloud; that is the last they saw of Him.<a name=211:9></a> And who can testify to the truth of a Man in glory with the Father except the Holy Spirit?<a name=211:10></a> And this is, I judge, the point in this chapter.<a name=211:11></a>

		Look now at chapter 5: 6.<a name=211:12></a> "This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.<a name=211:13></a> And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth .<a name=211:14></a>.<a name=211:15></a>.<a name=211:16></a> and there are three that bear witness" -- the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one.<a name=211:17></a> "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son".<a name=211:18></a> Here we have not the apostle's remembrance by the Spirit, but the witness of God which He has testified of His Son.<a name=211:19></a> "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: be that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.<a name=211:20></a> And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<a name=211:21></a> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of

		Christ is presented to us, to use the language of another part of Scripture, as the last Adam, and eternal life is really in the last Adam, who is the full and perfect revelation and expression of it.<a name=213:5></a> Therefore we get in this chapter the advance on chapter 1: "He is the true God and eternal life", because in Christ both are fully revealed.<a name=213:6></a>

		And now I desire to refer especially to the passage, "There are three that bear witness .<a name=213:7></a>.<a name=213:8></a>.<a name=213:9></a> the spirit, and the water, and the blood".<a name=213:10></a> It had been said previously this is the One that came by water and blood, for in order to bring in blessing Christ has come by cleansing and expiation, by water and blood; that is the order of things in His coming.<a name=213:11></a> Then the Spirit follows as the witness of what is accomplished, and that Man is in glory.<a name=213:12></a> When, however, we come to the order in the believer, the Spirit is put first, "the Spirit, and the water, and the blood".<a name=213:13></a> For it is not here a question of application, but of the apprehension of the value of the witnesses, and therefore the Spirit stands at the head; for the witness is "that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son".<a name=213:14></a> How is this verified?<a name=213:15></a> The Spirit is in the believer, and the Spirit is the truth, and what the Spirit witnesses is that the believer answers before God to Christ in glory.<a name=213:16></a> I am

		according to Christ, because the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ; and if the Spirit of Christ is in me it is proof that before God I correspond to Christ, I am constituted according to Christ in glory; to put it in the language of the apostle Paul, "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<a name=214:1></a> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly"; or, to quote another expression, "He that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing" -- (to be clothed in a glorified body) -- "is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit".<a name=214:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have the other witnesses.<a name=214:3></a> Having the Spirit, we can appreciate the value of the water and the blood -- and this raises the question, How came the water and the blood from Christ?<a name=214:4></a> Only through death.<a name=214:5></a> We all know that Christ was here after the flesh, and in that way having part in human life down here; yet morally apart from all here, "that holy thing" from the womb even as "made of a woman, made under the law".<a name=214:6></a> But the water and the blood witness to me, that in order to provide cleansing and expiation for us, Christ has died to the whole course of things down here.<a name=214:7></a> And hence I apprehend that if on the one hand, I am placed by the Spirit in correspondence with Christ in glory, on the other hand, I accept the place of death to the world here.<a name=214:8></a> And this is really what the water signifies.<a name=214:9></a> I have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, and in that sense am cleansed from the world.<a name=214:10></a> Christ has died to it all.<a name=214:11></a> Do you suppose Christ would have died to it all had there been any good in it for God?<a name=214:12></a> I have no doubt that it was needful for the glory of God that He should die; but it was the witness that there was nothing in man which was suitable to God.<a name=214:13></a> And we as Christians, having the Holy Spirit, as witness of Christ in glory, have also the witness of the water and blood testifying that we are cleansed by Christ's death from all contrary here to God, and are free from imputation of sin.<a name=214:14></a>

		We have to accept all three witnesses.<a name=215:1></a> And to what does their testimony converge?<a name=215:2></a> Why that "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son".<a name=215:3></a> I have that link now, "He that hath the Son hath life".<a name=215:4></a> Eternal life is in the Son; and I have the Son, and having the Son I have what is in the Son, I have the eternal life in Him.<a name=215:5></a> The connection is now seen.<a name=215:6></a> But then on the other hand I have His place of death to the scene and course of things here.<a name=215:7></a> If you were to ask me why I do not take part in the interests and politics of the world, I reply, I have morally no life for the world.<a name=215:8></a> The reason why, in Colossians, we are said to be dead to the world is because we have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.<a name=215:9></a> Christ was actually cut off in the cross; this was circumcision in His case; and we have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, "buried with him in baptism".<a name=215:10></a> Complete in Christ, and circumcised in Him, are bound to go together.<a name=215:11></a> If Christ had not died to the world I never could have been free from it while here; the link could not have been broken.<a name=215:12></a> It might be broken by my own death, but then judgment would be before me; but being broken by the death of Christ there is no judgment before me, for His death has provided expiation; there is no imputation to the believer, the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses from every sin.<a name=215:13></a>

		Now I pass on to a further word.<a name=215:14></a> "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.<a name=215:15></a> If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.<a name=215:16></a> There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.<a name=215:17></a> All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death".<a name=215:18></a> There are only two points in connection with this passage which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=216>[Page 216]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will refer to; one is confidence with God, and the other is discernment.<a name=216:1></a> Those are two things which accompany the blessing and position into which we are brought with God: confidence with God and discernment; for it says, "This is the confidence that we have in him", that is one thing; and then "there is a sin unto death: I do not say he shall pray for it".<a name=216:2></a> If we really were, by the power of the Holy Spirit, in the consciousness of what we are with the Father in the Son, I do not doubt those things would mark us.<a name=216:3></a> We should know when not to ask; "I do not say that he shall pray for it".<a name=216:4></a> But I dare not say very much about the passage, because I know so little about it experimentally.<a name=216:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the closing verses.<a name=216:6></a> "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=216:7></a> And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.<a name=216:8></a> And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=216:9></a> This is the true God and eternal life".<a name=216:10></a> Now I believe we have the climax, in the apprehension of the soul, of the truth unfolded: "We know" is three times repeated.<a name=216:11></a> It is an expression which indicates Christian knowledge, the knowledge which is proper to Christians.<a name=216:12></a> There is a sort of progress in the three verses.<a name=216:13></a> The first is what I may call abstract; it is not definitely applied, but is a sort of general principle, "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not" -- that is what marks a person who owes his beginning morally to God -- "but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not", thus far, in regard of sin.<a name=216:14></a> The one begotten of God does not sin, because his moral being is derived from God; and what is of God, as born of God, is looked at in itself abstractedly.<a name=216:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He does not sin, and the wicked one toucheth him not.<a name=217:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next expression is no longer abstract, for the apostle says: "We know that we are of God", that is, we Christians.<a name=217:2></a> It is not here what marks a person who is born of God spoken of as a principle, but the expression is more definite: "We are of God"; and everything is resolved to us now, "and the whole world lieth in wickedness", that is the effect in the soul of the teaching of the apostle.<a name=217:3></a> It is the result of what comes out in chapter 3.<a name=217:4></a> On the one hand, "He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous", on the other, in the world is lawlessness and hatred.<a name=217:5></a> "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren".<a name=217:6></a> Now the soul has come to a conclusion.<a name=217:7></a> We are of God because righteousness is of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one; that is where the world is morally.<a name=217:8></a> Thus you see what the teaching of the epistle has brought us to, and it is what was true in Christ when He was here upon earth; He was of God, and the whole world was in the wicked one then.<a name=217:9></a> The Lord says to the Jews, "Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world".<a name=217:10></a> He might have said, "and the whole world lies in the wicked one", only it was not then demonstrated so clearly as it is now, and the Christian has now to come to this conclusion, he is "of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one".<a name=217:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when we come to the next verse we get the statement of our portion and blessing.<a name=217:12></a> So far we have had sin, and the wicked one, and the world, and wickedness.<a name=217:13></a> In the closing verse we find, "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=217:14></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=217:15></a> The position of the Christian is more distinctly marked here than anywhere else, as far as I know, in the epistle, and we get
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the positive statement here, not simply that we abide in Him and He in us, but we are "in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ" -- in Christ in glory; that is the proper recognised position of the Christian before God.<a name=218:1></a> But I want to dwell a little upon the first part of it, "We know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true".<a name=218:2></a> Suppose a totally unlettered man to be placed in the midst of a scientific and cultivated company, what that man would need in order to be at home in the midst of such a company would be an understanding, otherwise he could not understand or apprehend anything that passed; he would want kindred understanding.<a name=218:3></a> Now that is what Christ has given to us; without it, if we were put into divine associations, we could not understand one single thing.<a name=218:4></a> Suppose you were to put an unconverted man in heaven, he would understand nothing of the thoughts or language of heaven; but I do not think that will be the case with us when we get to heaven; I do not believe it was the case with Paul when he was caught up to the third heaven; he heard unspeakable words, but it does not say he did not enjoy the things he heard; he heard things he could not utter in this scene of sinful existence, but it does not tell us he did not understand them.<a name=218:5></a> But what I get here is this: I am in wonderful company; not in the company of the scientific or the cultivated of this world, but in divine associations; and the Son of God has given to us an understanding that we may know Him that is true.<a name=218:6></a> He has given us the capability, the understanding, by which we can be at home in the company and fellowship in which He has placed us, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>: "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".<a name=218:7></a> Eternal life is there looked at objectively; here it is more the understanding which enables us to be at home, and in enjoyment, in such blessed company;

		He has "given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true".<a name=219:1></a> Him that is true is, in my judgment, Him that is revealed, and I think that is the idea in the word 'true' all through the verse.<a name=219:2></a> God is proved to be true, in that He has revealed Himself.<a name=219:3></a> If a devil were revealed he would be seen to be a devil, below natural conscience.<a name=219:4></a> God reveals Himself, and thereby proves Himself to be the true and blessed God.<a name=219:5></a> That is what I understand by the word 'true', "that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true", that is the One that has revealed Himself; "in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=219:6></a> He is the true God" -- that is, God revealed -- "and eternal life", as the full revelation and expression of it.<a name=219:7></a> That is what Christ is in glory, and we are in Him.<a name=219:8></a> This is what the verse brings us to.<a name=219:9></a> There must be the two sides, revelation and understanding: without the revelation of God we never could have enjoyed God; but the Son has revealed the Father perfectly and manifested the Father's name, and now He has "given to us an understanding that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=219:10></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=219:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is on the same platform as the rest of the chapter.<a name=219:12></a> This chapter brings before us Christ, who came through water and blood; and the Spirit, that blessed witness sent down from glory to testify to us that Christ is in the Father's presence as Man.<a name=219:13></a> I can understand a person saying, Was not He always in the Father's presence?<a name=219:14></a> Yes, He was.<a name=219:15></a> Faith was perfect when Christ was down here, and thus He was ever in spirit with the Father.<a name=219:16></a> But as Man He talks about going to the Father: He says, "I leave the world, and go to the Father".<a name=219:17></a> In this last chapter He is with the Father.<a name=219:18></a> Other parts of the epistle recognise the same thing, such as "We have an advocate with the Father".<a name=219:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The burden of all the first part of the epistle is the calling to mind by the apostle of what had been

		Now, beloved friends, may God help us in His great grace to get a right idea of the word, and to know how to handle it rightly.<a name=220:6></a> If anything has come home to me of late it is this -- the great importance of taking up things as they are set in Scripture, not being content merely with generalities, or with what is conventional amongst us; but getting hold of things in their Scripture connection.<a name=220:7></a> It may need a great deal of patience and attention to the word, but the patience and attention will be amply rewarded, and I believe this to be the great lesson that God has been bringing home to us of late.<a name=220:8></a>

		It is on my mind to take up the challenge sometimes thrown out to write a page of note-paper on the subject of the church.<a name=232:1></a> What I have to say is little in amount and simple in character, as the scriptures I have read will show you.<a name=232:2></a> The first epistle to the Corinthians does not profess to go beyond what is fundamental.<a name=232:3></a> "As a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation", chapter 3: 10.<a name=232:4></a> The apostle says in chapter 2, "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect", etc.<a name=232:5></a>; but in this epistle we get the church, not in the full light of the thought and counsel of God as in Ephesians, but in a very elementary way, though very important to us here.<a name=232:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is just that which I wanted to touch upon this evening.<a name=232:7></a> The position of saints as gathered to the Lord's name; and then the privileges that are proper to them; and how we may recognise where the truth of the church is -- a very important point in this day.<a name=232:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The essence of what I have to say is this: there are two results of the Spirit's presence here, as I understand it, whether looked at in the individual or in the assembly: He excludes and He introduces.<a name=232:9></a> The Spirit in the individual is exclusive of the flesh, and on the other hand He introduces Christ.<a name=232:10></a> I think the same thing is true in the assembly.<a name=232:11></a> The Spirit is here on the one hand to exclude man as to his mind, and on the other hand to bring in Christ; and in this light both chapters 3 and 12 are very interesting.<a name=232:12></a> In chapter 12 we have the anointed One, "So also is the Christ".<a name=232:13></a> The church, as anointed of the Spirit, is the body of Christ, and thus the vessel for the display and exercise here of all that is of God.<a name=232:14></a>

		I just say a word in taking up this subject as to the ground of gathering.<a name=233:1></a> Collectively, as I understand it, saints are gathered to a name, and to all the import of that name.<a name=233:2></a> Sometimes we talk of being gathered on the ground of the one body.<a name=233:3></a> I know what it signifies -- unsectarian ground -- all right as far as it goes, but it does not mean anything very distinctive in the present day.<a name=233:4></a> The fact that you are gathered <i>to a name</i> is important.<a name=233:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That leads me to a remark in connection with the gospel of Matthew.<a name=233:6></a> As has been often noticed, it alone brings in the truth of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=233:7></a> Luke gives us the truth of the kingdom of God.<a name=233:8></a> I think you will find that the truth of the kingdom of heaven centres round the Person of the exalted Christ, who has been rejected here; the truth of the kingdom of God in its present aspect centres round the Spirit given.<a name=233:9></a> If you bear that in mind it will help you to the force of the expression, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit".<a name=233:10></a> The kingdom of heaven centres, as I said, round the great fact of the exalted Man.<a name=233:11></a> The One who is in heaven is exalted to bear sway over the earth.<a name=233:12></a> If you study Matthew attentively, you will find all the first part of the gospel goes on the ground of the presentation of Christ after the flesh to His people here; from chapter 16 and onwards all goes on the ground of His exaltation.<a name=233:13></a> I do not think you will understand any of the similitudes of the kingdom in the latter part of the gospel if you do not bear that in mind.<a name=233:14></a> The marriage supper (chapter 22) is on the ground of the exalted Man.<a name=233:15></a> The ten virgins who go forth to meet the bridegroom (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>) also.<a name=233:16></a> The Bridegroom is the One who has rights in relation to the earth according to God, rejected here but glorified above, and He it is who is to bear sway in the kingdom -- and the virgins go forth to meet Him.<a name=233:17></a> The economy of the kingdom of heaven is to be found in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=233:18></a>

		People have made a mistake in going to that chapter for instruction as to the church.<a name=234:1></a> I quite admit it is introduced there, and also the point of gathering, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name".<a name=234:2></a> It is the One who, rejected on earth, is glorified in heaven.<a name=234:3></a> It is to His name that saints are gathered.<a name=234:4></a> If you examine Christendom, as to all that is under that name there, it will not help you a bit.<a name=234:5></a> Though they use the words of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, I do not think it enters into their mind that they are gathered to the name of the One who is rejected on earth and glorified in heaven.<a name=234:6></a> But it is the very name to which saints are properly gathered, and to which every saint ought to be true.<a name=234:7></a>

		In going forth to meet the bridegroom the virgins left everything here -- the religious associations in which men were found on earth.<a name=234:8></a> The awakening cry is, "Behold, the bridegroom!<a name=234:9></a>" A great thought is connected with it -- not only that Man is exalted above, but that He is coming again in glory -- the saints go forth to meet Him.<a name=234:10></a> In the meantime they are gathered to His name here.<a name=234:11></a>

		I pass on now to 1 Corinthians.<a name=234:12></a> I want to show you the privileges that belong to those who are gathered to the name of the Lord.<a name=234:13></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a> we find: "Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called .<a name=234:14></a>.<a name=234:15></a>.<a name=234:16></a> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=234:17></a> That is the ground on which the apostle saluted them, and the privileges that belonged to such were -- what I want to dwell upon tonight -- that they were the temple of God, and the body of Christ; chapters 3 and 12.<a name=234:18></a> They are very important subjects, and though elementary very interesting in regard to the true place of the church here.<a name=234:19></a> The saints who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus are properly the temple of God -- the Spirit of God dwells in them, and they are all baptised by one Spirit into one body, and have been all

		made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=235:1></a> They are Christ's body.<a name=235:2></a> I will, if the Lord enable me, bring before you in a few words the import of both these expressions, and just add a word as to the vessel of the Spirit.<a name=235:3></a> I believe, as I said before, that the object and purpose of the Spirit down here is practically to exclude what God has judged, and to introduce what God has glorified.<a name=235:4></a> I think everyone would bow to that, and it is seen in a distinct way in the church.<a name=235:5></a> Let me ask you, If man's state has been judged of God do you think that man's mind is competent to judge of the things of God?<a name=235:6></a> Hence the apostle says, "I determined to know nothing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=235:7></a> The presence of the Spirit is essentially exclusive, and exclusive of man.<a name=235:8></a> In the temple is God's glory, the mind of God is there; His oracles are there -- but the mind of man is excluded by the presence of the Spirit.<a name=235:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I go further; I say that the intrusion of what is of man in the temple of God defiles it.<a name=235:10></a> The holiness of God's temple is inconceivable to the mind of man; it cannot take in the idea.<a name=235:11></a> But that is the very point of the temple, "The temple of God is holy", and by the very holiness of it the mind of man in divine things is excluded.<a name=235:12></a> You bring an unconverted man there, he has no conception of the holiness which is of the Spirit of God.<a name=235:13></a> "The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are".<a name=235:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go to the other side, to what the Spirit of God brings in -- that leads to the thought of the body in chapter 12.<a name=235:15></a> As I have pointed out, the contrast between the two chapters is, that chapter 3 shows the holiness of God's temple and what that holiness excludes; chapter 12 shows what the Spirit of God brings in.<a name=235:16></a> The chapter introduces the thought of the Christ, and by that I understand "the anointed".<a name=235:17></a> When we speak about Christ it has come to be too much a mere name; we want the moral idea connected with it -- the Anointed.<a name=235:18></a>

		THE POWER OF AFFECTION

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to add a word on what I deem to be an important point in connection with what we have heard, that is, as to the place which affection has in leading us into the realisation of that sphere of life in which, in the grace of God, we are privileged to be with Christ.<a name=243:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just read a verse in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>"In that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God".<a name=243:2></a> I think that we should all agree with the remark which was made a few moments since, that the gospel presents to us a Person.<a name=243:3></a> He is presented to us in the value of the work which He has accomplished, but it could not be questioned that the gospel presents to us a Person; and it is with a Person that the thought of affection connects itself.<a name=243:4></a> When you come to affection it must be so.<a name=243:5></a> I can understand anyone having the love of all that is good, but for the true thought of affection with us you must introduce an object; and as we have often been told, a worthy object.<a name=243:6></a> And this is where I see the importance of the truth of the gospel centring in a Person.<a name=243:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire to say a word about is the way the Spirit works in the believer through affection.<a name=244:3></a> I think that is the manner of the Spirit's work.<a name=244:4></a> Evidently our being made acquainted with the love of God must produce a most extraordinary moral change in us.<a name=244:5></a> It is impossible for anyone to love God until he knows that God loves him.<a name=244:6></a> Scripture is clear on that: "We love him, because he first loved us".<a name=244:7></a> When the love of God is brought home to a man's heart it must produce a mighty effect in him.<a name=244:8></a> Then he loves God; and a great deal more hangs upon this.<a name=244:9></a> "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him".<a name=244:10></a> They are made known to the one who loves God.<a name=244:11></a> If we answer to God's love to us, it is His pleasure to make known to us those things which He has prepared for them that love Him.<a name=244:12></a> But the real spring is His love.<a name=244:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My point is that we are led by affection into that sphere of life which is true in Christ; as to the realisation of it, I mean.<a name=244:14></a> No one disputes the title to it.<a name=244:15></a> The title is entirely in the purpose of God: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should .<a name=244:16></a>.<a name=244:17></a>.<a name=244:18></a> have everlasting life".<a name=244:19></a> The title lies in the purpose of God, which is the fruit of His love.<a name=244:20></a> The purpose cannot be gain-said; but the purpose, and the realisation of it in the soul of the believer, are two different things, and the realisation is the important point to us down here, and is wrought by the Spirit through the affections.<a name=244:21></a> I begin by reminding you that all blessing comes to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=244:22></a> The administration of divine grace is committed into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=244:23></a> He has ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men.<a name=244:24></a> The ground of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another truth is developed in the latter part of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, which connects itself with the thought of the Person -- namely, that not only does Christ administer all, but that by His own personal perfectness He has secured everything He administers.<a name=245:5></a> It is His 'one obedience' and 'one righteousness', on which it all rests, and by virtue of which He has secured everything.<a name=245:6></a> I believe it to be the opening up of an immense field to us.<a name=245:7></a> As we trace sin and death to one man, to one act of disobedience, one man's offence, so we trace everything connected with grace up to one Man, as its first cause, to one righteousness, one obedience, the perfectness of one Man.<a name=245:8></a> All this culminates in the cross of Christ, where for us all blessing begins.<a name=245:9></a> Our blessings are very great.<a name=245:10></a> By Him we have peace with God.<a name=245:11></a> By Him we have access into divine favour; rejoicing in hope of the glory of God, the Holy Spirit given to us, the love of God shed abroad in the heart, reconciliation received; we know the terms on which we are with God.<a name=245:12></a> Now the Spirit of God begins to teach me that I have to trace everything up to the perfectness and obedience of one Man who has secured these things, that He might administer all on the part of God.<a name=245:13></a> I believe that is where the Spirit of God begins to form the first link of affection between the heart of the believer and Christ.<a name=245:14></a> As we see these things we begin to appreciate His own personal excellency.<a name=245:15></a> And now we derive from Him; you cannot deny your descent from Adam or what you get from Adam and the fall.<a name=245:16></a> It is equally true that you cannot deny that what you have from

		Now I will tell you what the Spirit of God will do.<a name=246:13></a> He will work in us by the power of affection to draw us to Christ in that place.<a name=246:14></a> It is not here so much a question of faith as of affection, which leads us to the One who has secured everything to us on the part of God, in the place in which He now is.<a name=246:15></a> We are drawn to Him where He is now to know His company there.<a name=246:16></a> The believer is set upon being in His company.<a name=246:17></a> "He liveth unto God".<a name=246:18></a> We want to be with Him, and to be with Him we must be outside of all that is here.<a name=246:19></a> It is a question not exactly of faith but of affection, you will not reach Him there but by affection.<a name=246:20></a> The Spirit of God draws me to Him by affection, and to be with

		We were speaking this afternoon of the purpose of the gospel.<a name=249:6></a> I do not think that anyone would be disposed to question the statement that the purpose of God in the gospel is that He might be made known, according to what He is in His nature, in the heart of man.<a name=249:7></a> What man is to be brought into is another point; but the first thing is that God might be known in the heart of man as He has been pleased to reveal Himself.<a name=249:8></a> "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil".<a name=249:9></a> The great work of the devil was to produce in the heart of man distrust of God and rebellion.<a name=249:10></a> There is a rivalry existing there.<a name=249:11></a> Then it is that God in due time comes in in His Son to make known what He is, so that the heart of man might be encouraged to trust God.<a name=249:12></a> God's love enters so that we may have confidence in Him.<a name=249:13></a> It is made effective by the Spirit in the believer's heart.<a name=249:14></a> It is impossible to trust anyone that you do not know, nor will anyone trust God till he knows Him.<a name=249:15></a> When God is known as He has been pleased to reveal Himself, then all is changed for us.<a name=249:16></a> Here we get the true expression of the love of God.<a name=249:17></a> "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=249:18></a> It goes further than expression, for the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is

		given to us.<a name=250:1></a> It is not only that God has in the most inconceivable way proved His love, but the love of God is realised in the believer by divine power.<a name=250:2></a> A man may get an apprehension of the grace of God, but I am confident that it is impossible to know God according to what He is in His nature until the Holy Spirit is received; then it is that "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts".<a name=250:3></a> And that is the force of the passage, "Hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us".<a name=250:4></a> Why "not ashamed"?<a name=250:5></a> Because the heart is able to confide in God.<a name=250:6></a> There is confidence in God as to all the changes and trials and exercises of the wilderness.<a name=250:7></a> Tribulation works patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope is assured by the love of God.<a name=250:8></a> That is the first scripture I turn to, the very beginning.<a name=250:9></a> I trust everyone will go with the thought that the purpose of God in the gospel is to make known to man the heart of God.<a name=250:10></a> Light is the revelation of God in love.<a name=250:11></a> I have often spoken of the intimate connection between light and love.<a name=250:12></a> Light exposes, but if even I am exposed by the knowledge of God it is the light of His love, the more light I have the more I am acquainted with His blessed Being; so that the more I am acquainted with the light the more I know the love.<a name=250:13></a> One word describes His nature, and that is -- <i>love</i>.<a name=250:14></a>

		Now I want to come to the next step.<a name=250:15></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>is the scripture I turn to (verses 9-11 and 15, 16).<a name=250:16></a> I believe that here you get something presented which is intended to attract the heart.<a name=250:17></a> It supposes the love of God is known, for the proper answer to the love of God on our part is that we love God.<a name=250:18></a> No man ever loves God until he knows that God loves him.<a name=250:19></a> Love on our part is the response of the heart by the Spirit to what God has made known of Himself.<a name=250:20></a> "Every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God".<a name=250:21></a> We could not love God if He were not made known.<a name=250:22></a>

		But now that God is known the heart is attracted by the thought put forward.<a name=251:2></a> "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him".<a name=251:3></a> It does not say here for those whom He loves; but our love toward God is the answer of our hearts to His love.<a name=251:4></a> I am attracted in this way.<a name=251:5></a> Of course loving God ought to be the mark of every Christian, for every Christian ought to love God, and every Christian does love God.<a name=251:6></a> His love may be deep down and overlaid, but the love is there.<a name=251:7></a> Now, loving God, something is presented to our affection, the thought of the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.<a name=251:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are wonderful things to be made known to us, which eye hath not seen (the Corinthians did not know them), which have never entered into the heart of man to conceive.<a name=251:9></a> Many would say that God has prepared these things for the Christian, and that they belong to the future.<a name=251:10></a> Yes; but the present knowledge of these things belongs to those who love God.<a name=251:11></a> Every Christian will enter into them eventually, I quite admit, but the present enjoyment is to those who love God.<a name=251:12></a> If our hearts are entering into that love, He will lead us into the enjoyment of these things, and that is present.<a name=251:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>I think you will come to what I may call the third step (verses 28-30 and 35-39).<a name=252:3></a> Here we get what I should call the complete answer in the heart of the saint to the work of the devil.<a name=252:4></a> His work was to create in the heart of man distrust of God; here I get full confidence in the love of God.<a name=252:5></a> It begins in this way in verse 28: "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God".<a name=252:6></a> Not only have we been attracted by the thought that God can make known to us what eye hath not seen nor ear heard, all those things that He hath prepared for them that love Him; but we know that nothing can go wrong, because we are conscious that all things work together for good to them that love God.<a name=252:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the remainder of the passage we have the complete and blessed response on our side to that which is found in chapter 5.<a name=252:8></a> Chapter 5 makes known to us the attitude in which God is towards us now, and whenever a soul has entered into the truth of God's purpose, it is persuaded that nothing can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=252:9></a> You may not have, as yet, a full entrance into the effect of the love of God, but you have a full persuasion about that love, and that nothing can separate you from that love.<a name=252:10></a> "I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=252:11></a> The most mighty power in the universe is the love of God!<a name=252:12></a> It is transcendent and of God.<a name=252:13></a> There is full persuasion in the saint that nothing can separate us from that love.<a name=252:14></a>

		Him what He has prepared for them, but it is greater to be persuaded that nothing can separate you from the love of God, and that all things work together for good to them that love God.<a name=253:1></a> Every created thing, all that is great and mighty in this world, or outside of it, is put in contrast to the love of God, and the love of God is greater than all.<a name=253:2></a> In Christ Jesus our Lord we are in the blessed circle of the love of God.<a name=253:3></a> It is the portion of the saint as belonging to that circle, not as being in the wilderness here; in the realisation of God's purpose he is in spirit outside of it.<a name=253:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last passage I turn to is in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:4">Ephesians  2:4</a>-7.<a name=253:5></a> Here we have the full display of love in the way in which it comes out towards us.<a name=253:6></a> There are three qualities of God seen in the passage: (1) God is "rich in mercy"; (2) "His great love wherewith he loved us"; (3) "That .<a name=253:7></a>.<a name=253:8></a>.<a name=253:9></a> he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus".<a name=253:10></a> But the point I am dwelling on is the love that originated all.<a name=253:11></a> God has made known to us here the things that He has prepared for them that love Him.<a name=253:12></a> It is not simply bringing us through redemption into the wilderness and giving us His Spirit; that did not content the heart of God.<a name=253:13></a> It is not even blessing us with manifold blessings -- that will not satisfy His heart.<a name=253:14></a> What suits His heart is to have us with Him where Christ is, in His own dwelling-place, His own habitation, in the full enjoyment of His love -- that we should be with Him there in the exaltation of Christ as Man.<a name=253:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point in all this is not what you want, or what I want, but what God wants.<a name=253:16></a> God works to satisfy His love.<a name=253:17></a> Nothing makes so great a demand on God as His love.<a name=253:18></a> To satisfy His love He will have the subjects of His love in His own habitation.<a name=253:19></a> It was a great thing for Israel when they were brought into the wilderness, and God had set up His dwelling-place among them; I admit they were brought to God, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 7 refers, I judge, to the public display: "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus".<a name=254:6></a> In the church will be the display of the exceeding riches of His grace.<a name=254:7></a> That is future, when He will show to the whole universe His grace.<a name=254:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are led on thus in the knowledge of His love; and it is a great thing to love God, and to know His love.<a name=254:9></a> If you love God, He will make known to you the things He has prepared for them that love Him.<a name=254:10></a> I believe that God delights in an attentive ear.<a name=254:11></a> If He brings a saint into a condition in which he can appreciate these things, then it is His delight to make them known to him.<a name=254:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I only just desired to point out these steps by which we are led on into the great reality of the love of God.<a name=254:13></a> First, we are attracted by it; then we are persuaded of it; and then the soul enters into the things which God has prepared for them that love Him.<a name=254:14></a>

		If you have studied the epistle to the Hebrews at all attentively, you will remember that previous to this chapter we get a great deal about the High Priest.<a name=273:1></a> In chapter 2 we read that "it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest".<a name=273:2></a> In chapter 4 it says, "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities", which is as much as to say, We have an High Priest who can sympathise.<a name=273:3></a> Chapters 5 and 6 also speak of the Priest; and in chapter 7 we are told that "he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them".<a name=273:4></a> All these passages refer to the Priest acting, as one might say, on the side of our need.<a name=273:5></a> He concerns Himself with regard to us on our side, and by the help which He accords to us down here He makes known to us His care for us in our weakness.<a name=273:6></a> That is what the High Priest does for us as we are going through the wilderness.<a name=273:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great point for every one of us to apprehend the interest and care which the Lord has for us individually in this way.<a name=273:8></a> You get an illustration of it in the Lord's prayer for Peter.<a name=273:9></a> Peter did not shine much; he was self-confident on the eve of denying the Lord, yet the Lord says, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not".<a name=273:10></a> He concerns Himself about Peter, and the point in the Lord's mind was that Peter's faith should not fail.<a name=273:11></a> That great breakdown in conduct was of less moment in the eyes of the Lord than that his faith should fail.<a name=273:12></a> Anyone of us might have a breakdown in conduct, the great thing is that our faith should not fail.<a name=273:13></a> "He is able also to save

		them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them".<a name=274:1></a> I think you will admit this, that when Peter came to recall all that the Lord had said, and how He had interceded for him, it must have left a lifelong mark on him.<a name=274:2></a> He might forget many things, but he never forgot that, and he carried out the Lord's admonition to him: "When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren".<a name=274:3></a> Satan had desired to have all of the disciples to sift them as wheat, but the Lord had prayed for Peter, and the proof of his being turned round was that he would strengthen his brethren.<a name=274:4></a>

		The Lord makes known to us thus His concern and care for us on our side; but in order to fulfil the proper function of the Priest He must lead us to God's side.<a name=274:5></a> He acts in both ways.<a name=274:6></a> He comes out to us in succour and sympathy, regarding us where we are, but He is a great Priest over God's house to conduct us in our consciousness into the Holiest.<a name=274:7></a> That is the wonderful thing!<a name=274:8></a> and it is the point in chapter 7: 26-28: "Such an high priest <i>became us</i>, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens"; and it is after all the offering work has been done; and the oath makes <i>the Son</i> Priest.<a name=274:9></a> The law made men high priests who had infirmity, "but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore".<a name=274:10></a>

		In chapter 1 you will have noticed that God has spoken in the Son: the Son is there seen on <i>His</i> side as apostle; here it is the Son, as on <i>our</i> side, a High Priest becoming us.<a name=274:11></a> It is on account of the greatness of our calling that such a High Priest becomes us, and the calling is apprehended in the Priest.<a name=274:12></a> God is bringing many sons to glory.<a name=274:13></a> Christ is going to conduct you into the Holiest, not exactly to glory, but to God.<a name=274:14></a> He is going to conduct you into the realisation of heavenly privilege.<a name=274:15></a> That is the true thought of the Priest.<a name=274:16></a>

		He was the figure of the church in that sense, and Jesus says, "Upon this rock I will build my church".<a name=276:1></a> The Father gave him to the Lord in making known to him the truth of His Person, and Peter came to Jesus as the living Stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, precious.<a name=276:2></a> You are given to the Lord, and are of value to Christ, because you are given to Him by the Father.<a name=276:3></a> The Lord prays thus for the disciples in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and they were of the deepest interest in His eyes.<a name=276:4></a>

		I have been so far simply trying to explain the reason of Christ's love to the saints.<a name=276:5></a> It pleased God to set His love upon us in the sovereignty of His purpose; you cannot explain or understand why, but you must believe it.<a name=276:6></a> That is not exactly the case as to the love of Christ.<a name=276:7></a> This refers to those given to Him during the time of His rejection; and the reason they were given to Him was that He might conduct them to the Father.<a name=276:8></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>He confides them to the Father during His absence.<a name=276:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that the truth in the scriptures to which I have turned links itself very closely with what has been before us, and my thought is to pursue the subject a little.<a name=281:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What we have at the outset in the verses in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>is first acquaintance with the Lord; that is, we have been brought to taste that He is gracious; that is where everyone begins in personal acquaintance with Him.<a name=281:2></a> And let me say here that what we are divinely taught is often very different from what we think we are taught.<a name=281:3></a> I do not know anything more valuable than to apprehend what is the line of the Spirit's teaching.<a name=281:4></a> The first thing then that we taste is that the Lord is gracious.<a name=281:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three points I would notice to which Peter had previously referred, as applicable to those to whom he writes.<a name=281:6></a> (1) They were called; (2) they were redeemed; and (3) they were born again.<a name=281:7></a> Not that these things had come in that order, but they are recognised as true of those to whom the apostle wrote.<a name=281:8></a> It is the groundwork.<a name=281:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by having tasted that the Lord is gracious is the sense in the soul that He is accessible, I can come to Him; and what I judge to be the meaning of the term 'the Lord', is the position which Christ fills as Man according to the counsels of God.<a name=281:10></a> He is the One in whom God has set forth the full expression of His pleasure in Man; and He is vested with full authority as Man to effectuate the will of God.<a name=281:11></a> You can only learn God's thoughts as to man through Him.<a name=281:12></a> So "we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time has not yet arrived for us to see all things put under Him, but we have now the whole will of God set forth in Him.<a name=282:4></a> It was the Lord who first gave light to our souls, and the object was that we might come to Him to taste that He is gracious, and from Him to learn God's will.<a name=282:5></a> If people are carried about by what men say, it is a proof that they have never got to the Lord.<a name=282:6></a> If you look at the religious systems around, and especially missionary effort, you find that many men, in themselves devoted, turn to men for instruction and direction as to their path of service; but no one save the Lord can give you to understand what the will of God is, you must go to the Lord, and He is gracious.<a name=282:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In having to do with Christ as Lord, you apprehend Him in relation to your responsibility.<a name=282:8></a> The apostle, at the close of his career, says, "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me", etc.<a name=282:9></a> That plainly indicates that the title of Lord connects itself with the responsible life and service of the Christian.<a name=282:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish that every one of our hearts were more impressed with the truth that the Lord is gracious, and has pleasure in leading us into understanding in all things.<a name=282:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have, "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".<a name=282:12></a> Now I think that coming to the Lord as a living Stone has a different character or idea from tasting that the Lord is gracious.<a name=282:13></a> As "a living stone" He does not stand in relation to our responsibility, but is the foundation

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John in his epistle classes Christians in different grades, according to their spiritual apprehension; that is, babes, young men and fathers; and even the babes are spoken of as knowing the Father.<a name=283:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should like, if possible, to give you a clear idea of what is meant by the "living stone".<a name=283:4></a> As I understand it, it is the Person of the Son seen in complete identification with manhood, so that He might take the place of Firstborn among many brethren, might build His assembly.<a name=283:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was brought to light in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>could not really be made good until redemption had been accomplished; still the truth came out as to the Son of the living God, and the structure to be built on that foundation.<a name=283:6></a> The Lord is revealed in a character totally new -- as outside of all here -- but in which He could be known by and associated with men, and in that character Peter could never have known Him but for the revelation of the Father.<a name=283:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we apprehend the Father, then it is that we come to Christ as the "living stone", and I do not think that you have much entrance into divine things until you have come to the living Stone; then you are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood.<a name=283:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the law the priest had not only access to holy things, but he had also discernment.<a name=283:9></a> Until you know what it is to approach the Father in liberty, and have discernment to distinguish between clean and unclean, I do not think you are in the reality of being built up a holy priesthood.<a name=283:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is then that divine affections are in exercise in the believer according to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>, and it is

		thus that the prayer in the last verse of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>is realised, "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<a name=284:1></a> You come now in your soul to the ground of God's purpose in Christ.<a name=284:2></a> He is the living Stone, in order that according to the counsels of God we may be identified with Him as His assembly.<a name=284:3></a> It is noticeable in the synoptic gospels how little comes out as to the truth of the Father and the Son.<a name=284:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a> we have the solitary instance in that gospel in which the Father and the Son connectedly are definitely spoken of.<a name=284:5></a> In the gospel of Matthew Christ is seen as the vessel of promise; in Mark, as the vessel of testimony, the Prophet; and in Luke, as the vessel of grace; while in John we have distinctly and prominently the truth of the Person in His relation to the Father.<a name=284:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we have really come to the "living stone", and know Christ as Son of God, what we learn further is this, that He is in His Person entirely beyond our power to grasp.<a name=284:7></a> It is truly a wonderful thing that He should have taken a place as Firstborn among many brethren: but we have to learn that though become Man, and so known by us, the Son is great enough for the Father.<a name=284:8></a> Hence He says, "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father".<a name=284:9></a> I do not think that in this passage there is direct allusion to incarnation.<a name=284:10></a> He does not say, No one knows "the Christ", but the point is that the Person of the Son, the One who has truly become incarnate that we might be in association with Him, is sufficient for the Father; and as one with the Father, He must be beyond the understanding or comprehension of any creature.<a name=284:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the same thought is really conveyed in the verses that I read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>.<a name=284:12></a> "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth".<a name=284:13></a> These poor men could say by

		John, who was one of them, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=285:1></a> The Word had pleasure in being among them; in His grace He could completely control them and govern their affections, but John has to add that there was that which was beyond them.<a name=285:2></a> "We contemplated his glory".<a name=285:3></a> I conclude by "glory" is meant distinction, and in this sense they contemplated what was entirely beyond human grasp.<a name=285:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, where the saints are no longer viewed as simple fishermen, but as those given to the Son by the Father, the Lord's desire is that they may be with Him where He is, that they may behold His glory.<a name=285:5></a> It is the closing prayer.<a name=285:6></a> Here on earth, in His personal glory, He was entirely beyond His disciples: yet He comes into their company, and dwells in their midst; and they proved His grace.<a name=285:7></a> We are to be with Him and like Him; and when we are there, then it is that that wonderful prayer will be made good, and we shall behold His glory -- His own personal distinction with the Father.<a name=285:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the meantime having come to the "living stone", we are "built up a spiritual house", in association with the true Aaron, the Son of God, in the light of the Father's counsels; and as a holy priesthood we too in a certain sense contemplate the unveiled glory of the Son.<a name=285:9></a>

		It was just this I wanted to touch upon, following on the remarks that fell from our beloved brother.<a name=285:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to say a few words, taking up the thought expressed by our brother who has just spoken, that is, of 'the second blessing'.<a name=286:1></a> He has put it before us in a way with which I fully agree, but I am going to dwell on the term in a somewhat different way.<a name=286:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I fully admit that there is for the Christian the 'second blessing'.<a name=286:3></a> The first blessing I shall refer to is that he believes on the Lord; and the second is that he has reached the Lord.<a name=286:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A mistake that is made by many is in thinking that because they have believed in the Lord, that they have reached the Lord; but it is not so -- the two things are distinct -- I can refer to the subject feelingly, because I know what it is to have gone through this.<a name=286:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I am about to say will connect itself with the second epistle to Timothy; I will give you a sort of arbitrary division of the epistle: that is, in the first two chapters we have the seeking of the Lord -- in the last two we have the Lord found and known.<a name=286:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is good to remember that it is a divine and unchanging principle which was uttered by the Lord, that "He that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened".<a name=286:7></a> That is a sure principle, which, if held to, will never fail you.<a name=286:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may just say that I am not attempting to give you a gospel address, I shall speak entirely to those who have believed on the Lord; and having believed, the great point for the soul is to reach the Lord; and I think if I take up a few passages in the epistle it will make what I mean plain.<a name=286:9></a> It is the soul personally appropriating the Lord.<a name=286:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first passage I turn to is in chapter 1: 8, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=287>[Page 287]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lord".<a name=287:1></a> I think the first thing that you need to bear in mind, in seeking to <i>reach</i> the Lord, is that the testimony of the gospel by which you are saved has come to you distinctly from Him.<a name=287:2></a> When you first believed the testimony, you could have been scarcely conscious that it came to you from the Lord; you would have been more disposed to assume that you had received it from the preacher that you had listened to; but it is a great point to apprehend that the Lord was the One from whom you did receive it.<a name=287:3></a> To establish the truth of this we may refer to chapter 1 of the epistle to the Hebrews; and there it is seen clearly that God is no longer speaking by the prophets, for, as to the prophets, what marked their testimony was that there was no perfection or finality reached, and there was consequently no announcement with them of rest for God.<a name=287:4></a> Now God has spoken in the Son: and who could speak after the Son?<a name=287:5></a> He is speaking in the Son and thus finality is reached in the testimony.<a name=287:6></a> God has reached His own rest in Christ.<a name=287:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at the chapter, what it tells us of is the things in which God can now rest, because everything is secured for His glory in the Son; and the first thing noticed is that He has sat down on high having accomplished the purging of sins; and then His superiority to angels is set forth.<a name=287:8></a> "For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?<a name=287:9></a>" He is the Son of God, and even as Man He is thus an object adequate for God; and anyone must see that it is a wonderful thing for God to have secured an adequate object for His affections and delight in a Man.<a name=287:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing, and that is He has secured an eternal throne, and that based on perfect discrimination between righteousness and iniquity in the One who has loved righteousness and hated iniquity, and is anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows.<a name=287:11></a> And it is the good pleasure of God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to present to us all that has been secured for Himself in that Man who is the suited object of His affections.<a name=288:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is a further point, namely, that in the Son there is no decay, no growing old.<a name=288:2></a> "Thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail".<a name=288:3></a> The quotation in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>is from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>, and is the divine answer to the Lord's words as Man here, "He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days".<a name=288:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point of deep interest and importance is in that He is called to sit at the right hand of God; and let us remember that that place is His, because He has been refused a place here.<a name=288:5></a> It is His place provisionally until His foes are made His footstool.<a name=288:6></a> And hence, if you want to know what the will of God is, or to learn His good pleasure, you must find it in Him who sits at God's right hand; for all is for the moment hid in Him, where He is.<a name=288:7></a> It is sometimes said that such things are too difficult, but is it too hard to seek to reach the things which God has made known in the Son?<a name=288:8></a> All is secured there, but for the moment all is hid in God and can only be known by the Spirit.<a name=288:9></a> Hence every Christian's interest is at the right hand of God, where Christ is in perfect patience.<a name=288:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has often been said in relation to Israel that though they spent forty years in the wilderness, yet the wilderness was no part of God's purpose for them.<a name=288:11></a> As to ourselves we are actually in the wilderness, and so long as God sees well, content to be there; but, thank God, our hearts are bound up in the One who is at His right hand.<a name=288:12></a> It is only a little moment and He, who waits in patience there, will be displayed in glory, and we with Him.<a name=288:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Lord's testimony is presented to us His work, His resurrection, and His glory.<a name=288:14></a> God has made known to us that glory, and how everything has been secured in the Son for Himself, and He would have our hearts to be beholding the glory of the Lord.<a name=288:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony is from the Lord; if you or I present

		<a name=289>[Page 289]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it, the danger is lest we dress it about with much that is of ourselves; but the testimony is nonetheless the Lord's; the Son is the Speaker, and He it is who is both the ark of the covenant, in whom all is secured, and the mercy-seat, the One in whom God's glory rests and in whom He speaks.<a name=289:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In following on to the next point, namely, the seeking of the Lord, I would refer to the fourth and following verses of <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>.<a name=289:2></a> "No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.<a name=289:3></a> And if a man also strive for masteries, yet he is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.<a name=289:4></a> The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.<a name=289:5></a> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things".<a name=289:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to notice that all this was written to a distinguished servant of the Lord, much more so, I need not say, than any one of us; and to such an one the apostle says, "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things".<a name=289:7></a> The servant must hold loosely to things here, strive lawfully, and labour patiently.<a name=289:8></a> These are the conditions for the consideration of the soul, and the Lord will give understanding in all things.<a name=289:9></a> If we are seeking, our desire is to reach the Lord, that from Him we may get understanding, may have His mind; and let me remark that if that was needful for a servant like Timothy in those times, surely it behoves us to seek the Lord that we may get understanding in these last perilous times.<a name=289:10></a> There is no uncertainty as to one thing, namely, that the testimony is that of our Lord; and if it has reached us as from Him, and we seek Him, He will give us understanding.<a name=289:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point I refer to is in verse 19, and there is brought out another principle, that which is the seal of God's firm foundation, namely, that if you name the name of the Lord, you must depart from unrighteousness.<a name=289:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=290>[Page 290]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is imperative.<a name=290:1></a> What we see all around us in Christendom is that a position is claimed on the earth, just as though Christ were accepted here; that is what I am sure may be rightly called unrighteousness, because the Lord alone is the true standard of righteousness.<a name=290:2></a> How can a Christian rightly claim a status in a world where Christ has been cast out, and to which He has not yet returned?<a name=290:3></a> It cannot be gainsaid that all the religious systems around us are acting as though they were in a scene where Christ and His rights were accepted and maintained.<a name=290:4></a> But it is plain enough to any spiritual mind that we are in the place where both the Person and the rights of that Person are disallowed.<a name=290:5></a> How, then, can the Christian, with that in view, be found accepting honour or distinction here?<a name=290:6></a> The thing is clearly unrighteous, and you must take care that you answer to the call to depart from unrighteousness.<a name=290:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what next?<a name=290:8></a> You are to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=290:9></a> You are still in a sense seeking, and in doing it you are to be in the company of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=290:10></a> The path marked out is plain and simple enough, but how few of us, when the Spirit of God opened our eyes to the confusion and unrighteousness around us, entered upon that path in all its simplicity!<a name=290:11></a> What a tendency there has been, and is still, to bring in an order of things after our own thoughts, and so without the real support of the Lord.<a name=290:12></a> The great point is that when your eyes are opened to the true state of things around you in Christendom, you should be careful that you really get to the Lord.<a name=290:13></a> Made sensible by the Spirit of God of the confusion on every hand, and which cannot possibly be met by any wisdom or device of man -- the one and only resource is to be found in the Lord.<a name=290:14></a> Do not rest in simply believing in Him, but follow on to reach Him in all His sufficiency, that He may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not question for a moment but that the weakness of our fellowship is because saints have got, as to the state of their souls, so little to the Lord.<a name=291:2></a> I have sometimes said that there is only one possible ground of fellowship for us, and that is the name of the Lord.<a name=291:3></a> That is the only legitimate bond, there can be no other maintained by the Spirit in this scene.<a name=291:4></a> You may get a great deal of instruction and help after being brought into this fellowship; but the bond is that we confess as Lord Him whom the world has rejected.<a name=291:5></a> You separate from what is around, that you may follow Him.<a name=291:6></a> My soul is set on reaching the Lord that He may be the great reality to my heart, and I get my guidance solely from Him.<a name=291:7></a> My desire is to walk in the light of the Lord, so that I do not miss my way; and one sure result is that the closer we get to Him, the closer we are drawn to each other.<a name=291:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is certain that the bond of fellowship that is according to God is found when we come to the Lord, and that alone will be effective in binding saints together in the midst of a dark scene where Christ has been rejected.<a name=291:9></a> If India were in a state of revolt, the true bond between those who were awakened to loyalty would be the name of the Queen.<a name=291:10></a> What binds us together is the Lord's name, and the Holy Spirit has come down to maintain this fellowship, and it is important to have in mind that if you are in the fellowship of the Lord, you must be in the fellowship of His death here.<a name=291:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now pass on to what I have referred to as the second blessing, and that is, <i>the Lord found</i>, and for that point I would turn to chapter 3: 10, 11: "But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity [love], patience, persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me".<a name=291:12></a> Here,

		In the next chapter we find another thing, and that is, the Lord is "the righteous judge".<a name=292:4></a> The apostle says, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing".<a name=292:5></a> When once I have reached real, personal acquaintance with the Lord, in the sense that I can say "the Lord delivered me", I am very well content to wait for Him as the righteous Judge.<a name=292:6></a> The apostle knows Him, and though he might be misjudged of men, he knows that He is the righteous Judge, whose estimate of his course was just.<a name=292:7></a> He is perfectly satisfied to wait till "that day", to leave all in His hands, knowing that he will then get the crown of righteousness; and he adds, "Not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing".<a name=292:8></a> You will get the crown if you love His appearing; and if you love His Person, you will also love His appearing.<a name=292:9></a> "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha".<a name=292:10></a> How blessed to be able to say I know Him and have reached Him, I know His delivering power, and I can leave all to Him as the righteous Judge, whose appearing I love.<a name=292:11></a>

		Very often the Scriptures speak of Jesus as the Christ, but the true force of the term here is the Anointed; if you substitute the words Christ or Messiah in verse 2 it would be quite right.<a name=295:4></a> What I understand by the term Anointed is that He was the child of promise, the One who was to be set forth according to promise.<a name=295:5></a> It comes out in the gospel of Matthew, where He is viewed as the vessel of promise; all the pleasure of God was to be set forth in Him, it was to prosper in His hand, and so in the early part of the gospel we read that "He went about doing good, for God was with him".<a name=295:6></a> That is what He came here for, that the goodness of God in regard of man might be set forth in Him.<a name=295:7></a> Look at <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a>, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me".<a name=295:8></a> What for?<a name=295:9></a> "Because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=295:10></a> It was the pleasure of God to effect recovery, and what a wonderful thing it is!<a name=295:11></a> All this was set forth in Him, and for this He was anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power.<a name=295:12></a> He had come to bless, and so He went about doing good, for God was with Him.<a name=295:13></a> But all this was limited, as to the display of it, to the people of God; He was of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, and He came to confirm the promises made to the fathers, and we only see glimpses of blessing going out to the Gentiles.<a name=295:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three points that I desire to bring before you: first, that God reveals Himself to Abram by the name Almighty; secondly, He sees fit to confer upon Abram a new name; thirdly, God gives to Abraham a covenant of circumcision.<a name=325:1></a> Every one of these points is a great principle which characterises the whole ways of God.<a name=325:2></a> The more we see divine principles characterising God's ways, the more we become acquainted with those ways themselves, seeing how the same principle comes out; it may be in different details and with varied applications, but the principle is the same.<a name=325:3></a> We see the ways of God extended over thousands of years, but His ways did not come in until sin came in, they were consequent upon sin.<a name=325:4></a> I desire to look at the application of these points at that time and also at their application to us.<a name=325:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's revelation of Himself by His name is part of the divine ways.<a name=325:6></a> He gives to Abram a name, and He gives him a covenant; the name God gave to Abram depended on the way in which He revealed Himself, in the same way that the covenant depended on the name God gave to him.<a name=325:7></a> It may be different in detail, but it is true in principle to the believer at the present time.<a name=325:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God began to take up Abram, telling him to leave his father's house and his country, he was slack in fully obeying the call; but at seventy-five he came into Canaan, and now he was ninety-nine.<a name=325:9></a> God had gone on with him for twenty-four years, but He had not yet revealed Himself to him by name.<a name=325:10></a> God's revelation of Himself in a name shows relationship; Abram had owned God by obeying His call; he had

		<a name=326>[Page 326]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		had to say to God, and God had had a great deal to say to him; but before God revealed His name Abram had to be clear of Egyptian connections, and when he was clear of them God revealed Himself to him by His name.<a name=326:1></a> That name became the foundation of his relationship with God, and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:16">Romans  4:16</a> states he "is father of us all".<a name=326:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To review for a little the name Almighty.<a name=326:3></a> There are three names under which God has made Himself known: first, as the Almighty to Abram; to Moses as Jehovah; and now, sending forth His Son, He is of necessity revealed as Father.<a name=326:4></a> The basis of Israel's relationship was the name Jehovah, just as the basis of ours is Father.<a name=326:5></a> In successive revelations of the name of God we never lose the value of the preceding ones.<a name=326:6></a> In the revelation of the name Jehovah, they had all the worth of the name Almighty.<a name=326:7></a> In regard to us the basis of our relationship is the name of Father, but we have the gain of the previous names, Jehovah and Almighty.<a name=326:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the close of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6">2 Corinthians  6</a>we can discern this: "Lord" in the New Testament is generally a rendering of Jehovah.<a name=326:9></a> "The Lord Almighty" brings in as well the special name and foundation of our relationship, but we get the benefit of every previous name.<a name=326:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look at the significance of the name.<a name=326:11></a> I think the force of the name Almighty indicates the introduction of resurrection.<a name=326:12></a> God could do nothing for ruined man except by acting on the other side of death.<a name=326:13></a> "God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=326:14></a> He brings you out to life.<a name=326:15></a> Men will never be quickened to judgment; they are quickened to life.<a name=326:16></a> He quickeneth the dead.<a name=326:17></a> The signification of Almighty, I doubt not, is the power of God to quicken to life.<a name=326:18></a> A man who dies in this world forfeits the life God gave to him, and when he is gone, all is gone.<a name=326:19></a> There is no hope for
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		man but in God, who quickens men out of death into life.<a name=327:1></a> That is the real force of Almighty, and Abram in this manner became the starting-point of promise.<a name=327:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To pass on to the name Jehovah: it shows the eternal faithfulness of God when dealing, not with a man like Abram, but with a people who turned away from Him like a deceitful bow.<a name=327:3></a> To them what was to be revealed was the eternal faithfulness of God to His promises.<a name=327:4></a> There was no future for the earth outside of the promises, and the accomplishment of these promises depended on the eternal faithfulness of God.<a name=327:5></a> "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance".<a name=327:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a word in regard to the name of Father.<a name=327:7></a> What I understand by it is, that God gives a revelation of Himself in self-sacrificing love.<a name=327:8></a> It is only by the fact of God's coming out in that way that the names Almighty and Jehovah could have effect, because God had to take up the liabilities of man.<a name=327:9></a> There might have been a lapse of hundreds of years between the revelation of each name, but there is no lapse of time with God, and, after all, it is one God who is Almighty, who is eternally faithful to His promises, and it is He who reveals Himself to us in the Son.<a name=327:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In God's dealings with Abram we can see the propriety of God making Himself known as the Almighty with power of resurrection; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:17">Hebrews  11:17</a>-19.<a name=327:11></a> The testing, the trial of Abraham's faith, is a point of great importance and interest.<a name=327:12></a> If ever God gives a man light, that man is bound to be tested whether he has received the light.<a name=327:13></a> Now God had given Abraham light, and God was about to test him to see how far that light was effective with Abraham.<a name=327:14></a> He was called to offer up Isaac, "accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead".<a name=327:15></a> That proved on the part of Abraham that the name by which God had revealed Himself to him was effective.<a name=327:16></a> He answers the test, he really had the good of the name whereby
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=328>[Page 328]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had revealed Himself to him.<a name=328:1></a> That was the end of God's ways with Abraham.<a name=328:2></a> We hear no more of God's dealings besides; God had achieved His purpose, the end of the Lord was accomplished with regard to him.<a name=328:3></a> He had proved the power of God Almighty.<a name=328:4></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a> we find, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad".<a name=328:5></a> What a place Abraham will have in the accomplishment of God's ways; he will have his part in the future as the father of the family of promise.<a name=328:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when God gives a man a name, it is a matter of the utmost importance to that man.<a name=328:7></a> It was effective in the case of Abraham, the name God gave to him was a secret between himself and God.<a name=328:8></a> What I understand by God's giving a name is that which God intends to set forth in that man.<a name=328:9></a> What God intended to set forth in Abraham was that he was to be the father of many nations.<a name=328:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is an important point in connection with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>.<a name=328:11></a> The accomplishment was put off until the true seed should be manifested.<a name=328:12></a> In the gospel the children of God are brought to light, and the place of the children of God is that we are counted as Christ's and then as Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.<a name=328:13></a> It is important to see what God had in the name He thought good to put upon Abram.<a name=328:14></a> Abraham will have a place manifestly as the father of all them that believe, and all the children of God are children of Abraham; this is quite clear from the passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>, it is the import of the name God gave to Abram.<a name=328:15></a> The mistake of the Jews was to arrogate to themselves the place of children of God and children of Abraham, and the Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:38">John  8:38</a> absolutely refuses this claim, a fact that confirms what we get in Romans.<a name=328:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In looking at the third point, circumcision and the covenant, there are no children of God except as viewed in the quickening power of God -- the children

		<a name=329>[Page 329]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of God are born of God.<a name=329:1></a> The name, "father of many nations", which God saw fit to give Abram, in reality depended on the name Almighty by which He had revealed Himself to Abram.<a name=329:2></a> What is involved in circumcision is the complete setting aside of flesh in man, and man after the flesh could have no part whatever in the purpose of God.<a name=329:3></a> If God revealed His ways to Abram there must be a complete setting aside of man in the flesh.<a name=329:4></a> The flesh may have place in the wilderness, where it will be tested, but it is allowed no place at all in the purpose of God.<a name=329:5></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot [should not] do the things that ye would".<a name=329:6></a> This is descriptive of a believer in the wilderness, but not of a believer in the land.<a name=329:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think the lusting of the Spirit against the flesh is the same as circumcision (the Christian having a new life in Christ has efficaciously put off the old man).<a name=329:8></a> By grace I take my stand upon the ground of God's purpose; then the flesh must be allowed no place (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>), putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.<a name=329:9></a> No doubt there is delay through our imperfect apprehension of the truth before our mind is in accord with the death of Christ.<a name=329:10></a> We are crucified with Him, and we have fellowship in His death.<a name=329:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this indicates the mind of the saint being by the Spirit in accord with the death of Christ: it must be so when we take our stand on the ground of divine purpose.<a name=329:12></a> Abram had to be circumcised, and this ended in separation from all the rest of the earth.<a name=329:13></a> Circumcision morally meant separation to God, and undoubtedly this was realised in Abraham.<a name=329:14></a> So far I have only spoken of things in connection with Abram, the revelation of God Himself, His name made known, the name He gave to Abram, that is, Abraham, the covenant of God with him.<a name=329:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=330>[Page 330]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To dwell on the application to ourselves, the foundation in our case is the same, hence we come into the place of children.<a name=330:1></a> God has been revealed in the Son.<a name=330:2></a> If the Son has come from God, it is very evident that God has been revealed.<a name=330:3></a> "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it".<a name=330:4></a> It was God coming out in self-sacrificing love, making known the Father's name.<a name=330:5></a> The blessed consequence is the line of children; the beginning of it was Christ upon earth, followed by a company of children who are loved as Christ was loved.<a name=330:6></a> At the same time we have the benefit of each foregoing name.<a name=330:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to Israel, the hope of Israel is in the church, and the church in that sense knows the value of the name Jehovah, but the basis of our relationship is in the name of Father.<a name=330:8></a> We come under His love and also under His chastening and discipline; as children of God we come under both.<a name=330:9></a> If a parent withheld discipline from his children it would be a proof that he did not love his children.<a name=330:10></a> He cannot always smile upon his children -- they have to come under discipline.<a name=330:11></a> A parent would be lacking in affectionate care who did not exercise discipline, because children seek to follow their will, hence the necessity of discipline.<a name=330:12></a> As children of God we enjoy His perfect love as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>"That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<a name=330:13></a> Love is perfect toward you.<a name=330:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every one of us comes under discipline, too, from time to time; the admonition is that you must not despise it or faint under it, but that you are to be exercised by it.<a name=330:15></a> The value to us of the revelation of the name of Father is that we come under the name of children, but also we have the discipline.<a name=330:16></a> The purpose of God's discipline is that we should be partakers of His holiness -- that is the real preparation for priestly service.<a name=330:17></a> We find it stated in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:10">Hebrews  12:10</a>, "He for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness".<a name=330:18></a> In this parents are deficient; they exercise

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=331>[Page 331]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		discipline in anger, but God never exercises discipline thus, and always for our profit.<a name=331:1></a> Discipline prepares us for service in the sanctuary.<a name=331:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point in connection with the effect of coming under discipline is, it establishes you in confidence in divine love.<a name=331:3></a> Confidence can and does spring only from divine love.<a name=331:4></a> You have confidence in God just in proportion as you know the love of God; nothing begets confidence like love.<a name=331:5></a> Beloved friends, if you get the confidence of love and become partakers of God's holiness, then you are on a good footing and you will serve God as priests according to His mind, and God must have infinite pleasure in it.<a name=331:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The name which God has been pleased to put on us is not "father of many nations", the same name could not be set forth in two several individuals or companies, but we get the name of Christ -- "ye are all one in Christ Jesus".<a name=331:7></a> This is the name which God has put on us -- all one in Christ, though we may be a vast number of units, and we ought to be one in spiritual affection down here; <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:21">John  17:21</a>-23.<a name=331:8></a> We are not regarded by God as so many units in the light of divine purpose, we are all baptised into one body, "As many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ".<a name=331:9></a> This corresponds to what we read in Genesis.<a name=331:10></a> We are all one in Christ in the light of God's purpose, and Christ is the name God has put upon us.<a name=331:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is God's testimony down here: the name of Christ is put upon it; it is not only the testimony of the word, but also of fact in the unity of the saints in their spiritual affection.<a name=331:12></a> It was all the testimony that the Father sent the Son; and as Abraham's name in its full meaning will come to light, so, too, the name God put on us all will come to light.<a name=331:13></a> The fact is, the unity which has been sadly marred in the church will certainly come out in the heavenly city, which will witness to the world on the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=332>[Page 332]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		part of God that He loved the church as He loved Christ; and in the place where the church has been but an unfaithful witness, there will it be displayed that the Father sent the Son; thus we arrive at the importance of the name under which God has been pleased to reveal Himself.<a name=332:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many may credit the word that God could quicken the dead or eternally keep His promises, but you only learn the love of God in the death of Christ -- that was the commendation of God's love.<a name=332:2></a> God took up our liabilities in self-sacrificing love; and "as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons [children] of God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:12">John  1:12</a>.<a name=332:3></a> "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>.<a name=332:4></a> The point is the thought of the place of the church in the way God has revealed Himself as Father in self-sacrificing love; we are brought into that love, and yet discipline is in consistency with that love.<a name=332:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham was called the "father of many nations", and the outcome of that was that he had to repudiate all that was after the flesh.<a name=332:6></a> He made a feast for his son Isaac: he has to reject the son who was after the flesh, Ishmael, and he had to make much of the child of promise.<a name=332:7></a> Now compare <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>-16.<a name=332:8></a> We are left in the world that morally we may be here as a perpetuation of the name of Christ, and if we carried out this scripture in lowly grace, we should be a kind of continuation of Christ Himself.<a name=332:9></a> That is what saints were at the beginning, as you see in the book of Acts; they were shining morally as lights in the midst of darkness.<a name=332:10></a> The children of God were the only people who had light.<a name=332:11></a> It is a good thing to bear in mind that the mind of God in regard to the saints has been realised and unity has been shown.<a name=332:12></a> The saints in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>and 4 were a continuation of Christ; they really justified the name that God has put upon them, it was true then with regard to the saints.<a name=332:13></a> You

		Now we are not only admitted to the benefits of Christ's death, but we also have fellowship in His death.<a name=333:2></a> The flesh must have no place; the flesh, that is myself, is buried, buried with Him in baptism.<a name=333:3></a> So the tastes and propensities of the flesh, everything has got to go the moment you enter on the ground of purpose.<a name=333:4></a> You do not allow anything to obscure the name which God has been pleased to put upon us.<a name=333:5></a>

		What I want to bring before you at this time is the line on which life comes to us or reaches us; also of what it consists; and then I want to distinguish between it -- that is, life -- and the exercises of the way here.<a name=334:5></a> You cannot mix up the two.<a name=334:6></a> There are the exercises of the wilderness, the difficulties and trials of which we all have our share, and through them we learn the depths of God's heart.<a name=334:7></a> Things are not always quite smooth and pleasant, and I suppose we all find it so in the wilderness; but what I have found out is this, the things which tend to disappoint one naturally we find in the long run to be the best things for us.<a name=334:8></a>

		I have had it said to me before now, Is not life a necessity for man?<a name=335:8></a> I admit that to be born again is a necessity for man, but in the way things are presented in Scripture life comes to us on the line of purpose, and you may depend upon it Scripture puts things far better than we can.<a name=335:9></a> It is much better to accept them as Scripture puts them than as we think they should be.<a name=335:10></a> A man <i>must</i> be born again.<a name=335:11></a> I understand by that that God's Spirit awakens a man; but life is another matter.<a name=335:12></a> Life comes to us on the line of God's purpose.<a name=335:13></a> The passage in Timothy makes it very plain: "Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, <i>not according to our works</i>".<a name=335:14></a> Mark that!<a name=335:15></a> The holy calling is not on the line of our responsibility, but on the line of God's purpose "<i>according to his own purpose and grace</i>".<a name=335:16></a> I think when I come to touch on <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>you will see the immense importance of that.<a name=335:17></a>

		But life does not come in on that line at all.<a name=336:3></a> The line that meets us in regard of our responsibility brings before us that we can have peace with God and favour; and you get also in connection with that line the exercises of the wilderness.<a name=336:4></a> The apostle says, "We glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:3">Romans  5:3</a>, 4.<a name=336:5></a> The wilderness comes in on that line and the circumstances connected with it.<a name=336:6></a> It is the grace of God meeting all that in which we had failed; and we are relieved of the pressure of death because our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit.<a name=336:7></a>

		The order in these chapters I think is this: in chapter 4 we get the communication of the Spirit; in chapter 5, the raising up of the man; in chapter 6, deliverance from the world.<a name=337:12></a> They make up in that sense a very complete whole, and every part is an absolute necessity to every one of us.<a name=337:13></a> You do not start at all on the Christian course till you have the Spirit.<a name=337:14></a> How are you going to reach eternal life without the Spirit?<a name=337:15></a> So the Lord says, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=337:16></a> You want the power within.<a name=337:17></a> It is a well within springing up.<a name=337:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been struck lately, in looking at the beginning of Revelation, to observe that the apostle is allowed to see the ruin of the church -- its failure as the candlestick, and then he is caught up to heaven and there the throne is established; there is no disturbing element.<a name=339:3></a> He finds the throne and the Lamb, and everything peaceful and serene there and nothing to disturb.<a name=339:4></a> We should not find any disturbing element there.<a name=339:5></a> There is a great deal here!<a name=339:6></a> But if by grace you can pass for an instant by the Spirit into the light of the Father's will, you have passed into a scene where there is nothing but serenity.<a name=339:7></a>

		The extraordinary thing is that such a thing should be possible in such a scene as this!<a name=339:8></a> In a scene where we are tested in God's ways with us, it is wonderful to pass into such a scene as that.<a name=339:9></a> I know something about the pressure of things here -- I think I have had my share; and I know the effect upon my spirit.<a name=339:10></a> But I think I can see the use God is turning it to.<a name=339:11></a> He brings out what is in my heart, and the deeper you go the worse it appears; things in your heart are brought to light which you had scarcely dreamed of!<a name=339:12></a> If God brings everything to light, we know it is to do us good in our "latter end".<a name=339:13></a> When we get to the end we shall be able to say our foot did not swell and our raiment waxed not old.<a name=339:14></a> We cannot say it perhaps while we are in it -- at least I do not think many of us do; but we do at the end.<a name=339:15></a> God will have effected His purpose and brought out all in us, but we shall be conscious it was to do us good at our latter end.<a name=339:16></a>
