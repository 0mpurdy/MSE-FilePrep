		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> The subject which the apostle takes up from chapter 11, verse 17 is the coming together of the Assembly.<a name=1:3></a> It is a great thing to see that in Scripture there is no such thing as an Assembly-meeting.<a name=1:4></a>

		F.E.<a name=1:7></a>R.<a name=1:8></a> There is no such thing as an appointed order of meeting, a system of meetings arranged and settled; prayer-meeting, reading, etc.<a name=1:9></a>, all that kind of thing is not known in Scripture.<a name=1:10></a>

		F.E.<a name=1:22></a>R.<a name=1:23></a> Well, they were rallied by the Lord's supper, you do not want any arrangement save as to time.<a name=1:24></a> The Assembly is brought together by the Lord's supper.<a name=1:25></a> I do not see such a thing as an assembly prayer-meeting or an assembly worship meeting.<a name=1:26></a> I have seen circulars passed about among saints fixing prayer-meetings and soon.<a name=1:27></a> I do not see it in Scripture, nor do I think it is the right idea.<a name=1:28></a>

		F.E.<a name=2:10></a>R.<a name=2:11></a> We must take into account the state of things.<a name=2:12></a> In a ruined state of things we cannot expect anything magnificent, we must be thankful that anything is preserved to us.<a name=2:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.C.<a name=2:14></a> The danger is that we drop the thought of the Assembly after the meeting is over.<a name=2:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:16></a>R.<a name=2:17></a> Where is the authority to arrange any system of meetings?<a name=2:18></a> I do not think of an Assembly prayer-meeting but a meeting of those interested in the Lord's work coming together to pray.<a name=2:19></a> If the Assembly comes together you cannot lay down any form it will take, but you must give place to the Head, to direct and order.<a name=2:20></a> If I come to lecture, I come with something before me, otherwise I should not be doing honour to the saints.<a name=2:21></a> But I would not have anything before me in the Assembly.<a name=2:22></a> The purpose of the Supper is to give the Lord His place as Head, that is the proper work of it.<a name=2:23></a> So the Supper in chapter 11 gives the Lord the prominent place.<a name=2:24></a> In chapter 12 we are baptised into one body by the Spirit.<a name=2:25></a> In chapter 13 we get the principle which excludes the flesh .<a name=2:26></a>.<a name=2:27></a>.<a name=2:28></a> anything that is uncomely in the Assembly.<a name=2:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:17></a>R.<a name=3:18></a> I object to receiving because some have a difficulty about it; every Christian known to be orderly has a title to be there.<a name=3:19></a> If so, how can you talk about receiving?<a name=3:20></a> We have not an exclusive fellowship.<a name=3:21></a> It may be called that, but we do not seek to make it so.<a name=3:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:21></a> Would it be correct to say that the Assembly, as such, took the place of the sanctuary?<a name=4:22></a>

		F.E.<a name=5:14></a>R.<a name=5:15></a> For the service of the sanctuary you must have saints divested of the flesh.<a name=5:16></a> You cannot have flesh in the sanctuary.<a name=5:17></a> The only ground on which you can have priests is risen with Christ, you cannot have a priest after the flesh, not even the Lord on earth.<a name=5:18></a> If you are risen with Christ you are outside of flesh, outside of every order of man, whether religious, philosophical, sentimental, educated.<a name=5:19></a> We may not know much of what a risen man is like, but he is clear of every order of man here.<a name=5:20></a> You may judge that if you get sentimentalism or eloquence in the Assembly, it is not priestly work.<a name=5:21></a> The spring of everything must be God Himself else it is not the divine nature.<a name=5:22></a> In chapter 13 you get the practical exclusion of the flesh.<a name=5:23></a> In the early part every movement of the flesh is excluded, the second part brings you to God outside of all knowledge, etc.<a name=5:24></a> That is where love brings you.<a name=5:25></a>

		Ques.<a name=6:3></a> What is the meaning of remembering the Lord?<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=6:5></a>R.<a name=6:6></a> It is calling Him into presence; His death is the vehicle, the means, and is so because death is the expression of His love.<a name=6:7></a> The death of Christ is an incident in the pathway of love, the most important incident, and so through death we call Him to mind.<a name=6:8></a> Love was there before death, and after death just as really as at His death.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:10></a> Is it the remembrance of His death in the past or the remembrance of Him as absent?<a name=6:11></a>

		F.E.<a name=6:23></a>R.<a name=6:24></a> Yes, so He is the Firstborn of many brethren.<a name=6:25></a> If we are speaking of the Lord, He is not one of us, but is Lord on God's side, as Head He is on our side therefore He is pre-eminent, anointed above His fellows -- that is where you join the Lord.<a name=6:26></a>

		F.E.<a name=7:10></a>R.<a name=7:11></a> Because it is only then that you come to a true sense of the Assembly.<a name=7:12></a> The Lord is called into presence by the Supper and thus it is that the Assembly begins.<a name=7:13></a> In the midst of the church will I praise thee.<a name=7:14></a>

		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:16">Matthew  11:16</a> - 30
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I wanted to draw attention to in this passage is the change from one order or course of things to another.<a name=17:1></a> It would not, I think, be seen until pointed out, but the Lord points it out here.<a name=17:2></a> No one would otherwise have understood the two things which were going on together here, namely, on the one hand the testimony of grace, and on the other the Father's work.<a name=17:3></a> It is just these two things to which I wish to draw attention a little as coming before us in this passage.<a name=17:4></a> Although the change in position indicated by the Lord's words is not publicly seen, the truth comes out that there is nothing effective in man, nothing that abides for ever, except the work of the Father.<a name=17:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that the Lord shows in the passage is, that in place of the mighty works He had done, another order of things was to come in, and that based upon the revelation of the Father; in other words, Christianity was to take the place of His presence and power.<a name=17:6></a> It is a painful reflection, but only too true, that man has refused every testimony of God.<a name=17:7></a> The testimony of Christ, when He was here, differed from all previous testimonies.<a name=17:8></a> It was not like the law -- not that He set the law aside, for He had come to fulfil it -- it was not like the prophets, nor like that of John the Baptist; it was entirely different and new.<a name=17:9></a> It was in the power of the world to come; and the Lord appeals to the works as that which the cities had seen, but they had not repented.<a name=17:10></a> I judge that the testimony of the Lord here was the testimony of the kingdom.<a name=17:11></a> I think that He came here in the mighty power of the kingdom, that is, in the power of grace, showing forth those mighty works which relieved man of the pressure of evil.<a name=17:12></a> That testimony God addressed to man, and man refused it,

		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		did not respond to it.<a name=18:1></a> In the first part of the scripture that I read, we see how John the Baptist had come, but they did not answer to him.<a name=18:2></a> And then the Son of man came "eating and drinking and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber".<a name=18:3></a> They no more responded to the testimony of grace presented in the Son of man than they had done to John's testimony in righteousness.<a name=18:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has to come home to us painfully that the heart of man refuses whatever testimony God is pleased to present to him, but none the less the testimony of grace goes on; God will cut it short, but it is still here.<a name=18:5></a> It is the form of God's outward dealings with man, the glad tidings are the glad tidings of the grace of God.<a name=18:6></a> The testimony of grace began with Christ, and continues in the mighty power of the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.<a name=18:7></a> But this does not alter the statement I made, that man does not respond to any testimony of God.<a name=18:8></a> Such testimony may produce a transitory effect, as in the case of Nineveh, but no lasting effect; for man, apart from a work of God in him, is not really affected by any testimony, hence the breach between God and man is complete.<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This ought to come home to us.<a name=18:10></a> It is a point of the last moment, but one which we are very slow to accept.<a name=18:11></a> We sometimes imagine that we might affect others by the testimony of God's grace, but man is not really affected by the best testimony of God's grace; was not even by the ministry of Christ Himself, save where souls were drawn to Him by the Father; and surely no ministry can be better or greater than His.<a name=18:12></a> As we have seen, the testimony of Christ was quite distinct, and of another character from that of John the Baptist, yet neither found favour.<a name=18:13></a> The same was true of the testimony of Elijah and Elisha.<a name=18:14></a> The testimony of Elisha produced no more permanent effect than that of Elijah.<a name=18:15></a> I have said this much to pave the way for what I have before me.<a name=18:16></a>

		We read in verses 25 - 27: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.<a name=19:5></a> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.<a name=19:6></a> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him".<a name=19:7></a> Now there is hardly a passage in Scripture that brings out the sovereignty of the Father more distinctly than this.<a name=19:8></a> The beginning is that the Father has "hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes".<a name=19:9></a> The Father reveals to the babes, and the Son also speaks about revealing.<a name=19:10></a> He reveals the Father to the subjects of the Father's work.<a name=19:11></a> Every one of us was a subject of the Father's work before we knew it.<a name=19:12></a> You see that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, where this comes out unmistakably: "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day".<a name=19:13></a> The Father's work is that He draws to the Son, and the Son's work is that He raises up at the last day.<a name=19:14></a> A great deal may come between, but these are the two extreme points in the Christian's course.<a name=19:15></a> We are waiting for the last, but the first was the secret of our coming to Christ.<a name=19:16></a> Did you come to the Son of your own accord?<a name=19:17></a> I think not.<a name=19:18></a> It is an expression of the

		There is not ability or power in man for the knowledge of divine Persons.<a name=20:5></a> No one knows the Son but the Father, and no one knows the Father if not revealed to him.<a name=20:6></a> We have no more power to know the Father than we have to know the Son.<a name=20:7></a> The Father was the subject of the Son's revelation; but as to knowledge, you no more know the Father than the Son.<a name=20:8></a> We were the subjects of the Father's drawing before we knew the Father.<a name=20:9></a> Then the Son follows the Father's work, He reveals the Father and thus makes Him known.<a name=20:10></a> The Son is not looked at here as the subject of revelation.<a name=20:11></a> He was presented to man, and bore testimony as to who He was, but His work was revealing the Father.<a name=20:12></a> In His mind the Father was the source of everything, as we see in the most distinct way in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, the Father's will and the Father's pleasure was His work down here.<a name=20:13></a> The Son revealed the Father to souls.<a name=20:14></a> There could be no knowledge of Him else.<a name=20:15></a> And here again comes in the point of sovereignty.<a name=20:16></a> No one knows the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.<a name=20:17></a> The Father hides from the wise and prudent and reveals to babes, and the Son reveals the Father to whom He will.<a name=20:18></a> Now, I refer to this because it is so important to be able to take account of ourselves as the subjects of the work of God.<a name=20:19></a> If I look at myself historically, I have come to know the grace of God.<a name=20:20></a> I was once unconverted, but by the grace of God was led to turn to God to receive remission of sins and the Holy Spirit; all that is the outward history; but when we come to be a little intelligent in the things of God we can regard ourselves in another light, that is, in the light of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the point I am coming to is this -- in the presence of the Father and the Son we have another order of man.<a name=21:3></a> The first order of man has been tested in every variety of way in which God could approach man -- law, prophets, John the Baptist, Christ, and even by the presence and testimony of the Holy Spirit -- but man has failed, he does not respond to any testimony of God at all.<a name=21:4></a> Thus man's case is hopeless.<a name=21:5></a> God cannot touch him except in sovereign grace.<a name=21:6></a> Without God's sovereign work, in which man is born again, man's case would be hopeless.<a name=21:7></a> It is of all moment to accept this.<a name=21:8></a> But then by this fact you have a man of another order morally before God, and that must be the case if the first man is not to be touched by any testimony of God.<a name=21:9></a> All must begin with a divine work in his soul, as we find in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God".<a name=21:10></a> Then in verse 5 you get a subsequent statement: "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God".<a name=21:11></a> But first you have to see that he cannot accept any testimony addressed to him by God.<a name=21:12></a> But in the presence of the Father you get a man of another order, and if you want to know what the character of it is, you get it here in the person of Christ Himself, for in the subsequent passage He speaks of Himself very evidently as Man.<a name=21:13></a> "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<a name=21:14></a> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls".<a name=21:15></a> One may venture to speak of the Lord as presenting Himself there as in the place of Man in the presence of the Father, and the character brought before us is "meek and lowly in heart".<a name=21:16></a> I

		think there could be nothing more remarkable than the Son describing Himself in that way.<a name=22:1></a> That is what a man is in the presence of the Father's love, that characterises him down here; but you never find that in man after the flesh.<a name=22:2></a> It was said of Moses, that he was the meekest man upon earth, but you must remember that this was after and the effect of a long course of divine discipline, and it was, I doubt not, in view of the One who here says, "I am meek and lowly in heart".<a name=22:3></a> If you find a man in the presence of the Father, I do not doubt he will be thus characterised.<a name=22:4></a> It is, I judge, in contrast to man in his assumption and self-confidence and pride.<a name=22:5></a> The first thing the Lord proposes is, "I will give you rest".<a name=22:6></a> You get rest in the apprehension of the glory of God; there righteousness and love have been perfectly reconciled, for that is what I understand by the glory of God, when the question of sin has been raised.<a name=22:7></a> The Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him".<a name=22:8></a> God has been glorified in the Son of man, righteousness and love perfectly reconciled in the place of sin.<a name=22:9></a> I believe it is in the apprehension of it that we get rest.<a name=22:10></a> While righteousness and love are opposed in regard of man, you cannot have rest.<a name=22:11></a> Righteousness is God's measure in regard of the creature, and it must be answered to.<a name=22:12></a> So if sin is in question, righteousness and love must of necessity be opposed; but when I see them reconciled, I get rest.<a name=22:13></a> All this was effected at the cross, and no one can now know God except as revealed in love and righteousness, and this we learn in the death of Christ.<a name=22:14></a> Then we have the admonition, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart".<a name=22:15></a> You are to be subdued to Christ; Christ is now the starting point morally.<a name=22:16></a> Every subject of grace has to take his character from Christ, and we can approach Christ from the very fact that He is meek and lowly in heart; He is approachable.<a name=22:17></a> That is the idea which the passage presents to me.<a name=22:18></a> You can venture to approach one who

		Now, in being brought to Christ, and learning of Him, you get wonderful instruction which you can derive only from Christ.<a name=23:2></a> We all seek to help, and to point out the lines to one another, and to direct each other's attention to the things of God.<a name=23:3></a> We can in this sense be as sign-posts to others, but each one of us has himself to learn of Christ.<a name=23:4></a> You cannot be impressed too much with the importance of that.<a name=23:5></a> Christ is the Teacher, He instructs us, and leads our hearts into the knowledge of the love of God.<a name=23:6></a> I think we learn every true lesson from Christ.<a name=23:7></a> Our hearts get instructed in divine love, and the love of God is the true source of our moral being.<a name=23:8></a> There is never a breath of real life in man except in response to the love of God.<a name=23:9></a> There may be an antecedent work in the soul, but until the love of God is apprehended, until we have learnt that "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ", we can hardly be said to be conscious of living.<a name=23:10></a> God began, of His love, and the first breath of spiritual life was our response to that love.<a name=23:11></a> And the great expression of that love is beyond all controversy in the death of Christ.<a name=23:12></a> God so loved us that He gave His Son for us.<a name=23:13></a> Every one of us has the spring of his moral being in the love of God.<a name=23:14></a> "Rooted and founded in love".<a name=23:15></a> Two great effects are produced in us by the love of God.<a name=23:16></a> One is holiness, and I think that is the point where man is naturally wholly unfitted for God.<a name=23:17></a> The holiness of God is unbearable to the natural man, though he has but little idea of it.<a name=23:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		into the love of God we appreciate holiness, and thus holiness is promoted.<a name=24:1></a> It is in this sense that holiness is progressive in the Christian.<a name=24:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another great effect produced by the love of God is growth in intelligence.<a name=24:3></a> We come to the clear knowledge of the Son of God.<a name=24:4></a> The spring of intelligence is love.<a name=24:5></a> Thus the apostle speaks of it in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>"Rooted and founded in love", that ye "may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge".<a name=24:6></a> And so in Colossians, "That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the clear knowledge of the mystery of God, .<a name=24:7></a>.<a name=24:8></a>.<a name=24:9></a> in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge".<a name=24:10></a> There is evidently great gain in that in which Christ can instruct us, that is, the knowledge of the love of God; and indeed, Christ went to the cross to bring us into that love.<a name=24:11></a> It was to maintain God's glory and righteousness that He died; but with all that there was the purpose that in it might be expressed to us the perfect love of God.<a name=24:12></a> It is there Christ instructs us, and there is the secret and spring of the true moral being of the Christian.<a name=24:13></a> I am thoroughly convinced that as we advance in the knowledge of God, as our hearts are in the sunshine of His love, so holiness is promoted in us, and we grow in divinely given intelligence.<a name=24:14></a> Holiness and knowledge are thus promoted in the Christian by learning of Christ.<a name=24:15></a>

		THE NEW COVENANT IN ITS APPLICATION TO CHRISTIANS

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:16">2 Corinthians  3:16</a> - 18
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My object in reading this Scripture is to say a few words in regard to the thought of the new covenant, and in general as to the force of a covenant.<a name=26:1></a> It is an idea which is presented to us in Scripture in different ways from time to time, and it is evident enough from the passage I have read that it has a very important application to us.<a name=26:2></a> The apostle speaks of being made competent as ministers of the new covenant, and then gives an idea of the terms and character of that covenant.<a name=26:3></a> Covenant was a thought with which those instructed in Scripture were familiar, and no doubt the new covenant spoken of literally, has its application in the future to Israel; it will be established for the house of Judah and Israel.<a name=26:4></a> But we find the truth here in its application to Christians, showing that the apostles' ministry was, in principle, the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=26:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I purpose to refer to two or three instances in Scripture of covenants established, to show their character, and then to refer to the new covenant to see the import of it in regard to ourselves; and in connection with this, to show what it is intended to lead on to.<a name=26:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose the new covenant when established with Israel will, in a sense, be the end of things for them, they will not look to anything farther, and power will be there to enable them fully to enjoy what is present.<a name=26:7></a> But covenant comes in in regard to us, not merely that we may enjoy what is set forth in it, but to lead us on to what is beyond; and the proof of that is found in this epistle.<a name=26:8></a> In chapter 5 we have the ministry of reconciliation, and it is plain enough that this is something beyond the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=26:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want first to give you the idea of a covenant.<a name=26:10></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I understand it, a covenant describes the terms on which God can be with an individual or a people at any given moment, the object being to secure to that people or individual the benefits of God's previous intervention on their behalf.<a name=27:1></a> That is rather a long sentence, but I hope you will take it in.<a name=27:2></a> A covenant invariably follows upon some intervention of God on man's behalf; and it is brought in in order that the benefits of that intervention may be enjoyed by the subjects of it.<a name=27:3></a> So that if God comes in to establish a covenant, that covenant lays down the terms or conditions on which God can be with man.<a name=27:4></a> We shall see this better and more clearly when we come to illustrations of it.<a name=27:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point incidental to this is, that a subsequent covenant usually embodies the conditions of preceding covenants, so that you are not at liberty to go back to a preceding covenant; if you do, you transgress.<a name=27:6></a> This is an exceedingly important principle, and comes out in Scripture very simply.<a name=27:7></a> What makes me refer especially to this is because of what we see in Christendom.<a name=27:8></a> There has been a general going back to the form of a preceding covenant, and in this sense they have transgressed.<a name=27:9></a> The Galatians were in great danger of doing this, of turning from the new covenant to the old, and the apostle shows that they were going in the direction of apostasy, and were in danger of falling from grace.<a name=27:10></a> It is this that very largely characterises Christendom.<a name=27:11></a> It has gone back from the new covenant to the form of the old covenant -- to Judaism.<a name=27:12></a> It is not therefore, I think, too much to say that Christendom is apostate, that is, the mass is apostate.<a name=27:13></a> I do not look with the least satisfaction on Christendom, and am only too glad to have escaped in measure from its corruption, and rather than be mixed up with much in it, I think I would stand alone all my days.<a name=27:14></a> I feel in spirit more and more apart from it.<a name=27:15></a> If you have your eyes open, you cannot but see the enormous increase of pretension in it, and yet, as a matter of fact, almost every pulpit

		To return to my subject.<a name=28:3></a> The first covenant to which I will allude (although it does not fully illustrate my point) is that which God made with Noah, and which followed on God's intervention on behalf of himself and his family.<a name=28:4></a> When the flood of water was upon the earth, Noah and his family were saved by God's intervention.<a name=28:5></a> They came forth from the ark on a regenerated earth, and that led to the covenant made with Noah.<a name=28:6></a> I have no doubt the basis of the covenant was the burnt-offering, and the object of it was that they might enjoy God's intervention on their behalf.<a name=28:7></a> The world had been destroyed on account of its wickedness, but God having saved Noah and his family, His thought was that they should enjoy His salvation, and therefore God made a covenant on certain terms with Noah.<a name=28:8></a> I do not go into the detail of the terms, but there it was.<a name=28:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we pass on to Abraham, where more of the moral character of a covenant comes out.<a name=28:10></a> The covenant with Abraham, as I understand it, was circumcision, a covenant in the flesh of Abraham and his children.<a name=28:11></a> Abraham was circumcised himself; and all the males of his household.<a name=28:12></a> That was the condition of God's covenant with Abraham, and the purpose and moral force of it was separation.<a name=28:13></a> They carried this sign with them in order that they might enjoy God's intervention, and that intervention was that God had accounted Abraham righteous.<a name=28:14></a> God had not only blessed him, but He made this covenant with him -- that Abraham might enjoy God's grace.<a name=28:15></a> God lays down the condition on which He could be with Abraham, and the condition was circumcision.<a name=28:16></a> He was to be separate from the nations of the earth, a stranger and a pilgrim apart for God.<a name=28:17></a>

		made with Israel.<a name=29:1></a> God made a covenant of law with the children of Israel, and the purpose of it was that they might enjoy His intervention on their behalf, that is, their redemption from Egypt.<a name=29:2></a> I do not go much into the matter, but the law expressed the terms of the covenant, and these terms were good and beneficent.<a name=29:3></a> We find God afterwards appealing to the people on this ground, and raising the question whether any other people on the face of the earth had had righteous statutes and judgments such as they had.<a name=29:4></a> They were far better off than any other people.<a name=29:5></a> They had an amount of light from God that no other nation enjoyed, and righteous judgments to guide them in government; and the object of the covenant was that they might enjoy the intervention of God, who had not only delivered them from Egyptian bondage, but brought them to Himself in the wilderness.<a name=29:6></a> The covenant with them embodied the covenant made with Abraham.<a name=29:7></a> We read that circumcision was not of Moses, but of the fathers.<a name=29:8></a> Thus the covenant made with them in the law embodied the principle of the preceding covenant, and described the terms on which God could be with them, and they with God.<a name=29:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before passing on from this to the covenant in connection with the coming of Christ, I may remark that there was a kind of covenant made with Israel on their return from the captivity in Babylon, which return was a remarkable intervention of God on their behalf.<a name=29:10></a> If you search the Scriptures, you will find that God laid down certain terms on which He would be with the people after their return.<a name=29:11></a> There was a modification of the original terms, because many things were scarcely possible after their return which had been laid down under the original covenant.<a name=29:12></a> They came back, you must remember, from the captivity under the protection of the Gentile power, but they no longer had the throne of David.<a name=29:13></a> They were brought back to wait for Christ under Gentile domination.<a name=29:14></a>

		Now we come to the presence of Christ in Israel, and in this we see a new intervention of God on behalf of His people, the greatest intervention of all.<a name=30:1></a> What could be equal to the thought of Emmanuel, God with us?<a name=30:2></a> In the early part of the prophecy of Isaiah we get this intervention of God on their behalf referred to prophetically, in allusion to the time when the Assyrian will yet come into the land, and the prophet says (chapter 9): The darkness will not be like the darkness was in the past, for "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder".<a name=30:3></a> That was the character of God's intervention on behalf of Israel.<a name=30:4></a> A sign was given (chapter 7), and the sign pointed to <i>Immanuel</i>.<a name=30:5></a> At the birth of Christ the angels say to the shepherds: "For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord;" and the sign which they gave them was of a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, laid in a manger, because there was no room for Him in the inn.<a name=30:6></a> The force of the intervention was "God with us".<a name=30:7></a> And when Christ came in thus, there were new conditions laid down for those that received Him that they might enjoy this new intervention of God.<a name=30:8></a> Not that Christ was come to set aside the law, but to fulfil it; at the same time, where there was faith to appreciate this intervention of God in Christ, there were new conditions for those who accepted it.<a name=30:9></a> The angels celebrated this at the birth of Christ in the song, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=30:10></a> That is very different to anything that had gone before.<a name=30:11></a> I have a strong impression that those who received Christ, and were associated with Him here, came under the favour of God, under that favour in which Christ stood, the object being that they might enjoy the wonderful intervention of God on behalf of His people.<a name=30:12></a> This intervention is celebrated in a very blessed way in the song of Zacharias in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and

		redeemed his people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David".<a name=31:1></a> While the occasion of the song was the birth of John the Baptist, the song is remarkable in its celebration of the coming kingdom of Christ.<a name=31:2></a> He was the "horn of salvation".<a name=31:3></a> The position of those whom Christ described as "blessed" may be seen in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>- 7.<a name=31:4></a> It is very interesting to trace out how those associated with Christ, when the Lord was here on earth, came under the favour of God, and that this was the character of the covenant consequent on the introduction of Christ.<a name=31:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to the passage I read, which speaks of the new covenant, and this refers to ourselves.<a name=31:6></a> Now, in order to lead up to the new covenant, I will say a few words about God's intervention, as pictured in the great supper (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>), and what I understand by it.<a name=31:7></a> The great supper brings before us, I judge, the glory of the Lord, as the celebration of righteousness accomplished; and you cannot understand or appreciate this intervention on behalf of men save as you apprehend the glory of the Lord.<a name=31:8></a> Then the new covenant has come in in order that we may behold and be changed by the glory of the Lord.<a name=31:9></a> You first have the terms of the new covenant, then it is added, "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=31:10></a> But we all, with open face beholding .<a name=31:11></a>.<a name=31:12></a>.<a name=31:13></a> the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image".<a name=31:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I have said, the great supper connects itself with the glory of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord is a great celebration!<a name=31:15></a> God will have His house filled, and filled with those who are prepared to have part in the great celebration.<a name=31:16></a> Now, if you ask what I mean by the great supper being the celebration of righteousness, I reply that the supper is the answer to the cross, and that the cross was the accomplishment of righteousness of God.<a name=31:17></a> Where sin had been, sin has been removed, and at the same time righteousness established in the righteous

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to a further point, the glory of the Lord is the celebration of righteousness.<a name=32:13></a> I do not know whether we all enter into the meaning of celebration, but the idea is brought before us in the great supper.<a name=32:14></a> I would like all to appreciate the glory of the Lord.<a name=32:15></a> You get a foreshadowing of it in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24">Psalm  24</a>, where we read, "Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in".<a name=32:16></a> When Christ went up on high, surely He was received with rejoicing.<a name=32:17></a> If there was such heavenly rejoicing when Christ was born into the world, do you not think there was great rejoicing when He went up as Man on high?<a name=32:18></a> When the Lord entered Jerusalem, at the close of His course here, to suffer, the children sang, "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=32:19></a> Now when righteousness was completed, and Christ went to heaven in the value of that completed work, do you not think He was received there with

		acclamation, that there was rejoicing in heaven?<a name=33:1></a> All the will of God accomplished, and the One in whom God had been perfectly glorified, who had accomplished righteousness in the place of man's judgment, gone up on high.<a name=33:2></a> If there were not rejoicing, I think there would be very poor spirits in heaven!<a name=33:3></a> And if there was rejoicing in heaven, I think we must be very poor things if we do not rejoice here.<a name=33:4></a> I doubt not that there was acclamation in heaven when Christ went back there in the power of His accomplished work -- rejoicing that can only be made good down here in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=33:5></a> The Holy Spirit has come down to report the glory of Christ, and to bring us into the celebration of the great supper, the rejoicing consequent upon Christ having entered heaven in accomplished righteousness.<a name=33:6></a> He came from there to do the work, He goes back as having fully glorified God.<a name=33:7></a> The Holy Spirit has come to bring our souls into the rejoicings of heaven.<a name=33:8></a> If that is true, and I think no one here would be prepared to dispute it, there is not one but would wish to join in the acclamation.<a name=33:9></a> Every one here, I suppose, knows and confesses Christ as Lord, but how far have we entered into the rejoicings of heaven?<a name=33:10></a> I feel the poverty of my own spirit in this way, how little I am in accord with heaven.<a name=33:11></a> If we were in the spirit of what characterises heaven, we should be very bright; how much rejoicing there would be here on earth!<a name=33:12></a> We must be all conscious how very soon we feel the effect of a ray of sunshine; and if you got a little ray of sunshine from the glory of the Lord, from that scene, what an amazing effect there would be on the spirits of God's people down here.<a name=33:13></a> The Spirit of the Lord is come, and we, in the liberty of the Spirit, beholding the glory of the Lord, enter into the rejoicings above, which really began when Christ came into the world and which have not yet ended in heaven.<a name=33:14></a> Christ has been received there as Man, and is seated in the highest place of honour and dignity.<a name=33:15></a> He has taken His place

		Now we will refer again to the covenant as that by which we may enjoy what we have been speaking about.<a name=34:2></a> The Spirit brings out the terms on which God is pleased to be with us, consequent on His intervention on our behalf.<a name=34:3></a> The terms are very simple: love and forgiveness, or love and righteousness.<a name=34:4></a> The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, and in the presence of the love of God it is impossible that there can be such a thing as imputation of sin.<a name=34:5></a> These are the spirit of the covenant, the love of God, and forgiveness or non-imputation.<a name=34:6></a> The love of God is the first principle of Christianity, and when the Holy Spirit is come, the love of God is shed abroad in man's heart.<a name=34:7></a> What is Christianity without love?<a name=34:8></a> I think the sense of grace would grow old in us, if you understand me, if we had not love.<a name=34:9></a> But love cannot grow old; love is ever fresh, because it is what God is.<a name=34:10></a> The sense of grace might in measure fail in the heart of a Christian, but there is no failing in the love of God.<a name=34:11></a> Indeed, we get the expression in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>"Love never fails".<a name=34:12></a> It is eternal, and the Holy Spirit sheds it abroad in our hearts.<a name=34:13></a> He is given to us to that end, that we might be in the blessings of the new covenant, love and righteousness.<a name=34:14></a> And, I judge the object is, that by beholding the glory of the Lord, we might be brought more and more by the power of the Holy Spirit into correspondence with the mind of heaven.<a name=34:15></a> There is a company in the Revelation that puts us to shame, a company on earth who learn the heavenly song.<a name=34:16></a> We do not sing it much.<a name=34:17></a> Our hymns have not much the character of it.<a name=34:18></a> The company I refer to learn the heavenly song.<a name=34:19></a> We ought not to have to learn it, for it belongs to us as a heavenly people.<a name=34:20></a> It is not for us to listen to, and to catch its tones; we ought to know it and to sing it ourselves, to be in concert with heaven.<a name=34:21></a> We can get on very well with such a hymn as:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=35>[Page 35]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'We bless our Saviour's name,<br>Our sins are all forgiven'.<a name=35:1></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that is hardly the acclamation and rejoicing of heaven; very different from it; and I think the Holy Spirit is come down here to bring our hearts into the heavenly song.<a name=35:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of the covenant, I have looked at it as being on our part, because covenants, though of God, are on man's behalf.<a name=35:3></a> A covenant, as we have seen, describes the terms on which God can be with us so that we may enjoy His intervention on our behalf; thus covenant is on our side.<a name=35:4></a> God does not make a covenant for Himself but on our behalf.<a name=35:5></a> There are two parties to a covenant.<a name=35:6></a> God makes the covenant, lays down the terms, and we accept the terms.<a name=35:7></a> But at the same time, I believe that the new covenant is to lead us into the apprehension of what is on the part of God, and the point where we begin to touch that, is the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=35:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I speak of God's love and righteousness, of sin not being imputed, that is on man's behalf; but when I come to the ministry of reconciliation, the word of reconciliation is that every man and every order of man has disappeared in the death of Christ from the eye of God, that but one Man may remain, and that Man is Christ.<a name=35:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consequent on reconciliation, you have this: "If any man be in Christ, there is a new creation, old things have passed away, behold, all things have become new, and all things are of God".<a name=35:10></a> That is not on man's part, but on God's part.<a name=35:11></a> The terms of the new covenant are to lead you to the apprehension of what is on <i>God's</i> part, and if you apprehend that, you have a very much clearer sense of what is on man's part.<a name=35:12></a> It is a great point for souls to go on to the apprehension of what is on God's part.<a name=35:13></a> Reconciliation is so, and it began when Christ was on earth.<a name=35:14></a> Then He was morally outside of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=36>[Page 36]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		everything and every man here upon earth; He was addressing man, but as being Himself morally outside all; He had no part morally with man, but was outside of all and every man -- the corn of wheat alone; and in the cross He removed every man.<a name=36:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is now the blessed starting-point for God.<a name=36:2></a> God will have none other.<a name=36:3></a> If any man be in Christ, there is a new creation; new things have come to pass, and all things are of God.<a name=36:4></a> Christ is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that in everything He might have the pre-eminence; and that we must accept.<a name=36:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing comes in as connected with this: you have to get free from everything that links you to the course of things down here.<a name=36:6></a> You will feel the need of deliverance, the need to be set free from everything to which the flesh would attach you; and the flesh would attach you to everything here.<a name=36:7></a> You become conscious of the urgent necessity that every moral tie should be broken; you have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, and then you prove the mighty power of the Holy Spirit, by which you are formed in everything that is after God.<a name=36:8></a> You partake morally of Christ.<a name=36:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more, to refer again to the covenant.<a name=36:10></a> In <i>Christ</i> you get the good of every preceding covenant -- you get circumcision.<a name=36:11></a> You may not get the good of every covenant in the letter of it, but you get the spirit of it.<a name=36:12></a> In the new covenant you get the circumcision of Christ.<a name=36:13></a> So as to the covenant of law with Israel, we get the good of it, for "the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit".<a name=36:14></a> You get too all the good that Israel should have had in the coming and presence of Christ here.<a name=36:15></a> You are in the favour in which He is -- "peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=36:16></a> At the same time we have "access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=36:17></a> You stand in divine favour.<a name=36:18></a> "As he is, so

		are we in this world".<a name=37:1></a> Thus you get the good of every preceding covenant; and to go back, as the Galatians were doing, to the form of some previous covenant, is really apostasy from the truth.<a name=37:2></a> I see cases of departure from us now, people leaving us, and going away from the light which they have been brought into, to something out of which they had come, to what is set up after the terms of another covenant, and that really means apostasy from the light.<a name=37:3></a> I pray God to preserve every soul from it.<a name=37:4></a> We are brought into the light and pleasure of God, and we ought to understand the terms on which it pleases God to be with us.<a name=37:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I touch on one other point.<a name=37:6></a> We read, "He hath made him sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him".<a name=37:7></a> That is, that we should be the eternal witness of the righteousness and consistency of God.<a name=37:8></a> There was in the cross the perfect solution of every moral question, and the reconciliation of love and righteousness.<a name=37:9></a> We are, in virtue of it, the objects of God's love, and at the same time the witness of His righteousness.<a name=37:10></a> If you want to learn great and eternal lessons, there is one point where you learn them, and that is in the <i>death of Christ</i>.<a name=37:11></a>

		CHRIST AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a little striking to see how simply you can read in the Old Testament the history of Christ.<a name=69:1></a> I quite admit that if we had not the light of the New Testament we should not have seen this; but having it, we can enter very simply into the way in which the Spirit of God has developed in the Old Testament the truth in regard to Christ.<a name=69:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know anything more interesting in the study of the Psalms than the apprehension of Christ in them, and indeed, as has been said, this is the great interest in the whole of Scripture.<a name=69:3></a> We read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>, "the Lord is that Spirit", that is, of Scripture, and the consequence is that we have now in that way the key to all Scripture.<a name=69:4></a> I think the writers of the Old Testament Scriptures had not that key; though holy men of old spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, they scarcely had the key to the understanding of them.<a name=69:5></a> But when you have the key, then Scripture becomes a completely new book.<a name=69:6></a> That is true of Scripture from beginning to end.<a name=69:7></a> When you apprehend that the Lord is the spirit of Scripture, you learn to draw in your mind a distinction between the spirit and the letter, though the letter is perfect and cannot be infringed in any way; but the one great point in reading any part of Scripture, the Old Testament as well as the New, is to apprehend that the Lord is the Spirit of the word.<a name=69:8></a> It would not be at all difficult to make plain, and in whatever part of Scripture you like to read, from beginning to end, you will find it is so; the Psalms, the Prophets, all are full of Christ, all prove that He is the Spirit of the word.<a name=69:9></a> The book of Leviticus would be a dull book in itself without interest, but when you really apprehend the Spirit of Scripture, then Leviticus becomes a book of the deepest interest.<a name=69:10></a> And in this connection I will allude to one

		point; when God set to work to lay down injunctions in regard to the system of sacrifices, He began with the burnt-offering, not with the sin-offering.<a name=70:1></a> It is a great point to see that God speaks of things from His height.<a name=70:2></a> He speaks from the height of the burnt-offering, and then comes down to the other offerings, until eventually He reaches the sin and trespass-offerings.<a name=70:3></a> In the presentation of the offerings all spoke of Christ, and all showed that God would be completely glorified in the place of death by His offering.<a name=70:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other things to which I might refer if necessary to prove the point that the Lord is the Spirit of all Scripture.<a name=70:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, my object in speaking to you is, that you should be able to get a true judgment of things; and I am perfectly confident of this, that we can only get a true judgment as the eye is attracted to the right hand of God; and, further, to the One who is at the right hand of God.<a name=70:6></a> It has often been said, that the right hand of God is the point of interest for the saints, because everything for God, and that is according to God, will surely come forth from the right hand of God; Christ is sitting there; and will sit there only till His enemies are made His footstool.<a name=70:7></a> And therefore the right hand of God must of necessity be the point of interest for the minds of the saints.<a name=70:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot tell what is going to happen from looking at events in the world.<a name=70:9></a> It is impossible to forecast in that way, for when everything is to take place according to God, the first movement will be from the right hand of God.<a name=70:10></a> It will be a great moment for this world when Christ rises from the right hand of God.<a name=70:11></a> He does not sit there for ever.<a name=70:12></a> He sits now on the Father's throne, but the day will come when He will rise and sit on His own throne.<a name=70:13></a> We learn that from the book of Revelation, and there we may see the tremendous changes that will take place when He rises from the right hand of God.<a name=70:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I take up these three psalms.<a name=71:1></a> First, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>, as presenting to us remarkably the sufferings of the One now at the right hand of God.<a name=71:2></a> There you will find that He particularly refers everything to Jehovah.<a name=71:3></a> He says, "He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days".<a name=71:4></a> The Lord does not take up what He passes through as the act of men, He receives all as from God.<a name=71:5></a> It came to pass in the government of God, in connection with His ways as to Messiah and Israel.<a name=71:6></a> The fact is very simple to understand; it was impossible for God to bring in blessing for Israel in connection with Christ after the flesh.<a name=71:7></a> When brought in for Israel it must be in life with Christ; and though cut off as Messiah, God gave Him in resurrection length of days even for evermore.<a name=71:8></a> So that now He is a priest for ever after the power of an endless life.<a name=71:9></a> That is the great thought in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>, and it stands good for Israel.<a name=71:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point is that He gets compensation.<a name=71:11></a> The answer of Jehovah is the full recognition of Him as Creator.<a name=71:12></a> "Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands".<a name=71:13></a> We should never have known that it was Christ who was referred to but for the light of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>.<a name=71:14></a> It was really Jehovah's answer, the full recognition that the One cut off down here was the Creator of all things; and while everything created will pass away, He remains.<a name=71:15></a> "Thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail".<a name=71:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is an immense point if we apprehend that the One who suffered here on earth is really the Creator of all things.<a name=71:17></a> It would alter our sense of everything here if we were conscious that all things were created by Christ, and without Him was not anything made that was made.<a name=71:18></a> Thus, "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not".<a name=71:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Creator came here, came into man's condition, and His strength was weakened, and His days shortened.<a name=72:1></a> I believe we have to bear in mind, and the fact still stands good, that the Creator has been here in the midst of the world, that Christ has suffered here, His strength was weakened and His days shortened; and when all that has come to pass in this world, what can be the moral value of the world in the eye of God?<a name=72:2></a> And if we understand this, if it comes home to us at all by the grace of God, it must have a profound effect upon us.<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we pass on to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, and here we have another side, the Jehovah side: here Christ's enemies are to be made His footstool; a very different thought.<a name=72:4></a> It is no longer Christ suffering here, and His days shortened, but it is the One who has been received with acclamation at the right hand of God.<a name=72:5></a> That is the thought that comes out there, a thought of the greatest import to us.<a name=72:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We pass on now to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>before dwelling in detail on <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#102">Psalm  102</a>.<a name=72:7></a> Here we find Christ received in the very city where He was once rejected.<a name=72:8></a> There the stone which the builders rejected is become the head stone of the corner.<a name=72:9></a> The time has come when they say, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=72:10></a> The Lord took up that expression when He came to Jerusalem for the last time, and said, "Ye shall not see my face until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=72:11></a> That completes the history of Christ as Messiah.<a name=72:12></a> He will come again to Jerusalem as Man, as Priest after the order of Melchisedec, and then will they say, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=72:13></a> He will be a Priest upon His throne.<a name=72:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may mention one more point in that connection; the Psalms really close with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>.<a name=72:15></a> All those that follow are supplementary, songs of degrees and praise psalms; but the five books of Psalms close with Psalm

		119.<a name=73:1></a> And you will find this a point of interest, for while <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>gives you the answer to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>gives the answer to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>.<a name=73:2></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>looks for the godly man, and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>you find him, the law being written on his heart.<a name=73:3></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>views Christ as rejected in Zion, and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118">Psalm  118</a>shows that He is received gladly in the very place where He was rejected.<a name=73:4></a> It is no longer the kings standing up, and the rulers rejecting Him, but they say, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=73:5></a> A mighty change has come to pass, and that brings home to us the completeness of the Psalms.<a name=73:6></a> The picture is dark enough in the beginning, but the close is very bright indeed.<a name=73:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>you have a godly company in whose heart the law is written, a people in that sense completely prepared for the Lord.<a name=73:8></a> Then you have also the question raised in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>answered in Christ being welcomed in the place where He was once rejected, and thus you see how you may read the history of Christ in the Psalms.<a name=73:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the point on our part is to share in the rejection of Christ.<a name=73:10></a> We often use Scripture expressions lightly, and without much understanding of their import.<a name=73:11></a> Take, for instance, such an expression as 'crucified and dead with Christ', do you understand the import of that expression?<a name=73:12></a> We are said to be crucified with Christ, but they will not have to be crucified in millennial times.<a name=73:13></a> There will be no reproach to bear then; Christ will have come again in glory; no going forth to meet Him then without the camp, bearing His reproach.<a name=73:14></a> Many expressions which are suitable to us will have no application to them; there will be no such thing as the fellowship of His death, dead with Him, and crucified with Him.<a name=73:15></a> These expressions are all right as to us now, but will have no place when Christ is here in glory.<a name=73:16></a> But the question I raise, and it is one proper to be raised, is how far are they real with us?<a name=73:17></a> We take up these expressions, but do they state what is really true in your souls?<a name=73:18></a> If you say, "I am crucified
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=74>[Page 74]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with Christ", does that express in your mind a sense of identification with Christ in His crucifixion?<a name=74:1></a> This is a point of great moment.<a name=74:2></a> If we go back to our baptism, we see there God setting forth His mind as to us, we are buried with Christ.<a name=74:3></a> A very long time commonly elapses between the baptism of people and their minds coming to the import of baptism.<a name=74:4></a> The import of baptism is that we are buried with Christ, but you have to come in mind to the reality that you are dead with Christ.<a name=74:5></a> If you have come to this, you discern the character of the scene in which Christ has been rejected.<a name=74:6></a> Christ came here in the perfect grace of God, and the world rejected Him, and the world thus manifested that they preferred Satan as its god and prince because he ministered to the lusts of men, and they had no room for the goodness and grace of God.<a name=74:7></a> Hence the true place of the Christian is crucified, dead, and buried with Christ.<a name=74:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then there is another side.<a name=74:9></a> If we have died with Him we shall also live with Him; we must look at the other side as well.<a name=74:10></a> There is the suffering side, but that means that you will have part with Him in glory when He comes again.<a name=74:11></a> In the place where He was rejected, the Church will come with Him, and participate in His glory when He comes to be glorified in His saints, and admired in all them that believe.<a name=74:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember that Christ will never come again in humiliation, never again be known as He was once known when here on earth; He will come again in glory to be glorified in His saints.<a name=74:13></a> The Church will be the vessel in which He will be admired; but at the present time He sits at the right hand of God, waiting until His enemies are made His footstool.<a name=74:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as thus exalted, He is saluted as High Priest after the order of Melchisedec, and my object is to show the import of that in connection with His presence at the right hand of God, and that His being made a priest thus is of the deepest import to us as Christians.<a name=74:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=75>[Page 75]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will refer to two or three passages in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=75:1></a> (See chapter 4: 14 - 16.<a name=75:2></a>) "Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<a name=75:3></a> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=75:4></a> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=75:5></a> I quite admit you do not get the actual expression here, 'the right hand of God', but the High Priest has passed through the heavens, like the high priest in Israel went through the holy place into the holiest of all.<a name=75:6></a> Thus we have a great High Priest passed through the heavens, gone to the right hand of God, I do not doubt at all, to establish there the throne of grace.<a name=75:7></a> That was the effect of His going to the right hand of God.<a name=75:8></a> Then He is also Priest; you get the thought of the throne of grace in the fact of Jesus being crowned with glory and honour, and this is the basis of the world to come.<a name=75:9></a> The principle of the world to come will be the rule of grace, and Christ is gone to the right hand of God to establish the rule of grace.<a name=75:10></a> He is a Priest there, and what hangs on that is, He is our representative.<a name=75:11></a> The instant you have the idea of a priest, He is representative, and if He is not representative, He is not a priest.<a name=75:12></a> Christ is thus very much like Aaron was on the behalf of the children of Israel.<a name=75:13></a> God took a distinguished man, the next to Moses, and made him the representative of the people.<a name=75:14></a> Moses was hardly the representative of the people He was much more the representative of God, as Aaron was the representative of the people with God.<a name=75:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thought connected with the priesthood is that Christ, as representative of the people, is sympathetic; "we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities".<a name=75:16></a> As representative of us at the right hand of God, He is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=76>[Page 76]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sympathetic with us down here.<a name=76:1></a> Now, saints enter into that thought but poorly.<a name=76:2></a> In the various pressures under which people suffer from various causes, such as sickness, bereavement, and other trying circumstances, there is a sense of need of sympathy, and therefore it is a great thing to see that the High Priest is sympathetic; and if you understand the force and meaning of that, if you have a sense of what the High Priest is, as representative at the right hand of God, but also sympathetic here, you will find that it bridges entirely the distance between you and God; and in consequence of it you are admonished to "come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=76:3></a> Mercy and grace are very great realities to faith.<a name=76:4></a> We not only obtain mercy, but find grace.<a name=76:5></a> Mercy is a less important thing than grace, but we obtain both.<a name=76:6></a> It is mercy as to the without, and grace as to the within.<a name=76:7></a> You avail yourself of the dominion of grace, to obtain mercy, and grace for the time of need.<a name=76:8></a> The kingdom is established in the Person of Christ, at the right hand of God, crowned with glory and honour, and the Priest who is ordained to be our representative is sympathetic, and the reign of grace stands good to you and me.<a name=76:9></a> It is blessed to think that not simply the throne of grace subsists, but that you are encouraged by the Spirit of God to come boldly to that throne.<a name=76:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the sense of this we should never faint under difficulties here.<a name=76:11></a> They may be very real, and appear overwhelming, but the throne of grace subsists, and you are encouraged to come boldly in every time of need.<a name=76:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will turn now for a moment to the next chapter.<a name=76:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:9">Hebrews  5:9</a>, 10.<a name=76:14></a>) "And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=76:15></a> Christ has become the Author of eternal salvation, and that is in virtue of His work.<a name=76:16></a> It

		is not a question here of temporal deliverance, but of eternal salvation to all them that obey Him.<a name=77:1></a> Salvation is brought to pass, I do not doubt accomplished in the death of Christ.<a name=77:2></a> I believe that every enemy was vanquished in the death of Christ, and He has become thus the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey Him.<a name=77:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we may stand here in this world in the blessed reality of salvation, with the helmet of salvation on our head because salvation is accomplished.<a name=77:4></a> There is no reason that I know of why a saint should not stand here at liberty from the power of the world, and sin, and Satan, because Christ has become to him the Author of eternal salvation.<a name=77:5></a> He has vanquished every foe, there is not a power left, for He has vanquished all in His death.<a name=77:6></a> The first point is, you are brought into the kingdom, under the sway of His grace; but the deliverance is, that you are set free from the authority of all against God.<a name=77:7></a> Christians who are worldly really do not understand grace.<a name=77:8></a> If they understood the sway of grace, they would not be overcome by the world, Satan, or sin.<a name=77:9></a> If they are overcome there is not a real enjoyment of the good of grace, they are not in the benefit and blessing of the grace of God.<a name=77:10></a> The very teaching of grace is that, having denied "ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=77:11></a> That is the attitude of the Christian under the influence and power of grace; he is delivered from the present course of things, and learns how to live soberly in this age.<a name=77:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:19">Hebrews  6:19</a>, "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=77:13></a>

		Now, just group these three passages together.<a name=78:4></a> I do not say that the presence of Christ at the right hand of God brings in the idea of a forerunner, but the presence of Christ in heaven does.<a name=78:5></a> You and I are not to sit at the right hand of God, but we are going to be in heaven.<a name=78:6></a> Christ has entered as Forerunner and we follow.<a name=78:7></a> If He is Forerunner, He is the first of a company going to have a place in heaven, and the practical result is that we have a hope in heaven, for Christ is our hope.<a name=78:8></a> I can contemplate Christ at the right hand of God with the consciousness that I have a hope in heaven.<a name=78:9></a> My hope is not of blessing on earth, but that He is going to receive us to Himself, that where He is we may be also; and the practical working of that you get in the next chapter.<a name=78:10></a> By the which "we draw nigh unto God".<a name=78:11></a> The whole legal system is set aside, a better hope has been introduced, and the working of that hope is in our drawing nigh to God.<a name=78:12></a> If conscious of having a place in heaven, and you have, if Christ is gone there as Forerunner, by that hope you draw nigh to God; and the more conscious you are of that place in heaven the more readily you draw nigh to God.<a name=78:13></a> You have every confidence in God, and are going to spend eternity there with Him, in this love, and it must be by that hope that we draw nigh to God.<a name=78:14></a> With the levitical system people could never draw nigh to

		One point more, Christ is the "minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man".<a name=79:5></a> He takes up the position typified by Aaron in his charge of the holy places.<a name=79:6></a> And He has something to offer, He offers the two wave-loaves, the consecrated company as presented by Him to God on the day of Pentecost.<a name=79:7></a> The wave-sheaf was offered on one day, and fifty days after was the presentation of the two wave-loaves, that is the Church in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=79:8></a> He has something to offer as being Minister of the sanctuary.<a name=79:9></a> If you asked me to define it I should have some difficulty, but Christ is Minister of it.<a name=79:10></a> There is a real and true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man.<a name=79:11></a> The fact is this, all difficulties in regard to the work and service of God disappear as you enter into the blessed fact of God revealed in the death of Christ; and our approach to God is the necessary result of the sense in our souls of what God has revealed of Himself in that death.<a name=79:12></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:11">Hebrews  10:11</a>, "And every priest standeth daily ministering and.<a name=79:13></a> offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool".<a name=79:14></a> That brings out a very important thought of the grace of Christ.<a name=79:15></a> He would not go up on high until every jot and tittle of the work was done; and now He sits at the right hand of God, the proof that all is done.<a name=79:16></a> "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are

		It is a great thing to apprehend that there is on the earth the family, or the offspring, I might say, of God: that is, in a moral sense.<a name=83:1></a> There is a race here which has derived its moral being from God and the description of it is exceedingly simple: it occurs in the expression, "Which were .<a name=83:2></a>.<a name=83:3></a>.<a name=83:4></a> born of God".<a name=83:5></a> What marks them we shall see further on.<a name=83:6></a> I am going to take up the marks of this family or offspring of God; but first of all I want you to get the idea of their having derived, one and all of them, their moral being directly from God.<a name=83:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not as in the case of descendants of Adam.<a name=83:8></a> No one of us came directly from Adam.<a name=83:9></a> He begat a son in his own likeness, but there has been a good number of generations between Adam and ourselves, and therefore it is impossible for any one to claim descent directly from him.<a name=83:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the offspring of God every member of that family has derived his moral being <i>directly</i> from God; and as I said the Scriptural description of them is, "Born of God".<a name=83:11></a> I purpose to dwell a little upon that now and to show how it has come to pass, and to point out the characteristics of this family who are born of God; and another point comes out in the closing chapter, namely, the witness of God.<a name=83:12></a> The witness is that God has given to us eternal life in His Son; thus God has given distinct witness concerning His Son, and it lies in that we are brought into the reality of eternal life.<a name=83:13></a> We have believed the witness that God has given of His Son and He that hath the Son hath life; we have come to the point, "These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God".<a name=83:14></a>

		<a name=84>[Page 84]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My first point in regard of the race or family spoken of in Scripture as born of God, who partake morally of God's nature, is this: that all is entirely dependent on the truth; that is, that it has pleased God to reveal Himself.<a name=84:1></a> Christianity is entirely based on the revelation of God.<a name=84:2></a> It has been said that really everything hangs on the Word having become flesh, so that God might be declared.<a name=84:3></a> All that you get here is necessarily consequent upon God being perfectly and fully revealed.<a name=84:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that you have the full light of God coming out in the death of Christ you have the expression, "born of God;" but there was not, nor could be, any such expression until God was revealed.<a name=84:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look at natural things for a moment, they furnish an illustration of divine things.<a name=84:6></a> When a child is born, it has derived its physical being from its parents, but as yet it has not derived any <i>moral</i> being from them.<a name=84:7></a> Where it derives its moral being from its parents is in growing up in the enjoyment of the affection of its parents.<a name=84:8></a> As it grows up it becomes acquainted with the tenderness and affection of its parents; it is brought consciously into the scene and system of natural affections, and by-and-by it becomes intelligent as to things, and the effect is, that it has become partaker of a moral being from its parents.<a name=84:9></a> Like parent like child, in a sense.<a name=84:10></a> If there were nothing to hinder, and the child brought up in that way in the light of love, I have no doubt but that the child would grow up responsive to the thought of love.<a name=84:11></a> It would grow up intelligent, entering into the thought of the parents, and into the affection which had been lavished upon it from its birth.<a name=84:12></a> I am speaking for the moment apart from the question of sin.<a name=84:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to divine things it is very important that we should get away from material ideas.<a name=84:14></a> You must remember that many terms which are employed in Scripture are really used as figures.<a name=84:15></a> Born again, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		so on, are figures which are employed by the Spirit of God to convey to our minds a moral idea.<a name=85:1></a> The moral idea connected with being born is, that you have derived a moral being directly from God; as a child when it has become intelligent, when its mind is expanded, understands that it has a moral being as well as a physical one.<a name=85:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If everything went right in natural things a child should be like its parents morally and not simply physically.<a name=85:3></a> There are often defects in dealing with a child; it takes a good deal of patience if the child is to answer to the affections of the parents, and to partake morally of the being of its parents.<a name=85:4></a> Of course we have to remember that man is fallen, and there is likely to be a great deal of difficulty and defect in dealing with children.<a name=85:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Animals derive instinct from their parents, but with man there is the great point of <i>intelligent</i> affection.<a name=85:6></a> There is the intelligence which can take in the mind and thought of another, there is the power of intellect and at the same time there is an answer to the affection of the parents.<a name=85:7></a> So it is with us.<a name=85:8></a> The moment you got your moral being from God was when you were brought into the light of God.<a name=85:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Born again", is an expression used to show that you cannot touch the kingdom of God without it.<a name=85:10></a> But never could a person be born of God unless that person had touched the reality of divine love.<a name=85:11></a> You must appreciate the testimony of the death of Christ, that it is on the part of God the setting forth of the greatness of His love to man.<a name=85:12></a> "God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=85:13></a> When that comes home to the heart of the Christian, then it is that the love of God is shed abroad in the heart.<a name=85:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is that our hearts are brought into the presence of divine love, and there we touch the divine nature and become responsive to it.<a name=85:15></a> We love God because He

		first loved us.<a name=86:1></a> That is the effect and result to us of God having been fully revealed.<a name=86:2></a> When man first comes to know about God, the great thing is His attitude.<a name=86:3></a> That is the first point apprehended as the fruit of receiving the gospel, and consequent on it the Holy Spirit is received.<a name=86:4></a> Then you begin to see what is behind the attitude of God; you get an insight into the heart of God; and being thus brought into the presence of God's love you respond to it.<a name=86:5></a> If you say you love God, then I say you are born of God.<a name=86:6></a> One proof of being born of God, is that we love God.<a name=86:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing for a man to be brought into the light of the love of God.<a name=86:8></a> The death of Christ is to the Christian full of light.<a name=86:9></a> The veil of the temple was rent in twain at His death, and it is the death of Christ that makes known the love of God.<a name=86:10></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=86:11></a> I know no lesson, for the believer, like this, to be learned in the cross of Christ.<a name=86:12></a> Get your eye there, and learn there the lesson of the love of God.<a name=86:13></a> The moment you touch His love you are responsive to it, and can say that you are born of God.<a name=86:14></a> You have derived your moral being from the blessed God as revealed.<a name=86:15></a> Had He not revealed Himself, it could not have been the case; but He is now the source of your moral being, so that you are of the offspring, the family of God.<a name=86:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to look at the marks of one who is born of God.<a name=86:17></a> The first is, "If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him".<a name=86:18></a> And again, "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God".<a name=86:19></a> Now put these two verses together.<a name=86:20></a> On the one hand there is the practising of righteousness, and on the other, one does not commit sin.<a name=86:21></a> Read further chapter 4: 7, "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God".<a name=87:1></a> The one born of God loves.<a name=87:2></a> In chapter 5: 1 we have, "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him".<a name=87:3></a> Here we have the heart going out and recognising those who are born of God.<a name=87:4></a> Still further in verse 4, "For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world".<a name=87:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first two expressions are essentially moral.<a name=87:6></a> One who is born of God practises righteousness and does not practise sin.<a name=87:7></a> Sin is lawlessness.<a name=87:8></a> One born of God walks here in self-judgment.<a name=87:9></a> No only does the Christian carry out the practice of righteousness, but he refuses to admit, or sanction, in himself that which God has condemned in the death of Christ.<a name=87:10></a> The evidence of a Christian is that he carries out practical righteousness.<a name=87:11></a> If you find a professed Christian allowing the flesh and other things in his practice and ways down here, which God has condemned, you have very little practical proof that he is a Christian.<a name=87:12></a> It is difficult in these days to trust profession; you want practice to witness to such, and this comes out in the way of practical righteousness on the one hand and the disallowance of lawlessness on the other.<a name=87:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible for one born of God to practise lawlessness; he cannot sin because he is born of God.<a name=87:14></a> These verses do not speak of isolated acts, but of the practice which characterises the Christian.<a name=87:15></a> They indicate marks important for us to bear here in the midst of a world full of lawlessness and unrighteousness.<a name=87:16></a> It is the first principle of one born of God that he walks in righteousness.<a name=87:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is obligation to God, and you begin to carry that out in the practice of righteousness.<a name=87:18></a> You find that things here are inconsistent with the love of God as He has revealed Himself.<a name=87:19></a> You discover by the light into which God has brought you many things which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to the next evidence of being born of God, and that is "love".<a name=88:5></a> Every one can say that he partakes of the divine nature if he loves.<a name=88:6></a> You cannot know the love of God without being responsive to it.<a name=88:7></a> It is not simply by doctrine that love is revealed to us.<a name=88:8></a> God has sent His Son who has died, and that is the witness of the love of God; and the word to us is, "Let us not love in word .<a name=88:9></a>.<a name=88:10></a>.<a name=88:11></a> but in deed and in truth".<a name=88:12></a> God has proved His love in deed and truth towards us.<a name=88:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I may use the expression, the Christian first touches the spring of love by the power of the Holy Spirit, and now he loves God and knows God.<a name=88:14></a> Then another point comes out, he discerns those who are born of God.<a name=88:15></a> Every one who believes Jesus to be the Christ is born of God.<a name=88:16></a> I think that love brings very great enlargement, and that is the point; it brings discernment and enlargement to comprehend all those who are God's children, and there is the desire to take in all, and that is a great point for us.<a name=88:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There may be many in London, many in the world, who believe Jesus to be the Christ, who have a reverence for the word of God, and does your heart take them all in?<a name=88:18></a> You may not compass them in knowledge, but, at all events, your heart may take them in because the great principle is, "him that loveth every one that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him".<a name=88:19></a> Practically things work as you get them put in this epistle.<a name=88:20></a> You come into the full light of divine love and you love God, then you love all those who are begotten of God.<a name=88:21></a> Then we come to another point; you overcome the world.<a name=88:22></a> If you love God love will not tolerate lust; they do not go together.<a name=88:23></a> In natural things you cannot mix oil with water, and lust does not tolerate love.<a name=88:24></a> All that is in

		Do you mean to tell me that a man who loves his family can be a drunkard?<a name=89:5></a> It is poor love where a man, to gratify his own lust, brings his family to poverty.<a name=89:6></a> You would not commend that man to me for natural love.<a name=89:7></a> If that man loved his family as he should he would not bring them to poverty and ruin in order to satisfy his own lusts.<a name=89:8></a> Lust is intolerable to love, and a man does not overcome the world in any other way than by love.<a name=89:9></a> A man might retire from the world and become a monk or an ascetic, or something of the sort, but he would carry the world into his retreat, he could not be free from it.<a name=89:10></a>

		There is a class of people in the present day (I think they are contemplated in Scripture) unwilling, in a certain sense, to give up the truth of Christianity, but who at the same time subject Scripture to a treatment which is entirely unwarrantable, and practically a denial of its being the word of God.<a name=93:1></a> It is all very well to accept simply the facts which are related in Scripture, but the facts related form a very small part of Scripture.<a name=93:2></a> We get a great many things related, and the relation of facts may be called in a sense history, but history forms a very small part indeed of Scripture.<a name=93:3></a> The bulk of Scripture is the revelation of the thought and feeling of God in regard to things down here.<a name=93:4></a> The impression Scripture makes upon any one accustomed to study it is, that it speaks of a living God.<a name=93:5></a> And when I refer to a living God, what I mean is this: a God who has His mind and feeling in regard to everything that is transpiring down here.<a name=93:6></a> If I might use the expression, He is affected by it.<a name=93:7></a> I do not mean affected in the way in which we are, but He <i>is</i> affected by things here.<a name=93:8></a> You get the expression in Genesis that He repented that He had made man; and such a thought is presented in Scripture as that He is afflicted in the afflictions of His people; and many another thought of the same description, all of which bring before your minds the idea of a living God -- that is, a God of feeling, and of purpose too.<a name=93:9></a> It is this idea which Scripture forms in you in regard to God.<a name=93:10></a> I feel it more and more for myself; as I go to Scripture I become increasingly conscious in my soul of being brought into the presence of a living God, while conscious also that it describes a succession of generations of dying men down here; one generation passes off the scene and another appears,

		Many very blessed and glorious thoughts are presented to us in the Old Testament, but they could not be fulfilled at the time: they had to wait for the Man of God's counsels before they could be fulfilled.<a name=95:13></a> What

		is lacking in the Old Testament is the Man.<a name=96:1></a> God was testing man in a variety of ways, but the Man of God's counsels was not here; so whatever might be the thoughts presented in the Old Testament, they had to wait for the Man in whom those counsels and thoughts could have their fulfilment.<a name=96:2></a> In the New Testament, the change is this; you have the Man.<a name=96:3></a> You will remember what the angels announced to the shepherds at the birth of Christ, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men".<a name=96:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are just three thoughts that I will refer to in the passage.<a name=96:5></a> The first is in verse 5: "And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength"; that is one thought.<a name=96:6></a> The next is in verse 6: "And [Jehovah] said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth".<a name=96:7></a> Now I read the verse in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>to show that Paul takes up that thought, and connects it with his testimony.<a name=96:8></a> That is, he turns away there from the Jew, and quotes this passage to show that God had accomplished the thought in it.<a name=96:9></a> That is, that Christ who had been rejected on the part of the Jew was set for a light to the Gentiles.<a name=96:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is still a third thought, and that comes out in verse 8: "Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee:" that is quoted in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6">2 Corinthians  6</a>as having its application to the present time.<a name=96:11></a> The apostle says there, "Now is the accepted time; behold now is the day of salvation".<a name=96:12></a> I do not doubt that the strict application of the passage is yet future, but a present application is given by the apostle Paul in writing to the Corinthians.<a name=96:13></a>

		It is those thoughts that I want to dwell upon.<a name=97:1></a> To enlarge a little upon the thought of Christ being set a light to the Gentiles; I want to make plain to you what that means.<a name=97:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>we see what, properly speaking, Christ is to His people; that is, God had raised up among His people a "horn of salvation", and John the Baptist was to give the knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of sins.<a name=97:3></a> That is what Christ has now brought to the Gentiles; He has brought the salvation of God to the Gentiles.<a name=97:4></a> The word was turned away from by the Jew and was addressed to the Gentiles, and they heard it.<a name=97:5></a> I shall go a little further to show you what the object of the salvation was.<a name=97:6></a> The object was that they might come into the divine thought, and that was eternal life: "As many as were ordained to eternal life believed".<a name=97:7></a> They were to be brought into the thought of God about them.<a name=97:8></a> Salvation was sent to them to that end.<a name=97:9></a> The salvation which properly belonged to the Jew, according to the song of Zacharias, went out, according to the prophecy of Isaiah, to the Gentiles -- "It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth".<a name=97:10></a> The point is this, that Christ takes the place of the servant of Jehovah here; He in that sense supersedes Israel.<a name=97:11></a> Israel had that place in regard to Jehovah, they were His witness and His servants.<a name=97:12></a> Christ comes in and takes that place.<a name=97:13></a> You will find that principle prevailing through Matthew; Christ takes the place of Jehovah's servant, so that eventually the remnant of Israel may come again into the place of Jehovah's servant.<a name=97:14></a> Properly speaking His service was to bring back to God the tribes of Israel.<a name=97:15></a> The tribes of Israel were lost, but Christ came to restore them; but instead of being received and welcomed here, He was rejected on the part of His people; and therefore Christ has to accomplish Jehovah's will.<a name=97:16></a>

		What marks the present time is this, He says, "yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, and my God shall be my strength".<a name=98:7></a> He is glorious in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=98:8></a> The Lord says, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=98:9></a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him".<a name=98:10></a> Christ might be despised (as He was despised in the eyes of the people), but He is now glorious in the eyes of Jehovah.<a name=98:11></a> Do you think there was ever a moment when Christ was so glorious in the eyes of Jehovah as when He suffered on the cross?<a name=98:12></a> That was the moment of glory, though put to shame on the part of man here.<a name=98:13></a> He was glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, and His God would be His strength; and the supreme moment of that was the cross.<a name=98:14></a> You have to estimate things morally.<a name=98:15></a> If you look at things outwardly, it was the moment of His shame and reproach; but if you look at things morally it was the moment of His glory.<a name=98:16></a> He was glorious in the eyes of Jehovah at the moment of His shame and ignominy.<a name=98:17></a> He glorified God in the place of man's dishonour.<a name=98:18></a> That same language ought to have its

		What I see is this (may God give me to make it plain), Christ is salvation to the Gentiles because the kingdom is established in His hands.<a name=99:8></a> The moment the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ is presented to man, the kingdom is presented because the kingdom has its expression and seat in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God; and the kingdom is preached that men may come under the sway of grace; and that being under the sway of grace, they may be brought into the knowledge of salvation.<a name=99:9></a> No one ever came to the knowledge of salvation in any other way.<a name=99:10></a> I am confident that it is in being brought under the moral sway of God as presented in the Lord Jesus Christ that you and I get salvation.<a name=99:11></a> It is a great thing to be brought under the moral sway of God; to know that God has pleasure in grace; that He has pleasure in accounting us righteous.<a name=99:12></a> His attitude toward man is grace, and nought else.<a name=99:13></a> "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men".<a name=99:14></a> It is the one important point for us

		It was proposed to read Mark's gospel.<a name=108:1></a> We might consider the first three chapters this morning.<a name=108:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The beginning of this gospel does not take any dispensational character, but is occupied with the moral condition of the people in which the testimony of God was rendered.<a name=108:3></a> That is, what it opens with is the wilderness condition of things with the people of God.<a name=108:4></a> John's testimony is the "Voice of one crying in the wilderness", and the Lord was driven into the wilderness by the Spirit, where He met the power of Satan before He began His ministry.<a name=108:5></a> There was the power of Satan to be met, and the moral state of things in regard to the people.<a name=108:6></a> Then you have the testimony of God in the vessel which was suitable in the midst of that state of things.<a name=108:7></a> It is of all importance for us to apprehend the state of things in which the testimony of God is rendered.<a name=108:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In John's baptism, God opened a door out of this state of things.<a name=108:9></a> Through repentance He opened a door for the escape of the people from the condition of things into which they had got.<a name=108:10></a> Repentance was the testimony of God by John, with a view to their deliverance from this wilderness condition, and from the power of Satan through believing the testimony of the Son of God.<a name=108:11></a> He alone could be the competent vessel of the testimony of God's gospel in the midst of evil.<a name=108:12></a>

		The preaching of the baptism of repentance was God opening the door for the people that were in this wilderness condition.<a name=108:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes.<a name=109:4></a> John's preaching was more the door out, and that was the real difficulty with them.<a name=109:5></a> What is very remarkable, is that all had to go down to Jordan to be baptised.<a name=109:6></a> John did not go to one place to preach and baptise, then to another place to preach and baptise, but all had to go out to Jordan <i>to him</i>.<a name=109:7></a> It is going out that tests us.<a name=109:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the mercy of God that opened the way out.<a name=109:9></a> So John's testimony was the first work in the remnant.<a name=109:10></a>

		No one was fully competent to be the servant but the Son of God.<a name=109:11></a> Nobody could really come into a world of sin and evil and be competent for God, either in the testimony of the gospel, or in power, but the Son of God.<a name=109:12></a> He was the only One who could bring in the light of God.<a name=109:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the wilderness condition, you get the nominal people of God really in that state.<a name=109:14></a> As to the Gentiles, there can be no question as to their state of alienation, but here you get the <i>people of God</i> not enjoying the promises and good things of God, that is morally a wilderness condition; and they had to go out to John in the wilderness to be baptised in Jordan.<a name=109:15></a> The great point was for them to admit their complete failure, and that they must go out.<a name=109:16></a> There was a new testimony coming in in the Son, not by Moses or the ministry of angels, but in the Son, the gospel of the kingdom of God, and if any in Israel, who had failed entirely to inherit the land, were to get a place in the kingdom they must go out.<a name=109:17></a> In fact, the remnant had been brought back from Babylon in order that Messiah might be presented to them.<a name=109:18></a> The poor understood it very well, they went out and were baptised of John.<a name=109:19></a> The poor were those who felt their need and the misery of the state of things around them.<a name=109:20></a>

		chapters give us the ministry of the Lord in connection with the state of things in Israel.<a name=111:1></a> In chapter 4 the Lord goes out by the seashore, that is, the testimony goes out wider.<a name=111:2></a> He had preached in their towns, as He said "Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for therefore came I forth".<a name=111:3></a> He was really sowing, but in <i>their</i> synagogues.<a name=111:4></a> Then in chapter 4 He goes out by the seaside -- an intimation that the word of the kingdom would go out wider.<a name=111:5></a> In the working of miracles He brings in the power of the kingdom, but it was in connection with Israel especially.<a name=111:6></a> What comes out too in these three chapters is, that the mission of the Lord is not at all favoured by the rulers and heads of Israel.<a name=111:7></a> When He speaks of forgiving sins, they question it at once.<a name=111:8></a> There was no reception of the Lord at all with them, but He goes on nevertheless.<a name=111:9></a> He cures the leper and tells him to go and show himself to the priest.<a name=111:10></a> It was a testimony to them that their God was there; also the palsied man He forgives and heals, and tells him to go to his house; thus showing that Jehovah their Healer was among them.<a name=111:11></a> Then He sovereignly called Levi, and this brings out the fact that He was calling sinners.<a name=111:12></a> The scribes and Pharisees would not own these ways of grace to sinners.<a name=111:13></a> They had no heart for Him who came here in grace; they said, "Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?<a name=111:14></a>" and, finally, they attributed the power by which He wrought the miracles to Beelzebub, whereupon the Lord disowns His connection with Israel.<a name=111:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We first find in this gospel the Lord in relation to the Father, then He goes into the wilderness and there binds the strong man, and then spoils his goods.<a name=111:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is your thought that we have here a moral wilderness?<a name=111:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes.<a name=111:18></a> But His place with the Father is declared, and consequently the light of God revealed in Him was here in the scene of man's sin and misery.<a name=111:19></a> A voice out of heaven came to Him.<a name=111:20></a> Heaven could look down

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then further, what you get here is that in the world there is Satan to be met, and in two ways.<a name=112:4></a> It is noted here that Christ was with the wild beasts which represent the ravening power of evil; this we see in Herod killing John.<a name=112:5></a> Herod represents the power of the Roman beast, but the first thing is, not his raging power, but the awful temptation of Satan.<a name=112:6></a> The Lord was tempted of Satan forty days.<a name=112:7></a> It was necessary that we should know the power of Satan, and that man is under it.<a name=112:8></a> The Lord had to meet it and overcome it for us.<a name=112:9></a> John said, "There cometh one mightier than I", and now the mightier is come and Satan bound; but besides this, John's testimony is, that He baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=112:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That goes beyond His ministry here.<a name=112:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It shows the power that had come in and it was in that power that He bound Satan.<a name=112:12></a> His bringing in the light of heaven and the testimony of God's love and goodness all depended upon His being the Son.<a name=112:13></a>

		God, and then (2) deliverance, as the effect of the testimony.<a name=116:1></a> Man is first delivered from the power of Satan, and then he finds everything under which he laboured in regard to God is removed; that is how the truth of the kingdom comes in.<a name=116:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the call of the fisherman, if the Lord calls a man to serve, the service, or rather the obligation of the service, is greater than any natural obligation.<a name=116:3></a> That is the salient point.<a name=116:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3, Jesus chooses twelve that they might be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach; what we have here is the right of God to call them, and the coming in of something entirely new.<a name=116:5></a> This is really the paramount claim of the Lord.<a name=116:6></a> It takes precedence with the one called over any other obligation.<a name=116:7></a>
	</div>

		The point here is really the <i>call</i>.<a name=116:8></a> In John's gospel you do not get the call into the new order of testimony.<a name=116:9></a> It is more internal relationships there.<a name=116:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of the leper was to the priests, the religious heads of the nation, that God was there, and there in grace.<a name=116:21></a> "I will, be thou clean", was the expression of divine power acting in compassion.<a name=116:22></a>

		In the early part of chapter 2 we see that the Lord would not conform to the ideas of man.<a name=117:11></a> He came in the power of divine righteousness, and could not, would not conform to their ideas.<a name=117:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see in the end of chapter 1 and beginning of chapter 2, the Lord met the actual state of things in Israel, but then in verses 13 and 14, He goes to the seaside and passes beyond the mere need of men, and calls a man to follow Him.<a name=117:13></a> He heals a leper and sends him to the priest, and He sends the palsied man home after forgiving and raising him up.<a name=117:14></a> Then He calls Levi clean away from everything in Israel to follow Him.<a name=117:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the connection between chapters 4, 5, and 6?<a name=131:8></a> Would you give a sketch of this chapter?<a name=131:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter is, in a certain way, complete in itself.<a name=131:10></a> It gives the state of things in Israel in which the testimony of God was sent forth by the Lord.<a name=131:11></a> Previous to this we have had the Lord Himself sowing the seed, and dealing with individuals in delivering power; then in this chapter the disciples are sent out.<a name=131:12></a> But in the beginning of the chapter people are brought to a point, and they have to decide as to it.<a name=131:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Was what the Lord was doing the intervention of God?<a name=131:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It involved the question of who Christ was, and in a way this point comes in for all our souls.<a name=131:15></a> You have not merely to look at things in a human way as to the benefit you get, but, like the poor woman with the issue of blood, you have to know the Person you get it from.<a name=131:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord here sends forth His disciples, and no doubt a measure of notoriety was connected with their preaching.<a name=131:17></a> People took notice of them, and of what was being done by them, and that brings out the actual state of things in which their testimony was being carried out.<a name=131:18></a>

		in Mark is, that the Lord brings God into the whole scene of man's misery.<a name=132:1></a> You do not get details so much, nor their bearing in a dispensational way, but in the service of the Lord is seen God's way of dealing with man's ruin and misery, and with the state of things then prevailing.<a name=132:2></a> Hence in Him there is the testimony of what God is.<a name=132:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may see the misery of man and God coming in to meet it; but another thing is this, man being utterly ruined, God's heart of love moves for itself towards man, but it is with the object of producing a response in the heart of man to Himself, and God must begin and carry on that work.<a name=132:4></a> It is that God may be known in the soul, and that He may get a response to His love, but if He is to get a response it must be by His working in the soul to produce it.<a name=132:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mission of the disciples as looked at here, is wider than in Matthew.<a name=132:6></a> They preached that <i>men</i> should repent, but in Israel it takes the character of a final testimony which discovers the remnant, and if their testimony was not received, they were to shake off the dust under their feet for a testimony against them.<a name=132:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many years ago, Mr.<a name=132:8></a> Darby said, 'God commits everything to the responsibility of man, but He makes it good in a remnant;' that is what you get here.<a name=132:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What we find next is, the state of Israel, which is apostate.<a name=132:10></a> Herodias represents the apostate state of Israel: as you get in Isaiah, "Thou wentest to the king with ointment", etc.<a name=132:11></a> Now, you get the same principle in the church, it is united to the world, such is the state of things.<a name=132:12></a> Just as Jezebel moved Ahab to destroy the saints in that day, so it is with Herodias; and thus we come to the actual state of things in which the disciples' testimony was borne.<a name=132:13></a> Then the Lord takes His disciples apart privately into a desert place.<a name=132:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three reasons given for His going into the desert.<a name=132:15></a> In Matthew it is dispensational on account of the murder of His witness; in Mark it is on account of

		He then constrains the disciples to go to the other side, and they encounter the opposition of Satan, not now using the world power, but as prince of the power of the air.<a name=133:6></a> The Lord goes up into a mountain; there was intercession on high and that secures all.<a name=133:7></a> What you get specially in Mark is, that the Lord comes to them, for us it is what the Lord speaks of in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, "I will come to you".<a name=133:8></a> It is not Peter leaving the ship to go to Him, but the Lord coming to them in the midst of all that was contrary.<a name=133:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>you get the enmity of man and all the state of things here, and in chapter 14 you get the Lord on high.<a name=133:10></a> Everything is secured there, and we have a place there, but we get His help by the Spirit; we get assistance.<a name=133:11></a> He comes to us, and this we apprehend by the Spirit.<a name=133:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of chapter 6 it says, "And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them", but here at the close the Lord comes back, so to speak, into the world, and there is nothing but blessing.<a name=133:13></a> The point for us is to get to the Lord, to get with Him apart and learn His mind, then to be able to come out in ministry in the present state of things.<a name=133:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the one case you are affected by the unbelief of people: you would not be affected by the attitude of the heathen, they were readier to listen than the Jews were.<a name=134:7></a> The testimony of God is going on in the midst of a people professedly the people of God, but who are practically apostate from the truth; the consequence is you are not to be surprised if you meet with unbelief.<a name=134:8></a>

		In connection with the gospel of Mark we had better take up the three chapters in conjunction, 6, 7, 8.<a name=136:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may regard these three chapters as being the education of the apostles for their testimony.<a name=136:10></a> Their testimony in chapter 6 was final.<a name=136:11></a> John was killed, so that in that line of things it was very evident that nothing could come out, that is, with Christ after the flesh.<a name=136:12></a> Properly speaking, the apostles became really the continuation of Christ Himself, in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=136:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Why were the seventy sent out after the twelve?<a name=136:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That proved that the testimony was going out wider, but it did not in any way invalidate the testimony of the twelve.<a name=136:15></a> It was consequent upon Christ going into glory.<a name=136:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul very carefully identifies himself with the twelve, but there is also his own special testimony.<a name=136:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is his name with the twelve in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>?<a name=136:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No.<a name=136:19></a> When the twelve were preaching, Paul was persecuting.<a name=136:20></a> The heavenly city comes out on the basis of the twelve.<a name=136:21></a> Paul's testimony had another result in connection with the city from that of the twelve; it does not set aside the city in any way, but brings in another element in connection with the city.<a name=136:22></a>

		presence of the Holy Spirit is witness to it, but with regard to Paul's testimony the essence of it is that he develops what was here consequent upon the coming of the Holy Spirit.<a name=137:1></a> He brings out all the counsel of God in connection with the Son of God: all the counsel of God was brought out through the Holy Spirit being here.<a name=137:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John's testimony comes in more in connection with the Jew, to confirm what had come out by Paul.<a name=137:3></a> The effect of Paul's ministry is to carry the saints to heaven, whereas, John's brings God to the earth, and brings the city out of heaven.<a name=137:4></a>

		There is a thought abroad today that the bride is Israel.<a name=137:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very serious matter, because it brings in a divergence between the teaching of the twelve and Paul's teaching.<a name=137:8></a> Peter, Paul, and John all taught Christianity; they were working really to the same end; though they give different phases of the same thing, it is all to one end.<a name=137:9></a> It only betrays the very greatest ignorance to bring in a distinction in that way as to the work of the apostles.<a name=137:10></a>

		There is another thing, namely, the determined effort of Satan to lower the privileges of the saints in the present day, so that people may go on comfortably with the world.<a name=137:11></a> If we could but present Christ to souls, to get them delivered from the system around them things would become clear to them.<a name=137:12></a> They want their souls lifted <i>out</i> of the world.<a name=137:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important for us to see the place the Lord takes in these chapters.<a name=137:14></a> He is outside of everything political, the order of the world, in a wilderness (chapter 6).<a name=137:15></a> In the next, chapter 7, we have the ecclesiastical order, and we get the complete exposure of the whole system of ecclesiasticism.<a name=137:16></a> The Lord shows the principle at work.<a name=137:17></a>

		I proposed this scripture because it brings together the two thoughts of the kingdom and the house, and in a certain sense, connects them with the gospel.<a name=158:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What do you mean by "the house"?<a name=158:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is your idea of the kingdom the compulsion?<a name=158:9></a> Those who came to the supper are brought into the kingdom of course, but the point to which they are really brought is the house.<a name=158:10></a> It is by the reception of the kingdom that they are brought in.<a name=158:11></a>

		Would you just say something with regard to the great supper and its scope?<a name=160:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I have thought lately that the kingdom is really the celebration of righteousness.<a name=160:6></a> The kingdom was a moral necessity to God: and that brings in the great supper.<a name=160:7></a> The idea of the celebration brings in the thought of the great supper.<a name=160:8></a> In the Old Testament we read, "And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed".<a name=160:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:44">Daniel  2:44</a>) It is the statement of purpose; but in the New Testament the kingdom is a moral necessity.<a name=160:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By 'a moral necessity', do you mean the result of His revealing Himself?<a name=160:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not exactly -- it is consequent upon the accomplishment of righteousness.<a name=160:12></a> God cannot be silent in regard of righteousness when accomplished.<a name=160:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is the kingdom the result of Christ being crowned with glory and honour?<a name=160:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is that.<a name=160:15></a> The work accomplished was so great that it was entirely impossible for God to be silent about it, and it must be celebrated.<a name=160:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is the idea in it the complete clearing of the ground in righteousness, so that the whole scene may be filled by Christ?<a name=160:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, the glory is now at the right hand of God, but eventually it will fill the whole scene, and nothing short of that would be an answer to the cross.<a name=160:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the difference between this and the marriage of the king's son in chapter 22 of Matthew's gospel?<a name=160:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Simply that Luke takes the one side and Matthew the other side of the truth; Matthew is the side of profession, but the point of the passage here is the compulsion.<a name=160:20></a> The parable of the marriage supper
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=161>[Page 161]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		clearly presents profession, because you find a man there who had not on a wedding garment.<a name=161:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the point in both cases is the glory of Christ?<a name=161:2></a> The marriage supper refers, I think, to what is more personal to Christ, certain counsels that God had in mind to establish in His own Son.<a name=161:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of this accomplished righteousness would be the outflow of grace in the gospel?<a name=161:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This goes out in the testimony of resurrection.<a name=161:5></a> The glory is the celebration of righteousness, and consequent upon the glory the Holy Spirit has come down to bring souls into communion with the celebration above.<a name=161:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the things which hinder souls in that connection are the things which belong to this earth?<a name=161:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, and things too which are right in their place.<a name=161:8></a> They are harmless in their place; but things that are of God's providence may hinder a man, to the exclusion of the supper.<a name=161:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the Lord afterwards refers to natural relationships being real hindrances.<a name=161:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, because they come the closest home to us.<a name=161:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose the compulsion here is the result of the refusal on the part of those invited?<a name=161:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there a difference between the accomplishment of righteousness and the celebration of it?<a name=161:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes, in its accomplishment you have the full testimony of God's righteousness in the place of judgment; but the celebration of it is the delight, the acclamation with which Christ has been received on high.<a name=161:16></a> He is crowned with glory and honour, and a little further on in this gospel we find in view of this the disciples saying, "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=161:17></a> That is the celebration.<a name=161:18></a> The Holy Spirit has come down to bring us into the great supper.<a name=161:19></a>

		The testimony of accomplished righteousness was there before the Holy Spirit came.<a name=162:9></a> You get it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=162:10></a> Christ is risen and comes into the midst of His own with the word of peace; but then God will <i>exalt</i> Christ and consequent upon His exaltation the Holy Spirit has come down to bring <i>us</i> into the consciousness of the celebration.<a name=162:11></a> All through the Acts of the Apostles we find the preaching of the kingdom, and the Holy Spirit was the power of the kingdom.<a name=162:12></a> I used to think that the Holy Spirit was here simply in connection with the house, but I see now that the Holy Spirit came to make good the kingdom; that the kingdom might be established here upon earth.<a name=162:13></a>

		I think it is very important to see that we are not capable to enter into what eternal life is, and the truth of the "body" until we get on to ground other than that on which we are in connection with the kingdom and the new covenant.<a name=188:1></a> Again, you could not appreciate the truth of the body rightly if you did not enter into the truth of eternal life.<a name=188:2></a> You must be in the life of Christ, that of course is to come out in us in the way of character, if there is to be the setting forth of Christ in the saints, it must be consequent upon their being in the life of Christ.<a name=188:3></a>

		Reconciliation is of great importance as a point of apprehension.<a name=189:12></a> You get this in the prodigal.<a name=189:13></a> At some point of his experience reconciliation was entered into; but where we get perhaps the idea of eternal life was when he was seated at the father's table.<a name=189:14></a> That is, all was on a completely new platform.<a name=189:15></a>

		Why do you make a point of the <i>holy</i> love of God?<a name=195:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Because holiness is a point insisted upon with God, and holiness on our part lies in the apprehension of the holy love of God.<a name=195:4></a> It is the holy love of God that makes anything of the knowledge of God impossible to the natural man.<a name=195:5></a> The natural man may have some idea of righteousness, but the thought of holiness is beyond him.<a name=195:6></a> The very best man of the world does not entertain the idea of <i>holy</i> love.<a name=195:7></a> When you speak of the love of God you are perfectly entitled to say, the holy love of God; the water and the blood were witness to it.<a name=195:8></a>

		Paul interprets the witness of the Spirit, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit", etc.<a name=196:15></a> When Christ ascended up on high He sent down the Spirit, the promise of the Father, and it was in order to make our hearts conscious of the love of God.<a name=196:16></a> This is the witness of the Spirit; you have the heart of the believer assured of the love of God by the Spirit.<a name=196:17></a> The effect is, that you are consciously in the sense of holy love.<a name=196:18></a> The Son has revealed to us the Father; you know the Son and are conscious of being in the Son by the Spirit.<a name=196:19></a> You have thus come into the scene of holy affections in the power of the Holy Spirit, and if you are come there you are outside of the death scene, because you are introduced by the Spirit into the scene of holy love.<a name=196:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you have got to this, that there is a scene of holy love outside of the scene of death with which we are so familiar.<a name=197:4></a> I know as well as most people, that holiness is foreign to the ideas of the natural man.<a name=197:5></a> As man he does not entertain the idea; righteousness is different, because it comes in often as between man and man.<a name=197:6></a>

		I could only reply in so far as I know God.<a name=197:8></a> Righteousness and holiness are not the same thing, righteousness judges sin, deals with it, whereas, as regards holiness, sin is perfectly repugnant to God.<a name=197:9></a>

		The body is for the expression of the mind of Christ.<a name=198:2></a> It could not possibly be but that the members of His body should be in His life: they could not be in accord with His mind if they were not in His life.<a name=198:3></a> That brings us to the mystery.<a name=198:4></a> It is very wonderful that the body of Christ is here, "Christ in you the hope of glory".<a name=198:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the prophecy there in verse 12 refers to a time to come on the earth, but we anticipate that and many other things now.<a name=198:13></a> Christ is personally exalted and it is impossible that He can be dislodged from the earth; we sometimes think, almost allow, that Satan and man have the victory; but God has gained the victory, though it is not displayed yet; it is set forth in mystery.<a name=198:14></a> The kingdom exists, but it is in mystery; so, too, as regards Christ, He was rejected down here, but died to accomplish the will of God, and now He is here in His body.<a name=198:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; I do not think it is quite the idea of the work of God that comes out in chapter 1 with regard to Christ; but the power that raised Christ from the dead is to us-ward, to set us actually in heavenly places.<a name=205:2></a> The bearing and power of the resurrection of Christ is towards all saints, and when the moment comes, it wants but another vibration of that power to put all of us in the enjoyment of the inheritance.<a name=205:3></a>

		Just say a word about the inheritance?<a name=205:4></a>

		The inheritance is that which Christ takes as Man.<a name=205:5></a> God is going to gather up all things in one, in Christ.<a name=205:6></a> We have an inheritance in Him and have received the Spirit as the earnest, and the apostle prays at the end of the chapter, that we may know "What is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints".<a name=205:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there anything in Ephesians corresponding to the Jordan?<a name=205:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=205:11></a> Darby used to connect Jordan rather with Colossians.<a name=205:12></a> In Ephesians, I think that everything is worked out from the top, from the height of purpose; it is not- so much a question of how we come at it.<a name=205:13></a> It is God working to give effect to the purpose of His will.<a name=205:14></a>

		Is life experimental?<a name=205:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Life must be experimental else it is not life.<a name=205:16></a> It is possible to look at divine things in two ways.<a name=205:17></a> You may go to Romans and see the steps by which we are brought experimentally into the reality of divine purpose, leaving Adam for Christ; or you may look at the whole thing from God's side, and see how He has given effect to the counsel of His will.<a name=205:18></a> God has set Himself to accomplish His will, and with that there is the question of the spiritual condition of the subjects of His counsel.<a name=205:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes.<a name=206:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Could this be said of all saints?<a name=206:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is one of those points which it is difficult to answer.<a name=206:4></a> The best answer is, that the truth is addressed to the Ephesians; it is said of them.<a name=206:5></a> It needs care and caution as to what you put before saints.<a name=206:6></a> A great virtue in the administration of food is to minister food that people are able to bear.<a name=206:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Romans and the Ephesians have each a little the character of a treatise; the one is the height of counsel, and the other is the gospel.<a name=206:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has been said has a very important bearing upon the point.<a name=206:9></a> You could not suppose the Spirit of God to have written the Ephesian letter to the Galatians, nor the Galatian letter to the Ephesians.<a name=206:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh yes, quite so, but what I wanted to guard was that it is true <i>for</i> all saints.<a name=206:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine purpose must really be to <i>all</i> saints.<a name=206:12></a>
	</div>

		Is there not a difference between that which is in the purpose of God for all, and that which is wrought in them?<a name=206:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think so; you greatly mar many things in Christianity by failing to look at them morally, and instead bringing into them the thought of time.<a name=206:14></a> You must understand not simply that you are brought into life, but that you have a place.<a name=206:15></a> It is a very important point that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>the subject of the chapter is prefaced with the place.<a name=206:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an immense thing to know that.<a name=206:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the place?<a name=206:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have there a distinctly given place in the Father's house.<a name=206:19></a> The sanctuary is a moral idea, and in order to enter into it you need to have the sense of a place as of divine gift.<a name=206:20></a>

		The term 'moral idea' expresses very little to some minds.<a name=206:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is filled unto all the fulness of God?<a name=207:9></a>
	</div>

		That is the state which is effectuated in the saints that they may be the living exposition here of the mind of God.<a name=207:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then this must be prior to the idea of place.<a name=207:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You just get here the place revealed, and then the state answering to, and consistent with it, and next you get the conflict in chapter 6.<a name=207:12></a>

		In chapter 2 you have the place; in chapter 3 the practical state, the object being that now you might be filled unto all the fulness of God.<a name=207:13></a> In chapter 6 you come forth to stand against the influences of evil in the armour of God.<a name=207:14></a>

		I doubt if you enter into the idea of the sanctuary if you do not understand that you have a place.<a name=207:15></a> Nine persons out of ten in Christendom connect the thought of worship with themselves as men here on earth.<a name=207:16></a> Many Christians today are not much in advance of pious Jews in that way.<a name=207:17></a> They are pious and have confidence in the goodness of God; they have a measure of light from God, but their service and worship is that of a people on earth; that is in principle, Jewish.<a name=207:18></a> The first thing to learn, is that you are brought to God, and "brought to God" is properly connected with your having another place.<a name=207:19></a>

		The first is this; that you are set in attachment to Christ.<a name=208:8></a> You are quickened with Him and He is the great centre and object of attachment.<a name=208:9></a> The second is, that you become conscious that, in the light of God, all distinction is abolished as between Jew and Gentile; they together form the company of worshipping priests.<a name=208:10></a> And the third is that the soul has come into the full sense of the love of God, and not only into the light of His love but into the purpose of His love.<a name=208:11></a>

		I may begin by saying that it is quite impossible for man to apprehend God's platform, except by divine teaching.<a name=300:10></a> It is beyond man's ken, because it is resurrection.<a name=300:11></a> God's power works there, and to know God's power and its operations we must reach this platform.<a name=300:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a> is the first passage I would turn to -- "Wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".<a name=300:13></a> Here we find the apostle speaking to saints who had reached and occupied the platform of resurrection.<a name=300:14></a> But first of all we must see how we have to reach it.<a name=300:15></a>

		It seems to me a senseless thing for the world to commemorate the resurrection of Christ, because the world knows nothing about resurrection -- when Christ was raised He was not shown to the world again.<a name=301:1></a> Resurrection is not an event in the course of this world's history at all.<a name=301:2></a> I can understand the world commemorating Christ's birth, and even His death, by days, because birth and death come within the cognisance of man but not resurrection.<a name=301:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show you first how God has reached this platform, and that which He presents to us on it.<a name=301:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before it could be reached two things had to be removed from before God.<a name=301:5></a> Resurrection necessarily refers to those who have died; it has no meaning otherwise.<a name=301:6></a> At the Lord's coming it is the <i>dead</i> who are raised; the <i>living</i> are <i>changed</i>.<a name=301:7></a> Hence to reach this platform God must deal with that which brought death in.<a name=301:8></a> Otherwise He would not be glorified.<a name=301:9></a> Hence resurrection means that what brought in death has been removed to God's glory, and this is the platform.<a name=301:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things had to be removed, <i>viz</i>.<a name=301:11></a>, (1) sin and (2) the flesh, in order that God might reach the platform of resurrection; it was for this end that Christ died.<a name=301:12></a> They did not need to be removed for Christ's own resurrection, but they had to be removed before God could be glorified in our blessing and deliverance.<a name=301:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Flesh had to go, for the reason that there is no good in it.<a name=301:14></a> Moreover, it does not even <i>reflect</i> God's goodness.<a name=301:15></a> What characterises a precious stone is that it reflects light; there is no light in itself.<a name=301:16></a> In like manner the moon reflects light from the sun.<a name=301:17></a> But with the flesh the case is different.<a name=301:18></a> Not only has it no inherent goodness, but it is incapable of reflecting the goodness of God, for it cannot appreciate it.<a name=301:19></a> I think flesh may appreciate the mercy, and, in a certain sense, the power of God, but not His goodness.<a name=301:20></a> Hence Paul had to say, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing".<a name=301:21></a> I quite admit there are unconverted

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now sin is more positive and merits death.<a name=302:5></a> The flesh was tainted by the serpent, and so the Son of man must be lifted up.<a name=302:6></a> The serpent turned man away from what light he had of God's goodness to do his own will.<a name=302:7></a> Hence sin merits death.<a name=302:8></a> Any creature which asserts its will brings in confusion, and hence sin merits death.<a name=302:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God has now reached the platform of resurrection, sin and the flesh having been removed to His glory, and death, His judgment, annulled.<a name=302:10></a> We see in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a> - 16 that the whole order of things after the flesh was over for the apostle.<a name=302:11></a> Hence in verses 17 - 20 God has reached a ground suited to Himself, where all things are of Himself.<a name=302:12></a> Here it is the platform of reconciliation.<a name=302:13></a> By that I understand the removal of all that caused distance between God and man on <i>God's</i> side -- sin and man's will.<a name=302:14></a> An illustration of reconciliation is given in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, when the father kisses the prodigal -- all distance was removed.<a name=302:15></a> This takes place on the platform of resurrection.<a name=302:16></a> It is there that God's power operates.<a name=302:17></a> I admit that resurrection is itself an expression of His power, but it is on the platform of resurrection that everything is carried out for His glory.<a name=302:18></a> This is seen in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, where the Lord is amid His disciples in His resurrection body.<a name=302:19></a> We need to apprehend this.<a name=302:20></a> Think of what it cost God to reach this platform -- to remove sin and the flesh!<a name=302:21></a> Henceforth Christ is not known after the flesh -- all that order is gone and a new platform now subsists.<a name=302:22></a> The platform is one of <i>peace</i>.<a name=302:23></a> It is otherwise with man's platform -- the world.<a name=302:24></a> What is seen there is unrest.<a name=302:25></a> The nations remind me of dogs tied up.<a name=302:26></a> I have been

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, God reached this platform very quickly.<a name=303:3></a> Our way to it is often tedious, but when once God came out to reach it, it was reached as in a moment.<a name=303:4></a> It was reached through the cross, where sin and flesh were removed, so that God's glory and power might be set forth in resurrection.<a name=303:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to ponder the importance of our reaching this platform -- to look at resurrection, not simply as a fact, but as a platform.<a name=303:6></a> When your soul reaches this platform you will get a sense of God's power.<a name=303:7></a> If there is one thing above another that souls need, it is experience of God's power.<a name=303:8></a> This is what would establish our souls in faith.<a name=303:9></a> It was this point which the Colossians had reached.<a name=303:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a word about what God sets forth on His platform.<a name=303:11></a> It is one single Person.<a name=303:12></a> We read in Matthew that many of the saints which slept arose after Christ's resurrection, but we hear nothing more of them.<a name=303:13></a> Christ <i>alone</i> is seen.<a name=303:14></a> He is declared Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead.<a name=303:15></a> He is set forth on that platform in two lights.<a name=303:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My feeling, when I address a company like this, is that I never do my subject justice; but my desire is to suggest a thought to be pondered over.<a name=304:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the second point is that on this platform of resurrection we see Christ as Son of man and Son of David, maintaining a link with man.<a name=304:17></a> Christ has still a body because He has become Son of man, and thus He has a link with man, but not, of course, after the flesh.<a name=304:18></a> He has a link, too, with David, for we find at the close of Revelation that He says, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star".<a name=304:19></a> This same blessed Person, who is the effulgence of God's glory, maintains a link with man in His resurrection body.<a name=304:20></a> I cannot conceive anything more wonderful.<a name=304:21></a> It was His body He showed to the disciples that they might identify Himself.<a name=304:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you read the gospels you will find these three titles again and again applied to Christ, "Son of God", "Son of man", "Son of David", and they are witnessed in a special way in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>and 12.<a name=304:23></a> I think that the significance of the title "Son of man" is that everything that was adverse to God -- Satan, death, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		every enemy -- has been put under Him.<a name=305:1></a> The Son of man subjugates everything.<a name=305:2></a> If you want a testimony to this read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>; God's ways are retributive, and if Satan corrupts man he must be put down <i>by</i> Man.<a name=305:3></a> When the seventy disciples returned to the Lord, rejoicing that even the demons were subject unto them through His name, the Lord says, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven".<a name=305:4></a> This takes place when the man child of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>is caught up to heaven.<a name=305:5></a> The man child has been caught up, and the only thing that causes the apparent delay is because the Church, the bride, is not there yet.<a name=305:6></a> Satan has corrupted man, and will be put under the feet of man.<a name=305:7></a> To this the apostle refers in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:20">Romans  16:20</a>, where he says "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly".<a name=305:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find that as Son of David Christ brings in the sure mercies of David.<a name=305:9></a> This is all on the platform of resurrection.<a name=305:10></a> (See <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:34">Acts  13:34</a>.<a name=305:11></a>) It would be in God's power to bless man temporarily down here, but the result would be that all would be spoiled by sin and the flesh.<a name=305:12></a> But He works on the new platform of resurrection to set aside the power of sin and the flesh, and eventually to bring into the world the sure mercies of David in the Son of man.<a name=305:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things are combined in Christ.<a name=305:14></a> Would that our souls were kept in that light!<a name=305:15></a> If it were so with us we should have little care or anxiety down here.<a name=305:16></a> If we are attached to this blessed Person, what a portion is ours!<a name=305:17></a> But I hope, please God, to look at that another time.<a name=305:18></a>

		It is God's pleasure to identify us with Christ on the platform of resurrection, and it is most blessed and important for our souls to reach this platform; but we must in the first place apprehend it.<a name=305:19></a> I will tell you what will be the sign when man's platform -- the world -- is about to be set aside.<a name=305:20></a> It is when God begins to revive Israel.<a name=305:21></a> When Israel went to the wall Babylon came into prominence, and so when Jerusalem comes

		I was speaking a little last week about the platform on which God has set Himself to accomplish the purposes of His love.<a name=307:1></a> It is important to apprehend this, though many might not enter into the thought just at once.<a name=307:2></a> It is difficult to some minds to grasp the idea of a moral basis or platform, whether on our side or on God's side.<a name=307:3></a> But it is true that there is a platform on which God acts on His side, and which we occupy on ours.<a name=307:4></a> As natural men, we have not as Gentiles any platform to stand upon with God; apart from the grace of God we stand simply as units or individuals.<a name=307:5></a> But in Colossians we find the saints, <i>i.<a name=307:6></a>e.<a name=307:7></a></i>, Gentiles, spoken of as "risen with Christ", and that is a platform.<a name=307:8></a> No one would for a moment maintain that we are <i>actually</i> risen with Christ, but Scripture regards saints as on that platform.<a name=307:9></a> You do not really reach God till you reach Him there, for the simple reason that He presents Himself there only.<a name=307:10></a> He will not have to say to us as in this world.<a name=307:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to enlarge a little now on the light and character in which God shows Himself to us.<a name=307:12></a> I do not wish to go into the point of the ground <i>we</i> occupy, but of the way in which <i>God</i> shows Himself.<a name=307:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The key to the first two chapters of Ephesians, I think, will be found in the use of the expression, "In Christ Jesus".<a name=307:14></a> The one chapter is a contrast to the other in regard of this.<a name=307:15></a> In chapter 1 it is <i>God</i> in Christ Jesus who is before us.<a name=307:16></a> In chapter 2 we have what <i>we</i> are before God in Christ Jesus as the fruit of His power.<a name=307:17></a> But it is as wishing to show what God is toward us in Christ Jesus that I have taken up chapter 1.<a name=307:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In looking into Scripture I see three platforms of God's dealings with men:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=308>[Page 308]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>Looking back, we see that God has taken up man on the platform of responsibility.<a name=308:1></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>Looking at the future, we see God taking the platform of judgment, and man will have to meet Him there.<a name=308:2></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both these platforms are necessary.<a name=308:3></a> It was needful in the past that God should take the platform of responsibility in His ways with man, in order to demonstrate man's state, and it will be needful in the future for Him to take the platform of judgment for His glory; for it is there that the question of good and evil must find its final solution.<a name=308:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li> Now resurrection is the platform of this moment, and it is of a totally different kind from those I have spoken of.<a name=308:5></a> God now presents Himself to us on this ground.<a name=308:6></a> I think many Christians hold God virtually at a distance, but if we desire to know Him intimately we must meet Him on this platform.<a name=308:7></a> We must accept that we are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".<a name=308:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>.<a name=308:9></a>) What you find there is that you are associated with Christ, and consequently loved with the love wherewith He is loved.<a name=308:10></a> Christ cannot be known after the flesh, as the apostle Paul tells us in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, and hence, "If any one be in Christ there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new".<a name=308:11></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a>.<a name=308:12></a>) The ground is entirely changed.<a name=308:13></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, looking for a moment at the platform of responsibility, I would enquire, What is the principle of it?<a name=308:14></a> It is a help to get hold of the principle of a thing, for often when you seize the principle you can see the form of the thing itself.<a name=308:15></a> Now the principle of the platform of responsibility is law, that is, requirement.<a name=308:16></a> God there required from man what was his duty to God.<a name=308:17></a> Man's duty to God was to love Him with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself.<a name=308:18></a> The effect of this was to bring all on this platform under the curse
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=309>[Page 309]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of a broken law.<a name=309:1></a> We get the answer to it in grace in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:4">Galatians  4:4</a>, 5.<a name=309:2></a> Christ has redeemed from the curse of the law; but the effect of God's taking the platform of responsibility with man was, in the first instance, to bring everyone under the curse.<a name=309:3></a> Man was already subject to death, and law made matters, if possible, <i>worse</i> by bringing in the curse.<a name=309:4></a> Christ was made a curse -- "for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:13">Galatians  3:13</a>) -- in order that the curse might be removed.<a name=309:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the platform of judgment is marked by <i>reward</i>.<a name=309:6></a> This is its principle.<a name=309:7></a> It certainly is not there a question of grace nor requirement, but of reward.<a name=309:8></a> Every man receives the due reward of his deeds.<a name=309:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:27">Matthew  16:27</a>.<a name=309:10></a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think anyone would care advisedly to meet God on either of these platforms.<a name=309:11></a> I would not like to accept the platform of responsibility, for it is not natural for me to love God with all my heart, nor my neighbour as myself.<a name=309:12></a> Indeed, I have often, as a Christian, to judge myself, which is a plain proof that I am not up to God's requirements, for to judge myself means that I have allowed something which is not suited even to God's law.<a name=309:13></a> On the other hand, I would not like to meet God in judgment, though I know we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, but that is to receive His estimate of the things done in the body -- not their reward.<a name=309:14></a> No, I would not like to have to say to God on that ground.<a name=309:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the principle of the platform of resurrection is triumph, as seen in the glorious power of God, that brings life out of death.<a name=309:16></a> God entered into conflict with death and Satan's power, and triumphed in resurrection, so that they have been annulled for Him.<a name=309:17></a> It is enormously important to see that God occupies this platform, and that death which was God's judgment and the secret of Satan's power, has been overcome; and the triumph of God is revealed in resurrection.<a name=309:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As an illustration of this I would remind you of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=310>[Page 310]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		song of Moses when the Red Sea was passed.<a name=310:1></a> This song is really the celebration of God's triumph over death and Satan's power, for Pharaoh represents typically the power of the enemy, Satan: and the Red Sea represents the waters of death.<a name=310:2></a> "I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously", etc.<a name=310:3></a> With the destruction of death as God's judgment the enemy's power was destroyed.<a name=310:4></a> This is what Christ's resurrection imparts.<a name=310:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we thus see God's power, it is important to apprehend that His power is at the disposal of His love.<a name=310:6></a> It was His <i>love</i> led Him to triumph.<a name=310:7></a> God's triumph in resurrection is the fruit of <i>His love</i>.<a name=310:8></a> The apostle prays (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a>) that the greatness of God's power towards us who believe may be known by saints, for it has been put in exercise.<a name=310:9></a> "For his great love wherewith he loved us".<a name=310:10></a> You can understand that nothing originates in God's power, but everything originates in His love, for He is love; His power is an attribute.<a name=310:11></a> I would like, for myself, that everything I did should be the outcome of love.<a name=310:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sin and flesh have been removed from under God's eye, and thus it is that God's power is displayed on the ground of resurrection.<a name=310:13></a> If you want a text to prove this I refer you to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>: "God having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh: in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to Spirit".<a name=310:14></a> (N.<a name=310:15></a>T.<a name=310:16></a>) By the righteous requirement of the law is meant the loving God with all the heart, and one's neighbour as oneself.<a name=310:17></a> This is fulfilled in us in a power outside of the flesh -- the fruit of resurrection.<a name=310:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage I read from <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, you will find four thoughts:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>Redemption.<a name=311:3></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>The knowledge of God's will.<a name=311:4></a></li>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God shows us here what He has done for us in Christ.<a name=311:7></a> It is in <i>Christ</i> that we get the light in which God presents Himself to us; this is a most important side of things.<a name=311:8></a> It is evidently <i>only</i> in Christ that God can present Himself on the platform of resurrection.<a name=311:9></a> Who else is risen but Christ?<a name=311:10></a> Now I want you to notice that each of these four points presents something outside the course of things down here, and for the reason that all are on the ground of resurrection.<a name=311:11></a> I believe that in the millennium God will put things on the resurrection platform.<a name=311:12></a> Death will be swallowed up in victory, and hence man will rightly look to be blessed here.<a name=311:13></a> But it is not so now.<a name=311:14></a> The only way in which the natural man can pretend to know God is through His providence, but providence is really a veil behind which God is hid.<a name=311:15></a> You may often see a wicked man prospering in the world.<a name=311:16></a> I do not pretend to understand God's providence, but I accept it.<a name=311:17></a> Job was stripped of all he had in the providence of God; and just so it may be with us.<a name=311:18></a> God knows how to turn all things to account; but providence is a veil, and the unconverted man cannot go beyond this veil.<a name=311:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christ, as Forerunner, has gone within the veil.<a name=311:20></a> All that in which God presents Himself to us in Him is outside of His providence.<a name=311:21></a> To take (1) redemption,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the forgiveness of sins.<a name=312:1></a> If we had these in God's providence the mark of it would be that we were not subject to death.<a name=312:2></a> This will come out in the millennium, when death will be swallowed up in victory.<a name=312:3></a> We are subject to death now; but God reveals Himself in grace on the platform of resurrection in Christ Jesus, who has been raised again for our justification.<a name=312:4></a> What would be the use of telling a man of the world that I had forgiveness of sins?<a name=312:5></a> I could not prove it to him.<a name=312:6></a> He would most likely say he was as good as me, or think me most presumptuous.<a name=312:7></a> But it is good for me, because I am in the light of Christ Jesus, and I can testify that forgiveness is there in His name.<a name=312:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next take the mystery of God's will.<a name=312:9></a> This is not for accomplishment in the present, but for the "dispensation of the fulness of times".<a name=312:10></a> Hence God's will refers to things entirely outside the course of the world.<a name=312:11></a> All things are to be gathered up in one in Christ (verse 10).<a name=312:12></a> That is not the present providential order of things.<a name=312:13></a> There is no mystery about God's will when displayed as there is about providence, but it is quite outside the present course of God's dealings.<a name=312:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have redemption -- and that is a big word, for it goes on to the redemption of the body -- and God has made known to us the mystery of His will.<a name=312:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is the inheritance.<a name=312:16></a> Now we do not enter on the inheritance until Christ gets in.<a name=312:17></a> The inheritance has been purchased, but is not yet redeemed; and Christ will not take it up until it is redeemed, but He will redeem it.<a name=312:18></a> Would you <i>like</i> to have part in the purchased possession while it is in Satan's or men's hands?<a name=312:19></a> I do not want any part in it until Christ redeems it.<a name=312:20></a> He has purchased it, but not as yet redeemed it.<a name=312:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth point is the earnest of the inheritance -- the Spirit.<a name=312:22></a> Has the Spirit anything to do with the world, or the course of things down here?<a name=312:23></a> "Whom the world cannot receive", the Lord said to the disciples.<a name=312:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=313>[Page 313]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world has no part in Him.<a name=313:1></a> He was never presented to the world as Christ was.<a name=313:2></a> His very presence here convicts the world concerning sin, and righteousness, and judgment.<a name=313:3></a> He is here because Christ has been rejected, in order to support Christians, and to testify of Him.<a name=313:4></a> He came down from Christ in order to conduct the saints to where Christ is in heaven.<a name=313:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And He has another office, and that is to completely supersede the flesh in the believer.<a name=313:6></a> Hence the Spirit is in no possible sense connected with the world; for all that is in the world is made up of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.<a name=313:7></a> Now the Spirit has come to set the flesh aside -- that is to say, to set aside everything that has connected me with the course of things in the world.<a name=313:8></a> What can lust do for us save to suit us for the world?<a name=313:9></a> If there were no lust in me the world would not tempt me.<a name=313:10></a> But the Spirit is here to set aside this link, so that by the circumcision of Christ we put off the incubus of the flesh, that we may be free.<a name=313:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is that God presents Himself to us in Christ.<a name=313:12></a> Everything is perfect on <i>His</i> side.<a name=313:13></a> His triumph is divinely complete.<a name=313:14></a> I think <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>is full of interest, for it is there that the testimony of what God is in Christ comes out.<a name=313:15></a> In chapter 2 we get another side -- the truth of what we are in Christ, quickened together with Him, raised up, and made to sit in the heavenlies.<a name=313:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important thus to see the platform on which God's power acts.<a name=313:17></a> Everything of grace comes out in Christ with redemption.<a name=313:18></a> The mystery of God's will, the inheritance, and the Spirit.<a name=313:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more.<a name=313:20></a> If sin and the flesh are removed for God, then their power must go for you and me.<a name=313:21></a> They are removed from God's eye; but if I am to reach God on the platform of resurrection, then sin and flesh must go from my eye.<a name=313:22></a> I must learn what sin is, and what freedom from it is; and I must learn, too, what
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=314>[Page 314]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the flesh is, and what it is to have put off the body of it, and thus to be freed from its principle and rule.<a name=314:1></a> Many people seem content to put off details merely, but the <i>body</i> of the flesh must go.<a name=314:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find myself on the resurrection platform, then, in company with Christ and all saints, outside of the whole course of this world and every order of man here, and in the place where Christ leads the praises of His people.<a name=314:3></a> Then the next thing will be to come out as gifted by Him in testimony for Him in this world.<a name=314:4></a>

		THE GROUND OF APPROACH TO GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:8">Colossians  2:8</a> to 3: 14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things between which it is important for Christians to distinguish.<a name=315:1></a> I refer to God's approach to man and man's approach to God.<a name=315:2></a> They are never confounded in Scripture, and the second is consequent upon the first.<a name=315:3></a> It is as we enter into the reality of God's approach to us that we desire to approach Him.<a name=315:4></a> Now, for this we need to apprehend the platform of resurrection, as otherwise we cannot approach God according to His mind.<a name=315:5></a> The apostle speaks to the Colossians as being on that platform, and as having been quickened together with Christ.<a name=315:6></a> Hence in chapter 3: 1 he exhorts them -- "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=315:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is necessary also to distinguish in our minds between the <i>fact</i> of resurrection and the <i>platform</i> of resurrection.<a name=315:8></a> The <i>fact</i> is a matter for faith -- you believe in God who raised up Jesus our Lord.<a name=315:9></a> Now, in regard to ourselves, we are not yet raised as a fact, but we are said to be risen with Him.<a name=315:10></a> When we are raised as a fact we shall be caught up to heaven, and will not talk then about the platform of resurrection.<a name=315:11></a> But we are not yet risen as to fact, and hence we speak about the platform of resurrection as a ground to be occupied by the soul according to the import of Christ's resurrection.<a name=315:12></a> Now, to know Christianity in its true power we must occupy this platform.<a name=315:13></a> I do not deny that souls may be pious, and know a good deal, as even the Jews did, without reaching it; but they do not fully know Christianity.<a name=315:14></a> You may say that I am using the term in a wrong sense, but I do not think it is so.<a name=315:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see revealed in Scripture certain things which are for God, and certain things which are for man.<a name=315:16></a> This
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=316>[Page 316]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		can be discerned in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>, where we find enumerated the things to which we have come (verses 22, 23).<a name=316:1></a> These are Mount Zion, the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, myriads of angels, the universal gathering, "and Church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven".<a name=316:2></a> These are all clearly for God.<a name=316:3></a> You get this idea conveyed in the term "firstborn", for it refers probably to the firstborn who were redeemed out of Egypt and were claimed by God.<a name=316:4></a> They were for <i>God</i>.<a name=316:5></a> The passage then goes on -- "and to God the Judge of all".<a name=316:6></a> Then follow things which are for man -- "spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling".<a name=316:7></a> These refer to blessings on man's side.<a name=316:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity consists in apprehending the things that are for God, and in the apprehension of these you get the consciousness of the things that are for man, and I use the word consciousness intentionally.<a name=316:9></a> In the line of divine teaching we learn what God has provided for Himself, for it is only in the first that there are things for God, that there can be anything for man; and God has approached man with a view to accomplish what is for Himself.<a name=316:10></a> The world broke with God entirely over Christ, and it is, in the presence of the Spirit, convicted of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.<a name=316:11></a> Well, then, what is there for man?<a name=316:12></a> Nothing, save as God has come out to accomplish certain things for Himself and for His own glory.<a name=316:13></a> It is only in this way that there can be anything for man.<a name=316:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in resurrection everything is for God.<a name=316:15></a> This is its import.<a name=316:16></a> Whatever of life God brings out of death is devoted to Himself -- is for His glory.<a name=316:17></a> You will remember what the Lord said to Martha in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:40">John  11:40</a> -- "Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<a name=316:18></a>" The sickness of Lazarus was for God's glory, that his resurrection might be a witness to the Son of God on His way to the cross, that God might thus be glorified.<a name=316:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=317>[Page 317]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get many blessings short of resurrection -- forgiveness of sins, for example; and people accept these, but shirk the resurrection platform because everything that is on that is for <i>God</i>.<a name=317:1></a> I do not go there to know the forgiveness of sins, but to approach God as a priest.<a name=317:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory of God is a most important thought.<a name=317:3></a> It is His <i>distinctive</i> triumph.<a name=317:4></a> The idea in glory is distinction, and the glory of God is His <i>distinction</i>.<a name=317:5></a> We get the idea of distinction in the heavenly bodies -- one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and so on.<a name=317:6></a> Glory as regards divine Persons is distinctive; for instance, the glory of the Son is not exactly the glory of the Father.<a name=317:7></a> The glory of God is in His complete triumph over every evil, or rather, I should say, in the triumph of all that God is over the power of evil.<a name=317:8></a> Hence resurrection is for the glory of God, for it sets forth the triumph of God.<a name=317:9></a> And no attribute of God is compromised, but He is glorified in all His attributes.<a name=317:10></a> He is glorified in Christ's resurrection, and now are seen His love, His righteousness, His holiness, His power.<a name=317:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man achieves the greatest glory chiefly by destruction.<a name=317:12></a> Men are much more dazzled by the victories of one who has effected destruction by war than by one who rules well in times of peace.<a name=317:13></a> The glory of God is very different from this.<a name=317:14></a> His glory is complete triumph over the power of evil, and this is set forth in resurrection.<a name=317:15></a> Death -- the great enemy -- is annulled in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=317:16></a> On the ground of resurrection God has a free hand, if I might so speak, to act in grace towards man without reference to evil, sin, the flesh, etc.<a name=317:17></a> He forgives freely, He can justify, redeem, and give the Holy Spirit.<a name=317:18></a> God can act towards man on that platform apart from all that is in man.<a name=317:19></a> Man is justified by the faith of God.<a name=317:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Why has God thus approached man?<a name=317:21></a> Because He is accomplishing all for Himself.<a name=317:22></a> God is to be all in all, and He is working for His own glory.<a name=317:23></a> He has

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=318>[Page 318]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		approached man on resurrection ground to accomplish what is according to His will.<a name=318:1></a> Everything that reaches this platform is devoted to God.<a name=318:2></a> God is the object.<a name=318:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the process or course of God's dealings with the soul, I do not think that when man believes that he is really <i>conscious</i> of anything.<a name=318:4></a> No doubt consciousness will follow, but I doubt if it does so very quickly.<a name=318:5></a> I think it is some time before the believer becomes <i>conscious</i> of things, for this involves the <i>new man</i> being put on.<a name=318:6></a> Speaking humanly, I am as a man conscious of certain things, and consciousness is peculiarly individual.<a name=318:7></a> "No one knows the things of a man save the spirit of man that is in him".<a name=318:8></a> That is to say, I am conscious of my things, and no one else is.<a name=318:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the same thing is true, I suppose, in regard to the new man, though there the consciousness is intimately connected with the Spirit of God.<a name=318:10></a> I am conscious of certain things in the new man, but that is a different thing from faith.<a name=318:11></a> It is by <i>faith</i> I am justified, but this is hardly consciousness.<a name=318:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And who has the consciousness of forgiveness of sins?<a name=318:13></a> The Christian who has put on the new man.<a name=318:14></a> I believe there are <i>thousands</i> of Christians who have faith, but who have hardly the <i>consciousness</i> of forgiveness, because it is known in the new man.<a name=318:15></a> Well, I see this, that God has approached man in the testimony of forgiveness of sins, and in the gift of the Holy Spirit, in order that the believer may be <i>conscious</i> of what is for God.<a name=318:16></a> For thus the work of the Holy Spirit goes on, forming the Christian in the divine nature and bringing him into liberty.<a name=318:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>we see the Holy Spirit leading the believer into the consciousness of <i>what is for God</i>.<a name=318:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>we have had what is for <i>man</i>.<a name=318:19></a> But in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>the thought of sonship is brought in, and sonship is for God, and God has no higher thought in regard to any Christian.<a name=318:20></a> But there are many Christians who are not in the good of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, although they might

	<div class="paragraph">
		be able to repeat the chapter word for word.<a name=319:1></a> But souls are often not in liberty, lacking the formative work of the Spirit.<a name=319:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next I come to the truth of the Church.<a name=319:3></a> The Church is for God.<a name=319:4></a> Of whom is the Church composed?<a name=319:5></a> It is composed of <i>all</i> the sons of God.<a name=319:6></a> They have the Spirit of sonship, and compose the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven.<a name=319:7></a> The Church is for <i>God</i>, although men may and will get the light of it; but if we look at it as the heavenly city we find that it is for God, for it has the glory of God, or if we look at it as the Church of the firstborn it is a worshipping company for God.<a name=319:8></a> It is in this respect like the sons of Aaron, who had the service of the sanctuary, and had no inheritance amongst the people.<a name=319:9></a> They were set apart for God.<a name=319:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mind of God is first apprehended in detail by faith.<a name=319:11></a> We must begin with this before we get consciousness.<a name=319:12></a> The Holy Spirit does not stop at the first step, but brings us by faith on to the resurrection platform.<a name=319:13></a> But to reach that, I must be consciously free of that which has been removed for God.<a name=319:14></a> This is more than faith -- it is deliverance.<a name=319:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, we apprehend the calling to sonship; then we see that sons of God are priests because they are sons.<a name=319:16></a> We have this thought in Hebrews, where Christ is spoken of as priest because He is Son.<a name=319:17></a> So with us, for who could have full access to God save sons?<a name=319:18></a> None but those who know God's love could fully enjoy access.<a name=319:19></a> It is sonship which enables us to be priests, and as such only are we priests.<a name=319:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is deliverance.<a name=319:21></a> We must be consciously free of that from which God is free in His approach to man.<a name=319:22></a> The tenth and eleventh verses of our chapter mean that we are to be consciously free from what God has removed.<a name=319:23></a> This brings us to the resurrection platform, where we can take part in true priestly service.<a name=319:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=320>[Page 320]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another work which the Spirit does, in which lies the secret of deliverance, and that is, the forming of the believer in the divine nature.<a name=320:1></a> But in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a> - 15 we just have, "Ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God".<a name=320:2></a> This means that you enter into the light of God's purposes set forth in Christ's resurrection to put man in touch with heaven, outside of every order of man down here, philosophic, sentimental, or religious.<a name=320:3></a> We are entitled thus to be free from the power of the flesh, and although still in the world, to be free from its influences.<a name=320:4></a> That is the platform of resurrection, and when we reach that platform we are suited to be of the worshipping company.<a name=320:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Quickened together with Him is a further thought, and is the source of spiritual affections.<a name=320:6></a> It means that the love of God is effective in us.<a name=320:7></a> It is first shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, and nothing can separate us from it -- that is one side.<a name=320:8></a> But the other side is that we love God as having recognised the love of God and the obligation that flows from it.<a name=320:9></a> We love God and we love Christ, who has brought to us the light of love, and then we love the brethren.<a name=320:10></a> God is the supreme object of these spiritual affections.<a name=320:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But just to touch again on the three points that have been before us.<a name=320:12></a> We have, first, the apprehension of what is for God.<a name=320:13></a> It is here that we find the lack in souls in ability to distinguish between what is for God and what is for man.<a name=320:14></a> Second, the apprehension of the Church.<a name=320:15></a> The Holy Spirit leads us into the light of God's pleasure that we are risen with Christ, thus in touch with heaven, and frees us from what is of the earth.<a name=320:16></a> Third, the Spirit forms believers in divine affections, so that they should be a company "holy and without blame before him in love".<a name=320:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps you say you cannot understand much about it.<a name=320:18></a> Well, I only suggest these things to you.<a name=320:19></a> The apostle says, "Set your mind on things above".<a name=320:20></a> If

		you are free from all that closes in death, then set your mind on things which are above.<a name=321:1></a> The energy of the Spirit is needed for this.<a name=321:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christians are often greatly occupied about the earth and the things which are to happen there, and make a special study of prophecy in that way; but they never get the truth in this way.<a name=321:3></a> But set your mind on things in heaven, and then you will know all about the earth.<a name=321:4></a> It is what takes place in heaven that affects the earth.<a name=321:5></a> When the Church goes to heaven and Satan is cast out of heaven, that means a great deal for the earth.<a name=321:6></a> But I only say this by the way.<a name=321:7></a> Set your minds on things above, on that scene of unclouded bliss where Christ is.<a name=321:8></a>

		Christians are not all alive to the thought that the books of the Pentateuch set forth typically the path and experiences of a Christian.<a name=322:1></a> They are not mere history.<a name=322:2></a> In fact, there is no real history in Scripture; that is, nothing that would be accounted such by man.<a name=322:3></a> The great bulk of the Old Testament is taken up by the dealings with and interventions of God on behalf of His people.<a name=322:4></a> In writing a history one would record the social, political, military, and commercial life of a people.<a name=322:5></a> The interventions of God on their behalf are not history.<a name=322:6></a> But if you take away the interventions of God from Scripture, you would have but little left.<a name=322:7></a>

		Now these early books of the Bible show prophetically the Christian's pathway, and God's dealings with him in it.<a name=322:8></a> The instruction which they give is not found anywhere else.<a name=322:9></a> The Gospels do not give us such instruction; they give us the facts of Christ's ministry, etc.<a name=322:10></a> But in the early books of the Bible God's ways in His moral government are seen.<a name=322:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>God redeeming His people from Egypt; and</li>

		Turning to Numbers, we get there the exercises of the wilderness.<a name=322:15></a> The world is a wilderness to the Christian, and in it he finds out the contrariety and perverseness of the flesh, but the grace of God.<a name=322:16></a> And there is another thing that he learns there; namely, God's ordering and provision for His people in the wilderness.<a name=322:17></a>

		In Leviticus we get another important subject; namely, the manner and details of approach to God.<a name=323:1></a> Now the apostle tells us that "whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope".<a name=323:2></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:4">Romans  15:4</a>.<a name=323:3></a>) I think many Christians fail to look at these early books of the Old Testament in this light; but these books are of great interest, as giving us the account of God's ways with His people.<a name=323:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My subject during these lectures has been the resurrection platform.<a name=323:5></a> It is on the platform of resurrection that God has approached man.<a name=323:6></a> "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day".<a name=323:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:46">Luke  24:46</a>.<a name=323:8></a>) This is the resurrection platform where everything contrary to God has been removed in the death of Christ, so that God can freely approach man.<a name=323:9></a> It is not the platform of responsibility, nor of judgment; but it is the platform where God addresses Himself to man with a view to salvation.<a name=323:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our chapter brings us to the land of promise; that is, to the side of Jordan westward, which is sometimes spoken of as 'the other side of Jordan'.<a name=323:11></a> I want to take up the typical meaning of the circumstances we get in this chapter, rather than to speak about them in detail.<a name=323:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would first of all like to say a few words about one point which has been previously before us, <i>viz</i>.<a name=323:13></a>, our being risen together with Christ.<a name=323:14></a> Now this is a question entirely of divine grace, and it is most important to understand this.<a name=323:15></a> It is through faith, and hence of grace, just as much as justification.<a name=323:16></a> What faith does is to apprehend the pleasure of God.<a name=323:17></a> In illustration of this you might call to mind how God spoke to Abraham of His purpose to bless.<a name=323:18></a> Abraham by faith apprehended it.<a name=323:19></a> The same is seen in David when God spoke to him of raising up one to sit on his throne.<a name=323:20></a> David by faith apprehended it.<a name=323:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the gospel we apprehend that it is God's pleasure to justify, through faith in Christ.<a name=323:22></a> We are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		saved in apprehending God's pleasure.<a name=324:1></a> I am not called to believe anything about myself.<a name=324:2></a> Justification of a man is not exactly the act of God, but it is His mind.<a name=324:3></a> The act of God was in raising Christ, and now man is justified in apprehending by faith God's act.<a name=324:4></a> "To whom it" (righteousness) "shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification".<a name=324:5></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:24">Romans  4:24</a>, 25.<a name=324:6></a>) I see that it is God's pleasure to justify, and in apprehending this I am justified.<a name=324:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a> we have further: "Wherein also ye are risen with him, through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".<a name=324:8></a> We are risen with Him thus by faith, the same principle by which we are justified.<a name=324:9></a> This is also God's pleasure, and we apprehend it.<a name=324:10></a> To be risen with Christ means that it is as much God's mind we should be with Him over Jordan as it is that we should be in the wilderness.<a name=324:11></a> But this is just what people fail to apprehend, and so, like the two and a half tribes, they settle down this side of Jordan.<a name=324:12></a> They are satisfied with justification, it is enough for them; but the pleasure of God is for us to occupy heavenly ground with Christ Himself before.<a name=324:13></a> Over Jordan, that is, the side of Jordan westward, contemplates saints in the occupation, in their souls, of heavenly ground in association with Christ, though still here on earth.<a name=324:14></a> This is a difficult thing to many to take in.<a name=324:15></a> They understand much more quickly if one speaks to them of heaven or earth; but to speak of heavenly ground is puzzling, and one can only receive it as prepared by the grace of God to receive it.<a name=324:16></a> But it is none the less the mind and pleasure of God for us.<a name=324:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might say this, that justification is our side, while risen with Christ is God's side.<a name=324:18></a> As justified I am cleared from every reproach connected with this world; but as risen I apprehend that it is God's pleasure to have me with Himself.<a name=324:19></a> To illustrate this, turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>,

		and read verses 17 and 19.<a name=325:1></a> In verse 17 the Lord makes known the pleasure of God: "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=325:2></a> That is, the disciples were associated with Himself as risen.<a name=325:3></a> And in verse 19 we find Jesus in the midst of a company gathered round Himself, morally outside of the world.<a name=325:4></a> Christ had just died out of the world, and now comes into their midst, saying to them, "Peace be unto you".<a name=325:5></a> They were morally risen with Christ.<a name=325:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you turn to the end of Luke you will find another thought, which I want to bring before you by way of contrast.<a name=325:7></a> Look at chapter 23: 43: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise".<a name=325:8></a> Paradise is a contrast to what I have spoken about, and the thief was to go straight to paradise.<a name=325:9></a> He did not occupy heavenly ground down here, and the same would apply to anyone who might be converted on a deathbed.<a name=325:10></a> But then the most of us are left down here for a time, and it is important for us to know that it is God's mind that we are risen with Christ.<a name=325:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at the exhortations of Scripture you find how little they make of this world.<a name=325:12></a> The fact is that we are justified before God to accept death to the world that we may apprehend His pleasure in being risen with Christ, to be with Him who died for us and was raised again.<a name=325:13></a> It is a great thing to apprehend the pleasure of God.<a name=325:14></a> Is such a thing really possible as that I should be associated with Christ?<a name=325:15></a> Yes, it is.<a name=325:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turn to our chapter (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5">Joshua  5</a>).<a name=325:17></a> It gives us the preparation for going up into the land, where we have to withstand the power of evil.<a name=325:18></a> We get this brought out in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:13">Ephesians  6:13</a>: "Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand", etc.<a name=325:19></a> But it is not an easy thing to stand.<a name=325:20></a> This is the evil day, and the influences which are at work in the world are subtle and deadly.<a name=325:21></a> Israel had to fight with flesh and blood,

		things which they could see, but it is different now.<a name=326:1></a> You cannot see the deadly influences at work today, but they are all directed against the light and testimony of a glorified Christ.<a name=326:2></a> The god of this world blinds people, that they may see not the glory of Christ.<a name=326:3></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:4">2 Corinthians  4:4</a>.<a name=326:4></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		But you say, How are these to be met?<a name=326:5></a> Well, I will tell you a thought which I have.<a name=326:6></a> I doubt if you can meet them in a solitary way.<a name=326:7></a> One cannot meet them as a unit.<a name=326:8></a> What we need is the support of fellowship.<a name=326:9></a> The Lord was competent to meet these powers of evil, but then He was the strong Man.<a name=326:10></a> He was able to bind the strong man.<a name=326:11></a> But I am weakness itself, and hence as a unit I am unequal to meet the powers of evil which are at work.<a name=326:12></a> Unity and fellowship are indispensable.<a name=326:13></a> There is nothing which affects me more painfully than to see the young exposed to the deadly influences of the world.<a name=326:14></a> We all, and they especially, want the support of unity.<a name=326:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the place of conflict with the power of evil, therefore, saints are looked at as a company.<a name=326:16></a> God does not mean us to stand solitary.<a name=326:17></a> When the Ephesians were told to stand, I think the apostle was addressing the company; they were to take the armour to be able to stand.<a name=326:18></a> So it is with us, we have fellowship one with another, and thus are enabled to withstand the subtle influences down here.<a name=326:19></a> Those who are without this support are in danger of giving in and making terms.<a name=326:20></a> Unity and fellowship are the manner of the Spirit's support.<a name=326:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us take up the points of our chapter.<a name=326:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>In verse 1 we get the weakness of the Canaanites westward of Jordan.<a name=326:23></a> Their hearts melted.<a name=326:24></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>Verses 2 - 9 give the circumcision of Israel.<a name=326:25></a> This was done when they were over Jordan, not in the wilderness.<a name=326:26></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>Verses 10, 11 give the keeping of the passover.<a name=326:27></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>Verse 12 the manna ceases, and the old corn of the land is eaten.<a name=326:28></a></li>

		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>The captain of the Lord's host appears to Joshua (verse 13), and this brings us back to verse 1.<a name=327:1></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people of Israel were to go against the Canaanites and to expel them.<a name=327:2></a> Thus the beginning and the end of the chapter refer to the Canaanites being expelled, while the rest of it is taken up with the preparation of Israel for conflict.<a name=327:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You or I might very naturally have supposed that Israel ought to have gone up at once when the hearts of the Canaanites melted.<a name=327:4></a> But that was not God's way.<a name=327:5></a> Natural powers are of no use for God's warfare; the flesh must be put off.<a name=327:6></a> Take, for example, a Christian who endeavours to meet an infidel in argument, that is with carnal weapons; he is likely to encounter defeat.<a name=327:7></a> The power of evil can only be met with divine weapons, and for this the flesh must go -- all self-confidence and that kind of thing.<a name=327:8></a> The apostle warned the Colossians of this in speaking to them of philosophy and vain deceit.<a name=327:9></a> All that is of the flesh must be put off in fighting for God.<a name=327:10></a> All links which connect me with the world must be broken, all the moral links.<a name=327:11></a> You cannot fight flesh with flesh, and any effort to do so only exposes you to defeat.<a name=327:12></a> I think that has been commonly the case.<a name=327:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is the passover.<a name=327:14></a> The flesh is distrusted (for you cannot actually get rid of it, but you can morally, by distrusting it), and now you come to the passover.<a name=327:15></a> We must be in communion with the death of Christ, with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name=327:16></a> Christ's death tests everything for the Christian.<a name=327:17></a> If things in the world are unsuitable to the death of Christ, they are unsuitable for the Christian.<a name=327:18></a> We find the Corinthians were allowing many things which were inconsistent with the death of Christ, and they had to purge out the old leaven.<a name=327:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point in the preparation of the people is the ceasing of the manna and the eating of the old corn of the land.<a name=327:20></a> Now the manna is, I judge, food for the individual.<a name=327:21></a> It is grace for the wilderness -- daily
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=328>[Page 328]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		grace for daily need.<a name=328:1></a> It is the grace which enables me to go through the day down here.<a name=328:2></a> The gathering of it is individual and for the wilderness.<a name=328:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the old corn of the land is the food of saints collectively.<a name=328:4></a> I want manna while I am down here for my individual path, but I eat the old corn of the land with the saints, I do not want the manna then.<a name=328:5></a> The difficulty is that in our case the things overlap.<a name=328:6></a> We have not done with the manna as Israel had, we need it daily; but we have part too in the old corn of the land.<a name=328:7></a> The old corn of the land is heavenly food, heavenly sentiments, all that is the growth and produce, so to say, of the land.<a name=328:8></a> The manna is angels' food which comes down from heaven, but the old corn of the land is what is proper to heaven, and can only be tasted in the Christian circle.<a name=328:9></a> I speak of these things morally.<a name=328:10></a> It seems to me that many who come to the meeting hardly touch the assembly.<a name=328:11></a> We need divine preparation for the assembly.<a name=328:12></a> But if the assembly is realised in the Christian circle, it is a most blessed thing and a foretaste of heaven; the food of heaven is tasted upon earth.<a name=328:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>for example.<a name=328:14></a> Were not the disciples happy?<a name=328:15></a> Do you think that there was any fear of the Jews when Christ was in the midst?<a name=328:16></a> None, it was all dissipated, for Christ was amongst them as the risen One who had proved Himself stronger than man.<a name=328:17></a> I believe they were supremely happy and full of affection for Christ and for one another -- I do not mean natural affection, but heavenly.<a name=328:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the last point I call attention to in the chapter is the recognition of Christ in glory as the Captain of the Lord's host with the drawn sword in His hand.<a name=328:19></a> It is He who leads in conflict against the powers of evil and their influences.<a name=328:20></a> Now are you going to stand or, to make terms?<a name=328:21></a> Suppose your purpose is to stand in the power of the truth.<a name=328:22></a> Well, I think you will stand if you apprehend the glory of the Lord, but if you fail in this, what will happen will be that you will remain

		The teaching of this chapter is undoubtedly founded on the Father's revelation to Peter recorded in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=330:1></a> The point of this epistle is the Church as the subject of God's moral government down here, coming in between the sufferings of Christ and the glories which should follow.<a name=330:2></a> Hence the Christians to whom Peter wrote were a suffering people.<a name=330:3></a> They are, however, exhorted to recognize human institutions, rulers, kings, and other dignities as being ordained of God.<a name=330:4></a> (Chapter 2: 12 - 17.<a name=330:5></a>)

		It is the object of Scripture to make known to us what we have by the work of God.<a name=330:13></a> No one can know what new birth is until he has it, what it is to be "born of God" until it is a fact; and no one knows what the new man is until he is formed in it.<a name=330:14></a> We need to be built up in order to apprehend our spiritual privileges.<a name=330:15></a> It is well to be intelligent about God's work in us, but this work precedes our apprehension of privilege.<a name=330:16></a> When you are created in Christ, then you understand something about new creation.<a name=330:17></a>

		The points we have here are taken from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>; 2 Peter is connected with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>, for Peter there presses the certainty of the kingdom, and alludes in confirmation of it to the vision on the Mount of Transfiguration, saying that they "were eye-witnesses of his majesty", etc.<a name=331:11></a> (See <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:16">2 Peter  1:16</a>, 18.<a name=331:12></a>) This confirms the kingdom.<a name=331:13></a> But 1 Peter is connected with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, where we have the Father's revelation to Peter as the result of Peter confessing Christ as the Son of the living God.<a name=331:14></a> The Lord then says to Peter, "Blessed art-thou, Simon Bar-jona", and adds, "Thou art Peter, and up on this rock I will build my Church".<a name=331:15></a> (See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:13">Matthew  16:13</a> - 20.<a name=331:16></a>) Now this thought is in mind in the chapter before us.<a name=331:17></a> I know the word that Peter uses for stone differs from that used in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, but the thought is, I judge, the same.<a name=331:18></a> Peter apprehended the import of the revelation when he wrote this epistle, though I do not think he did at the time he received it.<a name=331:19></a> This is shown by what follows (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:21">Matthew  16:21</a> - 23), where we find Peter rebuking the Lord when He speaks of His sufferings, and the Lord has to say to him, "Get thee behind me, Satan".<a name=331:20></a>

		But I only allude to this in passing.<a name=332:1></a> The point is that <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>is connected with the Father's revelation to Peter of Christ as the Son of the living God.<a name=332:2></a> That confession was the rock on which the Church was to be built, and the gates of hell would not prevail against it.<a name=332:3></a> It is therefore most important.<a name=332:4></a>

		Now Peter's confession represents Christ as outside of everything here.<a name=332:5></a> It was not Christ after the flesh.<a name=332:6></a> I believe this to be the force of the word "living".<a name=332:7></a> Everything here was under the power of death save Christ.<a name=332:8></a> The Lord was about to go into death, but He was outside of it as the Son of the living God.<a name=332:9></a> Hence the Lord tells Peter that the gates of hell should not prevail against what was built on the confession.<a name=332:10></a> So here Peter says, "To whom coming, a living stone .<a name=332:11></a>.<a name=332:12></a>.<a name=332:13></a> yourselves also as living stones".<a name=332:14></a> (verse 4.<a name=332:15></a>) It is a wonderful thing that there has been a Man here who entered into death and yet was the Son of the living God.<a name=332:16></a> The living God is not affected by death, and here was His Son who was, so to say, of another generation than of man.<a name=332:17></a> He was according to and of God, and hence outside of death and Satan's power.<a name=332:18></a>

		Early in the chapter (verse 2) the apostle recognises those He is addressing as babes who were to desire the sincere milk of the word that they might grow thereby up to salvation.<a name=332:19></a> You must add the last three words to the text; they ought to be there.<a name=332:20></a> The saints were to grow and to be built up.<a name=332:21></a> We do not get faith in this chapter as in chapter 1.<a name=332:22></a> We get here, first, "growth", and then, second, "built up", We all begin with faith, the pleasure of God is apprehended.<a name=332:23></a> Man is justified by faith, for it is the pleasure of God to justify man.<a name=332:24></a> The mind of God is unchanging, and faith enters into it.<a name=332:25></a> The same thing is true of saints being risen together with Christ.<a name=332:26></a> This is the pleasure of God, and it is apprehended by faith.<a name=332:27></a> The two thoughts are not similar.<a name=332:28></a> Justification clears one from every reproach connected with what I am in by nature, the world and the flesh

		The more you look into the truth, the more you see what an important place the kingdom has, it is the sense of it that has led me to Luke's gospel tonight, where the Lord says, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom", and in the light of that He exhorts the disciples to "sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not"; that was the gain the Lord contemplated for them; and, as far as I understand it, the kingdom is great gain.<a name=338:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are two ways in which I wish to speak of the kingdom -- as a <i>test</i> and as a <i>reward</i>.<a name=339:4></a> I think the kingdom is presented in both these lights.<a name=339:5></a> The kingdom is presented clearly in the shape of a test; you are to <i>seek</i> first the kingdom of God.<a name=339:6></a> So too in the passage I read in 2 Thessalonians, you <i>suffer</i> for the kingdom of God, and in the epistle to the Ephesians, you <i>fight</i> for it; the kingdom is thus a test for faith, you seek it, you suffer for it, and you fight for it.<a name=339:7></a> But then you come to the reward; you are accounted worthy of the kingdom for which you suffer, that is, you get the privilege of reigning with Christ.<a name=339:8></a> When Christ takes the kingdom and reigns when He comes again in power, then the part of the saints will be that they will be accounted worthy of the kingdom for which they have suffered.<a name=339:9></a> And even in the present we have great gain in the kingdom.<a name=339:10></a>

		Now I want to show you the effect of the kingdom of God upon us -- how you are affected by being under the sway of grace; this comes out in the teaching of grace.<a name=340:8></a> A verse in Titus wonderfully describes the teaching of grace; it works in this way, that we live "soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world".<a name=340:9></a> You are separated from the spirit and principle of the age.<a name=340:10></a> The age is the contrast to these principles; you could not say that man is marked by sobriety, or righteousness, or piety!<a name=340:11></a> But the heart, under the sway of grace, is taught that "denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world".<a name=340:12></a> Now, is that not <i>right</i>,

		Now righteousness undoubtedly separates you from the course of the world.<a name=341:14></a> Any man who is accustomed to walk in self-judgment is practically separated from the world, for it is impossible for him to go on with those who do not walk in self-judgment; there is that distance between him and the unconverted man.<a name=341:15></a> The unconverted man is not exercised as regards holiness, and he could not be pursuing it, because he does not carry out righteousness, and that is the true way to holiness.<a name=341:16></a> He might not break out into anything gross, but he is not concerned with regard to holiness, and it is impossible for the Christian to go

		But further, we have piety.<a name=342:2></a> I think that piety means the sense of God's care in regard of every necessity of this life, so that one is not governed by mere worldly prudence or forethought.<a name=342:3></a> Confidence in the care and goodness of God is what I understand by piety.<a name=342:4></a> Faith carries me into God's things, piety brings God into my things.<a name=342:5></a> Now that is the effect of being under the sway of grace.<a name=342:6></a> My course and ways are not ordered according to human prudence, but in confidence in God.<a name=342:7></a> As the apostle says to Timothy, "Therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe".<a name=342:8></a> Seek the kingdom of God, and the effect will be greatly to separate you from the spirit and principle of the age in which you are, because your mind is governed by principles different from those which rule in the world -- by sobriety, and righteousness, and piety; and these things do not contribute to the glory of man.<a name=342:9></a> If a man is to have part in the glory of the world, there must be a considerable amount of self-confidence with him -- he must not be too morally punctilious; and he cannot be pious, because he must be governed by the principles, and maxims, and spirit of this world, and they have nothing to do with denying ungodliness and worldly lusts; but in having done this you find yourself against the current of this world, and it brings you to suffering, and a Christian must be prepared to suffer loss in this world.<a name=342:10></a> It is a question of the glory of this moment, or of the glory of the <i>Lord</i>; and if you have glory with men, you will not have glory with the Lord.<a name=342:11></a>

		Another point I want to dwell upon is the intimate connection between grace and glory.<a name=347:1></a> If you turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:2">Romans  5:2</a>, you will see it there; "By whom also" -- that is, by the Lord Jesus Christ -- "we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=347:2></a> In the passage I read tonight it says, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=347:3></a> The teaching of grace leads us to look for the appearing of the glory.<a name=347:4></a> The connection is this, that grace fits you for glory; you are thus fitted for glory at the very outset, but the more you become acquainted with the grace of God, the more perfectly you are at home, as it were, in the thought of the glory of God.<a name=347:5></a> I could not understand what it is to have part in the glory of God if I did not see that I stand in grace, and apprehend the connection of grace with the glory of God.<a name=347:6></a> The glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ is, as I understand it, the full display in their result of the purposes of God's grace; God's purposes of grace are His glory.<a name=347:7></a> The glory of a man is that which he cherishes in his inmost heart, and in a certain sense it is that which God cherishes; so that the glory of God is that in which the heart of God delights and will display itself, and this is in the purposes of His grace; and everything looks forward to the full display of this.<a name=347:8></a> These purposes dawned very early in Scripture.<a name=347:9></a> The first real expression of the purposes of God's grace was in the promises that He made to Abraham.<a name=347:10></a> He

		engaged Himself in blessing to Abraham, and said, "In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed", it was the beginning of the revelation of God's purposes of grace.<a name=348:1></a> No doubt you get a hint of grace in the judgment on the serpent, that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the serpent.<a name=348:2></a> The seed of the woman was the Son of God, and the Son of God was the vessel of grace, and was to bruise the head of the serpent.<a name=348:3></a> But the first distinct intimation of God's purposes of grace came out, as I said, in the promise to Abraham.<a name=348:4></a> Now, when all is displayed in its full result, when all these purposes are accomplished in Christ (for all are centred and will be accomplished in Him), the great display of them will be the glory of God, and that is what I understand we rejoice in hope of, and so we can look for it.<a name=348:5></a> And the more I come under the influence of divine grace, the more ready I am for the display of the glory -- I look for the glory, for after all the glory is akin to the grace that I know.<a name=348:6></a> It is of immense importance to connect together grace and glory.<a name=348:7></a> Do you remember an expression in the Psalms, "To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary"?<a name=348:8></a> If we know God in the sanctuary, that is, in the blessed secret of His grace, nothing will content us except the hope of God's glory.<a name=348:9></a> The thought is a positive delight to me that the more I am acquainted with the grace of God, the closer I am really brought to the glory.<a name=348:10></a> The same holds good, too, in regard of Christ, the more I become acquainted with grace, the more I am in the light of the glory of the Lord.<a name=348:11></a> That is the connection in which the two things stand here, that where the heart is established in grace, the natural outlook is, "Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=348:12></a> When all comes to light, when the blessed display of grace comes to pass, then will be the glory of God's grace, and we shall find ourselves perfectly at home in it; the glory comes in to the delight of the soul, because,

		My reason for speaking on a previous occasion of the kingdom was the very great practical effect on each one of us of a proper apprehension of its existence.<a name=350:1></a> I noticed that the apostle Paul is found at the end of the Acts "preaching the kingdom of God".<a name=350:2></a> It was evidently an important subject of the apostle's testimony.<a name=350:3></a> It began with Peter, and Paul takes up the theme, no doubt with fuller light.<a name=350:4></a> I referred also to the two great features of the kingdom -- Christ exalted and glorified, not yet seated on His own throne, but made Lord and Christ at the right hand of God, and the Spirit down here; that is, a power equivalent to the authority at the right hand of God.<a name=350:5></a> Now I feel sure that if you do not understand that, you do not understand the kingdom, for the kingdom is a <i>spiritual</i> kingdom; and though it has the features of a kingdom, it is not yet manifested.<a name=350:6></a> That it is a spiritual kingdom is proved by the fact of its being maintained by the power of the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=350:7></a> You could not have the authority of the Lord maintained down here except by the power of the Holy Spirit -- no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Spirit -- you have <i>no sense</i> of the authority of the Lord Jesus but by the Holy Spirit.<a name=350:8></a> To understand the kingdom we must of necessity have the lordship of Christ before us as a reality, and to that end it is maintained not only in word, but <i>in power</i>.<a name=350:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are three points in reference to the kingdom that I want to bring before you.<a name=350:10></a> First, the <i>Law</i> of the kingdom; and when I say law I do not use the word in a technical and limited sense, but meaning by it the principle of the kingdom, in the same way that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=351>[Page 351]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		one speaks of the "laws of nature", law in the sense of rule or principle.<a name=351:1></a> Then the second point is how that law is maintained, so that it should be efficient in regard of us, for it must be maintained in some way.<a name=351:2></a> And my third point is the application of the law of the kingdom to us, how it is intended to affect saints.<a name=351:3></a> I think that you will get help from the consideration of these things -- not directly from what I say, but it may arouse the question in your minds -- and you will find that there is great practical benefit to be derived from the kingdom.<a name=351:4></a> But I come to my first point: <i>the law of the kingdom</i>.<a name=351:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the hand of man the kingdom has become a great mustard tree, and the principle of the kingdom is law, and I use the word now in its limited and technical sense; men have availed themselves of the kingdom, and have adapted it to the world.<a name=351:6></a> Kings and queens profess to rule "by the grace of God", but in their hands the principle of the kingdom could not be grace; this is not possible, for they could not govern on that principle in the existing state of things, and so if man takes up the kingdom, the principle must of necessity be law: no other principle is possible in the world.<a name=351:7></a> The kingdom in the hand of man has thus been falsified, in that a principle has been introduced absolutely foreign to the thought of God.<a name=351:8></a> Now the simple principle of the kingdom is <i>grace</i>, and a verse will prove this to you; "As sin hath reigned unto death, even so might <i>grace</i> reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=351:9></a> The kingdom in the divine thought of it is the <i>reign of grace</i>.<a name=351:10></a> You get the same thought expressed in the scripture I read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need;" that is, grace is <i>enthroned</i>, and that is the thought of the kingdom according to God.<a name=351:11></a> I have no doubt whatever that when the kingdom is set up manifestly, when Christ has come to take up the government

		<a name=352>[Page 352]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		here, the kingdom will have that character.<a name=352:1></a> The law was given by the disposition of angels, but the world to come is put under the Son of man because the foundation of the world to come is in redemption; so in that day grace will reign through righteousness unto eternal life.<a name=352:2></a> We antedate that time and apprehend that the principle of the kingdom is grace.<a name=352:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom being founded on righteousness, sin is not imputed; hence we are not under law, but under grace, and so we can "come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=352:4></a> It is a wonderful thing to find <i>mercy</i> and <i>grace</i>.<a name=352:5></a> I have experienced this for myself, and have seen it in its application to others.<a name=352:6></a> Saints are sometimes brought into very great straits; their way almost shut up, they come into extremity; but though they may be put thus through trial and sorrow for their good, yet mercy and grace come in, for they are not under law, but under grace.<a name=352:7></a> But you cannot come to the throne of grace with self-assertion; you must come in lowliness, and then you will find mercy and grace to help.<a name=352:8></a> And grace <i>reigns</i> unto eternal life.<a name=352:9></a> I do not think that the idea in that is to put eternal life off to the future: it is the end in view; grace must result in eternal life, and sin resulted in death.<a name=352:10></a> It is sometimes said that eternal life is generally future in Paul's writings; but Paul does not, I judge, intend to present eternal life in the future, but in a <i>moral</i> sense, For instance he speaks of our having our fruit unto holiness, and, "the <i>end</i> everlasting life" -- that does not put it off to the future; and so, too, in writing to Timothy he says: "Lay hold on eternal life", and again to the Galatians, "He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting".<a name=352:11></a> The reaping-time is <i>now</i>; you reap eternal life of the Spirit.<a name=352:12></a> Well, my first point is that the law of the kingdom is <i>grace</i>, and I would say, Get your eye off what men have made of

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is a little difficult to make clear, but I trust the Lord may give me grace to convey to you what is before me.<a name=353:2></a> It is how the principle of the kingdom is practically maintained.<a name=353:3></a> Now I do not doubt for a moment that this is by <i>priesthood</i>, and I do not see how it could be maintained otherwise.<a name=353:4></a> We could not be maintained in the liberty of grace apart from priesthood.<a name=353:5></a> The first mention of priesthood in the Old Testament was when Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings; Melchisedec, the priest of the Most High God, met him, and brought forth bread and wine.<a name=353:6></a> At any rate we get in that incident the idea of support and of joy ministered to Abraham, the man of God, and it was after the slaughter of the enemies.<a name=353:7></a> It was the expression of the divine mind in regard of Abraham; it was the pleasure of God to minister to Abraham, in whom the people of God were foreseen.<a name=353:8></a>

		Now in looking at the passage in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:11">Zechariah  6:11</a>, etc.<a name=353:9></a>, we pass on to the future.<a name=353:10></a> Joshua, the high priest, who was crowned, was not the Branch; he simply represented the Branch.<a name=353:11></a> Of Him we read that He sits and rules upon His throne; He is King upon the throne of David.<a name=353:12></a> There are two very distinct thoughts in the passage; one is that He is <i>King</i>, He "shall sit and rule upon his throne;" and the other, "He shall be a <i>priest</i> upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both" -- that is, the establishment of peace is dependent upon the throne and the priesthood.<a name=353:13></a> In the millennium, the throne and the priesthood will be combined in <i>Christ</i>.<a name=353:14></a> He is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=353:15></a> Then the people of God will have the counsel of peace, and they will experience too the support and refreshment that the Lord will bring forth to them.<a name=353:16></a> He will fulfil the type of Moses and Aaron, who, on the day of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, for the application of priesthood to us, we may look at the end of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>.<a name=354:8></a> Christ has passed through the heavens -- a figure taken, no doubt, from the high priest on the day of atonement, for, as we have seen, Christ is not yet upon His throne.<a name=354:9></a> It is evident that the object of the priesthood of Christ is that <i>grace</i> may be available to us, that we may come "boldly" to the throne of grace, to find grace for daily need.<a name=354:10></a> We do not come there for the assuring of our hearts that we are forgiven our sins -- that is not the idea of it; but it is available for saints in their course down here.<a name=354:11></a> There are two forms of pressure under which we come, <i>weakness</i> within and <i>pressure</i> from without; there are few people who do not know something of both.<a name=354:12></a> As conscious of weakness, we need, not just bread and wine, but grace and mercy: grace in regard of weakness within, and mercy in regard to pressure without.<a name=354:13></a> If people are callous and indifferent or hard, they do not get the experience of grace; but if on the other hand, they are lowly, they experience both grace and mercy.<a name=354:14></a> It is not the thought of God that we should be shut up in extremity, but that we should obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=354:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Priesthood stands in contrast to mediatorship.<a name=355:1></a> In the provision of a Mediator, God has bridged the distance between Himself and man; that was the thought of grace.<a name=355:2></a> God had to be glorified, righteousness to be secured, and God to be revealed, and all that has been effected; but with all that, the thought of grace was to bridge the distance between God and man, and that in a <i>moral</i> sense.<a name=355:3></a> Now in the Mediator this is effected; we find "there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus", and in the fact of the one Mediator, and of His having given Himself a ransom for all, the distance between God and man has been annulled on God's side.<a name=355:4></a> In the Mediator, God has brought Himself close to man, so that the testimony of the gospel goes out to man; God can approach man thus.<a name=355:5></a> He would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth; He can approach man thus, because the infinite distance between Himself and man has been removed in the Mediator and in His work.<a name=355:6></a> God presents Himself now to man as a "<i>Saviour God</i>".<a name=355:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the distance had also to be bridged on man's side, as to his sense of things; approach to God had to be secured practically, and what makes it practical is the <i>priest</i>.<a name=355:8></a> Priesthood is essential to us, that in our minds the distance between <i>man</i> and God might be abolished; and you do not understand this except as you enter into the reality of priesthood.<a name=355:9></a> I feel sure we do not appreciate the place that priesthood fills in the divine economy; we see the testimony of God going out world-wide, because the distance between <i>God</i> and man has been bridged in the Mediator; but saints are not so sensible of how the distance is gone between <i>man</i> and God, bridged through the Priest.<a name=355:10></a> The Priest is Representative of His people; that is clear: He does not represent God, but the people of God.<a name=355:11></a> He "ever liveth to make intercession for them".<a name=355:12></a> Aaron was representative of Israel, and now Christ

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the One who is our Representative in the presence of God is One who can feel with us in our weakness and infirmity here; that is a great point to get hold of; and thus it is we learn how the distance is gone between ourselves and God, the righteous One is our righteousness in the presence of God, and sympathises with us in our infirmities.<a name=356:4></a> Now, you will admit that this is a different thought from that of the Mediator; the Mediator is not for the people of God; the Mediator has to say on the part of God to the unconverted; the Mediator is between God and men, and its application is universal -- He gave Himself a ransom for all -- but the Priest is not for the unconverted, but is Representative of the people of God -- that is, of the converted.<a name=356:5></a> He is before the face of God for them, and sympathises with them in the pressure under which they are.<a name=356:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most wonderful to think that a divine Person is our Representative in the presence of God, and at the same time able, as a Man, to sympathise with us in our weakness and infirmity down here.<a name=356:7></a> It has been said that priesthood is for the prevention of failure -- to help us in our pressure.<a name=356:8></a> Now, that is a great point, and we must all acknowledge how much we miss from not having a more real sense of the Priest.<a name=356:9></a> He is at the right hand of God interceding for us, for His people.<a name=356:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, you have the sense that you can come boldly to the throne of <i>grace</i>, that you may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=356:11></a> I do not want to go to God for this or that to improve my circumstances

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Priesthood is the divinely-ordained way that grace might be in the ascendant in the hearts of the saints, that they should be conscious of and use the throne of <i>grace</i>, and I do not think that in any other way people could be conscious that the way is open to God.<a name=357:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to follow the distinction I have drawn between the Mediator and the Priest; there can be no failure in God's approach to man in the Mediator, but in the question of our approach to God there may be much failure to appropriate the Priest.<a name=357:6></a> We cannot fail to see how everything has been falsified in Christendom: they have set up a priesthood in imitation of Judaism, for when failure comes in, men will go back to a former dispensation.<a name=357:7></a> The Galatians were going back to law and circumcision; and Christendom in the same way has gone back to a priesthood after the flesh, which I should repudiate emphatically.<a name=357:8></a> The truth is that the king and the priest must go together, and I do not care for any priest who is not also king.<a name=357:9></a> In Christ we find the King and the Priest and the Prophet all combined; He who is Priest at the right hand of God is both Lord and Christ.<a name=357:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to my third point: why we are placed under grace down here.<a name=357:11></a> It is that we might have our senses exercised to discern between good and evil.<a name=357:12></a> You can carry out righteousness only in the presence of grace.<a name=357:13></a> You could not walk in self-judgment except as in the sense of grace, that is, that sin is not imputed; <i>then</i> it is that I can judge sin in myself, and that is

		the first principle of righteousness in a Christian.<a name=358:1></a> If my mind is assaulted by evil -- evil thought or evil conception -- I have to humble myself that I should have allowed myself to be thus overcome, even for a moment; but in so doing I judge myself; I do not remain there.<a name=358:2></a> It is in the very fact of my being under grace that I have ability thus to judge myself.<a name=358:3></a> If 'clouds have dimmed my sight', having judged myself, I find out that Christ is as bright to me as ever -- 'Towards me as e'er Thou'rt bright'.<a name=358:4></a> And the result of all that is, you have your senses exercised to discern between good and evil.<a name=358:5></a> Did you ever judge yourself before you were converted?<a name=358:6></a> No, you could not; unconverted people could have no clear sense of good and evil, because they do not judge themselves in regard to <i>God</i>; they may judge themselves by their fellows, but not in the light of <i>God</i>; they do not think of judging the thoughts and intents of their hearts.<a name=358:7></a> Many brought up in the light of christianity are straightforward and honourable in regard to their fellow-men, but they do not judge <i>themselves</i>; and that is the first principle of righteousness.<a name=358:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the result of being under grace is that, having your senses exercised to discern between good and evil, it produces the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and that leads to fruit unto holiness.<a name=358:9></a> There is the practice of righteousness and advance in holiness, and righteousness and holiness are the characteristics of the new man.<a name=358:10></a> The new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth; for you could not get righteousness and holiness apart from truth: it all comes out in the light of the blessed revelation of God; it is there that you reach righteousness and holiness.<a name=358:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought, in this present course of lectures, is to take up successively various <i>names</i> under which Christ is presented to us in the New Testament in their own import, and in their bearing in regard to ourselves.<a name=361:1></a> It is plain that under whatever name Christ may be presented to us, our knowledge of Him must be according to that name and it may be added that no one name can be lost in another.<a name=361:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there are many names under which Christ is spoken of, each having its own significance.<a name=361:3></a> You may not enter into that all in a moment, but the learning of it is the way in which we come to the knowledge of Christ.<a name=361:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of a <i>name</i> the idea I intend to convey is of that which is set forth in the person who bears that name.<a name=361:5></a> So if I speak of Christ by a name, that name indicates something which is set forth in Him.<a name=361:6></a> Another idea connected with name is that of <i>renown</i>.<a name=361:7></a> God has given Him a name which is above every name.<a name=361:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To make the matter plainer, if I speak of Christ as <i>Mediator</i>; that is a name which attaches to Him -- and which sets forth what He is as from God to man.<a name=361:9></a> I may speak of Him also as the <i>Son of God</i>; that is a name said to be inherited, which shows His superiority to angels.<a name=361:10></a> If I speak of Him as <i>Lord</i>; He bears that name, and it sets forth His relation to us down here, and ours to Him.<a name=361:11></a> Again I may speak of Him as <i>Head</i>; and that indicates what is set forth in Him in relation to the Church -- His body.<a name=361:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to those names to give you shortly an idea of what is before me; but I would desire now to present to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=362>[Page 362]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you the <i>Mediator</i> and its import to man.<a name=362:1></a> I begin there because that is really God's true starting point as regards man.<a name=362:2></a> His beginning is the presentation of Himself in grace to man in a mediator.<a name=362:3></a> That may not be the first thing which people understand, for many a person has faith in Christ who understand very little indeed of the import of the Mediator, and I doubt if such have really the full good of it.<a name=362:4></a> They apprehend Christ as a Saviour: they have faith in the efficacy of His sacrifice; that is the case with thousands of Christians; and yet they have very little sense of the <i>import</i> of any particular name which belongs to Christ.<a name=362:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the name <i>Mediator</i> stands in connection with the attitude which God has taken up towards man, namely, that of a <i>Saviour God</i>, for that has necessitated the Mediator.<a name=362:6></a> Everything which God does is, in a sense, a moral necessity flowing from what He is, and there is nothing that He does which is really arbitrary.<a name=362:7></a> There are certain moral consequences which must flow from what God is, and if God was to come out as a Saviour there must be the Mediator.<a name=362:8></a> As far as I can judge it was by a mediator alone that God was able to approach man in grace.<a name=362:9></a> It was not possible otherwise.<a name=362:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In taking up the name of Mediator, I purpose to give you some simple and plain thoughts in connection with the subject, and then to illustrate it.<a name=362:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And here I may say that it is really of very little good to speak of what is set forth in Christ, unless it is to have some moral power and influence over us; and that it may have this is my desire.<a name=362:12></a> I have no idea of attempting to form the minds of people, but I would seek to set forth that which will have its own effect upon you morally.<a name=362:13></a> I want you to be affected by <i>the truth</i>, and the truth is, <i>that which may be known of God</i> -- that is what is revealed.<a name=362:14></a> This ought to have the most powerful influence and effect upon every one of us.<a name=362:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There appears to me to be a connection between what is presented in the two passages which I have read:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=363>[Page 363]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the thought in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>is kindred to that of mediatorship in Timothy, "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=363:1></a> In this verse we have the principle of mediatorship in connection with the ministry of reconciliation.<a name=363:2></a> The passage shows us the attitude of God when Christ was here on earth.<a name=363:3></a> God presented Himself to men, in a man, the Man Christ Jesus; in the Mediator.<a name=363:4></a> God approached men, but did not impute unto them their trespasses.<a name=363:5></a> He had another mind: He was reconciling the world unto Himself.<a name=363:6></a> We hear Christ saying when He was on earth, "Neither do I condemn thee".<a name=363:7></a> He was not imputing trespasses.<a name=363:8></a> To others also He said as they came to Him: "Go in peace", and, "Thy sins are forgiven thee".<a name=363:9></a> It was evident that God was not imputing unto men their trespasses, but that on the other hand, He was reconciling the world unto Himself.<a name=363:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you what mediatorship implies.<a name=363:11></a> Not that I know very much about it myself; I can speak of it only according to measure, but my impression is that a great many Christians are very indefinite indeed in their thoughts in regard to the Mediator.<a name=363:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A mediator is one in whom God addresses Himself to man.<a name=363:13></a> That is certain enough.<a name=363:14></a> You could not read the passage in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>without getting that impression.<a name=363:15></a> "For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus".<a name=363:16></a> The Mediator is man-ward from God, and is a necessity consequent on the will of God to present Himself in the character of a <i>Saviour</i> God.<a name=363:17></a> Apart from the Mediator, such a presentation was impossible.<a name=363:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first statement in verse 5 is: "There is one God", or, as the passage would possibly be more correctly read, "God is one".<a name=363:19></a> In the Godhead there is no possible divergence of mind, or of purpose, or of judgment.<a name=363:20></a> The Lord Jesus when here upon earth

		could say: "I and my Father are one".<a name=364:1></a> So that while, on the one hand, there is distinction of Persons; on the other, God is one, in perfect unity of mind, spirit and purpose.<a name=364:2></a> That is a first principle in our thoughts of God.<a name=364:3></a> The truth that comes out in the Old Testament is: "Jehovah our God is one Lord", but in the New Testament it is, "God is one".<a name=364:4></a> In Christianity God is fully revealed, in the Persons of the Godhead.<a name=364:5></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:19">Colossians  1:19</a>: "In him was all the fulness pleased to dwell".<a name=364:6></a> The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, have all come to light in Christ, and hence we find the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>, enjoining the disciples to go and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<a name=364:7></a> But while we have God thus fully revealed, the truth remains that, "God is one".<a name=364:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then follows "there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus".<a name=364:9></a> There is not a variety of mediators but <i>one</i>, and the application of this is <i>universal</i>, for "God would have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth".<a name=364:10></a> There is <i>unity</i> in the Godhead, and <i>universality</i> in regard of the Mediator.<a name=364:11></a> It was not one mediator for the Jew and another for the Gentile, it was one towards all.<a name=364:12></a> It is connected with the presentation of God, and with that, of God's approach to man.<a name=364:13></a> God had approached man in Christ.<a name=364:14></a> "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=364:15></a> God is declared in the Mediator, He has by Him come close to man.<a name=364:16></a> That is a point of the greatest importance in one's thoughts of God.<a name=364:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have long been accustomed to the idea of the Trinity, which, though true, is a human expression.<a name=364:18></a> I very much prefer scriptural expressions, and the expression with regard to the Godhead is this: "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=364:19></a> The expressions of Scripture are safer than human expressions, for the latter may fail you sometime.<a name=364:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to certain things which are descriptive of the Mediator.<a name=365:1></a> One is, that He is <i>Man</i>.<a name=365:2></a> There is a significance in the way in which the name is put here.<a name=365:3></a> It is not "Jesus Christ", but "the man Christ Jesus".<a name=365:4></a> That is one mark of the Mediator, and the other is, "who gave himself a ransom for all".<a name=365:5></a> If you apprehend the force of these two points, you will enter into the idea of the Mediator.<a name=365:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going to speak a little on these two points, and to show the effect which the apprehension of them has upon us.<a name=365:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the Man Christ Jesus is the Mediator between God and men, then He must be <i>of God</i>, and therefore <i>according to God</i>.<a name=365:8></a> The mediator could not be a fallen man, and if not a fallen man, then He must be a Man of another order altogether; He could not be mediator if He were not according to God.<a name=365:9></a> Now that is a point which I want everyone to take in, because the introduction of a man of another order is of the greatest possible moment to us.<a name=365:10></a> It is unlikely that God can have <i>two</i> orders of man before Him, and if He brings in a man of another order, then the first order of man is displaced; and if you do not understand that, you do not understand Christianity.<a name=365:11></a> That is what led me to refer to <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=365:12></a> The first man is completely displaced by Christ coming in, and now, "If any man be in Christ, it is new creation".<a name=365:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now turn to the few verses I read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=365:14></a> "God was in Christ".<a name=365:15></a> When Christ was here on earth, do you think that fallen man was under the eye of God?<a name=365:16></a> No, the One who was under His eye was Christ, not fallen man.<a name=365:17></a> When Christ was born into the world, the angels praised God, saying, "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good pleasure in man"; but in what man?<a name=365:18></a> Certainly not in fallen man; it was in Christ, another man altogether.<a name=365:19></a> There was plenty of praise there.<a name=365:20></a> A multitude of the heavenly host praising God at the introduction of another man;

		a Man of another order; the Mediator.<a name=366:1></a> I want you all to appreciate the wonderful way of God's approach to man.<a name=366:2></a> God approached men in a Man who was to displace every other man; and when that Man came in, it could not but be that the first man was displaced before God.<a name=366:3></a> The Man who was here under God's eye, was Christ.<a name=366:4></a> He was the heavenly Man.<a name=366:5></a> He could say, "My Father gives you the true bread from heaven".<a name=366:6></a> I admit that He had come into the line of the first man, being made of a woman, made under law, but that was that He might die for all.<a name=366:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings me to the second point.<a name=366:8></a> "He gave himself a ransom for all".<a name=366:9></a> He was not going to reinstate man.<a name=366:10></a> "If one died for all, then all were dead".<a name=366:11></a> He was not minded to revive them in the old condition.<a name=366:12></a> He died to secure a claim upon all; His death was the proof and evidence of all being dead, for if one died for all it is plain that all were dead, and "He died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again".<a name=366:13></a> Christ died and rose again, and we as Christians are of His order: we must be so.<a name=366:14></a> Christ gave Himself a ransom for all, that He might have a place in and claim upon all; that is the thought of the passage.<a name=366:15></a> There were other questions in the death of Christ, but the point of which I speak now, is the giving Himself a ransom for all, to establish His right over all.<a name=366:16></a> My first point is, "the man Christ Jesus;" the second, "He gave himself a ransom for all;" and the effect of that is, that He is the <i>Head</i> of all: He is Head of every man, and if Head of every man, then the first man is displaced.<a name=366:17></a>

		Christ was never like the first man, Adam.<a name=366:18></a> Adam was perfect as God's work, innocent and intelligent; but without knowledge of good and evil; that was not like Christ.<a name=366:19></a> There was little similarity between Christ and Adam save as to sinlessness; and the <i>new man</i> is not like Adam, for he is created after God, in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=366:20></a> Christ was here in perfect

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, that the Head of every man is Christ, and in Ephesians, that "He has ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=367:4></a> The idea connected with Head is, that He <i>fills</i>.<a name=367:5></a> He is entitled to fill, and the position He has now with regard to every man is, that He is Head, to fill all.<a name=367:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how can Christ fill if there is no room for Him?<a name=367:7></a> Room must be made -- He must displace everything else.<a name=367:8></a> The fact of Christ's filling must of necessity displace what is already there.<a name=367:9></a> We get this idea expressed in the passage, "If one died for all, then were all dead: and he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again".<a name=367:10></a> They are subdued too and take character from Christ.<a name=367:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to see how very far this goes.<a name=367:12></a> Every Christian in the world would acknowledge that Christ has a claim upon him, but the point is, is he content to have everything in him displaced, so that Christ should fill?<a name=367:13></a> For if He fills, there is no room for anything else.<a name=367:14></a> A great many people are content with sentiments in regard of Christ.<a name=367:15></a> They know His grace, and thus they cannot help having sentiments in regard of Him; but the point is to have everything in you displaced so that Christ should fill.<a name=367:16></a> But someone might say, 'If everything in me is to be displaced, that would displace natural affections too'; but really natural affections could not be displaced if you would, yet they may be displaced as to the undue place they have in the hearts of people; and when Christ comes in, the old things are displaced: old things have passed away and new things have come to pass.<a name=367:17></a>

		Now I want to illustrate to you the working of these things, and to show that all is effected through the Mediator.<a name=368:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to four passages in Luke's gospel and I may say that these passages are found only in Luke.<a name=368:2></a> The first is in chapter 7: I refer to the case of the woman of the city who was a sinner.<a name=368:3></a> There you get the beginning of Christ's filling.<a name=368:4></a> She was displaced.<a name=368:5></a> She loved much; she was forgiven much: she was displaced, and Christ had the affection of her soul as <i>Saviour</i>.<a name=368:6></a> She had no knowledge of Christ beyond this; but that is the beginning of displacement, though it has to go on to completion.<a name=368:7></a> Another thing is, that it has to be effected in the saints here on earth.<a name=368:8></a> Christ gained a place in the woman's heart by His grace; and if you apprehend the wisdom and grace manifest in the place which Christ has taken as Mediator, and the fact that He gave Himself a ransom for all, it is totally impossible but that your heart should have affection for Him.<a name=368:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things which strike me in connection with mediatorship.<a name=368:10></a> On the one hand, the wisdom of God which devised the Mediator; and on the other, the grace of Christ, which led Him to come down under the judgment of God on man.<a name=368:11></a> What could God do for man except to displace him; but He did it by the introduction of another Man -- of Christ -- that He might fill all things.<a name=368:12></a> Everybody should be struck with the way of God's approach to man: in the person of another Man -- the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=368:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to chapter 10 to the parable of the good Samaritan.<a name=368:14></a> The Lord had in chapter 7 gained the affection of the woman.<a name=368:15></a> She had found a Saviour, and He had gained her heart; but in the parable of the good Samaritan, the man who had fallen among thieves found not only a Saviour but a <i>neighbour</i> -- One who would charge Himself with him, to care for him so long as he was in need of care.<a name=368:16></a> It was not simply that the good Samaritan had engaged the man's affections, but he brought home to him the consciousness: 'I have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come next to chapter 15, to the parable of the prodigal son.<a name=369:3></a> What we find here is, that the repentant man is <i>invested</i> in a robe brought forth from the Father's treasures.<a name=369:4></a> It presents the thought of a soul being clothed in Christ and having the acceptance of <i>that Man</i> in the presence of God.<a name=369:5></a> Morally the prodigal has disappeared, and nothing but Christ is seen.<a name=369:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, in the case of the thief on the cross in chapter 23, we learn that one who had possibly been a murderer is to be so completely <i>divested</i> of himself that he can be a companion of Christ for paradise.<a name=369:7></a> He is not simply <i>invested</i> in Christ, but completely <i>divested</i> of self.<a name=369:8></a> The Lord said to the thief, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise", and if he was going to be in paradise with Christ, it must be as entirely apart from himself -- not a bit of the thief could go to paradise, and it is of the greatest importance that we should apprehend this.<a name=369:9></a> I do not think that anyone who realised the truth of this would, if called upon to serve the Lord in any way, placard himself as a converted thief or in regard of anything that had made him notorious here.<a name=369:10></a> A man is divested of all, that he may be all for Christ.<a name=369:11></a> Our hearts should be in the good of that now, so as not to leave it to the end of our journey.<a name=369:12></a> If I understand the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, that Man is intended to displace everything, to displace me, in order that I might practically prefer Christ to myself.<a name=369:13></a> I naturally prefer myself to Christ, but if I am displaced I prefer Christ to myself, and He then rules in my heart; I give Him His place.<a name=369:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Mediator has come in to take the position of Head of every man, and it is in order to fill every man.<a name=369:15></a> If a man be not filled by Him, that man will disappear from the scene of God's blessing.<a name=369:16></a> Christ has ascended

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is blessed to think of Christ's place -- an acquired place in a sense -- in relation to man.<a name=370:2></a> Head of every man; to fill every man.<a name=370:3></a> We are prone to cling tenaciously to things in this world, liking to have a status here; and the practical result is, that we are unwilling to be filled by Christ.<a name=370:4></a> We often obstruct; what I would desire is our recognition of the title of Christ to fill, then we should be prepared to be displaced by Christ, for He displaces that which otherwise God would condemn.<a name=370:5></a> He displaced on the cross the man that was under the condemnation and judgment of God, bearing his judgment that he might be practically displaced in us.<a name=370:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Mediator is the beginning of God's testimony; He is, as we have seen, from God and according to God.<a name=370:7></a> God presents Himself in the Mediator, and He is still the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=370:8></a> He has come forth out of death, that He might become everything to the heart of the Christian.<a name=370:9></a> He is my Saviour, my Neighbour.<a name=370:10></a> I am accepted and invested in Him, and by His death divested of self.<a name=370:11></a> We should have the deepest sense of the grace and wisdom of God in approaching men in a Man, so that by a Man He should displace the man who was under the condemnation of God.<a name=370:12></a> God could have swept the whole scene in judgment, but with God it was a question of displacement, not of judgment, and that takes place now in those who are content to be displaced.<a name=370:13></a> One is content to be displaced, because displacement means that we are the companions of Christ in real joy and supreme happiness.<a name=370:14></a>

		I do not think that I am without a sense of the gravity of speaking on the subject before me.<a name=371:1></a> We have previously contemplated Christ as Mediator; now I want to present Him to you in another aspect, namely, as the Son of God.<a name=371:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel almost bewildered in attempting to do this, because what is connected with Him as "Son of God" is so vast, that it is most difficult to select any definite thoughts to bring before you in this connection.<a name=371:3></a> But I wish to dwell upon Christ as "Son of God"; and to show you what is <i>distinctive</i> of Him as such.<a name=371:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many designations of Christ in Scripture, as "the Christ", "Mediator", "Son of man", "Leader of our salvation", "High Priest", the "Word", etc.<a name=371:5></a>, all having application to the same Person, but each at the same time having its own particular significance.<a name=371:6></a> This is true also of the title "Son of God".<a name=371:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to apprehend that the title, "Son of God", is spoken of as a name inherited.<a name=371:8></a> In Hebrews we read: "Being made so much better than the angels, as He hath <i>by inheritance</i> obtained a more excellent name than they".<a name=371:9></a> Then follows a quotation from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, in which Christ is addressed as "Son of God".<a name=371:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are certain things evidently distinctive of the Son of God, and one of them is, the <i>voice</i> of the Son of God.<a name=371:11></a> <i>Voice</i> is distinctive of a person, or of a class.<a name=371:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was the voice of the prophets, the voice of law, and in each dispensation it was a voice from God.<a name=371:13></a> Now it is: "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Glory is also distinctive.<a name=372:2></a> There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon.<a name=372:3></a> And so in regard of divine Persons, there is the glory of the Son and the glory of the Father.<a name=372:4></a> The glory of the Father is not the glory of the Son, neither the glory of the Son that of the Father.<a name=372:5></a> Each has His own distinction.<a name=372:6></a> In chapter 17, the Son prays that He may be glorified.<a name=372:7></a> He says; "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee", and afterwards "Glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was".<a name=372:8></a> And at the close of the chapter, He prays on behalf of those given Him, "That they may behold my glory".<a name=372:9></a> In chapter 1, we have a reference to the glory of the Son, "And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father".<a name=372:10></a> That is not the glory of the Father, but of the Son.<a name=372:11></a> Thus we have the voice of the Son of God in contrast to every other voice, and the glory of the Son in contrast to every other glory.<a name=372:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not want to give you many thoughts, and I have not the notion that I can present to you, in a short lecture like this, all the truth of the Son of God.<a name=372:13></a> I can only attempt to give you one or two leading thoughts in connection with that name.<a name=372:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In studying the gospels, I believe that the key to the understanding of them is the sense that they present to you one and the same Person, though under different aspects.<a name=372:15></a> I have no doubt that a great many would say, we all believe that, but I am not sure whether all have realised it.<a name=372:16></a>

		In the gospel of Matthew, the Son of God comes in on what may be called the line of promise: the line of Abraham and David.<a name=372:17></a> In Mark, He is on the prophetic line.<a name=372:18></a> God had said to Moses, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from among your brethren like unto me".<a name=372:19></a> The Son of God comes in on that line.<a name=372:20></a> In Luke the Son of God comes in on the

		line of divine grace to man as the seed of the woman.<a name=373:1></a> The seed of the woman was to bruise the head of the serpent, and the seed of the woman is the Son of God.<a name=373:2></a> But in John we have something altogether distinctive.<a name=373:3></a> It is not the Son of God come in on the line of promise, nor on the prophetic line, nor on the line of grace to man, but presented entirely on the side of God.<a name=373:4></a> It is the Son revealing the Father and His will.<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two distinct thoughts connected with Christ as the Son of God.<a name=373:6></a> One is, His coming forth to express God; and the other is, to give effect to the counsel of the Father.<a name=373:7></a> He has come in that God may be perfectly expressed, and the Father's will and counsel effected.<a name=373:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There has been the perfect expression of God here in this world in Christ.<a name=373:9></a> But, alas!<a name=373:10></a> the world will not have God, even though perfectly expressed.<a name=373:11></a> They would not have prophets; nor will they have God, and if they will not have God, what remains?<a name=373:12></a> One thing only, that the Father should accomplish in Christ the counsels of His love.<a name=373:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in these two lights that we have the Lord presented to us as Son of God, and that led me to the passages which I have read.<a name=373:14></a> It is said, "No man hath seen God at any time: the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", the point is the declaration of God in the only-begotten Son.<a name=373:15></a> Another point comes out in chapter 17, "These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee; as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<a name=373:16></a> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".<a name=373:17></a> I want you to mark well the close of verse 2, "to as many as thou hast given him".<a name=373:18></a> Here we have the counsel of the Father, and authority was given to Christ over all flesh, not to give eternal life

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The declaration of God, and that which came out in connection with it, was a most serious thing for the world, resulting in what the Lord said when here, "They have both seen and hated, both me and my Father".<a name=374:3></a> The more fully God was declared, the more the opposition of man was brought to light.<a name=374:4></a> It was not the more the light, the less the opposition.<a name=374:5></a> There had been the breaking of the law and opposition to prophets, but the greatest opposition of all on the part of man was brought out by the presence of the Son of God here.<a name=374:6></a> That is the effect of the declaration of God.<a name=374:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You could not speak of any prophet in the way in which you can speak of Christ, for "God was in Christ", and thus God was brought close to man.<a name=374:8></a> A prophet brought God's word close to man, but in the Son, God Himself was here.<a name=374:9></a>

		There is a remarkable expression in Colossians, "In him was all the fulness pleased to dwell".<a name=374:10></a> I understand <i>fulness</i> to mean that which is necessary and adequate for complete display.<a name=374:11></a> All the fulness was pleased to dwell in Christ that there might be the complete display of God in this world, and that came to pass.<a name=374:12></a> "No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=374:13></a> It was the special object for which the Son came forth.<a name=374:14></a> He came forth from the Father, and He came into the world, He brought into the world the full and perfect expression of God's heart and thought in regard to the world, and when He left it, He did not leave it as He found it.<a name=374:15></a> Its god and prince was manifested.<a name=374:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Him the presentation of grace was perfect, and grace met every necessity of man.<a name=375:7></a> I need not allude to the many miracles which the Lord did, or to the compassions of Christ; but it was evidently the pleasure of the Lord to relieve the spirit of man from every pressure under which it was.<a name=375:8></a> Christ was full of grace and full of truth; and, in fact, a man wants more than grace, he wants truth too, for grace is not enough.<a name=375:9></a> Truth is that which is revealed and may be known of God Himself and of His will.<a name=375:10></a> It was the pleasure of God to meet every need of man in grace, and it was equally the pleasure of God to make Himself known to man in Christ.<a name=375:11></a>

		Now there are two present applications to us of the lordship of Christ: first, in the way of administration: and secondly, in the way of discipline.<a name=386:25></a> It is that which makes me say that every Christian carries in himself evidence of the lordship of Christ; and I want now to show you how you get the gain of His administration, and the benefit of His discipline.<a name=386:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point connected with the lordship of Christ, namely, His discipline.<a name=391:9></a> The object of discipline is to give us discernment in connection with good and evil.<a name=391:10></a> I will just refer to two passages in regard to this.<a name=391:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:19">Revelation  3:19</a> we read, "As many as I love I rebuke and chasten".<a name=391:12></a> I would like to alter two words, and read the passage, 'As many as I love I <i>convict</i> and <i>discipline</i>'.<a name=391:13></a> The change may make the sense clearer.<a name=391:14></a> Again, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:4">Ephesians  6:4</a>, "And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord".<a name=391:15></a> Both passages connect distinctly the thought of discipline with the Lord.<a name=391:16></a> The second passage supposes parents to be so acquainted with the discipline of the Lord, as that they are able to bring up their children in it.<a name=391:17></a> How could I bring my children up thus if I did not myself understand the discipline?<a name=391:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there must be in this an end in view, and we have seen that it is that our senses may be better exercised to discern between good and evil, flesh and Spirit, what is of man and what is of God.<a name=391:19></a> You may be certain that the Spirit will bring in nothing but what is of God, nothing of man.<a name=391:20></a> Man, on the other hand, will shut out all that which is of God.<a name=391:21></a> The two things get mixed up in us.<a name=391:22></a> The Christian has the

		Holy Spirit, and he has the flesh; and it takes a good deal of teaching to enable us to discern what springs from the flesh and what from the Spirit.<a name=392:1></a> But in it we are helped by the discipline of the Lord.<a name=392:2></a> Just as you are conscious of the blessings of the kingdom, so you will be conscious of the discipline of the Lord.<a name=392:3></a> I am under His hand, He loves me, and because He loves me He convicts.<a name=392:4></a> He disciplines me that I may find out what is of God and what of man.<a name=392:5></a> There should be perfect division between the two in the mind of the Christian.<a name=392:6></a> This process has to go on in the Christian, and it produces a wonderful effect in his senses.<a name=392:7></a> It is remarkable to find the Lord making such a statement as He does to Laodicea in such a dark day.<a name=392:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show a little further how discipline works.<a name=392:9></a> The conviction to which the Christian is brought is that Christ is <i>Head</i>.<a name=392:10></a> Hence everything must be after Christ.<a name=392:11></a> All that is of man has gone for God in the cross.<a name=392:12></a> Christianity has not come in to improve or reinstate man, but in testimony that he is absolutely set aside in order to make room for the Man that is from heaven -- the second Man.<a name=392:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now I would desire to give you an idea of what is of Christ, and for this purpose turn to a passage in Matthew.<a name=392:14></a> (Chapter 11: 25 - 30.<a name=392:15></a>) This passage brings out, in a divine way, what is after Christ, and in contrast to what is after man.<a name=392:16></a> What is highly esteemed by man is abomination in the sight of God.<a name=392:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To begin with, you get in contrast to the pride and haughtiness of man, "I am meek and lowly in heart".<a name=392:18></a> Meekness and lowliness are not appreciated in the world.<a name=392:19></a> For success in the world a man must have ability, but ability will not serve a man without a good deal of assurance.<a name=392:20></a> If a man does not push himself forward others will not do it for him.<a name=392:21></a> But in Christ everything is the contrast of that.<a name=392:22></a> "I am meek and lowly".<a name=392:23></a>

		All this is after Christ, and He is the Head of every man, the Head of a new race and order.<a name=393:3></a> We have to learn of Him, but before we learn of Him we need to get rest and perception and it is His grace which gives this to us.<a name=393:4></a> It is a great thing to see what is after Christ.<a name=393:5></a> The apostle teaches us in Colossians that everything now is after Christ.<a name=393:6></a> That which is after man fails to secure happiness for man.<a name=393:7></a> The pride and haughtiness of man never give him rest.<a name=393:8></a> The prouder a man is the more he is in danger of being wounded.<a name=393:9></a> But man's title to inherit the earth from God is meekness.<a name=393:10></a> "The meek shall inherit the earth".<a name=393:11></a> And that is reiterated through Scripture.<a name=393:12></a> When the Lord rode into Jerusalem as King, He came "meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass".<a name=393:13></a> The Scriptures were ever looking forward to the One who was to inherit according to God.<a name=393:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to cultivate that which is after Christ: to have everything displaced which is after man, so as not to be in affinity with man but with Christ, the meek and lowly One in whom we see everything which is really of God; who said, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart".<a name=393:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have seen that every Christian carries in himself the proof and evidence of Christ being Lord.<a name=393:16></a> Christ does not reign yet, but the time will come when Jehovah and His Christ will reign.<a name=393:17></a> Christ is meantime at the right hand of God, but not quiescent as to things here.<a name=393:18></a> We see His great act of administration in the gift of the Holy Spirit, and now He is convicting and disciplining those He loves.<a name=393:19></a>

		When God came in to establish a people in relationship with Himself the principle was brought out, that the people must stand in connection with a divinely appointed representative.<a name=397:8></a> That is an important principle in the ways of God.<a name=397:9></a> One who was competent was taken from the people to be a representative of the people in the presence of God.<a name=397:10></a> With the children of Israel Aaron had that place.<a name=397:11></a> He bore the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually.<a name=397:12></a> The names of the twelve tribes were engraven on stones upon the shoulder pieces of the ephod, and he bare them upon his shoulders as well as in the breastplate.<a name=397:13></a> He represented the people typically in power and in love before Jehovah.<a name=397:14></a> He was on the people's behalf before God.<a name=397:15></a>

		now is on the basis of reconciliation, and as far as I understand <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>, this was necessarily consequent on the sin of Nadab and Abihu; their sin altered the position of everything.<a name=398:1></a> Their sin was perhaps the greatest that occurred in the Old Testament, for they profaned God in offering strange fire.<a name=398:2></a> It was, in the eye of God, the gravest sin, since it did not occur on the part of a mere man, but on the part and in the service of those who had the privilege of access to God.<a name=398:3></a> It occurred in the priestly family.<a name=398:4></a> The sin shook the foundation of the priesthood system from the very outset.<a name=398:5></a> As in other cases, this did not appear at once, but the system was undermined.<a name=398:6></a> In any dispensation when evil comes in on the part of man from the outset, God goes on for a time with the dispensation; but when He comes in to judge He goes back to the original offence.<a name=398:7></a> This is illustrated in the children of Israel.<a name=398:8></a> The offence for which they went into captivity to Babylon was the making of the golden calf.<a name=398:9></a> When God could not bear with them any longer they went into captivity; but the real ground of this was the original offence.<a name=398:10></a> So after the sin of Aaron's sons the whole priesthood system after the flesh was gone for God.<a name=398:11></a> God allowed the priesthood to develop, but the sin involved the setting aside of the house of Aaron after the flesh.<a name=398:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle which comes in consequent upon that is reconciliation, which involved that man's <i>state</i> should be judged so that God should be glorified in the judgment of that state.<a name=398:13></a> That is one side.<a name=398:14></a> The other side is that there is now a new point of departure, and everything is to be reconciled <i>through</i> Christ and <i>in</i> Christ.<a name=398:15></a> Man is only fit to be removed, and God has come in to accomplish His purpose in Christ; and hence it is, "If any man be in Christ it is new creation, old things have passed away", etc.<a name=398:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the removal of sin man was removed, and consequent upon that, the distance between God and man was gone; therefore, there was reconciliation.<a name=399:5></a> And on the other side, God takes up everything afresh in the Man who came from heaven, everything now is in Christ.<a name=399:6></a> All is now a simple question of God carrying out His purpose in Christ, everything is to be on that ground.<a name=399:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have seen thus far that priesthood is a divinely appointed principle, and bound up in the day of atonement with the principle of reconciliation.<a name=399:8></a> Christ in regard of His sacrifice took the place of offering-priest, but He Himself was also the victim on behalf of man -- and the man who had offended was in Him removed.<a name=399:9></a> Christ was raised again from the dead on a new platform, and now God makes known in Christ the accomplishment of His purpose.<a name=399:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to turn to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>.<a name=399:11></a> Under the Aaronic priesthood the people received the law.<a name=399:12></a> Aaron did not give the law.<a name=399:13></a> "The law was given by Moses", but the people had it under the Aaronic priesthood, and the law laid down the terms and conditions of approach to God.<a name=399:14></a> If any one did not approach God according to the law he became liable to death, as we see in Nadab and Abihu, who offered strange fire and died.<a name=399:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as we have seen, the Aaronic priesthood broke down from the outset, and God goes back to the Melchisedec order -- outside of limitations which would apply to the flesh.<a name=399:16></a> Christ is outside of all limitations, and is a Priest after the power of an endless life.<a name=399:17></a> It would be futile for God to attempt to carry out His purpose, except in a priest after the power of an endless

		There are three things connected with the hope, namely, place, life, and relationship.<a name=402:6></a> The hope covers all three, and the apostle prays, "That ye may know what is the <i>hope</i> of his calling", that is, of God's purpose.<a name=402:7></a> The calling refers to the heavenly places, to our being before God in love, and to His "having predestinated us to sonship".<a name=402:8></a> And where do you get the light of that?<a name=402:9></a> In Christ, the Son of God.<a name=402:10></a> The word of the oath makes the Son a priest.<a name=402:11></a> God is brought to light and all His counsels, and in these Christ is the Head.<a name=402:12></a> Can you say that you have actually got to heavenly places?<a name=402:13></a> or that you are yet set holy and without blame before God in love?<a name=402:14></a> No; all is presented to us in the shape of a hope.<a name=402:15></a> We apprehend the truth of it in Christ but have not yet got to it.<a name=402:16></a> It is God's purpose about us, and so our portion.<a name=402:17></a>

		In connection with Christ as Head, I want to point out a distinction between the way in which He is regarded in Colossians and in Ephesians.<a name=410:6></a> No position in which Christ is seen in Colossians is taken up there as a question of exaltation as regards man, but as that which properly belongs to Christ.<a name=410:7></a> In Ephesians, when the same positions are spoken of, they are viewed as conferred upon Him as Man.<a name=410:8></a> The distinction is of great importance in order that you may understand the greatness of the Head.<a name=410:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will turn to a few passages to point out this distinction.<a name=410:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:17">Colossians  1:17</a>, we have "And he is before all things, and by him all things consist".<a name=410:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:9">Ephesians  1:9</a>, 10, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him".<a name=410:12></a> In Ephesians, God gathers together all in one in Christ.<a name=410:13></a> In Colossians it is simply "He is before all things".<a name=410:14></a> And, again, "Who is the Head of all principality and power".<a name=410:15></a> The clue to this is found in the earlier verses in chapter 1, in which we have reference to the Son of the Father's love.<a name=410:16></a> It is true that everything is gathered up in Him as Man, but as the Son of the Father's love He is before all things

		and naturally the Head of all.<a name=411:1></a> He is the moral necessity to everything being held together.<a name=411:2></a> Again, in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a>, we have "he is the head of the body", while in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, it says, "And hath put all things under his feet, and <i>gave</i> him to be the head over all things to the church".<a name=411:3></a> In Colossians, He is the Head, but in Ephesians God <i>gave</i> Him to be Head.<a name=411:4></a> He is seen in the latter as Man in whom God is carrying out the purpose of His will.<a name=411:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:18">Colossians  1:18</a> we have the clause: "Who is the beginning, the <i>firstborn</i> from the dead;" while in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a> it speaks of the power which wrought in Christ "when he <i>raised</i> him from the dead".<a name=411:6></a> In Colossians He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; whereas in Ephesians God <i>raised</i> Him from the dead.<a name=411:7></a>

		If you turn further to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>, you read, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ <i>sitteth</i> on the right hand of God".<a name=411:8></a> Here we simply have the fact of Christ <i>sitting</i> at the right hand of God, but in Ephesians, "God <i>set</i> him at his own right hand in the heavenly places".<a name=411:9></a> He is put there.<a name=411:10></a> These are important points of contrast between the epistles, which help us to apprehend the headship of Christ.<a name=411:11></a> They are of very great interest.<a name=411:12></a> In saying He is the Head of the body, "who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead", we have His qualification to be the Head, "That in all things he might have the pre-eminence".<a name=411:13></a> That He might have the first place.<a name=411:14></a> Everything starts from Christ as the beginning.<a name=411:15></a> It is a principle in John's writings that Christ is the starting-point of everything.<a name=411:16></a> There is no recognition of anything that went before Christ.<a name=411:17></a> He is the beginning, as the living bread come down from heaven, the beginning of all that is of God's purpose and grace.<a name=411:18></a>

		The present moment is a moment of mysteries; the purposes of God are not yet manifested, but God sees fit to give out in testimony now what He purposes to establish in power.<a name=418:4></a> That is the force of "mystery".<a name=418:5></a> He intends to establish His will in power, and Christ is the vessel in which God can establish all according to His mind.<a name=418:6></a> The vessel is the One in whom God is revealed.<a name=418:7></a> "In him all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily", and at the same time "He is the head of all principality and power".<a name=418:8></a> He is the true God revealed -- but, at the same time, He is "eternal life", that is, He is the expression of God's will for man in blessing.<a name=418:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:50">John  12:50</a>, the Lord said, "And I know that his commandment is life everlasting".<a name=418:10></a> The Lord was speaking there in the world of the commandment or will of the Father, but in John's epistle we read, "He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=418:11></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=418:12></a>) The first passage shows that eternal life is of God's will; the second, that Christ is the setting forth of God's will.<a name=418:13></a> He is the vessel in whom God sets forth the testimony and expression of His mind for man.<a name=418:14></a> The Father hath given all things into His hands.<a name=418:15></a> He could say, "All things that the Father hath are mine".<a name=418:16></a>

		What I want everyone to see is that in Christ is the setting forth of divine purpose.<a name=418:17></a> God has nothing to say to man, as such, except as to repentance and forgiveness of sins, but He has a great deal to say as to Christ, and we participate by sovereign grace in Christ,

		are new created in Him.<a name=419:1></a> Repentance and forgiveness of sins are a necessity as to man, but God's point is Christ, and we have been created in Christ, are God's workmanship, and now Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=419:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I would like to present to you certain divine characteristics which God has in Christ set forth in connection with His thoughts towards man.<a name=419:3></a> They are (1) blessing, (2) wisdom, (3) power.<a name=419:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all, we read in chapter 1: 3: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ".<a name=419:5></a> What I would call your attention to is this: God has blessed us <i>in Christ</i>, that is, Christ is the vessel of blessing.<a name=419:6></a> Now read verses 8, 9: "Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence; having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself .<a name=419:7></a>.<a name=419:8></a>.<a name=419:9></a> to gather together in one all things in Christ".<a name=419:10></a> There you get the thought of <i>wisdom</i>.<a name=419:11></a> And further on, in verses 19, 20: "And what is the exceeding greatness of his <i>power</i> to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty <i>power</i>, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places".<a name=419:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, my point is this; that you get these three great thoughts -- blessing, wisdom, and power set forth in One who is Himself adequate.<a name=419:13></a> One in whom God is fully revealed, and who is competent to hold everything for God.<a name=419:14></a> That is what is true in Christ.<a name=419:15></a> He was competent down here when He was alone and in weakness, but now He is the last Adam in quickening power, and therefore every purpose of God's heart can now be and <i>is</i> established in Christ.<a name=419:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get the thought of blessing running through Scripture: it only waited, on the part of God, for the One who was adequate to hold it.<a name=419:17></a> In the beginning God surrounded Adam with blessing, and he lost it;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=420>[Page 420]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but in Abraham you get the thought of blessing revived.<a name=420:1></a> The promise is assured to Abraham and to his seed, so that evidently God had not departed from His purpose of blessing.<a name=420:2></a> Now, God can act according to His pleasure, for He has the vessel suitable, the One who could hold everything for God.<a name=420:3></a> If One died for all, all were dead, and if He was great enough to die for all and to rise again, He is great enough to hold all the blessing which God has for man.<a name=420:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to the next point: "God hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence".<a name=420:5></a> We have the perfection of God's wisdom set forth in Christ.<a name=420:6></a> It is an immense point for us to apprehend, that God has let nothing slip from His hands.<a name=420:7></a> Nothing set forth in the Old Testament has been allowed to lapse.<a name=420:8></a> It is God's purpose to gather up all things in one in Christ.<a name=420:9></a> Whatever things God had placed in man's hands, man could not hold, for he was but a leaky vessel.<a name=420:10></a> But Christ is competent to hold all for God.<a name=420:11></a> Hence it is in Him that God will gather up all, He having tasted death for everything.<a name=420:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the setting forth in Christ of God's power, and this is in resurrection.<a name=420:13></a> Resurrection is the principle of God's ways now, for death is upon man.<a name=420:14></a> Christ Himself was the resurrection, could not be holden of death, therefore it was natural for Him to come forth from the dead; but then the mighty power of God in the resurrection of Christ was to <i>us-ward</i> who believe, so that resurrection is now the principle of God's dealings with us.<a name=420:15></a> Death came by man, and resurrection by Man.<a name=420:16></a> "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead", and "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".<a name=420:17></a> Christ was the One in whom God could set forth His power in regard of man; He is not only the vessel of blessing and of wisdom, but also the One in whom God could set forth the greatness of His power to us-ward who believe.<a name=420:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I could not conceive any greater contrast than between the first and the last Adam.<a name=421:1></a> In the first there was innocence which, however beautiful, could not stand against the tempter, but in the last Adam we see the utmost <i>moral</i> power.<a name=421:2></a> When on earth He met the tempter and sin and evil of every kind; He overcame all.<a name=421:3></a> His word to His disciples was this: "Be of good cheer, <i>I</i> have overcome the world".<a name=421:4></a> He was morally, divinely strong; the vessel in whom God set forth His pleasure; the vessel of blessing; the expression of God's wisdom, and the setting forth of God's power.<a name=421:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now the Church has to stand in the truth of that.<a name=421:6></a> The Church's testimony is "Christ", and I wish to show you how the saints are fitted for that testimony.<a name=421:7></a> There are two parts: first, they are formed in Christ, and then Christ dwells in the heart by faith.<a name=421:8></a> You could not understand the latter except as you are formed in Christ; but the two must go together.<a name=421:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My impression is that comparatively few Christians really come to it.<a name=421:10></a> They are pretty well content with the knowledge of grace, and stop there.<a name=421:11></a> They poorly apprehend Christ as the expression of God's purpose, and the consequence is, that they are not formed in Christ.<a name=421:12></a> It is the work of the Holy Spirit to form us in Christ; that is what the Lord Himself refers to in Matthew it.<a name=421:13></a> He says, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart".<a name=421:14></a> "We are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus", we are practically freed of the first man and formed in the second, the Man of God's pleasure, partaking of His character.<a name=421:15></a> We have our hearts impressed by divine love, which is the work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=421:16></a> "For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us".<a name=421:17></a> That is the principle by which we are formed, and if formed by love, then you readily learn of Christ, who is meek and lowly in heart, and you partake of His character.<a name=421:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the death of Christ every order and kind of man has disappeared in the eye of God, in order that one Man -- Christ -- may remain.<a name=422:1></a> There is nothing for us but Christ.<a name=422:2></a> Everything in us that is not of Christ will disappear.<a name=422:3></a> "The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.<a name=422:4></a> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly".<a name=422:5></a> We are now in the place of children in the presence of God, and are to partake of the character of Christ, and the principle which is effective and operative in us by the Spirit of God is the love of God; and so surely as the heart is under the influence of that love, so surely we are formed according to Christ.<a name=422:6></a> I am sure that is the divine way.<a name=422:7></a> When the Lord was here there was in Him the contrast to everything around.<a name=422:8></a> He was "meek and lowly in heart", though the whole power of God was at His disposal.<a name=422:9></a> His pleasure did not consist in acts of power, but that souls should come to Him and take His yoke upon them.<a name=422:10></a> It was a greater miracle for a man to find rest to his soul than for a dead man to be raised up.<a name=422:11></a> I would rather find rest to my soul in the knowledge of God than, in the present condition of things, have the burden of death literally lifted off.<a name=422:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the other point, namely, that the Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith; which involves this, that there is personal affection for Christ.<a name=422:13></a> It is the point in which the great mass of us are perhaps defective.<a name=422:14></a> If Christ dwells in the heart, He is the supreme object of our affection.<a name=422:15></a> It becomes true of us -- "Whom, not having seen, ye love".<a name=422:16></a> It is a wonderful thing to love One who does not affect sight or sense.<a name=422:17></a> You have never seen Him.<a name=422:18></a> Christ dwells in the Scriptures, He is the spirit of them.<a name=422:19></a> They are the revelation of the Father's will to us, and we too are strengthened by the Father's Spirit with might in the inward man, that the Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=422:20></a> The Church is the vessel of testimony; we are

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=423>[Page 423]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		formed in Christ, and if Christ dwells in the heart by faith, the result is, you are filled unto all the fulness of God, that is for the full setting forth of God down here.<a name=423:1></a> The Church was suitable and adequate for that, and the way of it was by the strengthening of the saints in the inward man.<a name=423:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken about God's testimony -- Christ -- and what God has set forth in Him, blessing, wisdom and power.<a name=423:3></a> That was the subject of the Church's testimony.<a name=423:4></a> The Church was, as we have said, competent and suitable, for it was formed in Christ.<a name=423:5></a> But the first state of things did not last long.<a name=423:6></a> The Lord had to say to the angel of Ephesus: "Thou hast left thy first love".<a name=423:7></a> Christ no longer dwelt in their hearts.<a name=423:8></a> The Church had fallen away from the true place of testimony down here.<a name=423:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you are in any way by God's grace in the place of God's testimony here you must not expect to have quiet times.<a name=423:10></a> You have to meet the whole power of evil, and for this you need to take the whole armour of God.<a name=423:11></a> If there were no evil to resist, the testimony would be simple.<a name=423:12></a> The evil in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>is not man, but influences which proceed from that which is above man, the spiritual influences of wickedness in the heavenly places.<a name=423:13></a> The object is to neutralise the revelation of God here.<a name=423:14></a> There cannot be a doubt that the revelation of God is here, and the point of the enemy is to frustrate it.<a name=423:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two special forms in which the wickedness works; superstition and infidelity.<a name=423:16></a> The working of superstition is to neutralise the revelation by bringing in a system of things which blinds people to the power of the revelation.<a name=423:17></a> Popery and High Churchism are a wonderful force to this end.<a name=423:18></a> The revelation is not denied, but a system has been invented which prevents the soul getting the light and benefit of the revelation.<a name=423:19></a> There is revelation, and the application of it, and if its application is falsified, the revelation becomes powerless.<a name=423:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=424>[Page 424]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other form is infidelity.<a name=424:1></a> This does not neutralise the revelation but denies it; that is the ground taken.<a name=424:2></a> An agnostic does not deny God, but he denies the revelation.<a name=424:3></a> He would set you on the search for truth: you would have to go into philosophy and science in the search after truth, but he would tell you that it is an impossibility that there can be such a thing as the revelation of God.<a name=424:4></a> That is the present character of infidelity.<a name=424:5></a> These are the wiles of the devil, and if you want to meet them you want the armour of God -- not one bit of it, but the whole armour.<a name=424:6></a> You want every characteristic that will mark Christ when He comes into the world in power.<a name=424:7></a> We find these in the detail of the armour -- truth, righteousness, peace, the helmet of salvation and the sword.<a name=424:8></a> Christ is presented to us in Scripture as coming in power with all these characteristics.<a name=424:9></a> He is the truth: the expression of God and of His will.<a name=424:10></a> He comes out in righteousness and establishes everything for God.<a name=424:11></a> He comes in peace, because righteousness has been effected and established.<a name=424:12></a> He comes, as God's salvation, to deliver His people; and with the sword -- the word of God -- to destroy His enemies.<a name=424:13></a> All these are marks of Christ when He comes again in glory; but we are to take the armour now and to come out in that way <i>morally</i>, with the additions of faith and prayer.<a name=424:14></a> We are here actually in the world in the place of dependence, and therefore we want these things.<a name=424:15></a> These are not marks of Christ, He will not bear these marks in His coming; but they are part of the armour to us.<a name=424:16></a> We want every bit of the armour: truth, righteousness, peace; that is, the power of these things realised in the soul; and then faith, the consciousness that God will bring down all the power of evil; the head lifted up in the sense of salvation; and the word of God -- the testimony here.<a name=424:17></a> Thus you are in peace, you have the knowledge of God's will and can stand here, in the presence of the will of man, in God's will.<a name=424:18></a>

		What we have to confront immediately is the will of man, but behind it the influences of Satan; but we are fortified in the consciousness of God's will, and of what He has established in Christ, the last Adam, the Man of God's right hand, the vessel of His purpose.<a name=425:1></a> There is blessing, wisdom and power fully set forth, on the part of God, in Christ, but having their application to us.<a name=425:2></a> They are set forth in Christ for man, and God will surely accomplish His purpose because He has the vessel which is adequate.<a name=425:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a brief moment all God's mind was accomplished in Christ, and now the Church is left here in testimony to it.<a name=425:4></a> Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith, and we are to stand here in the armour of God, characterised by the marks which the Lord will bear when He comes in glory.<a name=425:5></a> We have to take up the armour morally, for it could not be otherwise with us; and we anticipate the coming of the Lord in glory and power to establish publicly the will of God, when there will be no more mystery or testimony.<a name=425:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is now the time of testimony, and the subject of it is Christ.<a name=425:7></a> You see two things in Him, the revelation of God, and the expression of the purpose of God's will.<a name=425:8></a> He is "the true God and eternal life".<a name=425:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great thing we want is Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith: that we might be marked by real affection for Christ.<a name=425:10></a> We lack in strength and spiritual power because Christ is not sufficiently known <i>personally</i>.<a name=425:11></a> One's desire is that the hearts of the saints may be <i>personally</i> attached to Him.<a name=425:12></a> He is true to affection, not to sense and sight.<a name=425:13></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, He says: "I know my sheep, and am known of mine, as the Father knoweth me and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep".<a name=425:14></a>

		DEMAND AND SUPPLY

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:14">Acts  2:14</a> - 47
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are various lights in which it is possible to look at the Scriptures.<a name=426:1></a> For instance, one might look at the Old Testament as a book of types and shadows, while the New Testament gives you the substance; or, again, one might look at the Old Testament as the book of demand while the New Testament is the book of supply.<a name=426:2></a> All that is demanded in the Old Testament -- and every type and shadow <i>was</i> in principle a demand -- is answered in the New Testament, hence the latter is the supply.<a name=426:3></a> The one is in that way the contrast to the other; and I might take up this thought in all kinds of connection and prove it to you.<a name=426:4></a> But I confine myself to two or three points of what I have called <i>demand</i> in the Old Testament, of which you get the <i>supply</i> in the New.<a name=426:5></a> The particular points that are before me are very simple: the first is righteousness, the second resurrection, the third is the Spirit, and the fourth the kingdom.<a name=426:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is not difficult to see that these things were demanded in the Old Testament; and the demand lay in the necessities of the purpose of God.<a name=426:7></a> The demand was not from man; in the New Testament you find the answer to all.<a name=426:8></a> If you take up the Scriptures in that way you will see increasingly the interest that attaches to them.<a name=426:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope to show you how the apostle Peter in this chapter gives the answer to every demand that came out in the Old Testament; and the secret of this was in that the kingdom had been established, and that is a point of the greatest moment to every one of us.<a name=426:10></a> If we have not an apprehension of the kingdom the defect is serious; but on the other hand, "we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=427>[Page 427]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear".<a name=427:1></a> We receive an immovable kingdom, a <i>moral</i> kingdom, and the result is that we serve God acceptably and with godly fear.<a name=427:2></a> I am now looking at the kingdom in that light, that is, not dispensationally, but morally, and in its effect upon the saints.<a name=427:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the testimony of both Peter and Paul is undoubtedly of the kingdom.<a name=427:4></a> You find comparatively little about the Church in the Acts, but you get the testimony of the kingdom; the book begins with it and closes with it.<a name=427:5></a> It speaks of Paul in the last chapter as "preaching the kingdom of God".<a name=427:6></a> No doubt he took the truth of the kingdom from Peter, though with more light, and all through we find that he preached the kingdom of God.<a name=427:7></a> Now in this chapter we have the establishment of the kingdom, and the effect of it.<a name=427:8></a> One point of moment is this, whatever is of God's establishment never grows old; the kingdom of God does not grow old.<a name=427:9></a> What is presented to us in this chapter remains in full force <i>unimpaired</i>; it is not affected by the ruin of the Church or the state of Christendom.<a name=427:10></a> The truth of the exaltation of Christ, and of the presence of the Holy Spirit here, remains unimpaired, it cannot be affected by anything; and if you go back to these two facts they will still have their proper effect upon you.<a name=427:11></a> We have only to come face to face with them for this end.<a name=427:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think that anyone could serve God with reverence and with godly fear who did not apprehend the kingdom; that is the moral sway of God.<a name=427:13></a> And the sway of God must be in <i>grace</i>; there is no other possible on the part of God with reference to fallen man.<a name=427:14></a> It would be possible, of course, for God to judge man, or destroy him; but the <i>sway</i> of God over man, sinful as he is, must be in <i>grace</i> -- any other would be impossible.<a name=427:15></a> We are accustomed to far different things in the world; for instance, in this land the rule is one of law, and those who infringe the law of the land

		have to suffer the penalty of their offence; but in the kingdom of God there is the sway of grace -- not law.<a name=428:1></a> There is no imputation of sin in grace.<a name=428:2></a> Supposing one fails, grace comes in to show the point of departure -- that is the way it works.<a name=428:3></a> Should there be will at work there may be need of discipline; but <i>there is no imputation</i>.<a name=428:4></a> "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin".<a name=428:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to make clear the difference between demand and supply.<a name=428:6></a> As regards the first point, <i>viz</i>.<a name=428:7></a>, righteousness.<a name=428:8></a> From the beginning to the end of the Old Testament you will find the demand for righteousness.<a name=428:9></a> I do not now speak of righteousness in a practical sense, but I refer to the righteousness of God.<a name=428:10></a> The law, though witnessing God's righteousness, was a demand for human righteousness; but in general what marks the Old Testament is the demand for divine righteousness, a demand which was not supplied in Old Testament times.<a name=428:11></a> Every sacrifice that was offered to God was in a sense a demand for righteousness; had there been the answer they would not have continued to be offered.<a name=428:12></a> In Old Testament times there was not revealed the forgiveness of sins.<a name=428:13></a> God saw everything before Him, but there was no such thing revealed as righteousness for man.<a name=428:14></a> As I said before, the character of every sacrifice offered to God was a demand for divine righteousness.<a name=428:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the New Testament we find the supply -- the blood of <i>Jesus</i>; the great answer to the requirement of the Old Testament is the blood of <i>Jesus</i>; God has set Him forth a mercy-seat through faith in <i>His blood</i>, and in this is declared His righteousness, we have the righteousness of God revealed!<a name=428:16></a> It is now no longer a question of sacrifices having a typical force, but of righteousness revealed for faith.<a name=428:17></a> As I said, the demand for righteousness is in the Old Testament, so that in result there might be forgiveness of sins, and when you come to the New the demand is answered.<a name=428:18></a>

		Now the next point of which I spoke was <i>resurrection</i>.<a name=429:1></a> You get the demand for resurrection in the Old Testament -- <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, is a demand for resurrection, and not resurrection as a mere act of divine power, but resurrection as that which was the suited answer to a certain course down here in which God was glorified.<a name=429:2></a> "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption" -- undoubtedly that was a foreshadowing of what would come to pass, and thus a demand for resurrection to life.<a name=429:3></a> God might have raised men for judgment, but there would have been no life in that.<a name=429:4></a> In the New Testament the demand for resurrection is <i>supplied</i> -- One went into death who could not be holden of death; and the reason of that was His own perfection.<a name=429:5></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>is the setting forth of the moral perfection of a Man here upon earth, and if He went into death resurrection became a moral necessity.<a name=429:6></a> Now you have in Christ the answer to this.<a name=429:7></a> He was of course the exception to the universal rule of death in regard to man, but He went into death.<a name=429:8></a> Man <i>must</i> die, and he will see corruption; but One has been into death who could not be holden of death -- "This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses".<a name=429:9></a> He was raised again from the dead in testimony of the power of God.<a name=429:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will, I think, admit that you find the principle of demand and supply in regard to resurrection as to righteousness; there was in the Old Testament the demand for resurrection to set man outside the realm and power of death, and in the New Testament Christ is raised from the dead, for He could not be holden of it.<a name=429:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the coming of the Holy Spirit is referred to similarly in the Old Testament, in the nature of a demand.<a name=429:12></a> There was no pouring out of the Spirit there; He did come in power upon men, and influenced them.<a name=429:13></a> The prophets, for instance, came under the influence of the Holy Spirit, but there was no pouring out of the Spirit.<a name=429:14></a> It was foreshadowed there, and was thus in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the nature of a demand; it was something to take place in the ways of God, and in the Acts "when the day of Pentecost was fully come", etc.<a name=430:1></a>, the supply was furnished.<a name=430:2></a> The demand in the Old Testament for the Spirit is instanced in the anointing of the leper, then again in the two wave-loaves presented fifty days after the sheaf of first-fruits.<a name=430:3></a> All these implied a demand for the Spirit, and in the Acts you get not only the fulfilment of the shadow, but the promise of the Father, of which the Lord Jesus Himself had spoken to the disciples.<a name=430:4></a> They were to wait at Jerusalem until they were "endued with power from on high", and in one sense, when that had come to pass, there was nothing beyond it.<a name=430:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think it will be admitted that to speak of the Old Testament as a book of demand is just, and that in the New Testament you have the supply.<a name=430:6></a> Righteousness is established, resurrection has come to pass, and the Holy Spirit is poured out.<a name=430:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to the kingdom, on which I desired to speak more particularly.<a name=430:8></a> There are two points which come out in the Old Testament with regard to the kingdom; the one is that Jehovah dwells in Zion, and the other is that the kingdom is Jehovah's.<a name=430:9></a> David reigned in Zion, but that was not the kingdom of God properly; and Solomon, David's son, reigned in Jerusalem, but, whatever these might be in the way of types as regards David, or David's son, it was not the kingdom of God.<a name=430:10></a> But how was Jehovah to dwell in Zion?<a name=430:11></a> In all that had come to pass in the Old Testament times, in the setting up of the tabernacle, or the building of the temple, there was not realized the idea of Jehovah dwelling in Zion.<a name=430:12></a> Then again, how was David's kingdom to be the kingdom of Jehovah?<a name=430:13></a> How this can be is the enigma that the Lord proposed to the Jews when they came tempting Him -- how could David's Lord be David's Son?<a name=430:14></a> And the truth of the matter is, that David's Lord is David's Son, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=431>[Page 431]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David's Son, on the other hand, is David's Lord; it is because David's Lord has become David's Son that Jehovah can dwell in Zion.<a name=431:1></a> Christ is the root <i>and</i> offspring of David, and thus while He sits on the throne of His father David the kingdom is Jehovah's.<a name=431:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is part of what I have called the demand of the Old Testament -- a demand for Jehovah's kingdom, and for Jehovah to dwell in Zion; a demand which was not fulfilled in Old Testament times, nor is fully realised yet.<a name=431:3></a> But one part <i>is</i> fulfilled, and that is, the kingdom is <i>Jehovah's</i>: I could not speak of Jehovah dwelling as yet in Zion; in this the Old Testament looks forward to the millennium, but in the New Testament we find everything in principle fulfilled.<a name=431:4></a> Righteousness revealed in the blood of <i>Jesus</i>; resurrection come to pass, because of the moral perfection in which Christ went into death, and the Spirit poured out; then, too, the kingdom is established in the fact of Christ being set as Lord at the right hand of God, and the Spirit being down here.<a name=431:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now just put these two things together -- the demand and the supply.<a name=431:6></a> I want you to study the Old Testament in that light, to see what was necessary for the glory of God, and to apprehend not only the demand, but the supply in the presence of Christ at the right hand of God, and the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=431:7></a> I desire that you might see the effect of the kingdom of God in its application to us; for though the kingdom is not yet manifest, and is spoken of as in mystery, yet, for all that, the kingdom subsists, and the witnesses to it are <i>Christ</i> at the right hand of God, and the <i>Spirit</i> down here -- that is what was announced on the day of Pentecost.<a name=431:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to make clear is that the <i>kingdom</i> of God is a <i>reality</i>; it is not in word, but in <i>power</i>.<a name=431:9></a> People fail, I think, to apprehend that -- Christendom does not apprehend the kingdom of God in what I might call its <i>moral force</i>.<a name=431:10></a> The kingdom of God is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the effect of grace reigning is that we even dare to look at righteousness -- we do not shrink from this.<a name=432:5></a> There never was a man in the world who could look at righteousness until he knew grace.<a name=432:6></a> You never saw a man as such walk in self-judgment, and it is only as I learn that in the righteousness of God I am justified, that I can touch righteousness; I disallow what God has disallowed, and now being made free from sin, and having become a servant to God, I have my fruit unto holiness.<a name=432:7></a> A man who is in the <i>pursuit</i> of righteousness -- who is seeking to maintain his own righteousness, cannot maintain it; but a Christian who is under grace can walk in self-judgment, and the sway of grace through righteousness leads to eternal life, and all is "through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=432:8></a> The gain of the kingdom is <i>immense</i> -- God has no other attitude towards us than <i>grace</i>.<a name=432:9></a> Then you are taught by grace -- the grace of God "hath appeared, .<a name=432:10></a>.<a name=432:11></a>.<a name=432:12></a> teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world".<a name=432:13></a> A soul that is under the sway of grace accepts the teaching of grace, and it is taught to look for that blessed hope "and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=432:14></a> The kingdom is very great gain.<a name=432:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I return to the thought that the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.<a name=433:1></a> There is supreme authority at the right hand of God, but there is also power equal to that authority down here, and that is the Holy Spirit; so that the kingdom of God is not eating or drinking, but "righteousness, peace, and joy in [the power of] the Holy Spirit", and it is important to see the mighty power that is maintaining righteousness, peace, and joy in a scene of sin and restlessness, of death and of sorrow.<a name=433:2></a> There is no <i>peace</i> in a world of sin and death, and death <i>must</i> bring sorrow in its train, but in contrast to all that, the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and <i>joy</i> in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that the kingdom is not in word, but in <i>power</i>.<a name=433:3></a> The kingdom of God is established in the soul of the believer in the power of the Holy Spirit; and righteousness, peace, and joy are the characteristics of the kingdom.<a name=433:4></a> It is an immense mercy in the midst of this world of turmoil to enjoy peace; to be delivered, too, from the sway of sin in the knowledge of righteousness, and in the midst of a scene of sorrow to know <i>joy</i> that will never fail you.<a name=433:5></a> The greatest force in the world could not bring this about.<a name=433:6></a> For this you need a power completely superior to every pressure here upon earth.<a name=433:7></a> For the establishment of the kingdom you must have supreme authority at the right hand of God -- authority in grace too.<a name=433:8></a> There may, of course, be a measure of discipline connected with it, but, at the same time, it is authority acting in <i>grace</i>; and with that, divine power here upon earth -- a power commensurate with the authority that is at the right hand of God.<a name=433:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I thank God for the grace in which His word has made one's soul acquainted with principles which otherwise one could not have known anything of -- such as righteousness, and love, and grace.<a name=433:10></a> Do you think a man of the world, or even a philosopher, knows anything at all about such principles?<a name=433:11></a> Why, he would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I just call attention to one or two verses in this chapter (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:40">Acts  2:40</a> - 43); and what I would say is that these principles <i>remain unimpaired</i>.<a name=434:5></a> The demand for separation -- "Save yourselves from this untoward generation" -- is as urgent as ever it was.<a name=434:6></a> But you may say, Is not the world a Christian world?<a name=434:7></a> I admit that, but for all that there is an "untoward generation", and hence the demand for separation morally is as forcible as ever it was; one cannot go on in the life of this world, we are separated from it by the waters of baptism.<a name=434:8></a> I no more have part in the Christianity of this world than in Judaism, or even in heathenism; the principles of these things find their place in the Christianity of today, and baptism separates me from them, I am identified with the death of Christ, and accept the obligation to separation from all that is of the world down here.<a name=434:9></a> I could not stop in these things to help them; the principle is, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation".<a name=434:10></a> If we look around and see a generation governed by the principles of this world, it is to us an untoward generation.<a name=434:11></a> If you are governed by the love of Christ, you will be content to be identified with His death.<a name=434:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point that I would like to bring before you from verse 42, "They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers".<a name=434:13></a> What I point out is that all these things are unimpaired.<a name=434:14></a> We have not got apostles living today, but for all that we can continue in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the apostles' doctrine; and do not take that second-hand -- take it <i>first</i>-hand.<a name=435:1></a> The great systems on earth would have you take it second-hand, but that means the ignoring of the Spirit of truth.<a name=435:2></a> Then those who believed did not accept the doctrine and refuse the apostles; they continued in their fellowship, so as to be not only in the light of the truth, but in the fellowship of those who ministered the truth.<a name=435:3></a> So we, too, have to see to it that being in the light of the truth, we are also in the fellowship that is formed on the truth.<a name=435:4></a> This scripture leaves no room for those who would accept the doctrine, but not have the fellowship, though reproach may be connected with this.<a name=435:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, as to the coming together of saints, two things are mentioned, the breaking of bread, and prayers; these two things are recognised as special occasions of our coming together.<a name=435:6></a> The doctrine of the apostles, and their fellowship, have not reference exactly to our coming together; the first is not a question of meeting at all; and the second, though a question of fellowship, does not speak of coming together -- we continue in the doctrine and fellowship always, but we come together to break bread, and in prayers.<a name=435:7></a> Both these are collective; and then we read "fear came upon every soul".<a name=435:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter was the great apostle of the kingdom; he was the first to announce it.<a name=435:9></a> The burden of his testimony was Christ at the right hand of God, and the Holy Spirit come here; and the benefits and effect of the Spirit's presence were for those who apprehended these things.<a name=435:10></a> Those who received the kingdom were in peace and in power.<a name=435:11></a> Then they accepted separation, and, having accepted it, they went on in the doctrine of the apostles and in the fellowship formed on the truth, and at the same time in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.<a name=435:12></a> I should not care for a fellowship based upon unity of mind and judgment, such as would be required by some particular system of doctrine or interpretation.<a name=435:13></a> Of course unity of mind and

		<a name=436>[Page 436]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		judgment is important, but any basis of fellowship apart from the acceptance of the apostles' doctrine would be too narrow.<a name=436:1></a> What one looks for now is a fellowship in which there is not resistance of the truth.<a name=436:2></a> It may be that every soul is not in the full light of it, but it is not refused.<a name=436:3></a> I doubt if all the three thousand who believed were in the full light of the apostles' doctrine, but at the same time it was there.<a name=436:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would again press that every great principle in this chapter remains unimpaired.<a name=436:5></a> The Holy Spirit is here, and the kingdom established, and I know of no reason why we should not have all that properly lies in the establishment of the kingdom of God.<a name=436:6></a> The point is to get back to first principles -- not to be governed by what is around, and not to be confusing these principles with what is around, but to get back in soul to what was from the beginning, and for this you must begin with separation.<a name=436:7></a>

	<div class="heading">
		THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that in the issue of a new serial it is important to make plain that the object in so doing is the maintenance and setting forth of that which is true in doctrine, not the promulgation of that which is new.<a name=437:1></a> That there has been in the present century a remarkable revival of the truth of the Church no intelligent Christian can, I think, gainsay; and the effect of this has been felt, far and wide, beyond the immediate circle which has been formed by the truth thus revived in God's goodness.<a name=437:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In later years the question has arisen as to how the great truths involved in the Church, such as the calling of God, eternal life, new creation and union are to be maintained.<a name=437:3></a> The effort to secure them by the use of fixed statements and conventional terms, devoid of elasticity, has proved entirely inefficacious; as has also the mode of attaching everything to the believer as a possession, the good of which is experienced in the power of the Spirit.<a name=437:4></a> Souls trained in this school must necessarily stop short of any apprehension of new creation.<a name=437:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is now largely admitted that a Christian's apprehension of God's calling cannot be anything beyond the measure of God's work in him.<a name=437:6></a> He may claim standing and privilege, have prophecy, understand all mysteries and all knowledge intellectually, have faith to remove mountains, and, without love, be nothing.<a name=437:7></a> A Christian's measure for God and for the assembly is love, and love is evidently the work of God in him.<a name=437:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this brings me to the conclusion that the real and only way to secure truths which have been revived is in our being the expression of those truths; holding the truth in love; and at the same time watchful that, while having the full light of God's will in Christ, we do not arrogate to ourselves anything beyond what we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=438>[Page 438]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are as the effect and fruit of God's work in us; for it is evident that we cannot have the conscious sense of any truth, save as we are in the state which corresponds to that truth (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>); and it is, I think, unsafe to talk much of things of which we have not the consciousness.<a name=438:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While speaking thus of consciousness, I do not mean to put it in the place of faith.<a name=438:2></a> The first light of God in the soul is by faith.<a name=438:3></a> We are justified by faith, saved by faith, sons of God by faith, risen together with Christ by faith, and Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=438:4></a> So that in the Christian course the scope of faith is more and more enlarged.<a name=438:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time it is certain that a large part of the New Testament is occupied with bringing before us the work of the Spirit of God in the believer, which forms him for approach to God in the consciousness of his soul; and consciousness in this sense must be in the new man.<a name=438:6></a> The old man has nothing to say to it.<a name=438:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a proof and illustration of what I have said, I would draw attention to the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=438:8></a> In the first ten chapters we have but little unfolded as to the state of the Christian (save a state of unbelief and danger of apostasy).<a name=438:9></a> What is brought to light is the new order of things which is the necessary moral consequence of the sacrifice and priesthood of Christ, not only in the setting aside of what previously existed, but in the introduction of that which is perfect as both expressing and answering to God's mind.<a name=438:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 11 to 13, however, we get the question of Christian state elucidated, and learn how it is formed.<a name=438:11></a> The first great principle of it is faith, which is, for this moment, the principle of living.<a name=438:12></a> This is not peculiar to Christianity, for it was announced as a principle to the prophet Habakkuk in view of the coming of the Lord.<a name=438:13></a> What I understand by this is that the soul is in the light of God's testimony, not in the moral darkness which is around.<a name=438:14></a> This testimony is for us of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=439>[Page 439]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		glory of God and Jesus at the right hand of God.<a name=439:1></a> This principle of faith puts us in the line of the witnesses.<a name=439:2></a> It involves that the soul is in the light of God's pleasure and perfect satisfaction.<a name=439:3></a> But in chapter 12, we have not, so far as I know (after the opening), any allusion to faith, but in a sense what is greater than faith, namely, the chastening of God, and its voice and meaning to those who are the subjects of His discipline; together with the purpose to which the chastening is directed.<a name=439:4></a> The chapter necessitates a distinction between mere professors and those who are really of God.<a name=439:5></a> In His discipline God does not occupy Himself with bastards; they are not genuinely of Him, though they may be in the place of profession; and hence they are not disciplined.<a name=439:6></a> Those who come under discipline are the objects of love -- they are of God, and thus sons; and if even they have not accepted the assurance of this by the Spirit, they may learn by discipline that they are loved of God.<a name=439:7></a> Though they may not bear themselves towards God as sons, He bears Himself towards them as Father.<a name=439:8></a> Thus the soul is practically led into the reality of the relationship, which is the most essential step in the question of Christian state.<a name=439:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, concurrent with this, we have the object of chastening, namely, that we may be morally according to God, as partaking of His holiness, and yielding peaceable fruits of righteousness.<a name=439:10></a> Thus we have in principle the having put on the new man, which is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=439:11></a> In the new man the believer is holy and without blame before God in love.<a name=439:12></a> In the putting on of the new man there is of necessity the having put off the old.<a name=439:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have light as to the formative principles of Christian state, and the means by which it is effected in us.<a name=439:14></a> As the result of this there is the ability to apprehend the breadth and length and depth and height, the whole range and extent of things before God, the fruit of His sovereign will; and to distinguish
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=440>[Page 440]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		between that which is for God, and that which is for man.<a name=440:1></a> In the case of the children of Israel, in coming to mount Sinai where God addressed them, they came to that which could and did affect man as man.<a name=440:2></a> It was not a scene of judgment; but it had a good deal of that character.<a name=440:3></a> There was that which was tangible and terrible to the senses, and calculated to inspire man with awe, and to forbid his approach to God, or even the hearing of His voice.<a name=440:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christians have come to another order of objects, none of which could affect or be appreciated by the natural man (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>), and they can be appreciated by the Christian only in the measure in which he has been formed of God according to His nature.<a name=440:5></a> Then it is that he can discern the difference between the things which are for God, and those that are for man.<a name=440:6></a> At the same time he apprehends that his own true blessing and position are bound up with the things which are for God.<a name=440:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the mount Zion, the city of the living God, and the Church of the firstborn ones which are written in heaven, are evidently for God; that is, for His glory and pleasure, and for the display of Himself, of His longsuffering mercy, His government and His grace.<a name=440:8></a> With these our calling as "in Christ" is identified; and in the soul's apprehension of these objects we reach the point where God, and He only, is "judge" -- all is under His eye.<a name=440:9></a> Then it is that we have the consciousness of all that which is for man: the perfecting of "just men" through redemption, the new covenant in its Mediator, and the blood of sprinkling speaking of the removal of death in righteousness, instead of the answering a call for vengeance.<a name=440:10></a> In this way our souls are in the brightest light as the fruit of God's work in us; and in the apprehension of the greatest things which are for God, we have not only the faith but the consciousness of all that is of God's grace for man.<a name=440:11></a> Truly we can then say that we have been brought out of darkness into God's marvellous light.<a name=440:12></a>

		I think that it may be said that light and testimony are the two extremities in Christian progress and experience, though other things come in between.<a name=441:1></a> Nothing can be more certain than that we all began our Christian course by the reception of light -- for the natural heart of man is all darkness in regard to God.<a name=441:2></a> The result of the reception of light is to bring us into the kingdom of God, under the sway of grace, with all its attendant blessings.<a name=441:3></a> By grace our wills are subdued, through the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and we are made conscious that, while man's will brings in confusion, God's will is good and perfect and acceptable.<a name=441:4></a> And thus we are brought in our souls to the apprehension of God's glory, and learn the truth of the mystery, of our place in association with Christ, the object and centre of the glory, so that we are conscious of being a priestly company, as risen together with Christ -- having boldness for entering the holiest; and then Christ assumes such complete possession of the heart, that, simply and without effort, we become vessels for God's testimony -- full of intelligence and love, we are filled unto all the fulness of God.<a name=441:5></a> I desire to show how Christ is necessary to every step of this blessed progress.<a name=441:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As we have already said, the starting-point for us is the revelation of God, and this we have fully in the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=442:2></a> In the death of Christ we have the revelation of God in love and righteousness, removing that which had affected Himself, and made man obnoxious to Him -- hence the rending of the veil.<a name=442:3></a> In the resurrection of Christ we see God breaking the power of all that which affects man, namely, death, the fear of judgment, and, connected with these, the power of the enemy of souls.<a name=442:4></a> The mind of man has to be brought into accord with what God has done, in the way of repentance toward God, as to the sin that affected Him, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Mediator, who is the means and expression of the salvation of God's grace.<a name=442:5></a> Thus we are, so to speak, instinctively brought into the kingdom, under the moral sway of the Lord Jesus.<a name=442:6></a> We are in the light of the grace and power of God, and can appreciate His grace because it has been confirmed by His power, as in the case of the paralytic; his forgiveness was confirmed by the power that enabled him to take up his bed and walk.<a name=442:7></a> Now being in the light of grace, and justified in grace, we come readily under the sway of the One in whom God's will has been revealed to us and in whom that will has been effected.<a name=442:8></a> It could not be otherwise than this -- for there must necessarily be the consciousness that He claims, and is entitled to the allegiance of our hearts.<a name=442:9></a> They that live, live to Him who died for them and rose again; and thus we are brought experimentally under the sway and teaching of grace; we come under the nurture and discipline of the Lord; and the end and purpose of that is to set aside practically in us that which has in the cross been removed

		We see thus the immense value and importance to us of the kingdom -- the throne of grace.<a name=443:3></a> As our wills are practically subdued the will of God comes more distinctly into view as that which is good and acceptable and perfect; we rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and we become sensitive to the presence of the Spirit.<a name=443:4></a> Here we get the passage from death into life -- from the mind of the flesh, which is death, to the mind of the Spirit, which is life and peace.<a name=443:5></a>

		Now in coming to the will of God we discern by the Spirit's teaching the place which Christ Himself has taken in connection with that will.<a name=443:6></a> That not simply was He to reconcile all things to God, but that it is "through himself".<a name=443:7></a> He Himself is to be, as Man, the Head and centre of the system which is for God -- He is the second Man -- the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.<a name=443:8></a> Christ is now seen not only as Lord but as Head, that is, as on our side, as identified with saints.<a name=443:9></a> And now it is not, as in the kingdom, the exercise of discipline to subdue our wills, but the working of divine affection in Christ towards those whom the Father has given to Him, that He may draw them close to Himself in the presence of the Father's love.<a name=443:10></a> Thus we have reached the truth of the assembly -- the Sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one, He is not ashamed to call them brethren.<a name=443:11></a> And here comes in the Father's discipline, which has in view to confirm us in sonship, and to make us partakers of His holiness.<a name=443:12></a> There is the having put off the old man and put on the new.<a name=443:13></a>

		It is impossible to overrate the importance of gathering up the various indications and foreshadowings which God has seen fit to give from time to time in the course of the world's history of His mind and will, and to apprehend the meeting-place of all in the One in whom God has been fully and perfectly declared in grace.<a name=450:1></a> The effect cannot but be to establish the soul in the knowledge of God, and in the sense of His patience and wisdom.<a name=450:2></a> The three elements of God's will which are particularly prominent in the Old Testament are of blessing, dwelling, and ruling.<a name=450:3></a> Though these thoughts have been historically developed in this order, it must be evident to any thoughtful soul that in their establishment and application rule, or the kingdom, must have the first place -- for in man's condition of departure and moral distance from God there can be no blessing until his soul has come under the moral sway of God.<a name=450:4></a> Now the kingdom of God has come into effect; not simply in word, but in power.<a name=450:5></a> In all the history of man from the time that sin came in there had been the moral government of God.<a name=450:6></a> Of this there is abundant record in the Old Testament.<a name=450:7></a> Saints were instructed in the principles of it, and encouraged to wait patiently for the issue of it -- but this was a very different thing from the soul being freed of the fear of death, and under the moral sway of God revealed as imputing, in grace, righteousness to the believer apart from works.<a name=450:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The foundation of God's kingdom is righteousness.<a name=450:9></a> This was secured in the death of Christ.<a name=450:10></a> Righteousness must be God's measure of creature responsibility, and this has been fully and perfectly met in the death of Christ, so that the love of God can freely flow forth in the channels which it makes for itself; and in this conciliation

		Now a few words may be said as to the moral effect of all this on ourselves -- for the truth which has been before us cannot, if accepted, fail of having a profound moral effect.<a name=452:3></a> It appears to me that while we cherish and in a measure delight in the love of God, we become more and more alive to the truth that His love is a holy love, intolerant of a breath of evil, and we arrive at the painful experience that in ourselves there is nothing in common with the holiness of God; so far from touching anything in man, it is rather repugnant to him.<a name=452:4></a> Hence we learn that nothing of the flesh or nature is sanctified for the service of God, that we can be and are for Him only as we have begun in the knowledge of God's love, and grow in it.<a name=452:5></a> The secret of holiness lies in love, and for the Christian all has to be new, and all of God, starting in the knowledge of His love, a new creation; and the painful lesson has to be learnt that the flesh is incapable of receiving any impression from the holiness of God, that in the light of God there is nothing for it but the circumcision of the cross, and this is possible as one's heart is made acquainted with the love of God.<a name=452:6></a> We are rooted and grounded in love, and in partaking thus of the divine nature, not only do we advance in holiness, but the power of apprehension in the things of God is increased, we have entrance into the range of His counsel.<a name=452:7></a> Thus we have love, holiness, and intelligence marking the Christian, and qualifying him for his place in common with other saints in the service of God in the sanctuary; the truth is apprehended that the saints are Christ's brethren, one with Him in the presence of the Father.<a name=452:8></a>

		Now to go back to the beginning (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:1">Genesis  2:1</a> - 3), "God rested the seventh day".<a name=453:13></a> There are two thoughts apparently essential to rest, one is cessation from toil, and the other complacency in what has been wrought, the sense that it is good.<a name=453:14></a> To understand the rest of God you must bear these two thoughts in mind.<a name=453:15></a> There had been six days' labour in creation, and the seventh day was rest.<a name=453:16></a> God rested from His work, and at the same time His complacency was complete in what He had created.<a name=453:17></a> "God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good".<a name=453:18></a> Rest is more than cessation from toil, there is a moral element in it.<a name=453:19></a>

		To show how all this was to be met, I pass on to Noah's burnt-offering (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:20">Genesis  8:20</a>, 21), in which God smelled a "savour of rest".<a name=454:13></a> (See note.<a name=454:14></a>) If there was to be rest for God, two things must come to pass: God must be glorified, and man must find a place of acceptance outside of himself.<a name=454:15></a> God must be glorified in the conciliation of His nature and attributes, His righteousness must be conciliated with His love; and that is what the burnt-offering typically set forth, and what came to pass in the death of Christ.<a name=454:16></a> God was glorified, the judgment under which man lay was borne vicariously; and man could find in Christ risen a place of acceptance with God.<a name=454:17></a> Man can come to God by the altar of burnt-offering.<a name=454:18></a> Thus there is a savour of rest.<a name=454:19></a>

		There are two remarkable passages in the Psalms -- first, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#95:10">Psalm  95:10</a>, 11, where Jehovah says, "They have not known my ways: unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest".<a name=455:5></a> Secondly, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:1">Psalm  132:1</a> - 5, where David says, "Until I find out a place for Jehovah, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob", and verse 8 appeals to Jehovah to arise into His rest.<a name=455:6></a> In verses 13, 14, Jehovah answers, He hath chosen Zion -- this is My <i>rest</i> for ever: here will I dwell.<a name=455:7></a> Now there is a great distinction between these two psalms: the first gives Israel in the wilderness, and the second, David, as a figure of Christ.<a name=455:8></a> It is the difference between Israel looked at on the footing of responsibility, and Christ who has glorified God, and founded mount Zion, the place of God's rest.<a name=455:9></a>

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#95">Psalm  95</a>, gives the thought of Israel excluded from entering into God's rest for their perverseness.<a name=455:10></a> But in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, we have Christ providing for God the place of His rest.<a name=455:11></a> The rest of God is where God <i>dwells</i>, and Christ has provided a place of rest for God.<a name=455:12></a> We may dwell for a moment on this point.<a name=455:13></a> You will remember that when the ark was taken by the Philistines they were plagued of God until they sent it back.<a name=455:14></a> David brought it eventually to mount Zion.<a name=455:15></a> Christ has provided a resting-place for God, where God can dwell, and that is in sovereign mercy, the fruit of redemption.<a name=455:16></a> The boards of the tabernacle were set in sockets of silver; the tabernacle was founded in redemption.<a name=455:17></a> So the true dwelling-place of God is set up in redemption.<a name=455:18></a> Mount Zion speaks of what God

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one other passage, in the prophet Zephaniah, chapter 3: 17, to which we may refer.<a name=456:11></a> This seems to be the climax of what is set forth in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=456:12></a> There we read, "Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is mighty .<a name=456:13></a>.<a name=456:14></a>.<a name=456:15></a> he will rest in his love".<a name=456:16></a> He dwells in the place which Christ has provided for Him, He can joy over His people with singing and rest in His love.<a name=456:17></a> We have thus in the Old Testament a foreshadowing of what will yet be effected in Israel.<a name=456:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the New Testament we come not to the foreshadowing, but to the <i>reality</i> of things.<a name=456:19></a> I would call attention to <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:16">John  5:16</a>, where the Jews sought to slay Jesus because He had done these things on the sabbath day; He says, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work".<a name=456:20></a> I have hitherto spoken of what God works <i>for</i> man, but in this chapter we get the idea that, if there is to be rest, God must work <i>in</i> man; and God had been doing this from the outset.<a name=456:21></a> I do not believe that a man ever approached God save in virtue of a work of God <i>in</i> him.<a name=456:22></a> Abel offered his burnt-offering to God as the result of the work of God in him.<a name=456:23></a> The same principle is seen in Enoch or Noah, or any of the men of faith -- the Father had been working in man all along.<a name=456:24></a> The raising up of the impotent man expressed a work done <i>in</i> him, rather than a work <i>for</i> him.<a name=456:25></a> A man hopelessly incapable took up his bed and walked.<a name=456:26></a> Thus we see

	<div class="paragraph">
		that not only must God work for man, which is set forth in the burnt-offering, but that no man draws near to God except in virtue of a work <i>in</i> him.<a name=457:1></a> And this work still goes on.<a name=457:2></a> Christ's voice is not silent now.<a name=457:3></a> It is still heard.<a name=457:4></a> He works effectively in man, and they that hear His voice <i>live</i>.<a name=457:5></a> God's work <i>in</i> man could not have glorified God, nor removed the judgment that lay on man: this was effected in the cross.<a name=457:6></a> The Christian believes in the work of God <i>for</i> him, and at the same time he himself is a subject of the work of God.<a name=457:7></a> God had set His love on man, and in order to make that love effective it was necessary for God to work <i>in</i> man if man was to have part in God's rest.<a name=457:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To pass on to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>.<a name=457:9></a> Here we see that a promise is <i>left</i> of entering into God's rest.<a name=457:10></a> The argument from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#95">Psalm  95</a>is that if God sware that certain should not enter in, that implied that <i>some would</i> enter in.<a name=457:11></a> "There <i>remaineth therefore</i> a rest to the people of God".<a name=457:12></a> "Let <i>us</i> labour therefore to enter into that rest".<a name=457:13></a> The strict application of this passage is to the time of the kingdom when God will rest in what will be brought to pass in Christ; but <i>faith does</i> enter into rest, we who <i>believe do</i> enter into rest.<a name=457:14></a> Now, rest for us is in entering into God's mind; you penetrate the secret of His rest; you apprehend what gives rest, and that is Christ, and thus you get the virtue of God's rest.<a name=457:15></a> Rest is in the apprehension of the burnt-offering, in which God was glorified.<a name=457:16></a> The cross is the glory of God morally, although not the display of it.<a name=457:17></a> We are before God to the perfect satisfaction of His righteousness, according to the value of the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, and can bear to be measured by the reed, as the angel did the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=457:18></a> The very attributes of God to which sin made us obnoxious we do not now fear; they have been completely vindicated in the work which has been done for us.<a name=457:19></a> You enter into rest as you appreciate the burnt-offering, and the effect of this is that you want to get near to Christ; you are set upon learning
