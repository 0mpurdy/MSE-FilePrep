		It is a great thing to get a right idea of christianity in its true meaning and power, and I am looking at this time at christianity in that sense -- I mean, as the work of God.<a name=1:1></a> Of course, we may look at christianity in connection with the faith of man, because christendom has been formed by the faith of man; it is made up of those who profess to believe on Christ.<a name=1:2></a> A great many now have been born into it, but still in a general way christendom has been made up by the faith of man.<a name=1:3></a> But there is another side to the truth, the work of God; and the true power of christianity lies not in the faith of man -- though not apart from it -- but in the work of God.<a name=1:4></a> I do not think anybody would be prepared to gainsay that.<a name=1:5></a> That is what I want to dwell upon now, because I think it is of the greatest importance that all of us should understand the nature of God's work.<a name=1:6></a> It is presented to us in Scripture that we may know it in its character and effect.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get remarkable instances presented to us in Scripture of the work of God and of its effect.<a name=1:8></a> One instance given to us is that of the woman of Samaria, and I have taken it up to give you, if I could, an idea of the work of God and its effects in the soul.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And let me say this, that what God does He does alone; nobody else interferes; it is God's work from beginning to end, and He produces the result that He intends.<a name=1:10></a> A servant may have a certain idea of what he intends to produce, or would produce if he could, but he may fail in it.<a name=1:11></a> There are very few servants of the Lord, I think, that do not encounter disappointment in that way; they fail of their object.<a name=1:12></a> But God never fails of His object.<a name=1:13></a> He sets Himself to accomplish a certain purpose, and He does accomplish it without fail.<a name=1:14></a> That is as certain as that God is God.<a name=1:15></a>

		I read the passage at the end of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>because it presents to us the attitude of a person who recognises the work of God.<a name=2:1></a> That is what we see in Mary.<a name=2:2></a> She was not active or bustling or excited, but wanted to get the word of Christ.<a name=2:3></a> I think she is an advance, in a certain sense, upon what we have in the preceding incident, the man that fell among thieves.<a name=2:4></a> She represents to us what would be the proper attitude of a man to whom Christ had become a neighbour.<a name=2:5></a> If I find Christ to be my neighbour, then I want to hear the word of Christ.<a name=2:6></a> I feel that Christ has something peculiar to say to me which no one else can say, and I want to hear what He has to teach me.<a name=2:7></a> It is a great point for all of us to be attentive to hear what Christ has to say to us.<a name=2:8></a> If Christ has healed our wounds, set us on His own beast and taken care of us, that does not close His dealings with us.<a name=2:9></a> He has something to say to us, and it is a great thing if our ears are open to what He has to say.<a name=2:10></a> We need to hear the word of Christ.<a name=2:11></a> And what is that?<a name=2:12></a> It is really the expression of Himself.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take up the case of the woman of Samaria because I think she represents in a very remarkable way the work of God.<a name=2:14></a> It is a sample or representative case.<a name=2:15></a> There are two parts in it.<a name=2:16></a> The first is the subduing power from without, that brings her down completely and the second is the source and spring of power within, which springs up into eternal life.<a name=2:17></a> I want to bring before you the extraordinary forces which are thus brought into operation in order that grace may effect its work.<a name=2:18></a> In the world men comprehend what great forces mean, and they understand how to concentrate natural forces to accomplish a particular object; but I want you to see the forces which are brought into operation that Christ may effect <i>His</i> purpose.<a name=2:19></a> This is a typical case.<a name=2:20></a> There is first the outward subduing power which brings the woman down to nothing, which breaks down all her

	<div class="paragraph">
		self-confidence, and puts aside all her thoughts and ideas.<a name=3:1></a> The effect is very much like the case of Mary at the feet of Jesus.<a name=3:2></a> She is subjected or subdued by the word of Christ.<a name=3:3></a> But that is only one side.<a name=3:4></a> There is an equivalent force within the woman which springs up unto everlasting life.<a name=3:5></a> I want just to speak of these two sides of the work of God.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity consists, I think, in two things -- on the one hand man's complete deliverance from all that to which he is in bondage by reason of sin, and on the other hand the formation of new relationships and of the affections which are suited to those relationships.<a name=3:7></a> I have no doubt at all that there is many a believer in Christ, as Lord, who knows very little indeed about the true power of christianity.<a name=3:8></a> I want to bring before you these two things: first, the emancipation of the man (who is very much in the position naturally of a bond slave, whom grace comes in to set free), and then the formation of new relationships and of the affections suited to them.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you were to ask me what constitutes a man, the answer I should give would be this: I judge man to be made up of body and mind, relationships and affections.<a name=3:10></a> I think if you take that in, you will admit the truth of it.<a name=3:11></a> It is true whether we speak of the old man or of the new.<a name=3:12></a> God made man thus at the beginning.<a name=3:13></a> He made him body and mind, and set him in certain relationships, with affections suited to those relationships.<a name=3:14></a> The same is true of the new man.<a name=3:15></a> Grace sets us in certain relationships and forms affections which are suited to those relationships.<a name=3:16></a> But at the same time there is the complete deliverance of the man from all that to which he is naturally in bondage.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The work of God is a great work.<a name=3:18></a> Nothing can be more amazing than God's work with regard to a poor soul, and the wonderful character of the forces which He employs to carry it out.<a name=3:19></a> I think if you apprehend
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it you would understand the immense value of a single soul in the sight of God.<a name=4:1></a> Here in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>it is not a preaching of the gospel to masses, but a simple case of the work of grace with regard to one single individual, though this case is no doubt a typical one.<a name=4:2></a> The same forces have been brought to bear upon each one of us, and with the same object: emancipation and subjection on the one hand, and the formation of affections suited to new relationships on the other.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great thoughts of which I am going to speak in connection with the passage referred to in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>first, the way in which Christ presents Himself to the soul, and next, the well of water, the spring which the Lord would communicate to this poor woman or to any believer: "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst: but the water I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=4:4></a> May God give me grace to show to you what it is that subdues the soul: the presentation of Christ Himself; and on the other hand, what it is that springs up in the believer; and if you put these two things together, I think each one would be prepared to admit that there is not very much of you and me left.<a name=4:5></a> What is of us is subdued, and what springs up is entirely and completely new; it is the effect and fruit of what Christ is.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak first of the subduing, and I think it contemplates this, that a soul has really come to Christ.<a name=4:7></a> I do not think you would understand it without first seeing that the soul has really come to Christ, having received the gift which Christ gives.<a name=4:8></a> And I would ask if this is true of all of us.<a name=4:9></a> Have you really come to Christ?<a name=4:10></a> You may have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, you may confess Him as Lord, and yet keep Him at a distance.<a name=4:11></a> If I think of Him as Lord, He is very great, He is at the right hand of God, I have not sensibly come very close to Him.<a name=4:12></a> But there is another light in which Christ may be apprehended: as the Giver of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		living water; and when you begin to apprehend Him in that light then you get near to Christ, and are conscious of having received from Him the gift of the living water which springs up in you unto eternal life.<a name=5:1></a> I judge it is the soul's apprehension of the Lord Jesus Christ as the blessed Son of God.<a name=5:2></a> I think we all begin by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ -- because the testimony is of the Lord Jesus Christ -- and the confession of Him as Lord; but there is an advance on this, and that is the apprehension of Him in the soul as the Son of God who gives the living water.<a name=5:3></a> "Let him that is athirst come.<a name=5:4></a> And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let me say a word here about the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=5:6></a> What was effected in the death of Christ?<a name=5:7></a> I do not speak at present about righteousness, or in regard to the sacrifice, but of the death of Christ as the revelation of God.<a name=5:8></a> When Christ died, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom -- God was revealed.<a name=5:9></a> The resurrection of Christ, on the other hand, is not exactly the revelation of God, but the setting forth of God's pleasure in regard to man.<a name=5:10></a> I want you to apprehend this thought and to meditate upon it.<a name=5:11></a> The death of Christ is the revelation of God.<a name=5:12></a> It is there that we learn God's love: "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:8">Romans  5:8</a>.<a name=5:13></a> And the rending of the veil was the significant witness on the part of God, that God was fully revealed in love to man.<a name=5:14></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=5:15></a> That was brought to light when the Son of man was lifted up.<a name=5:16></a> The Lord Jesus could say, "It is finished", and He bowed His head and gave up the ghost.<a name=5:17></a> What was finished?<a name=5:18></a> Well, I have no doubt the will of God was completed, but at the same time there was a full revelation of God in His love to man.<a name=5:19></a> He never

	<div class="paragraph">
		came out fully till the death of Christ, not even in the presence of Christ in life on the earth.<a name=6:1></a> Consequently all that system which the veil represented came to an end, for God was no longer hidden, but was in the light of the full revelation of Himself
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the resurrection of Christ we have, as I have already said, not so much the revelation of God as the setting forth of God's pleasure in regard to man.<a name=6:2></a> So we read that Christ was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>).<a name=6:3></a> This was God's pleasure in regard to man, that man should be justified.<a name=6:4></a> And we are justified by faith "on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead".<a name=6:5></a> There was the setting forth of God's pleasure, not only in regard to Christ but in regard to man.<a name=6:6></a> I think if you take in the two thoughts I have mentioned, you will be convinced that the death and resurrection of Christ are great subjects for the contemplation of the believer, and if one contemplate nothing else there is a vast deal to be learnt there.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is on the ground of the death of Christ that the living water is communicated.<a name=6:8></a> "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=6:9></a> That is to say, the intimation made here by the Lord to this woman is that He is the Giver of the gift of God.<a name=6:10></a> That is what marks Christ.<a name=6:11></a> Therefore you can understand that it necessarily follows that He is the Son of God.<a name=6:12></a> Certainly no man, however exalted, could give the gift of God.<a name=6:13></a> No one could give the gift of God except One who is Himself God.<a name=6:14></a> The One who on the cross glorified God, and in whom God was perfectly revealed, is the Giver of the gift of God.<a name=6:15></a> It was the One of whom Jesus had spoken to Nicodemus in the previous chapter (verses 16), and He comes out in this chapter, not as the Son of man lifted up, but as the Giver of the gift of God.<a name=6:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The gift of God I take to be the living water, but Christ is the One who gives it and I think that many persons have received the gift of the Holy Spirit before they are conscious of having received the gift from Christ.<a name=7:1></a> It is only perhaps when one apprehends Christ as the blessed exponent of the love of God that the soul is conscious of having received the gift which Christ gives.<a name=7:2></a> If I apprehend the Son of God, and the gift which He gives, there can only be one effect, I am <i>subdued</i> in the presence of the love of God.<a name=7:3></a> It is such a wonderful thing that the Son of God should have come forth from God to be the Giver of the gift of God, that the soul of man is completely subdued before Himself.<a name=7:4></a> Do you think that any soul naturally believes that God "gives"?<a name=7:5></a> No, I think the natural thought is that God "expects".<a name=7:6></a> It is a new light entirely in which to apprehend God, that He gives, and that the Son of God has come forth to make Him known and to communicate the gift of God.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is perfectly blessed to see the way in which God has been pleased to express Himself, so as to make Himself known to man.<a name=7:8></a> The One who came here to make God known, and who went to the cross that God might be fully set forth, as He never could have been in any other way, is the One who gives the gift of God.<a name=7:9></a> And I desire for every reader, that your soul might be in the presence of the Son of God.<a name=7:10></a> I want you to apprehend the moral greatness of the Son of God.<a name=7:11></a> There, and there only, I think you will learn your own exceeding littleness.<a name=7:12></a> But I pass on to another point in connection with the passage.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at verses 15 - 26 you get another light in which to regard the Son of God, the Giver of the gift.<a name=7:14></a> He is now the prophet.<a name=7:15></a> And how?<a name=7:16></a> Because He is the mouthpiece of God.<a name=7:17></a> And in connection with Him as prophet we have a most important truth, that His word searches the conscience of man.<a name=7:18></a> The woman felt herself brought by the word of Christ into the

		presence of God; she became conscious that she was in the presence of One whose word searched her conscience.<a name=8:1></a> Now I think we have all to enter into the same thing.<a name=8:2></a> There is fulness of grace in the Lord Jesus, but at the same time if you have come into the presence of the Son of God you have become alive to the fact that His word searches your conscience.<a name=8:3></a> It is in the presence of Christ that we learn our own contrariety.<a name=8:4></a> He makes known to us what is of God, and it is in the light of that that a man learns himself.<a name=8:5></a> It is in the presence of love that you learn what the will and life and heart of man are.<a name=8:6></a> Never till a man is brought into the light, to learn what God is, does he really learn what he himself is.<a name=8:7></a> The darkest picture of man in the whole compass of Scripture is found perhaps in the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=8:8></a> The Ephesians had come into the light of God and so the darkness of man's heart was fully manifested.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A christian may go on for many a long day before he really finds out what the springs within him are, but a day comes when he gets a revelation of what is there.<a name=8:10></a> And how?<a name=8:11></a> The light of Christ searches his conscience and makes him aware of the dreadful contrariety and perversity of the human heart.<a name=8:12></a> Look at the best of men in regard to God, and what is he?<a name=8:13></a> His heart is contrary and perverse; its very springs are diametrically opposed to the springs in the heart of God.<a name=8:14></a> Do you know the difference between love and lust?<a name=8:15></a> Lust gratifies itself: if a man loves drink, for instance, he will sacrifice everything, his friends, his family, his health, for the gratification of his lust.<a name=8:16></a> Love on the contrary seeks not its own gratification, but the gratification, the happiness, of its object.<a name=8:17></a> God seeks the good, the blessing of the objects of His love.<a name=8:18></a> I quite admit it is for His own ultimate joy and satisfaction, but that is found in the object of His love being completely blessed and satisfied.<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would dwell a little on this truth: that the Son of God who communicates the gift of God is the Prophet whose word searches the conscience and makes a man know what is in himself.<a name=9:1></a> It is a very great moment when a man learns what he is in the sight of God.<a name=9:2></a> He comes to this: "I know that in me, (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing".<a name=9:3></a> How does a man find that out?<a name=9:4></a> By the light of God.<a name=9:5></a> The light makes my contrariety manifest, and I learn this more and more every day as I go on.<a name=9:6></a> I come to the conclusion that in me good does not dwell.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now another point of view comes out from which to regard Christ.<a name=9:8></a> He knows all the will of God.<a name=9:9></a> The woman begins to talk about worship, and raises the question whether Jerusalem or mount Gerizim is the true place; but she is immediately stopped by Christ, who tells her that it is now neither the one nor the other; and He reveals to her God's will in regard to worship.<a name=9:10></a> He is the Prophet who searches the heart of man, but He is at the same time the One who knows all the will of God, even in regard to worship.<a name=9:11></a> The woman now comes to this point, "I know that Messias cometh, .<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a>.<a name=9:14></a> when he is come, he will tell us all things", and the Lord immediately answers, "I that speak unto thee am he".<a name=9:15></a> And He has told her as to worship: "The hour cometh, .<a name=9:16></a>.<a name=9:17></a>.<a name=9:18></a> when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth".<a name=9:19></a> He could tell her what the Father was seeking, and also what was suitable morally to God.<a name=9:20></a> "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth".<a name=9:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to put these things together.<a name=9:22></a> I am sure I have presented them poorly, but my object is to press that it is in the presence of Christ that we are completely subdued.<a name=9:23></a> You are never completely subdued till you come to close quarters with Christ; and christians are often not subdued because they are content with believing on Christ as Lord, and never

		come to close quarters with Him.<a name=10:1></a> If they did they would have no more spirit left in them, they would have a subduing sense of His greatness, and would know Him as the Giver of the living water, as the One whose word searches the heart and makes known everything there; and at the same time He makes known perfectly what the mind and will of the Father is, and what is suitable to God.<a name=10:2></a> I was only recently reading a psalm which is no doubt familiar to all of us: "Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me".<a name=10:3></a> That is just what the word of Christ does.<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I am going to speak a few words on the other side, but I desire first that every one should have a true apprehension of Christ, that you may be brought to close quarters with Him so as to be completely subdued in His presence.<a name=10:5></a> Nothing will really subdue a man but the apprehension of what Christ is as giver, and of what He knows on your side and on God's side.<a name=10:6></a> When the queen of Sheba saw the grandeur of Solomon, of his house, his servants, the magnificence of all his appointments, there was no more spirit left in her; and it is as we see the moral grandeur of Christ, the Son of God, who gives the living water, whose word searches the conscience, and who knows and reveals all the will of God, that there is no more spirit left in us.<a name=10:7></a> I would that my own and every other soul were really in the presence of His greatness, and completely subjected by it.<a name=10:8></a> I daresay you remember a verse in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, which speaks of our looking for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven, "who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body".<a name=10:9></a> But now mark the rest of the passage: "according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself".<a name=10:10></a> Angels and principalities and powers are made subject to Him, but there is at the same time a spiritual subduing, which is going on now in souls, and which will take effect even in regard to the body,
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to come back for a moment to the well of water which Christ gives.<a name=11:2></a> I have been speaking of the force which acts upon us from without, that is what is presented to us as objective, what Christ is, His greatness as the Son of God.<a name=11:3></a> Now I want to speak of the other side: the water which He gives.<a name=11:4></a> It is a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=11:5></a> What are you and I between the power of Christ on the one hand, and the well of water springing up on the other?<a name=11:6></a> We are not of very much account, except in the eye of God.<a name=11:7></a> There is not much of us left standing.<a name=11:8></a> All a man's self-confidence and self-importance is completely subdued and broken down by the greatness of Christ.<a name=11:9></a> A man does not think very much of himself when he apprehends the Son of God.<a name=11:10></a> He may have had a certain standing and importance previously in the world, but all this is broken to pieces in the presence of the greatness of the Son of God, and the revelation of God's love, and the gift of the living water.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity, in the true power of it, as I said before, consists in relationships and affections.<a name=11:12></a> The grace of God has set us in the place of children before Him, the Father.<a name=11:13></a> We have that truth in the first chapter of this gospel: "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name".<a name=11:14></a> But there is not only the fact of our being put in the place of children, but also the formation, the springing up, of affections which are suited to the relationship in which we are placed.<a name=11:15></a> Take any house in the world, the greatest and grandest you like, what is it without the affections which are suited to the relationships which exist there?<a name=11:16></a> I am afraid there are houses where those affections are lacking.<a name=11:17></a> If a person comes to my house I do not want his attention to be occupied with the surroundings,

		the furniture and the like, I want him to see me at home; and the true adornments of my house are the affections which are proper to the relationships which subsist there.<a name=12:1></a> You have been in houses perhaps where the appointments are all that could be desired, but where there is a great lack of the affections which are suited to the relationships subsisting in the house.<a name=12:2></a> I should not like to have a fine house and gardens and all the surroundings perfectly in keeping, and everything inside the house in moral disorder.<a name=12:3></a> The true adornment of a man's house, as I have said, is the affections proper to the relationships which exist there; and a man is not fit to be an overseer in the house of God if he has not got his own house in order.<a name=12:4></a> I say again, and I think every one here will agree in it, that the real adornment and attraction in every well-ordered house are the affections suited to the relationships subsisting there.<a name=12:5></a>

		GOD'S HOUSE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to say a little at this time of the character of God's house.<a name=16:1></a> This comes before us in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>and 15 in the way of parables: the parables represent the truth of it.<a name=16:2></a> You could not understand the parables of Scripture if the Holy Spirit were not here to expound them; but when you get the exposition, you see in how very striking a manner the truth is presented in the parables.<a name=16:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noticeable that you get the idea of the house in both these chapters: first in connection with the Supper, "Compel them to come in, that my house may be filled"; then at the close of chapter 15, "he came and drew nigh to the house".<a name=16:4></a> You must divest your mind of the idea that heaven is presented in these scriptures: it is God's house that is seen, connected with what transpires here upon earth.<a name=16:5></a> It has been pointed out that you would not get the elder brother in heaven; hence, from the introduction of the elder brother, it is evident that the house refers to what takes place upon earth.<a name=16:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the point of this chapter is that everything is for God: it is not a question in it of what man gets the rejoicing is on the part of God.<a name=16:7></a> In the first parable, the man rejoices; in the second, the woman rejoices; and there is fellowship in the rejoicing, others are led to rejoice with them; in the third parable, the Father justifies the rejoicing: "it was meet that we should make merry".<a name=16:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you take the three parts of the parable together, the idea is evidently rejoicing on the part of God.<a name=16:9></a> It is not a question of what the sheep, or the piece of silver, or the prodigal gained, but of what God gained, and the effect of it: all that transpires affords satisfaction to God; God has His own satisfaction in His own

	<div class="paragraph">
		house.<a name=17:1></a> What comes out of that is that in chapter 15 man is everything for God: he becomes the occasion of rejoicing to God; in chapter 14, man is nothing.<a name=17:2></a> When man is anything in his own eyes, or thinks anything of himself, he does not come in to the Supper; it is only when he comes to the sense that he is nothing that he comes in to the Supper: he is compelled to come in.<a name=17:3></a> It has been said that in chapter 14 you get God's house, and in chapter 15 the guest; but to my mind the point in chapter 14 is that man is nothing, it is his side; and in chapter 15 God is everything, and man is for God.<a name=17:4></a> Whilst man is brought into God's house, all the rejoicing of God is connected with man: man becomes the subject of the rejoicing of heaven.<a name=17:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First let me say a word in connection with the Supper in chapter 14.<a name=17:6></a> I understand the Supper to be the celebration of grace.<a name=17:7></a> The Spirit has come down to bring us into the celebration of grace; therefore you find that wonderful things take place in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=17:8></a> The early disciples were full of joy and gladness, for the Holy Spirit was bringing the mind of man into concert with heaven.<a name=17:9></a> I understand the kingdom to be God's celebration of righteousness; righteousness was accomplished in the death of Christ.<a name=17:10></a> The resurrection of Christ was God's testimony of righteousness; no one is justified short of faith in the resurrection of Christ, because that is God's testimony; no one is approved of God who does not believe in the resurrection of Christ.<a name=17:11></a> But you must go a point further.<a name=17:12></a> The disciples saw Jesus go up: a cloud received Him out of their sight, He was received up to heaven and went to the right hand of God, angels and principalities and powers being made subject to Him (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:22">1 Peter  3:22</a>).<a name=17:13></a> In verse 18 of that chapter Christ has suffered to bring us to God; righteousness was accomplished; in verse 21 you get the testimony, and the answer of a good conscience
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		towards God by the resurrection of Christ: a man gets a good conscience in having accepted the testimony of resurrection.<a name=18:1></a> Then in verse 22 you get the celebration: the Holy Spirit has come down to report the glory of Christ, to bring man's mind into the light of and into accord with what has been accomplished in heaven.<a name=18:2></a> It is the presence of the Holy Spirit which brings about the great Supper; and souls are compelled to come in, that God's house may be filled.<a name=18:3></a> I think there are limits to a house: a house conveys the impression of limits, like the three measures of meal; but at the same time they are compelled to come in that God's house may be filled.<a name=18:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of all importance, when souls have accepted the testimony of God, that they should be brought into christian fellowship, into the place where the rejoicing is.<a name=18:5></a> There must be a great lack on the part of people who, when they have accepted the testimony, fail to come consciously into the place where the Holy Spirit is, that is, fail to recognise God's house.<a name=18:6></a> They do not get into joy, into sympathy with heaven, and I think it is because they fail to recognise God's joy and the presence of the Holy Spirit here.<a name=18:7></a> If that were recognised, all misgivings would disappear, and believers would be brought by the Spirit into the mind of heaven.<a name=18:8></a> God's testimony is the ground for faith; but the Holy Spirit has come down to witness to the delight which heaven has in that which has been accomplished for man here upon earth.<a name=18:9></a> Hence there is joy in the Holy Spirit.<a name=18:10></a> When people are converted they are generally carried into some sect or system -- very often to sacramentalism, and come under the influence of clergy.<a name=18:11></a> That is not the idea of God's house: if they were brought into the sense of God's house and the presence of the Spirit, it is my conviction that they would very soon be in accord with the mind of heaven.<a name=18:12></a> You cannot ignore or disregard the Holy Spirit with impunity.<a name=18:13></a> Many christians are not

	<div class="paragraph">
		bright because they practically ignore the presence of the Spirit.<a name=19:1></a> Souls can only thrive in God's house, where God's Spirit resides, and only in that way can they be brought into communion with heaven.<a name=19:2></a> The effect of it will be that they are filled with joy in the Holy Spirit.<a name=19:3></a> At the beginning christians did not mind suffering, they were filled with joy.<a name=19:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, you have the accomplishment of righteousness, secondly the testimony of righteousness, and lastly the celebration of righteousness.<a name=19:5></a> Now if you enter the house of God, you have to be nothing.<a name=19:6></a> If a man is to be exalted, he has to take the lowest room: if he accepts the presence of the Spirit and the truth of God's house, he has to come down from all high thoughts.<a name=19:7></a> In the latter part of chapter 14 another point comes out: if a man is going to be a disciple of Christ, he must forsake all that he has.<a name=19:8></a> We come into the house and get part in the joy of heaven; but having come in, we want to be disciples of Christ, that we may learn that to which Christ leads, and for this a man must forsake all that he has: his soul must be free from the control of everything down here, because Christ is going to teach him lessons which none but He can teach.<a name=19:9></a> It is the true position of a christian on earth; he has been compelled to come into God's house and at the same time is a disciple of Christ, that he may learn of Christ; like Mary at the close of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>, she came under the teaching of Christ.<a name=19:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I pass on to the next chapter, because I want to speak a little of what is for God.<a name=19:11></a> I think the parables in chapter 15 present to us three persons.<a name=19:12></a> The first parable presents to us Christ Himself; in the second we have, it may be, the Spirit, and in the third the Father.<a name=19:13></a> The first parable represents the labour and service of Christ Himself in regard to the Jew.<a name=19:14></a> It presents the way in which the Lord vindicates Himself as to the charge brought against Him of eating with sinners; He makes manifest that He was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in accord with the mind of heaven, rejoicing in the salvation of the lost sheep.<a name=20:1></a> In the second parable the thought is wider: the Spirit has lit up a light to search in the house for the lost piece of silver.<a name=20:2></a> The reason why God allows the light to be in the world is to bring to light the elect of God.<a name=20:3></a> The light in a sense shines upon everybody -- the truth of the gospel is for all; but the object of the light is, that the elect of God may be brought to light.<a name=20:4></a> I do not doubt they are brought to light in those who love God: they are the called according to His purpose, and they have been brought out by the light which the Holy Spirit sheds down here.<a name=20:5></a> There is no doubt that God has been pleased to reveal Himself in connection with His purpose.<a name=20:6></a> The apostle Paul says, "I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory".<a name=20:7></a> Now there is another point connected with the parable: there is the word "Rejoice with me".<a name=20:8></a> The Holy Spirit looks for fellowship in the rejoicing, because He would bring souls into accord with the mind of heaven.<a name=20:9></a> It is really heaven rejoicing, and looking for fellowship in that rejoicing.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the previous chapter man is nothing; he is subdued under the grace of God; and in this chapter God is everything, and man gets his place here in connection with God.<a name=20:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when you come to the third part of the parable, it is not the man nor the woman calling for fellowship in the rejoicing, but the Father justifying the rejoicing.<a name=20:12></a> He says, It was meet; the rejoicing is justified.<a name=20:13></a> The house represents the place where reconciliation has been brought to pass; you get the great idea of reconciliation in connection with God's house.<a name=20:14></a> God's house is the place where God dwells, and where christian fellowship is enjoyed; and there it is that the good of reconciliation is known.<a name=20:15></a> The first great principle in the house of God is that you come under

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=21>[Page 21]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the teaching of Christ; He teaches you the mind of God toward you; then reconciliation comes in, and the principle of that is, that where there was distance, now there is complacency, and you could not get a more suitable illustration of it than in the prodigal.<a name=21:1></a> The house of God is the scene of complacency.<a name=21:2></a> You may have also the thought of the great house: that is what christianity has become in the hands of man, but we have to get back to the moral idea, the original thought: the house is the place where God has complacency.<a name=21:3></a> It is a point of great moment to connect the thought of reconciliation with God's house.<a name=21:4></a> The prodigal had come under the instruction of Christ, that he might know the Father's disposition towards him.<a name=21:5></a> Now he was entirely suitable to the eye of the Father.<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show you what the secret of that is.<a name=21:7></a> There was one link between the prodigal in the far country and the prodigal in the father's house; that link was conscience.<a name=21:8></a> There was in him the most complete change of individuality; but while there was change of individuality, there was identity of conscience.<a name=21:9></a> I believe identity is maintained in conscience.<a name=21:10></a> The prodigal, in that sense, had the conscience of what he had been; identity was maintained, but individuality was entirely changed.<a name=21:11></a> The prodigal in the far country was morally a different man from the man who sat at the Father's table.<a name=21:12></a> Reconciliation had come to pass; the distance connected with him and the far country had gone.<a name=21:13></a> When be comes into the Father's house he has neither the clothing nor anything that appertained to the prodigal and the far country; he has on him the best robe, the ring, the shoes -- all that described another individuality, which is stamped upon us by the teaching of Christ.<a name=21:14></a> The believer has become a disciple of Christ: he is a man of a different order.<a name=21:15></a> Hence it is that he is suitable to the eye of the Father.<a name=21:16></a> I have no doubt the prodigal

		The designation Son of man in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is perhaps a little more difficult to understand than the others, but it is one of great interest.<a name=24:8></a> The Lord often applied it to Himself, indeed I think He applied no other, and it was a title by which He was known down here.<a name=24:9></a> You will remember that the Jews, although they understood something about the Christ, yet they said, "Who is this Son of man?<a name=24:10></a>".<a name=24:11></a> They did not understand it.<a name=24:12></a> There are two important points in connection with the Son of man: first, His sufferings; secondly, His exaltation.<a name=24:13></a> You get His humiliation in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, but in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>the further thought of His sufferings.<a name=24:14></a> Let me say also that "man" and "Son of man" are two distinct ideas.<a name=24:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8:5">Psalm  8:5</a> the <i>Son</i> of man is referred to.<a name=24:16></a> Adam was not crowned with glory and honour, neither was he the son of man.<a name=24:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>

		SUMMARY OF READINGS ON ROMANS
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first chapter as far as verse 17 gives an introduction to that which follows.<a name=31:1></a> Then in the following verses of chapter 1 and as far as verse 19 of chapter 3 we get the character of the man who has been tested under every conceivable condition.<a name=31:2></a> The apostle then brings out what is connected with the Man that <i>is</i>.<a name=31:3></a> He develops the character of the man that <i>was</i>, in order to make room for God's righteousness and for the Man that <i>is</i>.<a name=31:4></a> Righteousness and power are the prominent attributes of God which form the subject of His gospel, besides that He Himself is made known in love.<a name=31:5></a> The gospel is concerning His Son, but the first great point is making God known, of course by Christ, for in this epistle everything is referred to God.<a name=31:6></a> God is made known in His righteousness, power, and love.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the man that <i>was</i>.<a name=31:8></a> We may so speak of him, because God recognised man up to a certain point; he was under probation; he had a place which he has not now.<a name=31:9></a> We have in these early chapters a survey of man up to the cross.<a name=31:10></a> He has been completely tested, and proved to be unmendable; no good <i>can</i> come out of Him for God.<a name=31:11></a> This was always known to God, but had to be demonstrated so that man might know it.<a name=31:12></a> It was not fully demonstrated until God produced <i>His</i> Man; and these chapters show the state into which man had fallen.<a name=31:13></a> Christ came out, apart from the man that was.<a name=31:14></a> He came out in the order of the new man in resurrection.<a name=31:15></a> You do not properly get the new man in Romans, but Christ inaugurated that order.<a name=31:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is spoken of as of the seed of David because He came as One entitled to a throne on earth.<a name=32:5></a> It shows that God was not unmindful of His promises in the past, and He will yet have a throne on earth according to the sure mercies of David; but the great point in Romans is the introduction of another Man.<a name=32:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 2 shows that God had spoken before, and you must have the link maintained with the past.<a name=32:7></a> In Abraham we have promise, and God's determined purpose to bless is made known.<a name=32:8></a> Then in connection with David we see that God will have His throne here, and, according to His right to dispose of the earth as He sees fit, He will have David's seed upon that throne.<a name=32:9></a> Christ takes that up, but the point here is the introduction of another Man; then to chapter 3: 19 the state of the first man.<a name=32:10></a> At the end of chapter 3 we have God's righteousness established in Christ's blood; in chapter 4 God's power in raising the One who was delivered for our offences; then the offences are gone.<a name=32:11></a> In chapter 5 all is "through him"; that brings in the thought of administration.<a name=32:12></a> God's benefits are administered to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=32:13></a> All is in connection with another Man; and people find it difficult to get into that.<a name=32:14></a> Then in chapter 6 we have the new Head, we reckon ourselves alive in Him, and now it is "in him" and not "through him"; we are in His line, descended from Him.<a name=32:15></a> In chapter 7 there is change of law, we are released from the old husband, but are [married] to another, even to Him that is raised from the dead.<a name=32:16></a> In chapter 8 we are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.<a name=32:17></a> We have there an entirely new thing, our relation to the Spirit.<a name=32:18></a>

		In chapter 5 the thought is more of the last Adam than the second Man, because there everything is "through him", and that involves administration.<a name=33:1></a> "Through him" implies instrumentality.<a name=33:2></a> It is when we come to "in him" that we get the thought of the second Man, the Head, involving descent and derivation.<a name=33:3></a> This does not go so far as new creation, but it involves it.<a name=33:4></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>does not really go beyond reckoning, you reckon yourself to be dead to sin, and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<a name=33:5></a> We do not get the positive doctrine of "in Christ" developed in this epistle.<a name=33:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The early part of this chapter sets forth our experience in the light and blessing of what God has established, that is the new sphere which He has brought to pass.<a name=61:5></a> Peace, favour with God, and the hope of glory are the elements of blessing which belong to us as brought by faith into this sphere.<a name=61:6></a> Peace is consequent on the destruction of the enemy.<a name=61:7></a> It is as with the children of Israel when they had passed through the Red Sea and had come into the wilderness.<a name=61:8></a> In figure it was a new sphere into which they entered, where God was known to them in a new light.<a name=61:9></a> They had Moses for king, and God loved His people.<a name=61:10></a> We have come into the sphere of God's administration where Christ is Lord, and the Holy Spirit is to us the witness of God's love, as in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a>, "Yea, he loved the people".<a name=61:11></a> We have had before us two types, the blood on the lintel and the Red Sea; in the one (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>) the judgment of God was met, in the other (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>) the power of the enemy was overthrown.<a name=61:12></a> Death was the power of the enemy, and in death it was destroyed, and God comes in as the God of resurrection.<a name=61:13></a> It is His glory.<a name=61:14></a> We get, in passing through Christ's death, into the enjoyment of what God has done, and we enter by faith into the new sphere of God's power, where the enemy has no place.<a name=61:15></a> It is an immense thing to realise that there is a sphere where the enemy

		The love of God is seen in that He sent His own Son; so in chapter 5 the death of Christ is the expression of God's love; but here the point is that He sent Him in the likeness of sinful flesh; hence the state has been condemned with the sin that dominated it.<a name=90:11></a> It hardly goes so far as <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, for there we have the opening up of the whole range of divine love; here the truth is more limited, because it is the question of our state; the second verse is connected with the truth of <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, the well of water springing up in the believer.<a name=90:12></a> In principle that was fulfilled in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=90:13></a> The Lord breathed on the disciples and said, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit".<a name=90:14></a> But there is something further than this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=90:15></a> Many have received the Holy Spirit in whom He is hardly a well of water springing up to everlasting life.<a name=90:16></a> The Spirit springing up brings you into the light of God's purpose.<a name=90:17></a> So here if Christ is in you the body is dead, but the well is springing up, "the Spirit is

		All that we have been considering comes in with regard to the outward dealings of God with man, beneath which is the sovereignty in which He carries out His purpose.<a name=105:2></a> What had come to pass was this, that God had let the gentile in on common ground with the Jew.<a name=105:3></a> There was no difference.<a name=105:4></a> The Spirit of God had been communicated alike to both Jew and gentile who believed.<a name=105:5></a> The Jew in his exclusiveness might complain, but the apostle's answer is that God had only vindicated His sovereignty, and none would have had at any time any blessing at all but for that.<a name=105:6></a> He compels them as to their own hereditary history and national blessings to admit the principle, as seen in God's rejection of Ishmael and Esau, and in the destruction of Pharaoh, also in their having been spared when they had made the golden calf -- God retreated into His own sovereignty, and then takes occasion to assert that He will be gracious to whom He wills to be gracious, and that principle eventually let in the gentiles.<a name=105:7></a> At every point God took care to vindicate His sovereignty, so that Israel should not think that God acknowledged flesh.<a name=105:8></a> Take the points presented one after the other.<a name=105:9></a> Ishmael represented the flesh, Esau represented the flesh, the Egyptians represented the flesh, and Israel in the wilderness represented the flesh; so that the key to these chapters is the sovereignty of God which lay underneath all His outward dealings.<a name=105:10></a> He accomplishes His purpose, and at the same time refuses to recognise the flesh.<a name=105:11></a> Thus the whole chapter is unanswerable by a Jew, for their whole status rested upon the sovereignty of God.<a name=105:12></a> When they made the golden calf they might have been cut off to a man, in fact God proposed to Moses to cut them off.<a name=105:13></a> It was through the intercession of Moses that they were spared, but on the principle of

		We have seen in the former section, the reconciling of God's outward dispensational ways with His sovereign mercy and election in the gospel.<a name=120:1></a> The compassions of God are the ground of the exhortation in chapter 12.<a name=120:2></a> We find two principles which have marked God's dealings in the world: on the one hand election, and on the other rejection; the first man is rejected all along the line, and everything is brought to pass in the second Man.<a name=120:3></a> If we trace this through Scripture, Isaac is the man of purpose and Ishmael is rejected; then Jacob is chosen and Esau is rejected; Israel finds mercy, "I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion", and Pharaoh is destroyed.<a name=120:4></a> Then there is the election from Jew and gentile, and Lo-ammi on Israel; and eventually Israel is brought back and the gentile rejected.<a name=120:5></a> These two principles of sovereign mercy and rejection have always lain underneath the dispensational dealings of God: every one who is saved in the present dispensation is saved through sovereign mercy; at the same time the principle of rejection is shown in the Jews, for the time being they are cut off.<a name=120:6></a> The rejection of man is not until he has filled up the measure of his perverseness.<a name=120:7></a> Pharaoh was allowed to fill up his measure, and so the Jew and the gentile.<a name=120:8></a> There is the sovereign grace of God to the vessels of mercy, and the perverseness of man; and there are the sovereign rights of God, and if He rejected Ishmael and Esau He had a right to do so.<a name=120:9></a> Rejection is a principle on which God has acted from the outset, and the force of this to the Jew was that their own position was dependent on it; if Ishmael had not been rejected, Isaac would not have had the place he had.<a name=120:10></a> Israel is spared on the ground of sovereign mercy.<a name=120:11></a> All who are saved come in on that ground, but if there is the sovereignty of mercy, there must be rejection.<a name=120:12></a> God would have been

		Saints ought to be conscious that they are the objects of God's sovereign mercy, and, in proportion as we are affected by the compassions of God, we are here for His pleasure, that is, for His will.<a name=121:5></a> The christian's body is a sacrifice -- a thing devoted which cannot be recalled, it is for the will of God; hence the christian cannot use his body as he pleases.<a name=121:6></a> It would make a great change with us, if we were conscious in the depths of our souls of being saved in the sovereignty of God's mercy.<a name=121:7></a> There comes a moment in the soul's history when the obligation to present the body as a living sacrifice is accepted, but then this has to be maintained.<a name=121:8></a> If the body is a living sacrifice, there is not a bit of the will of the flesh animating it.<a name=121:9></a> It could not be a living sacrifice unless its deeds were mortified, it would only bring forth fruit unto death; but if the body is a living sacrifice it is dead in regard of the lusts and will of the flesh.<a name=121:10></a> A point of great practical importance in yielding the body a living sacrifice is, that, in effect, it breaks the link with the course of things here; we are not conformed to this age, but are transformed by

		No one can really understand the house of God, who does not see the last Adam appearing in the presence of God in subsisting righteousness; there is not only the perfect purgation of sins, but the last Adam appearing for us in the presence of God, so that all is administered by Him in grace; the first thing resulting from that was the gift of the Holy Spirit which formed the house of God.<a name=122:7></a> The house is set up in the sanctification of the Spirit, as separate from the world as the Holy Spirit is separate; we all admit now the existence of the great house, and we have to confront the confusion, but we are not worth much if we do not get hold of the divine idea in the midst of the unreality around.<a name=122:8></a> The tabernacle as presented in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>was a pattern of things in the heavens, and everything connected with it had to be purged with blood; but the heavenly things, that is, the things connected with christianity, had to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle recognises the times of the gentiles when power is committed to man; and the christian has to accept this; we recognise that we are in a scene that is subject to man; if a demand is made we submit to it.<a name=128:7></a> We have to be obedient, not loyal, though not disloyal.<a name=128:8></a> If a different form of government were established, it would be our duty to submit to it, which if loyal to the queen we could not do -- the authority is the ordinance of God.<a name=128:9></a> Government in itself is never bad, in its nature it is good; there can be no worse calamity for a country than anarchy, there may be abuse in government, but it is always good in principle.<a name=128:10></a> Circumstances may occur when man's government intrudes into the things of God, so as to come athwart a christian's conscience, and then it is plain that the christian must not do evil.<a name=128:11></a>

		The subject of ministry is brought forward in this chapter in a remarkable way.<a name=132:12></a> The ministry of the Lord to the circumcision is first noticed, and then that of the apostle to the gentiles, while in the latter part we have his temporal ministry to the poor saints at Jerusalem; to the gentiles it was in spiritual things, to the Jews in temporal.<a name=132:13></a> The Lord was a minister of the circumcision to confirm the promises made of God to the fathers, but with another purpose in view -- that the gentiles should glorify God for His mercy.<a name=132:14></a> The apostle takes up two ideas with regard to himself; he speaks of himself as an offering priest, offering up the gentiles, and as a minister (deacon) towards the Jews.<a name=132:15></a> The object of the epistle was the practical knitting

		Verse 8.<a name=133:2></a> The truth of God rendered it imperative that Christ should come to confirm the promises made to the fathers.<a name=133:3></a> There was no making the truth of God good in any other way, for the simple reason that all God's ways were in anticipation of the coming of Christ.<a name=133:4></a> For instance, such a thought as in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:18">Genesis  22:18</a>, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed", could only be fulfilled in Him.<a name=133:5></a> Whatever light God saw fit to give came in through the circumcision, they had the oracles of God.<a name=133:6></a> God took up the seed of Abraham and made them the depositaries of the truth.<a name=133:7></a> All the communications from God came to them -- the prophets, the psalms, and Christ Himself came on that line.<a name=133:8></a> So Paul, when raised up, puts Jews before gentiles, and when preaching in any city went to the Jews first, and took up that ground with them; they had the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants.<a name=133:9></a> Then to that is added in Scripture the idea of mercy going out to the gentiles, which brings in the thought of divine sovereignty, as seen in the case of the Syrophenician woman.<a name=133:10></a> The Lord says, "it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs", but she answers, "Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table".<a name=133:11></a> She gets the mercy of God.<a name=133:12></a> The promises are confirmed in Christ risen from the dead.<a name=133:13></a> As many as are the promises of God, in Him is the yea and in Him the Amen.<a name=133:14></a> How could the universe of bliss be held together, and men be blessed, if there were not a centre, if Christ had not the priestly place?<a name=133:15></a> All will be dependent on Him in the eternal state, not in the

		Evidently the object here is the binding together of Jew and gentile, the passage (verses 8, 9) connects the gentile with Christ in a remarkable way, "That the gentiles should glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the gentiles", that is, Christ will confess among the nations.<a name=134:13></a> "Praise the Lord, <i>all</i> ye nations", "Praise him, <i>all</i> ye people".<a name=134:14></a> It is universal praise.<a name=134:15></a> Again, Esaias saith, "There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles, in him shall the gentiles hope".<a name=134:16></a> Christ is hope to the gentiles.<a name=134:17></a> Evidently the passages are taken with the view of

		The apostle speaks about himself as "ministering the gospel of God".<a name=135:6></a> This is remarkable, he takes up the gospel here as priestly service, rather than levitical.<a name=135:7></a> It is a similar idea to that of Aaron offering up the Levites.<a name=135:8></a> Anything offered sacrificially was devoted and could not be recalled, and this is the way in which the apostle looks upon the gentiles here.<a name=135:9></a> Preaching, looked at generally, is levitical service, not priestly; but here Paul is looking at his own apostolic work, and takes up the totality of the ministry of the gospel of God, regarding it as priestly service; he was Jesus Christ's minister.<a name=135:10></a> While the ministry of Jesus Christ in its full public blessing both for Jew and gentile is still deferred owing to His rejection, the apostle Paul is raised up to carry on a special work among the gentiles, and the results of this are looked at as a first-fruit, and perhaps representative; as the Levites were taken out from Israel.<a name=135:11></a> It is not the salvation of the gentiles, as such, that is here in view, but the taking out a people from the gentiles.<a name=135:12></a> It is not exactly the preaching of the gospel which is before the mind of the apostle, but the offering up of the whole of the company taken out from the gentiles, looked at as one offering, and all the fruit of the apostle's work; he was minister of Jesus Christ to the uncircumcision, as Jesus Christ had Himself been minister to the circumcision.<a name=135:13></a>

		It is remarkable that the apostle should speak of his deacon work after this, the two things not being on the same level; the offering up of the gentiles is a very different service from ministering to the Jews in temporal things; and though the apostle in carrying out the latter may have fallen below his proper apostolic work, yet the Spirit recognises his service.<a name=136:8></a> The apostle speaks in a tremulous way of his visit to Jerusalem, and asks their prayers as to it, but still we have the fact that the Spirit of God refers to it in connection with his affection for the saints.<a name=136:9></a> He was a bond between Jew and gentile, he had ministered the gospel of God to the gentiles, and then on behalf of gentiles he ministered in carnal things to the Jews.<a name=136:10></a> It is evident from the Acts that Paul went up to Jerusalem against the Spirit's warning, but he was a devoted man, and not serving himself in going up, and we may hesitate in judging of the conduct of a man so much greater than ourselves.<a name=136:11></a> The thought in his mind was apparently that of reciprocity.<a name=136:12></a> The gentiles could not minister to the Jews in spiritual things, and therefore it was important that they should minister in carnal

		It might be a matter of interest to us to pay a little attention to what one may call a first and last word of Christ to the church, that our attention might be taken up with the things that are.<a name=217:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John was charged to write the things which he had seen, which I take to refer to the vision of Christ in chapter 1.<a name=217:2></a> "The things which are", that is, the church as a witness here, and "the things which shall be hereafter", after the church has ceased to occupy the place of witness here on earth.<a name=217:3></a> The proper place of the church down here is that of witness.<a name=217:4></a> In the ways of God the church is set to be a faithful witness, or light-bearer; that thought is conveyed to us under the symbol of the seven golden candlesticks.<a name=217:5></a> The thought of God has always been that there should be a witness of Himself; even among the idolatrous gentiles God did not leave Himself without witness.<a name=217:6></a> Israel was established as a witness in the earth on the part of God.<a name=217:7></a> In Isaiah God continually refers to Israel as such -- a witness against idolatry.<a name=217:8></a> The time came when Israel ceased to be a witness for God; that moment had arrived long before Christ came; then Christ came, and <i>He</i> was the true witness.<a name=217:9></a> Now at the present moment, until Christ comes again, the church is the witness; the church was established as a witness here to the Man in heaven, at the right hand of God, in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<a name=217:10></a> The Holy Spirit has come down as witness to the glory of that Man; but the Holy Spirit must have a vessel in which the witness is maintained; that vessel is the church: hence you get here the symbol of the golden candlesticks.<a name=217:11></a> It is very important

		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to understand the place the church has as witness.<a name=218:1></a> In the end of chapter 3 you get Christ coming in as the faithful and true witness when the church has not proved to be a faithful witness.<a name=218:2></a> Christendom is not a true witness of Christ, for the witness of Christ to be effectual must be a witness morally, not merely by word of mouth; and christendom is not that.<a name=218:3></a> The church has not maintained that place, hence we get these epistles written to the seven churches; and now the time is near when Christ will appear as "the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God".<a name=218:4></a> Adam was not the beginning of the creation of God, he was historically the first man; Christ is the beginning of the creation of God, and He is the faithful and true witness when everything has failed.<a name=218:5></a> What will come to pass is that Israel will come again into the place of witness in connection with Christ; the golden candlestick in the holy place was symbolic of Israel in that way in the world to come; that is the issue of things here on earth.<a name=218:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I want to touch upon is the <i>first</i> word of Christ to the church after its defection.<a name=218:7></a> If you pass on to the close of the next chapter you get the <i>last</i> word of Christ to the church; it is extremely important to take these into account.<a name=218:8></a> If by the grace of God we have been led to return, in any measure, to first things, you may be pretty sure that history will repeat itself in us, and the defection will be much of the same character as at the outset.<a name=218:9></a> It is a fatal mistake now to set up to be anything here on earth.<a name=218:10></a> If we have returned to the first things in any measure, we are exposed to the same defection that overtook the church at the beginning.<a name=218:11></a> I am going to speak a little as to what that was, and at the same time to say a word as to the promise to the overcomer.<a name=218:12></a> The overcomer is essentially individual, and the promise is not to the church, but to the overcomer: the very thought of an overcomer implies that the current is against you, and

		<a name=219>[Page 219]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		if you do not go against it, you will not be an overcomer.<a name=219:1></a> It is a proof of vital energy to go against the current; the Lord has pleasure in the overcomer.<a name=219:2></a> I have often thought of the promise to the overcomer in Laodicea when things had got to the worst.<a name=219:3></a> The Lord says, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne".<a name=219:4></a> The Lord will have the company of the overcomer with Him there; such a thought as that ought to engage the attention of every christian.<a name=219:5></a> It is wonderful encouragement that the Lord will have the overcomer to be associated with Him, that He will have his company with Him in His throne.<a name=219:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point of departure which marked the church was that it had left its first love; it is extremely important to see the principle and character of the defection.<a name=219:7></a> The Lord commends everything that it was possible to commend, but in leaving its first love it had given up its place of witness.<a name=219:8></a> There was no longer fidelity in the place of witness; nothing can be more important than to understand that the church was left here as a witness in the absence of Christ.<a name=219:9></a> The Bridegroom is in heaven, and the bride on earth; the church should be mourning the absence of the Bridegroom, and yet have the Bridegroom dwelling in the heart by faith; that is the true position of the church.<a name=219:10></a> Not going in the current of the world, not overcome by the power of present things, but in a sense desolate in the absence of the Bridegroom, and yet not desolate because Christ is dwelling in the heart by faith.<a name=219:11></a> The practical effect would be the Bridegroom set forth in the bride, and at the same time the bride entirely taken up with the interests of the Bridegroom.<a name=219:12></a> That is what I understand by Christ dwelling in the heart by faith, and for that everything depends upon the appreciation of Christ.<a name=219:13></a> There was evidently a drawing back in the church, and the appreciation of

		Now a word with regard to how we are led into the appreciation of Christ.<a name=220:3></a> Christ is presented to us in the gospel in the first instance as a point of attraction; even in the Old Testament we have the figure of the Sun of righteousness; you cannot entertain the idea of the sun without the thought of a power of attraction.<a name=220:4></a> The Lord says, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=220:5></a> If Christ is to draw to Himself, it implies that there must be a power of attraction in Himself; and that power is that every thought of grace on the part of God towards man is presented to men in a Man, and that Man is Christ -- "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus"; that is what I should understand to be the principle of attraction which resides in the Sun of righteousness.<a name=220:6></a> It is quite true that nobody is drawn to Christ unless God works, but that does not alter the power of attraction in Christ.<a name=220:7></a> The fact that men do not come to Christ proves the terrible deadness and insensibility on the part of man to all that is of God; as I said before, you cannot entertain any thought of grace on the part of God towards man save in a Man, and that Man has taken up every liability under which men were, in order that in Him the grace of God might be presented to man, so that he might be attracted to the Sun of righteousness; it is the first principle in the ways of God in regard to man.<a name=220:8></a> The next point is you become attached to Christ, and that attachment is brought about by the Spirit which Christ gives to the one who is responsive to the grace presented in Him.<a name=220:9></a> There is a link formed between the believer and Christ, and that link is in the Spirit.<a name=220:10></a>

		It is by attachment to Christ that we shall be kept from the evil of the world.<a name=221:1></a> The Lord says, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture".<a name=221:2></a> You do not want the shelter of a fold; you are kept, whatever the condition of things in the world, by the power of attachment to Christ; you are saved, are in liberty, and find pasture.<a name=221:3></a> The most gifted intellect in the world could not explain how a christian is kept down here, preserved from evil and temptations and allurements, and at the same time finding pasture.<a name=221:4></a> He does not go to the world's fields to find pasture, he is independent of them.<a name=221:5></a> The secret of it all is attachment, which exists in the Spirit of Christ, the living water which Christ gives, and which springs up in the believer unto everlasting life.<a name=221:6></a> What follows is that you get the knowledge of Christ.<a name=221:7></a> "I .<a name=221:8></a>.<a name=221:9></a>.<a name=221:10></a> know my sheep, and am known of mine".<a name=221:11></a> The apostle Paul says, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord".<a name=221:12></a> It is a great point to arrive at the appreciation of Christ; then it is we are prepared to part with ourselves, because we have found in Christ that which is supremely excellent; and in result we have Christ dwelling in the heart by faith.<a name=221:13></a>

		Then you come to the defection -- the Ephesians had got away from the first appreciation of Christ; they had left their first love; Christ was not dwelling in the heart by faith; they had lost that which separated them from the present course of things.<a name=222:2></a> I do not think any christian can be maintained in separation from the world except in the appreciation of Christ.<a name=222:3></a> And when I speak of appreciation of Christ, I speak not only of what Christ is personally, but of all that of which He is the centre; that vast system of which He is the beginning and the end.<a name=222:4></a> He is the Head of all principality and power; Head of every man; He is the Head of every family; of the church, Israel; hence we need to entertain the thought of Christ in that light.<a name=222:5></a> But at the same time we need to be led by the Spirit into the appreciation of what He is morally, because it is in that way we understand the character He gives to every family in the universe of bliss.<a name=222:6></a> "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things".<a name=222:7></a> The church takes her character from Christ at the present time, and is left here, that the excellencies of Christ might be displayed in her.<a name=222:8></a> The point of departure was in getting away from the appreciation of Christ, and we have to be on the watch against this.<a name=222:9></a> We need to be continually vigilant; there are dangers around us on every side; the things that are passing around us tend to dim our appreciation of Christ.<a name=222:10></a> I wish that Christ might be so brought before our vision that we might be led by the

		I have read these passages with the desire of saying a little on what I might call the last words of Jesus.<a name=225:1></a> The last words of people who have passed away have a peculiar significance and are cherished in the thoughts of others; but it does not always follow that the one who has said his last word has passed away.<a name=225:2></a> It is certainly not the case with regard to the Lord, but He has nothing more to say.<a name=225:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have had the last words of Christ here in various connections.<a name=225:4></a> In the gospel of John it is in connection with His life and ministry here; in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>it is His last word to the church, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me".<a name=225:5></a> And the word at the close of Revelation is addressed to whosoever thirsts, "Let him that is athirst, come.<a name=225:6></a> And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=225:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Evidently these are last words, and derive their significance from the circumstances under which they were spoken.<a name=225:8></a> I will dwell on these words in their connection.<a name=225:9></a> It is His word that endures until the Lord comes again; every word of Jesus is expressive of Himself.<a name=225:10></a> In John's gospel, when they questioned Him as to who He was, His reply was, "Altogether that which I also say to you".<a name=225:11></a> It is of extreme importance to hear what the Lord has to say to us at the present moment, so to speak -- His last word.<a name=225:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if we take into account that the words of Jesus are the expression of Himself, these last words bring before us the way in which He now presents Himself; and to look at them may be a real benefit to us.<a name=225:13></a> The effect should be that our ears being opened to this

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will now consider His last words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#19">John  19</a>.<a name=226:3></a> It is plain that they are connected with the close of His pathway on earth.<a name=226:4></a> He was on the point of departure, and the word we get in that connection is, "It is finished".<a name=226:5></a> Christ had been here for the will of God, to accomplish redemption.<a name=226:6></a> He "was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death .<a name=226:7></a>.<a name=226:8></a>.<a name=226:9></a> that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man".<a name=226:10></a> It is perfectly true that man was tested by the presence of the Son of God on His road to the cross; but the real purpose of the coming of the Son of God was to accomplish redemption; there is abundance of witness in the Old Testament to this.<a name=226:11></a> In death Christ bore the judgment of God that lay upon man.<a name=226:12></a> He became the victim, the Lamb, foreordained before the foundation of the world.<a name=226:13></a> What it really meant was that, in Christ, God Himself came to take up the liability under which man lay under His judgment; it had been impossible otherwise for a creature to be saved.<a name=226:14></a> You cannot conceive a greater expression of the love of God.<a name=226:15></a> In the death of Christ the world system came to an end for God.<a name=226:16></a> The apostle Paul says, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world".<a name=226:17></a> It is evident from that passage that for God the world system had come to an end in the cross of Christ.<a name=226:18></a> The Lord says, "It is finished".<a name=226:19></a> He had come down to accomplish the will of God; and <i>all</i> was finished, but the world had exercised its own judgment on

	<div class="paragraph">
		The last word of Christ to the church is very remarkable.<a name=230:5></a> It is surprising that whilst Christ recognises such a state of things as existing, He is content to wait upon it in patience.<a name=230:6></a> He will not identify Himself with it, but in patience and grace He waits upon it, and calls attention to Himself: "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me".<a name=230:7></a> That is wonderful!<a name=230:8></a> He who is the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, says He will come in and sup with me, and I with Him.<a name=230:9></a> What I understand by it is that He will sympathise with me in my things, and lead me into the communion of His things; and the practical result is that I gain the most blessed intimate acquaintance with Christ Himself.<a name=230:10></a> Orthodoxy is not the real answer to the existing state of things; the real answer is Christ Himself, and what we want is attachment of heart to Him, and the sense of His grace and patience in waiting on such a state of things as is depicted here, as prepared to come into anyone who will open the door.<a name=230:11></a> When the Lord was upon earth He supped with His disciples; they were all familiar with Him, John even lying in His bosom.<a name=230:12></a> We see the expression of this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=230:13></a> There is nothing to be more appreciated than the

		Great as Christ is, He attends upon such a state of things as is described here; and if we have opened the door, we know something of His tenderness, sympathy, and consideration on the one hand, and on the other we have understanding of His interests, and this is a great preparation to fidelity to Him down here.<a name=231:3></a> It is a great reality, and available to every one of us.<a name=231:4></a>

		In chapter 3 there is a circle in association with Christ marked by two things, namely, the practice of righteousness, and love for the brethren, and in that circle I should say eternal life abides.<a name=271:3></a> One great point in regard to eternal life is that you have passed out of death.<a name=271:4></a> What is characteristic of eternal life is Christ -- He is the true God and eternal life.<a name=271:5></a> I think eternal life is really Christ coming into the world, and bringing in all the light of God, and setting aside the power of evil.<a name=271:6></a> The apostle begins the epistle by referring to what they had witnessed in Christ Himself.<a name=271:7></a>

		I have thought that the difference between the gospel and the epistle of John is that the gospel takes up man where he is, and shows the quickening power of God in regard to him and then he finds good -- the living bread; whilst the epistle shows what the eternal life is into which he is to enter.<a name=279:12></a> Take for instance a new-born child, it must not only have food and nourishment, but the life of the child is dependent upon certain conditions into which the child is born, that is, there must be light, warmth, air and so on -- they are necessary conditions of life.<a name=279:13></a> So in the gospel of John you get all that is necessary for the state of the persons and in the epistle you get all the conditions of life.<a name=279:14></a>

		I have seen your letter to -- -- and am constrained to write to you what I judge and have no doubt is, in the main, the truth as to the points you raise.<a name=287:4></a> If I understand you, you sum up the whole penalty due on God's part to sin and sinners in one word, namely, the judgment pronounced to Adam -- 'death'.<a name=287:5></a> You connect with this what Paul says of the gentiles -- "dead in trespasses and sins" and you sum up the work of Christ in grace in the same one word 'death'.<a name=287:6></a> Now the evil of this is, that what is pronounced as a penalty against sin, namely, death, is confounded with what is a moral condition ("dead in trespasses and sins") which is a very different thing; and more than this, in connecting the work of Christ with it, there is a fear of connecting <i>Him</i> with our moral condition, which, even when in our position (that is as a Man in flesh) and as "made sin" by God, He was apart from entirely.<a name=287:7></a>

		Him.<a name=288:1></a> This the gospel offers to me, telling me that I have died with Christ -- the consequence is <i>that even here</i> by a new life, in the power of faith and of the Holy Spirit, I find an entrance into a new and heavenly order of things, into which Christ has entered as Man, and which Scripture calls the new existence ("newness of life").<a name=288:2></a> But the ground of this is that the first existence ("life of flesh") as before God with its sins, is closed.<a name=288:3></a> Again if I were a Jew looking for life in the earth and blessing, I should see that the sins of the people whereby they had forfeited life, had brought death to Christ, and as a consequence of His death, that the penalty of death was lifted off from the people, and they established in life and blessing on earth, their sins forgiven, because Christ had suffered the penalty.<a name=288:4></a> Now all this is connected with grace triumphing over the power of Satan in the very scene where Satan has corrupted God's creation, and lorded it, by the power of death, over God's people.<a name=288:5></a> It does not go beyond <i>this world</i>.<a name=288:6></a> The believer sees an end of the first Adam existent in the death of Christ -- stands reconciled through it to God, and is in a new life as a heavenly thing in the face of the world.<a name=288:7></a> The Jewish nation hereafter, with the penalty of death lifted <i>off</i>, are established in life and blessing, sins being forgiven, in the presence of Christ -- but all within the limits of this world -- complete triumph over Satan, and the power of death, through the death of Christ.<a name=288:8></a>

		scene, and speaking of a life right above and beyond this scene by its very nature, I find that though He can warn the Jews that they will die in their sins, yet He speaks in the same gospel of results of sin, beyond death, this is resurrection to judgment.<a name=289:1></a> Again, I find the truth declared, "it is appointed to men once to die, and after that the judgment".<a name=289:2></a> Again I find men <i>raised from the first</i> death, judged, put under <i>the second death</i>, and death cast into the lake of fire.<a name=289:3></a> Again, I find the revelation in the gospel, of the judgment of the secrets of men's hearts by Jesus Christ and of wrath of God from heaven, upon all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men; again, that God will reward every man according to his works -- indignation, wrath, tribulation and anguish on every soul of man that doeth evil.<a name=289:4></a> Here I find God dealing with sin and sinners according to the exigencies of His own nature; but, although the works for which they are dealt with were done in this world, yet the action and dealing and results are eternal, and beyond altogether the course of this world.<a name=289:5></a> Hence the certainty of eternal punishment.<a name=289:6></a> The freeing me from the assertion of God's rights upon me in this world (that is death), so that I can consider myself dead with Christ, or if I were a Jew might count upon life on earth, could not be, unless these eternal consequences had been met by Christ, and sin and sins dealt with in Him according to the exigencies of God's holiness.<a name=289:7></a> The consequence is that I find a class of texts referring to Christ in regard to sin and sins (the latter having more especial reference to the act of God's people before Christ died) in connection with which death is not expressly mentioned, and these are the passages that connect sin with Christ.<a name=289:8></a> I will quote those which occur to me.<a name=289:9></a>

		From Adam to Moses <i>death</i> reigned universally (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:14">Romans  5:14</a>), then the law came in which (though ordained to life) was <i>the ministry of death</i> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:7">2 Corinthians  3:7</a>).<a name=291:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Habakkuk.htm#2:3">Habakkuk  2:3</a>, 4, we have the idea presented that Christ might tarry as to His coming, but ever to be waited for; and in the meantime the just shall live by faith.<a name=291:2></a> (This we see made good in Romans and Hebrews).<a name=291:3></a> Then Christ came that the sheep might have life and might have it very abundantly.<a name=291:4></a> Death was annulled and life and incorruptibility brought to light.<a name=291:5></a> Then the Spirit was given (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>) as a breath of inward life, to be a well of water in saints, making good <i>in</i> them what Christ had acquired <i>for</i> them by redemption.<a name=291:6></a> They now live in the Spirit as children of God.<a name=291:7></a> As regards saints in the millennium the coming of the Lord will release the elect from the presence of death, they will be placed by Him under the new covenant and the law written in their hearts.<a name=291:8></a> Thus I judge they will live in a regenerated earth.<a name=291:9></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- In reply to yours of 25th I send a line to try and explain what I mean by 'mixed conditions'.<a name=292:11></a> The truth is that a christian is of new creation before he has done with the old; he is heavenly before he has done with the earthly; he has eternal life before he has done with his responsible life as a man down here.<a name=292:12></a> Hence while on the one hand we are a new creation in Christ where old things have passed away and all things have become new, on the other hand we have to run a race, to continue in the faith, to see that sin and flesh do not reign in us.<a name=292:13></a> In Ephesians we see our new creation state, in Romans our responsible life as still here in old creation condition and circumstances, but justified and indwelt by the Spirit.<a name=292:14></a> This makes the mixed condition, and it is of all moment to see these things in their distinctness or we fail to see either the true character of the new creation order -- or to appreciate the grace by which we are supported in our responsible life while here.<a name=292:15></a> It is somewhat like a dissolving view; the new picture has come on to the scene before the old has completely passed away.<a name=292:16></a>

		The term 'eternal life' in the New Testament is evidently taken up from the Old, and what was in the minds of the Jews.<a name=294:8></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:39">John  5:39</a> is a clear proof of this.<a name=294:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:3">Psalm  133:3</a> we learn it is blessing, promised for Israel, commanded of God in Zion.<a name=294:10></a> I believe the main thought of it to be liberation from the power of sin and the penalty of death.<a name=294:11></a> Israel will enjoy this in the kingdom (for which they will be born again).<a name=294:12></a> We have it in the relationship of children with the Father, for which not only are we born again but Christ lives in us in the power of the Spirit.<a name=294:13></a> The blessing is revealed in Christ who has annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light, but I can see no such idea in Scripture as its being an essential title of the Son.<a name=294:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel of John the Lord is never said to be 'eternal life' for the reason, I believe, that He is presented to us in the divine aspect of His Person -- "The Word became flesh".<a name=294:15></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I hasten to answer your letter, and to express my sympathy with you in the very trying condition of things existing at St.<a name=295:12></a> Ives.<a name=295:13></a> I had not heard, till a day or two ago, of the activity of evil that was going on there.<a name=295:14></a> At the same time I must say that it appears to me very sad to witness the lightness with which saints can be carried away from a fellowship which they have enjoyed for long by attacks on supposed statements of some brother which they have not concerned themselves to examine.<a name=295:15></a> I do not think that it bears witness to a soul under the influence of grace.<a name=295:16></a>

		The 'monstrosity' referred to a sentence of Major Macarthy and simply meant that is was a monstrous statement.<a name=296:4></a> It was that the Lord never ceased to be the exhibition of eternal life from the babe in the manger to the throne of the Father.<a name=296:5></a> This sentence has been so much discussed that I do not think I need say anything as to it.<a name=296:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the babe in the manger being God manifest in the flesh, the matter arose thus.<a name=296:7></a> A sister (Miss Kingscote) wrote to ask me if I would admit that that blessed babe was God manifest in the flesh.<a name=296:8></a> I answered that I wholly objected to such a method of treating Scripture -- in putting together passages of scripture which have no immediate connection and making them thus combined a kind of article or test of orthodoxy.<a name=296:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:7">Luke  2:7</a> we read that Mary brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger, and I, with every christian, hold that the babe was the Son of God.<a name=296:10></a> In <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a> we read God has been manifested in the flesh -- that is, as I understand it, has been <i>made manifest</i>; the light and grace and character and works of God have been made manifest in flesh -- as Christ as Man -- hence I can understand that the world is guilty in having both seen and hated both Christ and His Father -- I maintain the truth of the two passages -- but I do not believe that the one is the synonym of the other.<a name=296:11></a> As to the idea of death being the only punishment of Old Testament sinners I never said or thought anything of the kind.<a name=296:12></a> It is true that in the Old Testament death is because God's governmental dealings are in view, but I should hold in regard to all that it is appointed to men once to die and after that the judgment.<a name=296:13></a>

		In regard to what came up in Dublin, I may say that one point pressed on us was the continuance of the thought of eternal life to heaven.<a name=298:3></a> In proof of this the verse <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a> was quoted, I said that it did not prove anything beyond the present, for it presented the character which eternal life takes for us now, knowledge is a thing for the present, when the perfect is come then knowledge will vanish away, knowledge is that in which there is no progress, and when we know even as we are known, then knowledge will have no place.<a name=298:4></a> I only used this to show that the argument drawn from the verse in question is not conclusive.<a name=298:5></a> It appears that knowledge is the form which eternal life takes to us in contrast to that in which it will be enjoyed by the saints in the millennium.<a name=298:6></a> As to the point of 'communication of life', I see that the Spirit is life, and if this is what is meant by the communication of life, then I have no objection.<a name=298:7></a> But antecedent to the communication of the Spirit I cannot see the communication of anything but a work of God in a man by which his eyes are opened, so that he can apprehend a testimony of God.<a name=298:8></a> It may be that others mean the same thing as I do, but if so, why do they not drop human forms of expression and adopt those found in Scripture?<a name=298:9></a> Scripture speaks of a work in a man, he is born again, or new created, or quickened, I do not see that this is the communication of anything to him, though it may have been spoken of innocently enough in this way.<a name=298:10></a> I do not believe it is just to speak of a man being alive to God until he loves, or life is just below the level of the law and if a man loves it is the result of the Spirit having made him acquainted with the love of God.<a name=298:11></a> The antecedent work of God is in view of this end.<a name=298:12></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am pleased to answer your letter, and am very glad to see that you seized the thought that I sought to present on Tuesday evening.<a name=300:2></a> It seems to me evident that a child is born into certain conditions which are essential to life, and that those conditions are permanent and abiding while, as to the child, changes may come in.<a name=300:3></a> And I think that it is thus with us spiritually.<a name=300:4></a> The beginning is that one is born again, and then the soul is enlightened through the gospel, then the Spirit is given, and the person lives morally in the Spirit.<a name=300:5></a> Thus there is life in the sense that the believer is morally alive to God.<a name=300:6></a> This is the state of the believer, but then, as in natural things, the living is dependent on certain conditions which are permanent and abiding and unchangeable, and into these the believer is born and can enter into them morally because he is alive.<a name=300:7></a> These conditions are I think found in the epistle of John, they consist in the rule of Christ (as in natural things the earth is subject to the rule of the sun) for Christ is the Sun of righteousness, then in the moral atmosphere which exists among the brethren, and which has its character and impulse in the love of Christ, then in the full light of the love of God in its application to us down here.<a name=300:8></a> All these abide and are not subject to change though we may change and pass away from this scene.<a name=300:9></a> It is of all moment that we have life, that is in the sense of being alive in the Spirit, the Lord said, "I am come that they might have life and have it more abundantly".<a name=300:10></a> But this is not the thought which the expression 'eternal life' conveys to my mind.<a name=300:11></a> I think that all the difficulty goes when one distinguishes between the fact of a person having life in the sense of being alive, and the conditions which are essential to

		My Dear Broomhead, -- Many thanks for your letter to hand this morning.<a name=303:7></a> I am very glad to hear a better account of the Skeffingtons, and that there is a reasonable expectation of the baby getting on.<a name=303:8></a> I suppose from the fact of your having been away that you are yourself better, and for this I am thankful.<a name=303:9></a> I am now sending a line to say that I have written to Morford, and have had a reply to the effect that he will take the preachings for four Sundays beginning with September 21st.<a name=303:10></a> Our month here will be up on September 9th, and they will not be content that I should leave before that.<a name=303:11></a> I shall therefore be available for Sunday the 14th -- thus there will be the next two Sundays to provide for.<a name=303:12></a> I understand that you will be there for the next, and I will count on you to provide for the other.<a name=303:13></a> I will not make any arrangement for after Morford, as I would rather leave the matter in your hands.<a name=303:14></a> I do not quite understand whether you go away in the next week, or the week after.<a name=303:15></a> If the latter I shall possibly see you.<a name=303:16></a> We shall be home on the Tuesday.<a name=303:17></a> Kindly send me a card before then to let me know when you leave, as I would make an effort to see you.<a name=303:18></a> In regard to the proposed meeting of evangelists, I have had a letter from T.<a name=303:19></a>H.<a name=303:20></a>R.<a name=303:21></a> in which he tells me that Pollock wrote him, asking him if he would be present, and he replied that he would not if

		My Dear Brother, -- The question of illustrations is one that sometimes presents difficulty, for it involves a clear knowledge of that you wish to illustrate.<a name=304:15></a> A man that can use simple and telling illustrations is a master of his subject.<a name=304:16></a> One has to allow a certain latitude in the use of such things, and to judge of them by whether they make plain the main idea, without looking for perfection in every detail.<a name=304:17></a> In the use of them one

		My Dear Brother, -- I am still inclined to think that what expresses the result of the Spirit's work in the believer is the thought of his being formed in Christ.<a name=306:9></a> He has to grow up to the Head in all things.<a name=306:10></a> This involves a positive formation in him, but of a moral kind, so that it is <i>he</i> that is formed.<a name=306:11></a> I understand the expression "Christ in you" in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>to be dependent on the Spirit of Christ being in us, so that I would say of any one that has the Spirit of Christ that Christ is in him.<a name=306:12></a> And of course there is a work antecedent to this, there is the work of the Spirit in new birth, and faith.<a name=306:13></a> There is that, looked at abstractly, which is wholly new and of God.<a name=306:14></a> It is consequent on this that the Spirit dwells, and renews.<a name=306:15></a> But all this renewal I judge to be moral, that is an effect produced on the believer himself.<a name=306:16></a> He is transformed.<a name=306:17></a> It is a result of the light being presented to him.<a name=306:18></a> I see the sovereign work of God at the beginning in new birth,

		and at the end in the raising up or quickening of the body, all between is wrought morally, that is through the effect of the truth.<a name=307:1></a> I think that any believer who has the Spirit might identify himself with what is of God in him, and say that he is not in the flesh but in the Spirit and could speak of Christ living in him; and yet he has to be built up in Christ.<a name=307:2></a> And this is the effect of the truth being digested into his moral being.<a name=307:3></a> He comes to know that the contrary element is himself, and that is the flesh, but then he is not in it, and so judges it as not himself.<a name=307:4></a> That is, not his true self with God.<a name=307:5></a> I think that what God regards is the individual, it is he that is born again or new created, and in this sense there is danger in being too abstract, though many things can only be apprehended abstractly while things are as they are now.<a name=307:6></a>

		In regard to what you say as to opposition to the gospel I can only say that it has never come before me, nor do I think that it would be countenanced by any right-thinking people.<a name=307:7></a> It appears to me that the gospel is the great interest of all, and that this should be insisted on, and that if prayer is desired in a special way, it should be on the part of the spiritual, and not on the part of the evangelists.<a name=307:8></a> Service is essentially individual as the result of gift.<a name=307:9></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>is clear as to this, and each servant should carry out his service in responsibility to the Lord, and any banding together of any particular class of servants is highly undesirable, and tending to form a party through some special interest, and there is no such thing properly.<a name=307:10></a> May the good Lord keep us.<a name=307:11></a> With love in the Lord, believe me,

		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to give you such answers to your questions as I am able.<a name=308:2></a> There is much difficulty in speaking about quickening <i>as a process</i>, for Scripture never speaks of it in that light.<a name=308:3></a> On the one hand divine persons are said to quicken, and certain people are said to have been quickened.<a name=308:4></a> Thus it is only spoken of in connection with the One who does it, and the result in the one who is the subject of it.<a name=308:5></a> So no one can say much as to the operation in itself, nor is it necessary.<a name=308:6></a> We have to judge of persons on other ground, that is as to faith and the possession of the Spirit.<a name=308:7></a> Scripture does not seek to bring new birth and quickening together, and the reason may be that new birth never goes beyond earth, and quickening is necessary for heaven.<a name=308:8></a> For that we must live in a new state altogether, and so we are said to be quickened with Christ.<a name=308:9></a> Hence, so far as I can see, quickening is a work of God in a man by the Spirit by which he can live in the same sphere of affection as Christ.<a name=308:10></a> And the thought must go on to the body, so that the state may be complete.<a name=308:11></a> Now we are quickened together with Christ.<a name=308:12></a> I do not think that you will gain much by mixing this up with new birth, which stands in connection with a man coming under the moral sway of God.<a name=308:13></a> Each is looked at as complete in itself and not as part of anything else.<a name=308:14></a> This is evident in the Ephesians.<a name=308:15></a> I think that if all these expressions are looked at in their moral bearing the difficulty disappears.<a name=308:16></a> The difficulty arises from the attempt to construe them in a natural way.<a name=308:17></a> Then as to the question of eternal life, Scripture does not appear to connect it either with new birth or with quickening.<a name=308:18></a> It appears to be connected with Christ and faith, and the Spirit.<a name=308:19></a> The question of a person

		being a christian is determined by the possession of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the One of whom the believer is to reap eternal life.<a name=309:1></a> But if the believer has not reaped it, you could not unchristianise him.<a name=309:2></a> I do not know that quickening is an expression that applies exclusively to christians, for in a national way it will apply to Israel.<a name=309:3></a> They will be quickened out of the dust.<a name=309:4></a> But the connection in the New Testament is peculiar, and relates to our being in a state in which we can live together with Christ.<a name=309:5></a> I hope that you may be helped with those with whom you are in controversy.<a name=309:6></a> With conceit there is little hope.<a name=309:7></a> I return your letter as you wish.<a name=309:8></a> With love in the Lord, believe me,
