		NOTES OF READINGS ON THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> I am rather inclined to think "The Word" was a recognised appellative as applied to Christ.<a name=1:3></a> When the apostle speaks thus of that Person, it was in a way known and recognised by Christians.<a name=1:4></a> This gospel was written late.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suppose the reference to "eye-witnesses" in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a> would refer more to miracles, and that sort of thing.<a name=1:6></a> It is "eye-witnesses <i>of</i>".<a name=1:7></a> The Word was His personal name.<a name=1:8></a> I think it helps in the understanding of this gospel to see that John, speaking of "The Word", speaks of a thought that was current among Christians -- known among them.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you talk about the testimony of God -- Christ Himself is the testimony; not simply certain facts, but Christ Himself is the testimony from John's point of view.<a name=1:10></a> Death and resurrection are certain facts, and they form a testimony in a certain way, but in John, Christ Himself is the testimony.<a name=1:11></a> These things are all parts of the testimony.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:13></a> Would you regard the title as an adaptation of a thought that was in man's mind?<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:15></a>R.<a name=1:16></a> Well, that is, after all, a matter of small moment to us.<a name=1:17></a> If it comes to that, all words are taken up in man's literature, and no doubt the thought may have been familiar to men.<a name=1:18></a> The thing is, Christ Himself is the testimony -- <i>He is "The Word</i>".<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:20></a> Is it right to say, "The eternal Word"?<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:22></a>R.<a name=1:23></a> Scripture does not so speak.<a name=1:24></a> The expression is used here in connection with His presentation in manhood.<a name=1:25></a> It is He who is "The Word" who was "in the beginning".<a name=1:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:1></a> What is the meaning of "in the beginning" here?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:3></a>R.<a name=2:4></a> It carries you back to the farthest point of time.<a name=2:5></a> No human mind can take in a period previous to "the beginning" in John.<a name=2:6></a> "All things received being" by that Person, and "without him not one thing received being which has received being".<a name=2:7></a> The full thought in the title "The Word" belongs to Him as become flesh.<a name=2:8></a> "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us", and afterwards we have, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father".<a name=2:9></a> He came out as the testimony of God -- all the thought and heart of God find their expression in Him.<a name=2:10></a> Resurrection may witness God's <i>power</i>, but it would not, in that way, be the expression of His <i>love</i>.<a name=2:11></a> His giving His only-begotten Son is the witness of His love.<a name=2:12></a> No one who was not all He is said to be in these verses could be the expression of God.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:14></a> What is the difference between "the beginning" here and in the epistle?<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:16></a>R.<a name=2:17></a> "From the beginning" in the epistle is "from the outset".<a name=2:18></a> You remember it says, "The devil sinneth from the beginning" -- that is, from the outset of sin.<a name=2:19></a> It is the beginning of the thing spoken of to which the writer refers.<a name=2:20></a> In the epistle John is speaking of Christianity, and so he speaks of what was from the outset of that.<a name=2:21></a> Christ was the beginning of Christianity from John's point of view -- all that preceded that was completely ignored.<a name=2:22></a> It is peculiar to John.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:24></a> I suppose that Christianity does not properly begin until resurrection and ascension?<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:26></a>R.<a name=2:27></a> It is one feature of John's gospel that he speaks of what Christ brings in -- he carries you back, even in the epistle, to what, in a certain sense, was from the very beginning of Christ.<a name=2:28></a> It connects itself
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with the peculiar line of John's testimony -- it presents Christ coming in after a completely new order.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:2></a> The "corn of wheat" which fell into the ground and died, that it might not abide alone.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:4></a>R.<a name=3:5></a> Yes; it is all after that kind.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:7></a> John speaks of Christ because failure had come in.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:9></a>R.<a name=3:10></a> Yes.<a name=3:11></a> The church may fail, but Christ can never fail.<a name=3:12></a> It is a great point that there is no failure about Christ, and all this was written when everything was broken down.<a name=3:13></a> It is supposed to be the last book written in the New Testament.<a name=3:14></a> John is altogether different from every other gospel.<a name=3:15></a> What I mean is this -- he brings to light what is in the Godhead.<a name=3:16></a> No other gospel does that.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:18></a> I suppose you would say there is abundant proof in the others of His being God's Son come down here?<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:20></a>R.<a name=3:21></a> Oh, yes.<a name=3:22></a> But there is no other gospel which takes quite the ground of His being the Son here to reveal the Father -- that is not the line which they pursue.<a name=3:23></a> Matthew, for instance, presents Him as men knew Him here on earth, but John gives you what lies behind -- the relationships of divine persons -- if I might say so, the inner life of the Godhead.<a name=3:24></a> You do not get that developed in any other gospel.<a name=3:25></a> Then, in the latter part of this gospel, you get the coming of the Holy Spirit; it is the truth as to the Godhead which is brought out in John, which is totally different, in that way, from any other gospel.<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:27></a> What do you understand by the "Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father"?<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:29></a>R.<a name=3:30></a> The Father is the source of all -- the source of divine counsels, but then the Son comes to carry those counsels into effect.<a name=3:31></a> The Son and the Spirit both come forth from the Father in that way.<a name=3:32></a> The Holy Spirit came on that line, in connection with the counsels of the Father.<a name=3:33></a> Then, too, you find that the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Son is the centre of those counsels; the Spirit is the bond, if I may so speak, between the Father and the Son.<a name=4:1></a> The Father and the Son are one in the unity of the Spirit.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:3></a> The Spirit is a distinct Person in the Godhead?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=4:5></a>R.<a name=4:6></a> Yes, of course.<a name=4:7></a> It is in the same way that the Spirit is the bond that binds all Christians together.<a name=4:8></a> The Father and the Son are One, but they must be One in the unity of the Spirit -- you cannot leave the Spirit out -- it is the Spirit of the Father, but then He is spoken of too as the Spirit of Christ.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:10></a> Do you take "The Word" to be that which expresses God?<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=4:12></a>R.<a name=4:13></a> Yes.<a name=4:14></a> It is that in which God is expressed -- you get all the heart of God coming out.<a name=4:15></a> A prophet could not make known to you the heart of God; he might make known a great deal about God, but there could be no testimony like the testimony of a divine Person.<a name=4:16></a> The Lord said, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen".<a name=4:17></a> A prophet very often did not know at all what he was speaking about.<a name=4:18></a> Christ was altogether what He said He was.<a name=4:19></a> In Him there was One down here in this world who could tell you what was in the heart of God.<a name=4:20></a> It is most wonderful.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you want to get all about the divine nature, and love, you have to go to John for it.<a name=4:22></a> He presents to you the One in whom it was all manifested.<a name=4:23></a> No one but Himself was equal to the manifestation of it.<a name=4:24></a> I do not see how you could have love presented except in a <i>Person</i>.<a name=4:25></a> You could not get at the reality of it except in a <i>Person</i>.<a name=4:26></a> Think of a Man being here -- there was a Man here -- the exact expression of God, and who knew all that was in the heart of God.<a name=4:27></a> What a moment for earth!<a name=4:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you get, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (verse 4).<a name=4:29></a> All things came into

	<div class="paragraph">
		existence by Him, and in Him was <i>life</i>.<a name=5:1></a> I think "life", as here, involves the power to quicken, it is a divine Person who could make others alive.<a name=5:2></a> You could not speak of life being in a <i>creature</i>, because he is simply made alive by an act of power.<a name=5:3></a> You are quickened, but it can only be said of a divine Person that life was "<i>in him</i>".<a name=5:4></a> "The life was the light of men".<a name=5:5></a> "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life".<a name=5:6></a> When man saw this "life", he really saw what the life of God was, that is, love; love is properly the life of God.<a name=5:7></a> I have no doubt that Christ was as strange to man as man was strange to Him.<a name=5:8></a> If you could conceive such a thing, I really think that the Lord must have been surprised at the motives which actuated man -- the way he sets to work to gratify himself, and to make himself happy here.<a name=5:9></a> It must all have been so strange in His sight to see man pursuing happiness, as he thought, and yet to know that it was not that, but just the opposite.<a name=5:10></a> We too ought to learn to look at things morally, and not as they appear.<a name=5:11></a> It must have been a strange path for the Lord through this world; things must have looked strange to Him here, and I have no doubt He appeared equally strange to them.<a name=5:12></a> The Christian ought to be as strange to the world as Christ was.<a name=5:13></a> You get the principle in the verse, "The spiritual man discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned of no man".<a name=5:14></a>

		Rem.<a name=5:15></a> Selfishness cannot understand love, and love cannot understand selfishness.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=5:17></a>R.<a name=5:18></a> Still, the life was the light of men; it came into the world as the light of men, although, I quite own, it needed a work of God for them to receive the light, but the life was the light.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:20></a> How does this verse fit in with what we have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:26">John  5:26</a>, "As the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself"?<a name=5:21></a>

		spoken of here, but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>it is developing what was between the Father and Himself as a Man down here -- that which He takes up as "given" to Him, all that was His as Man.<a name=6:1></a> When you look at that Person abstractly, He has life in Himself; but in the other case, viewed as in His ministry here on earth, He received it from the Father.<a name=6:2></a>

		Ques.<a name=6:3></a> The "last Adam, a life-giving Spirit"?<a name=6:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=6:5></a>R.<a name=6:6></a> Well, He became that -- He was made that.<a name=6:7></a> Until resurrection He could not give life to men.<a name=6:8></a> It was in resurrection that He is spoken of as the "last Adam".<a name=6:9></a> He cannot be a "life-giving Spirit" until resurrection, until the judgment of God had been met.<a name=6:10></a> As a matter of fact, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>He is speaking of Himself all through as the "last Adam", but the "last Adam" is the Son of God.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the idea in verse 4 is that there was no other light for man -- He was the only light for man.<a name=6:12></a> "The life was the light of men".<a name=6:13></a> There is no record of any quickening here.<a name=6:14></a> "The darkness comprehended it not"; it was impenetrable darkness, even as regards divine light.<a name=6:15></a> Man was not capable of taking in the light, it just proved his perfect incapability.<a name=6:16></a> It is like those wonderful rays we hear of now, that can penetrate solid bodies.<a name=6:17></a> They can penetrate to the bone, but they cannot make alive.<a name=6:18></a> They can discover the bit of dead bone, if it is there, but they cannot make it alive.<a name=6:19></a> They leave the dead bone just what it was before.<a name=6:20></a>

		Rem.<a name=6:21></a> It brings the two things very markedly together -- life and light.<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=6:23></a>R.<a name=6:24></a> It is as plain to me as daylight, because, as far as man is concerned, he cannot live if God does not reveal Himself.<a name=6:25></a> The fact of man's living depends on God revealing Himself.<a name=6:26></a> Life must depend upon light.<a name=6:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not suppose Adam wanted much in the way of "light".<a name=6:28></a> He, as far as I can understand his experience,

		knew God in everything -- every created thing was to him an evidence of the goodness and beneficence of God, and before he fell, I suppose he was filled with gratitude and thankfulness.<a name=7:1></a> He could have known nothing about the righteousness of God, or the holiness, or love, of God, although everything witnessed to the goodness of God.<a name=7:2></a> It was in that that Adam lived.<a name=7:3></a> Now we, in God's ways, know a very great deal about God; we know His righteousness and His holiness and His love.<a name=7:4></a> All these things have come out to us now as "light", and in that light we live.<a name=7:5></a> "The Son of God has come .<a name=7:6></a>.<a name=7:7></a>.<a name=7:8></a> that we should know him that is true".<a name=7:9></a>

		F.E.<a name=7:12></a>R.<a name=7:13></a> Yes.<a name=7:14></a> You want light to enlighten you, but how are you going to live, or where?<a name=7:15></a> God begins a work in you, but that is not life in the true sense of it.<a name=7:16></a> There must be a work of God <i>in</i> you, but living is quite a different idea in Scripture.<a name=7:17></a> We commonly speak of a man having "life", but life really is living in certain relationships -- that is really begun when the heart has appreciated the light of God.<a name=7:18></a> There is, of course, a starting-point, and that is when God is known.<a name=7:19></a> When there is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we arrive at the starting-point of life.<a name=7:20></a> What makes me say that is this -- "The letter kills, but the Spirit quickens", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:6">2 Corinthians  3:6</a>.<a name=7:21></a> Then a little later in the chapter you have, "Now the Lord is the Spirit".<a name=7:22></a> When your soul apprehends the Lord in resurrection, you have got hold of the quickening Spirit.<a name=7:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=8:3></a>R.<a name=8:4></a> Not exactly.<a name=8:5></a> The first light that comes in is as to the blood; a person gets a sense of divine righteousness, and of being under judgment; but if you are going to live to God, <i>you must get outside the flesh</i>.<a name=8:6></a> You are landed outside the flesh when you apprehend the Lord Jesus Christ as outside the flesh.<a name=8:7></a> Your <i>faith</i> has taken you outside the range of flesh.<a name=8:8></a> The cleverest man cannot enter into the idea of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=8:9></a> It is impossible -- naturally man cannot go beyond the flesh.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a matter of fact, people do not know what faith is.<a name=8:11></a> They give you an illustration of it, a story something like this: "You have heard there is such a place as, say, Canton.<a name=8:12></a> You have received it upon trustworthy authority, and you believe it.<a name=8:13></a> Well, that is faith".<a name=8:14></a> And people want you to believe that that is faith.<a name=8:15></a> There is not a bit of faith in it!<a name=8:16></a> Why, I could go and verify that statement to-morrow if I had ways and means.<a name=8:17></a> Now, the thing is, <i>faith</i> is what you cannot verify, but you take it upon the testimony of God.<a name=8:18></a> Before God comes out in a public way, I accept His testimony, and that is the link between my soul and God.<a name=8:19></a> "The just shall live by faith".<a name=8:20></a> "Faith is .<a name=8:21></a>.<a name=8:22></a>.<a name=8:23></a> the evidence of things not seen".<a name=8:24></a> The heart is interested in that scene -- it is with the <i>heart</i> you believe.<a name=8:25></a> How do you know that God raised Christ from the dead?<a name=8:26></a> You say you are sure of it, you know it upon God's testimony -- it is God's testimony that enables you to know Him risen from the dead.<a name=8:27></a> I do not think that, even with the disciples, it was simply upon the testimony of their eyesight that they believed in the resurrection.<a name=8:28></a> I believe they accepted the testimony of God's word -- the testimony of the scripture.<a name=8:29></a> Man has to learn to accept God's testimony.<a name=8:30></a> How could you be happy through eternity if you could not trust God's word?<a name=8:31></a> That is a very much greater thing that just believing the historical facts.<a name=8:32></a>

		I feel sure that the resurrection is the true test of faith.<a name=9:1></a> The human mind can take in <i>death</i> in a certain way -- it is familiar with that -- but it cannot take in resurrection.<a name=9:2></a> God had before Him in the cross a true demonstration of man's state and place, and that is why the apostle pressed so much the testimony of the cross; but you cannot believe in the cross unless you believe in the resurrection.<a name=9:3></a> The resurrection is the great proof that the One who died on that cross was the Son of God.<a name=9:4></a>

		You see, if there is to be universal blessing, God must come in and establish a link between man's soul and Himself.<a name=9:5></a> To introduce blessings into this world, to heal ills, and all that sort of thing, would not be sufficient.<a name=9:6></a> He must have a link established between Himself and the heart of man.<a name=9:7></a> What is to accomplish this?<a name=9:8></a> Why, nothing but His word -- making Himself known, and getting a place in the heart of man.<a name=9:9></a>

		F.E.<a name=9:12></a>R.<a name=9:13></a> In one sense it would -- "The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance".<a name=9:14></a> The principle was the same with Israel: "The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart".<a name=9:15></a> The word is the link between them and God.<a name=9:16></a> It was the same with Abraham -- "he believed God".<a name=9:17></a> If God sends light into the world, man's heart is tested by it -- the gospel comes in, a great testing process, in order to bring to light the elect of God.<a name=9:18></a> It is like the woman in the parable that lighted the candle in order to find the lost piece of silver.<a name=9:19></a> It is the light of God testing every man.<a name=9:20></a> Some reject and some receive, but the great purpose of the gospel is to bring to light the elect of God.<a name=9:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Returning to the chapter, it is noticeable that you do not get any sort of detail here, either in regard to the Lord or to John the Baptist.<a name=9:22></a> John is simply introduced as "a man sent from God".<a name=9:23></a> We have nothing of the connection between him and what

		The great argument of the chapter is that "if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever".<a name=92:27></a> In the case of the manna, it did not give them life; they ate it and died -- it was not intended to give them life; but on the other hand, "This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die".<a name=92:28></a> The real point in the sign was this -- what were the people on the lookout for?<a name=92:29></a> If they were looking for the right thing, they would have received a sign, but they were looking out for the wrong thing and consequently missed the right thing.<a name=92:30></a> Christ Himself was the sign, and He was the sign because He came, after all, in a very lowly way -- a babe laid in the manger.<a name=92:31></a> The intervention of God was not apparent outwardly, but, nevertheless, it was

		A point that has struck me very much in thinking of the death and resurrection of Christ is that, speaking of man generally, he is not affected by sin -- I mean not painfully affected by sin, he likes it.<a name=344:5></a> As to the sin itself, he may, of course, have to suffer for the indulgence of it, but it is not the sin itself that painfully affects him, it is not that that makes him suffer.<a name=344:6></a> Now to God sin is obnoxious in itself; and sin must go, and in the death of Christ, not only sin but the man himself went in judgment.<a name=344:7></a> Now what you can often affect men by is death and judgment, but you do not see all that met in the <i>death</i> of Christ, but in the <i>resurrection</i>.<a name=344:8></a> God removed first that which was obnoxious to Himself, and, in the resurrection of Christ, He dealt with that by which man is affected, death and the fear of judgment; and then grace comes in to practically set aside in us what has been removed for God, both sin and the man.<a name=344:9></a> It is that which really brings deliverance.<a name=344:10></a>

		the sense that he had really judged himself, and yet be deeply conscious that he had lost communion.<a name=464:1></a> Here you see Peter jumping out of the boat in order to be the first to reach the Lord, but when he gets there he feels he is not free with Him.<a name=464:2></a> The Lord afterwards goes to the root of the matter.<a name=464:3></a> It is the root of the matter which He deals with, and not the actual breakdown which had occurred.<a name=464:4></a> There is often a kind of self-confidence in a person that puts him in the position of thinking that he has more affection and regard for the Lord than anybody else.<a name=464:5></a>

		Then as to Peter, the challenge, "Lovest thou me?<a name=464:13></a>" comes just corresponding to his denial.<a name=464:14></a> Peter had denied the Lord three times, and the Lord puts the challenge three times, and then Peter sees that he is entirely cast upon the Lord: he says, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee"; as much as to say, "Other people may not know it, but <i>Thou</i> knowest that I love Thee".<a name=464:15></a> Then it all closes up with the special commission given to Peter, and with the intimation that he was to die.<a name=464:16></a> With John, as regards the character of his testimony, he remains until the coming of the Lord, he brings Christ in again, as to his testimony.<a name=464:17></a> Peter's testimony all passes away, his special testimony and his work all pass away.<a name=464:18></a> He was to feed the sheep and the lambs of the Jews, and they would be merged in the church, and therefore, to all appearance, his work all passed away, and even his testimony was superseded.<a name=464:19></a> But John's testimony brings Christ in again in the Revelation.<a name=464:20></a>

		Then I think it was a great mark of confidence on the part of the Lord as "the great shepherd of the sheep", to entrust to Peter now the sheep and the lambs.<a name=465:21></a> While He probes Peter to the bottom, He yet gives to him this distinct mark of His own confidence.<a name=465:22></a> It is very wonderful to see all this on the part of the Lord in resurrection.<a name=465:23></a> It is Christ in resurrection that you have before you here.<a name=465:24></a>
