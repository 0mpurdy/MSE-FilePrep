		My thought is just to touch on another element, an additional point, which is of the greatest possible moment in connection with the subject of our relationship with God.<a name=1:1></a> When we come to the question of our relationship with God the Father, it is not faith that we want, what I understand by faith is light from God, and the amount of light a man has is in proportion to his faith.<a name=1:2></a> The great divine thought is that we are to be in the light as God is in the light: God has come out in all the fulness of light, and His thought in regard to us is that we should be in the light as He is, but my light practically is measured by my faith.<a name=1:3></a> It may be said, we have the whole of the Scriptures, true -- but how much do we know of them?<a name=1:4></a> I can say unhesitatingly, 'I am sensible how little I know of them,' indeed I was saying to a brother, 'I feel as though I was but on the very threshold of christianity.<a name=1:5></a>' One may well be aghast at one's ignorance.<a name=1:6></a> I would not demur for a moment to admit, as I have said, the truth that we are in the light as God is in the light; but along with that, it is perfectly consistent to ask, how much faith have I in my heart?<a name=1:7></a> Faith, remember, is light from God; and through the entire line of God's word, we have men presented in their various measures of faith, if you begin with Abel, it is seen to be so, "Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:4">Hebrews  11:4</a>); so with Noah; take any of the patriarchs, the light they had was the promises God had given them.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is our light now?<a name=1:9></a> It is the full revelation of God in Christ, but my own measure of light is according to what my faith has apprehended.<a name=1:10></a> It is perfectly true in that sense that faith must precede the work of the Spirit, that is you must have light from God.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I understand, there are three steps in God's work in every one of our souls.<a name=2:1></a> The first thing is, 'new birth'; the second is the light that comes into our souls by the gospel testimony, and that is where comes in the very deep importance of all gospel preaching; I need not say, the preacher cannot convert a soul, but his office is to enlighten the soul as to God, and the great purpose of God now; the third thing is he receives the Spirit, and then takes place all the formative work in the soul of the believer, which is carried out by the Spirit, and then comes out the great and blessed question: if I am brought out of darkness into His marvellous light (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:9">1 Peter  2:9</a>), the thought is that I should know God.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People's general idea of the gospel is that God's great object is to save their souls, forgive their sins, preserve them from judgment, or some kindred thing; but the object of the blessed God is infinitely above all that, His wonderful purpose in it being to make Himself so known to the heart of man that he may find his complete delight and joy in Him.<a name=2:3></a> To my mind no greater thing can be conceived than the fact that God should come into this dark and sinful scene, where all the wickedness of man rages, and that His gracious and persistent object and purpose should be, yea, that the very pleasure of God in gaining the heart of man is, so to make Himself known to him, that He might have his confidence and love, and that man might be completely at home in His presence.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved brethren, may we not ask how far we have travelled on this road?<a name=2:5></a> Depend upon it, christianity has never been seen by us in anything like its full worth if we have not been led to see this.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is well for us to be clear on this point -- that it is not faith that knows God thus, it is love!<a name=2:7></a> Quite true, apart from faith you could not know God at all, but when it becomes a question of relationship with your soul and God, then it is love that has to be brought

		in as we find in the epistle of John.<a name=3:1></a> "Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<a name=3:2></a> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:7">1 John  4:7</a>,8); so again in the first chapter of Ephesians: "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a> (not 'in faith').<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may say I know God practically, and my relations with Him are practically measured by my love.<a name=3:4></a> Without love a man is nothing for God, he may, according to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>, have faith to remove mountains, bestow all his goods to feed the poor, or give his body to be burned, but the absence of love leaves all worthless.<a name=3:5></a> I would say further, that void of this, we are nothing for the christian circle, because all our relations there are to be carried on in love.<a name=3:6></a> You find in Romans the first thing our hearts are made acquainted with by the Spirit is the love of God; it is His divine work in us.<a name=3:7></a> God has gained His end, inasmuch as I am made partaker of the divine nature when that is effected in me.<a name=3:8></a> If it is a question of being in relation with God, I know Him, and that according to His nature, there can be no true intercourse where there is not a kindred nature.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to our relations with God, they are all carried on in love.<a name=3:10></a> We were chosen in Him that we should be before Him, holy and without blame, in love <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a>.<a name=3:11></a> "And we know that all things work together for good to <i>them that love God</i>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>).<a name=3:12></a> That is preceded by what we have in chapter 5, that is God's love to us.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may notice that there are three chapters in Romans that specially present God, and three chapters the christian.<a name=3:14></a> That is, in chapter 3 it is God revealed in righteousness; in chapter 4 in power; and in chapter 5 in love.<a name=3:15></a> As to the christian, in chapter 6 he is dead to sin; in chapter 7 he is married to another that he should bring forth fruit to God; and in chapter 8 it is seen that all things work together for

	<div class="paragraph">
		good to them that love God.<a name=4:1></a> In chapter 5 it is God's love to you--here it is your love to Him and what goes along with that is unbounded confidence.<a name=4:2></a> We know that all things work together for good <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>, that it is in the very nature of things.<a name=4:3></a> it is not, as people sometimes put it, that God will make or mould things to bring about good to them that love Him, but it cannot be otherwise.<a name=4:4></a> God has secured His end in having gained the full confidence of your heart, that heart where there was once nothing but distrust of God, or fears of everything going wrong; now you are assured that nothing can go wrong, because you are sensible that all things work together for good to them that love Him.<a name=4:5></a> I am ashamed of anyone who denies the thought that God should have pleasure in gaining the affections of man's heart; He has, blessed be His name, so revealed Himself as to win the affections of the heart of man, and this effected, the heart confidently rests in the assurance, "That all things work together for good" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>.<a name=4:6></a> It is not a question of my faith now, the point is, I <i>love Him</i> and I cease to be agitated by things around, I am not going to make the best of both worlds.<a name=4:7></a> Alas!<a name=4:8></a> How many christians there are who, on the one hand, want all the good of christianity, and at the same time seek to secure all the conveniences of this world that they possibly can, but this is not to be done: you cannot on the one side be entering into all the blessed truths that God has made known, and on the other securing to yourself a smooth path here.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If God has set to work in His boundless love to gain the affections of your heart, be assured that He is jealous to have nothing short of the <i>entire</i> affections, and believe me, I do not speak of a thing that I am practically a stranger to.<a name=4:10></a> I have not trod the path without tasting some of the pressures that belong to it, and perhaps, could I have foreseen the path before me I should have been ready to say I could not have gone through it.<a name=4:11></a>

		There is one point further I will allude to, and that is: if you want to know the things that God has prepared for you, it is not faith that will teach you, you will get no true insight into them unless you love God.<a name=5:1></a> There are three points: first, you begin by loving God because He loves you.<a name=5:2></a> We love Him because He first loved us <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:19">1 John  4:19</a>, that involves your being partaker of His nature, and you are assured as to everything here, you know all things work together for good <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>.<a name=5:3></a> Then you get a step further, loving God, you get an insight into the things He has prepared for them that love Him, and let me add this, if you and I want to know what it is to reach the "heavenly places", it is not <i>faith</i> that will take us there.<a name=5:4></a> No, it is love that must bring that about and I will tell you why: because it is the pleasure of God to have you there that He might gratify Himself and make known the riches of His grace.<a name=5:5></a> He is set on securing His own pleasure and meeting the satisfaction of His own heart.<a name=5:6></a> Do not let us be afraid to be there, because God wants us there to gratify Himself, to suit His own heart, and if that is so, how rightly I say every bit of fear may be dispelled.<a name=5:7></a> In the presence of such thoughts may we not well say, 'Do not be afraid to enter there'.<a name=5:8></a> Bear in mind, I again say, that it is not faith that secures an entrance into the 'heavenly places' nor yet (in that sense) the power of the Spirit, but it is love, and every heart ought to realise that nothing will meet the heart of God, or reach His wonderful desire for us, but that we should be in those 'heavenly places'.<a name=5:9></a> I again remind you, that your faith is the measure of the light that you have from God; a man is in pitch darkness unless he has faith; you may have men of great learning and distinction in the religious world, or in the political world, but it matters not what natural abilities or acquirements a man may possess if he is destitute of faith -- he has no light from God.<a name=5:10></a> Neither rank nor position, nor education, nor aught else will bring light from God,

		a man who is a mere beggar on the dunghill may have his heart full of light because he is one who has faith.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel we could not have brought before us a more important truth than what we have been looking at, namely, that if it is a question of your present relation with God He has made Himself known to you and the first of your history is that you love God, and you never were, nor could have been, a partaker of the divine nature, until you knew His love.<a name=6:2></a> Knowing His love, we may well rest in it freed from agitation or disturbance by circumstances or whatever may be around us, reposing in His word we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>.<a name=6:3></a> And to those who love Him, He gives a present entrance into those things that He has prepared for them.<a name=6:4></a>

		There is a verse that I think will help to illustrate this, in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=7:1></a> "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=7:2></a> It is not that either of these passages brings out what I should call christian privilege, that is much more difficult to unfold than people think and is in contrast to responsibility.<a name=7:3></a> If you take chapter 8:4 of this epistle, "That the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>; it does not go beyond our responsibility, it is for man on earth.<a name=7:4></a> It is not christian privilege, that is sonship, it is God's mind about man on earth, the blessing of those who have the Spirit.<a name=7:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show the principle on which we carry out our life here and it does not go beyond what God looks for from man in his path through this world.<a name=7:6></a> He did look for it from the very time He had a vineyard, He very rightly looked for fruit from the vine.<a name=7:7></a> We find in Scripture both the vine and the fig tree, the former especially in relation to Israel, and the other more man in the flesh.<a name=7:8></a> The very fact of there being a vine shows that God looked for fruit, the wood is of no use if it does not bring forth fruit, it is good for nothing but to be burned; they were a nation to bring forth fruit to God and if they failed in that they were useless.<a name=7:9></a> The place for fruit-bearing is this earth.<a name=7:10></a> There was no true answer to meet God's eye until Christ came, and took a place as Man.<a name=7:11></a> He is as the tree planted by the rivers of water that brought forth His fruit in its season.<a name=7:12></a> He was indeed the true

		I see the grace of the Lord Jesus, personally He was free from death but He settled every question for us by entering into it and thus He opened up the way of life.<a name=9:10></a> You cannot have a greater conception of grace than that He on whom death bad no claim should enter into it, that He might draw us into this way of life.<a name=9:11></a> He is raised from the dead by the glory of the Father <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>, and in the life in which He is I accept death.<a name=9:12></a> The soul must appropriate the blessed grace seen in the Lord Jesus going down into death to open up for us the way of life.<a name=9:13></a> When I see that, I am prepared to reckon myself dead; and that is the account the christian takes of himself down here.<a name=9:14></a> Nothing inferior to Christ will suit God, there is a new life, all is <i>in Him</i>.<a name=9:15></a> If you trace out in Ephesians, "In Christ Jesus", you will see it indicates a new order of life and it alone will do for God; everything is on the basis of being <i>in Him</i>.<a name=9:16></a> If it is faith, it is faith <i>in</i> Christ Jesus, or life, or grace, or acceptance, or position, every principle

		If you raise the point, 'What is going to be my rule of life?<a name=10:5></a>' we know many christians look at 'the law' for their rule of life, and many of us here tonight think that we are justified by His death, but that 'the law' was still for the rule of life.<a name=10:6></a> The only rule of life for the christian is love.<a name=10:7></a> I have said sometimes that there is nothing that really affects the heart of man like love.<a name=10:8></a> People pray that the word of God may affect the heart; I think it is what the word of God reveals that will affect the heart.<a name=10:9></a> "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me" <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=10:10></a> I am married to another, joined to another, even to Him that is raised from the dead, that I should bring forth fruit unto God <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>.<a name=10:11></a> That is now entirely outside the order of things here, it being the will of God; mark the expression, "outside the flesh", Christ is now apart from that entirely and He will direct you to God's will, and all that is involved in that is not after the flesh, as my business, domestic or family concerns.<a name=10:12></a> If you want to know what is the will of God read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, and there you will learn that you are to present your body a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, and the first thing that comes out in answering to this exhortation is that "we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:5">Romans  12:5</a> and you are to exercise the gifts given you with that in view.<a name=10:13></a> You do not get anything that is after the flesh, you are

	<div class="paragraph">
		Does not the fact that the apostle addresses the churches of Galatia in the way he does, e.<a name=47:8></a>g.<a name=47:9></a>, omitting the usual salutation and greetings, indicate that the departure was greater there than at Corinth, and that if they continued on that principle they could no longer be recognised as assemblies of God at all?<a name=47:10></a> They were giving up christianity.<a name=47:11></a>

		The apostle addresses them abruptly; he is stirred to the depths.<a name=47:12></a> In Corinth they had forgotten that they were God's assembly, they were acting as though the meeting was their own.<a name=47:13></a> It was the assembly where God should have been known in holiness.<a name=47:14></a>

		It is in view of Christ Jesus, who is made of God unto us wisdom and righteousness, sanctification and redemption, that no one should glory in men but in the Lord.<a name=48:5></a> The contrast is with the first man.<a name=48:6></a> The first chapter is that God has completely cleared the ground for Himself in Christ crucified.<a name=48:7></a> By Him God has cleared the ground in view of the coming of the Spirit and the communication of the deep things of God.<a name=48:8></a> That is seen in the first two chapters.<a name=48:9></a> The ground completely cleared in the cross of Christ so that the Spirit might bring to light the whole range of the wisdom of God, but then there comes in this difficulty, that the spiritual man only can enter into it, and the Corinthians were carnal.<a name=48:10></a>

		Yes, but not developed; he gives them, as it were, a taste.<a name=48:12></a> It is not until the second epistle that the apostle is able to enter fully on the deep things.<a name=48:13></a> The first epistle insists on the death of Christ, the second on the glory of Christ.<a name=48:14></a> When you come to the last Adam and the second Man, as in chapter 15, you are coming very near to the wisdom of God.<a name=48:15></a>

		And I suppose when he speaks about the Spirit, too?<a name=48:16></a> Everything was in the Spirit.<a name=48:17></a> I think the wonderful thing is, that God should have been able to clear the ground so that the Spirit should be given to unfold the deep things of God; clearly there is no room for the wisdom of man.<a name=48:18></a> The wisdom of man never affected the practice of a man.<a name=48:19></a> Take Bacon, he was a man of most extraordinary mind, but he was a man exceedingly corrupt.<a name=48:20></a> The same thing was true with

	<div class="paragraph">
		You were speaking yesterday of many not apprehending the Lord's supper in relation to the assembly; what is the relation of the Supper to the assembly?<a name=80:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I think the relation of the Supper to the assembly, is really the relation of the Lord to the assembly.<a name=80:6></a> I thought the prayer this morning expressed what we are called to -- the sanctuary -- and to come to the sanctuary we must come the right way.<a name=80:7></a> Chapter 10 is a crucial point; it is where the great bulk of saints fall in the wilderness, that is, they never come to the sanctuary.<a name=80:8></a> Chapter 10 is brought in for deliverance, and you do not come to the sanctuary except in deliverance.<a name=80:9></a> A fleshly man may claim liberty, but is all the time in the most abject bondage himself.<a name=80:10></a>

		I think from anything and everything in which there is the recognition of the principles of this world; that is the idea of chapter 10.<a name=80:12></a> Of course evil had the form of idolatry then; it is not exactly that now, but the great idea is deliverance from the world, from all that in which the power of Satan is recognised.<a name=80:13></a>

		Yes, that is what chapter 10 brings in; the real way of freedom is fellowship in the Lord's death, it is very much akin to <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of man, only that in 1 Corinthians to the idea is founded on a recognised act of fellowship.<a name=81:1></a> A great many take the Supper, but they take it individually, not in connection with the assembly.<a name=81:2></a> The great point to which we come in chapter it is the convening of the assembly.<a name=81:3></a> It was very well expressed in prayer as coming to the sanctuary.<a name=81:4></a> The Lord's supper lies at the threshold.<a name=81:5></a>

		I think there has been a little misunderstanding as to the breaking of bread -- the meeting has been limited to that.<a name=82:2></a> There has been the getting the breaking of bread over early and then two or three speaking, so that the character of the meeting has been lowered instead of its going on into worship.<a name=82:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find that the Lord's supper properly apprehended and carried out, has the effect of putting saints in touch with Christ and with one another.<a name=82:4></a> In assembling together, each coming from his engagement and home, saints are not for the moment free in spirit to enter into what is proper to the assembly, but they sit down for a while and partake of the Lord's supper, and so get in touch with Christ and with one another; they are thus brought into the spirit and tone of the assembly, and are as different as possible in mind and spirit from what they were at first.<a name=82:5></a>

		It is a great thing to see the right way; but I think I have entire sympathy with a brother well known, in the way in which he presses deliverance.<a name=82:9></a> If you come to know much of people you see that is the crucial point.<a name=82:10></a> If they do not accept the death of Christ as the way of deliverance, they do not enter into the sanctuary; that is the secret of there being so little worship; people are not free.<a name=82:11></a>

		There are three points in the chapter.<a name=152:1></a> It is the song of Moses, and the children of Israel, when they had been delivered from the power of Pharaoh, the enemy of God.<a name=152:2></a> God is celebrated as a Man of war fighting on behalf of the people.<a name=152:3></a> The first point is the enemy swallowed up in the Red Sea, and his power completely annulled; that is the first part of the song.<a name=152:4></a> The next great truth is, that God had brought Israel out of the land of bondage and to His habitation; then the third point is, that He would bring them into His own land: "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of <i>thine</i> inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which <i>thou</i> hast made for <i>thee</i> to dwell in", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:17">Exodus  15:17</a>.<a name=152:5></a> That is what God would do.<a name=152:6></a>

		Now, in the detail before us, the first two points were present: the enemy had been destroyed, and Israel had been brought to God's habitation; the third point was future, it was that God would bring them into His land.<a name=152:7></a> But when I come to the application of the type, I see that I can venture to set forth all three things to you as present.<a name=152:8></a> There is a future application of the last for us, no doubt, but I only dwell on the present aspect now.<a name=152:9></a> God brings us to His dwelling-place.<a name=152:10></a> There is a difference between being redeemed and being brought to God's habitation.<a name=152:11></a> It is a greater thing to be brought to God's own habitation.<a name=152:12></a> That is the extent of the song.<a name=152:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first point I want to present is God in the character of a Saviour God: not now in the character of Judge, but as Saviour.<a name=152:14></a> We have the judgment of God in Egypt; the character in which God was known there was as Judge.<a name=152:15></a> He was passing through the land in judgment.<a name=152:16></a> The blood on the lintel meant typically that the judgment had been anticipated, and it sheltered the children of Israel from judgment; the blood was the witness of it, and consequently the destroying angel had nothing to judge.<a name=152:17></a> Now it is evident that the character in which God was known was that of

		Judge, but in this chapter there is not a word about that.<a name=153:1></a> In the celebration here, the song presents God in the character of Saviour; He is a man of war: the enemy of the people was the enemy of God, and I will tell you why, because he set himself to prevent God accomplishing His purpose.<a name=153:2></a> Satan is busy today, seeking if possible to hinder God in the accomplishment of His purpose, therefore, though you may believe he is the enemy of God's people, yet, after all, Satan is the enemy of God, which is a more terrible matter.<a name=153:3></a> God has come out in the character of a man of war to destroy the power of the enemy.<a name=153:4></a> Here we see the power of Pharaoh destroyed; he and all his host were swallowed up in the Red Sea, and the children of Israel celebrated the victory in this song of triumph.<a name=153:5></a>

		Now you will forgive me if I use an illustration.<a name=153:6></a> A great many will be sensible of the feebleness of the illustration, but I use it because I think it will help some, and make the subject plain to your minds.<a name=153:7></a> I will suppose that this country was threatened with invasion, and all the horrors attendant thereon, by a neighbouring country, where there was a great military force.<a name=153:8></a> Such an idea is intelligible enough.<a name=153:9></a> But suppose the queen of this country sent a general into the country from which invasion was threatened, with a force sufficient to crush the entire military power of that country, so that it could never again be constituted or lift up its head.<a name=153:10></a> We will suppose this done, and the commander-in-chief to have brought back his force to his own country.<a name=153:11></a> Now that is what I see in regard of what God has done; God has taken in hand to defend His people.<a name=153:12></a> They were threatened with a fearful hostile force that could terrify them and bring them into bondage.<a name=153:13></a> Just think of this country being blockaded; no food, no liberty, all threatened with death; and you have a faint picture of the terror I am speaking of.<a name=153:14></a> Satan had the power of death, he

		What I say is this, that so long as Christ had not come, there might have been a testimony inferior, but once Christ has been into this world, you can have no testimony inferior to Him.<a name=164:2></a> Testimony for God now is the perpetuation of the testimony that was given in Christ; the testimony of the moment is 'the word of life'.<a name=164:3></a> We hold forth the word of life because of His having introduced it here, and in virtue of our connection with Him by the Spirit.<a name=164:4></a>

		In order to make the point clear to you, I will endeavour to bring before you the elements that go to make up spiritual life.<a name=164:5></a> Life consists not merely of one element, there are two or three elements that go to make up life; they meet in one person, but in themselves it is possible to distinguish, and Scripture does distinguish them.<a name=164:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going to make use of an illustration, though you have to bear in mind that every illustration taken from material things must be feeble; although it may serve to illustrate, it is impossible that it could express, spiritual truth; it may serve as a figure or illustration, but only as such.<a name=164:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if I take a lamp to illustrate my subject, everybody knows what a lamp is, and in every part of the world is familiar with a lamp.<a name=164:8></a> A lamp in this country is what a lamp is in every other country.<a name=164:9></a> It may be plain or artistic, may give out a poor or a better light, but a lamp is a lamp in every part of the world.<a name=164:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three distinct elements which go to make up a lamp; you cannot have a lamp without these three parts: they are the wick, the light and the oil; that is perfectly familiar to everyone here.<a name=164:11></a> If you have any two of these elements they will not constitute a lamp; if you apply light to the wick without oil, it would not serve you as a lamp, or if you apply light to

	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope you will only allow this to remain in your minds as an illustration, you cannot work it literally; it is not an expression of the truth, but I think it may help to convey what I want to convey to you.<a name=165:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I speak of the wick, I look at the wick as the individual, that is, myself.<a name=165:4></a> When I speak of the light, that is what is applied to me, and the oil is that by which the light is sustained.<a name=165:5></a> That is the way in which I apply all three.<a name=165:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course my illustration fails me in a moment, for in its application I must apply the light to the wick before the oil comes in, if you can conceive such a thing.<a name=165:7></a> This is the reverse of what you do with a material lamp.<a name=165:8></a> In the spiritual application the first thing is the trimming of the wick.<a name=165:9></a> Then the application of the light, and finally the filling up with oil.<a name=165:10></a> I want to make it plain to you that when you have all these elements you have a lamp.<a name=165:11></a> You are no longer darkness, but you are a lamp; it is not that you have a lamp, but you are a lamp, shining "as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a>,16.<a name=165:12></a> You are the expression of light, and have in fact the testimony of life.<a name=165:13></a>

		It is a fatal mistake to limit testimony to what is said.<a name=165:14></a> Some think that preaching is everything, that is their testimony, but I judge that it is the church which is the vessel of testimony, not preachers, and the preachers can have very little power when the vessel of testimony is obscured, and that is the reason why there is so little power now with the gospel; it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I come back to take up the detail of my illustration.<a name=166:9></a> The first thing is the wick.<a name=166:10></a> In trimming a lamp it used to be the habit to cut off all the part that was black; in the present day it is more usual to wipe the wick, but in times gone by one used to be careful to remove all that was black.<a name=166:11></a>

		The first great fact in God's work in the soul is new birth.<a name=166:12></a> I cannot tell you what new birth is.<a name=166:13></a> It is not that I am singular in my ignorance; you can no more tell me than I can tell you, but I can tell you of two effects of new birth.<a name=166:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wick represents, as I have said, the individual; new birth refers to the individual.<a name=166:15></a> It is you or I personally that have to be the subject of the operation of the Spirit.<a name=166:16></a> A man must be born again.<a name=166:17></a> I do not think new birth is exactly the communication of anything, but an effect produced, not through human agency, but simply and purely by the power of God.<a name=166:18></a> One is born of the Spirit.<a name=166:19></a> It is as though a thread of another description were introduced into the texture of the wick.<a name=166:20></a>

		believe the first effect is an utter collapse of the man.<a name=167:1></a> What I mean is, that in everything which constitutes a man suitable for this world new birth produces an utter collapse.<a name=167:2></a> Have you ever seen a balloon?<a name=167:3></a> Now, if a rent were made in the silk, there would be almost immediately, an utter collapse of the balloon.<a name=167:4></a> Suppose I take a man of the world, he is much like a balloon; the bigger a man is in this world the more he is like a balloon inflated with gas.<a name=167:5></a> Man is inflated.<a name=167:6></a> If you ask by what?<a name=167:7></a> well, to begin with, he is very self-important; a man will not make his mark in the world if he be not self-important.<a name=167:8></a> I have seen people clever and capable, but who never made a mark in the world, because they were lacking in certain necessary qualities; there are certain qualities needful to fit a man for the world -- self-confidence is one, and self-sufficiency or self-reliance; and there are other qualities necessary to make a man successful in the world.<a name=167:9></a> You would not have a good doctor or lawyer without these qualities in greater or less degree; he would not, as a rule, be thought much of, if he were lacking in these; and the same applies to other lines of life.<a name=167:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But when the work of God begins in a man, there is a collapse of the whole thing.<a name=167:11></a> He perhaps hardly knows it himself.<a name=167:12></a> It is like the case of Nicodemus, there is a complete collapse.<a name=167:13></a> After the collapse has taken place, a man will often try to keep up appearances, but the man has collapsed, his self-confidence, and all that which made him suited for this world is undermined; that is produced by new birth,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be that a man has been so far affected in conscience by the preaching of the word as to have certain exercises.<a name=167:14></a> Felix was made to tremble, but there was no collapse of the man, nothing of the effect produced by new birth.<a name=167:15></a>

		If you set to work to cut away the foundation of a house, the walls will soon fall down.<a name=167:16></a> That is what God does, He strikes a blow at the foundation, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another effect of new birth; there is a cry, a very feeble cry, the cry of a babe.<a name=168:2></a> I dare say you know that the first sign of life in a babe is a cry, either of want or of pain.<a name=168:3></a> So it is when a man is born again; the man has collapsed though perhaps he will try to keep up appearances for a time, but there is a cry, and that cry is the measure of the man; that man is no bigger than his cry.<a name=168:4></a> He may have been a big man before, in his own estimation, like Nicodemus, and also in that of others, but when God begins to work, and the cry of want or pain is produced, then the man is as big as his cry, the cry is the cry of a babe, and he begins like a babe.<a name=168:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what God has produced; man cannot compass it for himself, but God can.<a name=168:6></a> It is a wonderful thing for God thus to work in a man, and to effect this entire collapse whatever the greatness of the man may have been.<a name=168:7></a> In the case of a man like Nebuchadnezzar in all his greatness, who but God could have brought down the whole superstructure of pride and self-sufficiency?<a name=168:8></a> Who could produce from a proud man a cry of want or pain?<a name=168:9></a> I think everyone would admit that none but God could do it, and it is the effect produced on the individual simply and exclusively by God.<a name=168:10></a> There is as yet no link formed with God, but there is a cry and that cry refers to the One who produced it.<a name=168:11></a> It is spirit.<a name=168:12></a> The Spirit of God produced that cry and it refers to God.<a name=168:13></a> What is born of the Spirit is spirit; evidently what is produced in that way by the sovereign power of the Spirit of God refers to God.<a name=168:14></a> The importance of it is this, that no one can answer that cry except God Himself just as in the case of a new-born babe, who but the mother can meet the cry of want or pain?<a name=168:15></a> The cry refers to the mother, and when I come to the cry of a new-born soul, it refers to God and none can answer that cry except God Himself.<a name=168:16></a>

		Then the next thing is the light, the wick has to be made to burn.<a name=169:1></a> Of course I quite admit the feebleness of the illustration.<a name=169:2></a> When we have the wick ready the next thing is to apply the light; when by the power of God's Spirit a man has been born again, the next thing is that the soul has to be enlightened; if I may use the expression, that man has to be made to burn, the light has to be applied to him.<a name=169:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When I come to the subject of the light, I come properly to the work of the evangelist.<a name=169:4></a> I can see in Scripture that the work of the evangelist is to enlighten the new-born soul.<a name=169:5></a> The soul of the man that is born of the Spirit has to be enlightened; the light of God has to be brought to that man's soul; that man has to be made to burn.<a name=169:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will tell you what the light is.<a name=169:7></a> I refer to a few verses in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:12">John  3:12</a>-16.<a name=169:8></a> You see the character of the light, that it is a light that has come down from heaven.<a name=169:9></a> It is an important point for us to see.<a name=169:10></a> I am assured that the evangelist's distinct work is to enlighten.<a name=169:11></a> He may reason and persuade, but he has to enlighten.<a name=169:12></a> The light is from heaven, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>.<a name=169:13></a> Why is it light from heaven?<a name=169:14></a> Because it was to make known the heart of God, and therefore no man could conceive it; it must come down from heaven.<a name=169:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the light has come down; the Son of man has come down from heaven to bring tidings of the heart of God, and not only so, but to clear away every obstacle that stood in the way of the love of God.<a name=169:16></a> What was in the heart of God was a great ocean, but there were certain obstacles that had to be cleared away that that ocean of love might flow out.<a name=169:17></a> The first thing to be cleared away was sin; it stood in the way of the purposes of God; and there is another thing about sin, it compromised the character of God.<a name=169:18></a> The next thing was that the power of the enemy had to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ glorified God on the earth.<a name=170:10></a> You will remember there are two parts in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:4">John  17:4</a>: "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do".<a name=170:11></a> In order that He might finish the work which God gave Him to do, He glorifies Him on the earth.<a name=170:12></a> It is a wonderful thing that God has been glorified in this world; He had been dishonoured here, but the whole question of good and evil has been solved down here by Christ.<a name=170:13></a> But that was only part: Christ glorified God, but He also finished the work that the Father gave Him to do, He removed everything that stood in the way of the accomplishment of God's purposes; He was made sin to remove it.<a name=170:14></a> Whatever Christ touched of evil, it was simply that it might pass away: if He touched a

		If you ask what is my greatest glory -- and a man's glory is what his heart cherishes -- I can honestly say that the glory of my heart is, that I know God in the wonderful way in which He has been pleased to reveal Himself.<a name=173:9></a> There is not a single attribute of God which is now a terror to me, whether it be His righteousness, or holiness, or power.<a name=173:10></a> It is a most wonderful thing when all fear of God is completely expelled, that is love made perfect with us: "that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>.<a name=173:11></a> And if you can say that truly, then you can say, Thank God I know that light has been applied to me.<a name=173:12></a> I know the love of God, my heart is burning, I am lit up with that wonderful light that has been revealed in the Son.<a name=173:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You keep the light up in this way, if you fail to supply the wick with oil the light will not last, it is like an impression produced upon a person but which passes away.<a name=174:6></a> Many are impressed by the truth, but there is nothing lasting; if you are to have what is lasting you must have the wick and the oil; the latter supports the light.<a name=174:7></a> I believe the oil is a type, and a just one, of the Spirit of God.<a name=174:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that it is the Spirit to which the Lord refers.<a name=174:9></a> The woman had often enough come to Jacob's well, it is a figure of the springs of this world to which souls go to find satisfaction and pleasure.<a name=174:10></a> The Lord says, "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting <i>life</i>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>.<a name=174:11></a> Just think of a well of water in you springing up to eternal life!<a name=174:12></a> I want to show you the connection between the well of water and the light that has been applied to the wick.<a name=174:13></a> The well of water is given in order that it may sustain the light.<a name=174:14></a> I will tell you how it works; the first thing is that the Spirit of God works in the believer to emancipate his soul from sin and legality -- that is the springing up of the well in the believer.<a name=174:15></a> It is an undeniable fact that we are so much detained by both sin and legality, we are

		Another thing is to bring me into freedom, not freedom of will as man thinks of it, but into the freedom of God's blessed love.<a name=175:3></a> There is a verse in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>which shows this: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>.<a name=175:4></a> That was the apostle speaking in regard to himself, he could say it with regard to himself, and in some little measure I can say it, only not perhaps in the absolute way in which he spoke of it.<a name=175:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important to see that this is the effect of the springing up of this well of water; it emancipates a man from the bondage of sin and legality.<a name=175:6></a> I am sure you would like to taste the sweets of liberty, for liberty is a very precious thing.<a name=175:7></a> Nine out of ten christians are not happy because they are not free, and why not free?<a name=175:8></a> Because their hearts are clinging to some poor thing of this world, or in legality doing things because they ought to do them; they are not prepared to sacrifice.<a name=175:9></a> What the Spirit of God leads you to is happiness.<a name=175:10></a> It is a great thing to be happy; to taste these heavenly things is true happiness.<a name=175:11></a> Do you know what it is to be supremely happy?<a name=175:12></a> You will not be happy if you are clinging to this thing or that, if trying to keep up a certain status in this world, or if you sink down into the pleasures of a country life; but if you are here in the enjoyment of the love of God, and at the disposal of the Lord Jesus you will be supremely happy.<a name=175:13></a>

		The Spirit of God is in the believer a well of water, and it is not the only work of the Spirit to emancipate the soul from sin and from legality.<a name=175:14></a> There is another most important part of the Spirit's work, and that is to form and mould us according to the light which

		has been given us.<a name=176:1></a> How are people formed in this world?<a name=176:2></a> Take a babe that is born into this world, how is it formed?<a name=176:3></a> That babe is formed by the affections of which it is the object.<a name=176:4></a> As a babe it finds itself in the midst of a blessed system of affections: the love of the mother and father, and, it may be, of brothers and sisters, too -- a blessed framework of affections.<a name=176:5></a> Thus the child is morally formed as it grows, and they are all intelligent affections.<a name=176:6></a> It is this which makes the difference between man and the beast; there are affections in the brute creation, but they are not intelligent affections.<a name=176:7></a> What would this world be without natural affection?<a name=176:8></a> It is the one redeeming feature among men, from the highest to the lowest.<a name=176:9></a> I thank God He has left it here, greatly debased I do not doubt, but still here.<a name=176:10></a> The new-born child is brought up in this framework of affections, and is thus formed.<a name=176:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me say one word more: it is a very great thing in a family to exercise affection; it is a great mistake for a father to be too austere; it is a beautiful thing to see love between brothers and sisters, and I believe, beautiful under the eye of God.<a name=176:12></a> There is a deficiency where this tenderness of affection is not found.<a name=176:13></a> What makes a household beautiful is the tenderness of affection in all the members of it.<a name=176:14></a> A christian household is beautiful under the eye of the Lord.<a name=176:15></a> That is only an illustration; when I come to the christian reality, I have the wick lighted up.<a name=176:16></a> And now I see the individual, like the woman, has to be formed and framed entirely anew by the relationships in which he is placed.<a name=176:17></a> When the light is applied and the wick made to burn, the next thing is that that person is placed in the sphere of divine affection.<a name=176:18></a> Do you not think you ought to be very free with a person who loves you?<a name=176:19></a> Thank God, I can say one is more free with Him than in the home circle here.<a name=176:20></a> There is no alloy there; perfectly free with God in the circle of His love, and that is how you

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is something else that comes in -- the love of Christ; the love of Christ is a little different from the love of God; there is a peculiarity about the love of Christ.<a name=177:4></a> I could hardly say, God loved me and gave Himself for me.<a name=177:5></a> When I come to Christ I can.<a name=177:6></a>

		I will refer to a third point: there are the relationships in which the new-born soul is placed among the brethren.<a name=177:7></a> The more you are among the brethren, the more you love them and the more you love them the more your heart will be enlarged; only one thing enlarges the heart, the knowledge of love.<a name=177:8></a> "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:14">1 John  3:14</a>.<a name=177:9></a> In order to complete the framework of christian relationships, you must include the love of the brethren.<a name=177:10></a> The Lord says: "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>), and in the epistle of John it is said, "everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:1">1 John  5:1</a>.<a name=177:11></a> Love casts out fear, <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:18">1 John  4:18</a>; I can confide in God because of His power, which has been exercised on our behalf, but it is not only His power that leads me to confide in Him, it is His love that wins my confidence.<a name=177:12></a> You can place implicit confidence in Him.<a name=177:13></a> You can trust, too, the love of Christ; He has not only died for us, but He lives for us, and He is coming and we love His appearing.<a name=177:14></a> He is also coming to receive us to Himself.<a name=177:15></a> I have said that His coming

		If I once more refer to the wick as representing the person, let me add that although the texture of the wick may be changed, it is the same individual wick all through.<a name=178:3></a> The person who now loves God is the same that was once dark and dead in regard to God.<a name=178:4></a> The woman of Samaria is the same person, and yet the texture has been completely changed.<a name=178:5></a>

		Many have noticed how the principle of the gospel comes out in connection with the ministry of the prophet Elisha.<a name=180:1></a> He was a remarkable type of Christ in that sense.<a name=180:2></a> He did not come in the character of Elijah, but is marked by having a double portion of Elijah's spirit.<a name=180:3></a> The ministry of Elisha has its own character; it is evangelical.<a name=180:4></a> Israel was suffering great affliction from the Syrians, at that time their enemies, and they had to learn that if they were to have any relief or good from God, it must be by the word of the prophet; it was by the prophet that God would give them deliverance.<a name=180:5></a> That was always the case.<a name=180:6></a> They were ready enough to have the deliverance, but they did not care for the word through which it came; they had to learn that deliverance would only come that way.<a name=180:7></a> No one can read these scriptures without feeling the deepest interest in Elisha.<a name=180:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point to which I would call your attention is the character of those who bore the glad tidings, then how the principle of the gospel comes out in a most remarkable way, in that the power of the enemy was broken, and where there had been dearth there came to be plenty, it was not only the dearth removed, but there was now abundance.<a name=180:9></a> The same principle comes out earlier in the ministry of Elisha (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4">2 Kings  4</a>) in the case of the widow and her pot of oil, not only was the debt paid, but she and her sons were to live of the rest.<a name=180:10></a> I only just refer to it, everybody here is familiar with the narrative, and it shows us the divine way.<a name=180:11></a> It is not the way of grace simply to relieve a person of debt, but to provide that on which he may live; it relieves you of the pressure that is upon you, but you are to live of the residue; the word which

		brings the tidings of the grace of God, becomes the power of life in the believer.<a name=181:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will now say a word about the bearers of the glad tidings.<a name=181:2></a> The important point is that they were not great men, they were not learned men, but they were leprous men, and yet they were the bearers of glad tidings; they were evangelists.<a name=181:3></a> We see the same thing in connection with the healing of Naaman; it was not a great man that brought the good news to him, not some priest or general, but a little maid who said there was a prophet in Israel who could heal him of his leprosy.<a name=181:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have four leprous men.<a name=181:5></a> People might be offended with the gospel, because it is irregularly brought to them, not by properly constituted ministers; but what I see is this, that man having departed from God, He will not put any honour upon man in the bearing of glad tidings to him.<a name=181:6></a> The first people who preached were unlearned men; I quite admit that later on, God did take up a man of another kind, but the first preachers of the gospel -- and they were most distinguished men in the service of Christ -- were Galilean fishermen and the like, and they were the bearers of glad tidings.<a name=181:7></a> This is important, and no one ought to be offended because of the person who brings to him glad tidings.<a name=181:8></a> I would say, look at the glad tidings, not at the bearers of them; that is the lesson to be deduced from what is before us.<a name=181:9></a>

		These four lepers were in desperate case, they said: If we enter into the city we die, if we sit still here we die, if we fall to the Syrians and they kill us we shall but die, so to the enemy they went.<a name=181:10></a> But the remarkable thing is that when they were come to the camp, they found not only that the enemies were gone, but that they had left abundance behind them, and they fell upon the prey and took the spoil.<a name=181:11></a> Then there comes out the natural selfishness of the human heart; they take and hide for themselves, but after a while conscience

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the great principle of the gospel as illustrated here, that where the enemy and dearth were, it came to pass that not only was the power of the enemy broken, but there was abundance; and that is just what marks the present moment.<a name=183:9></a> I quite admit that you cannot see it with your eyes, it is only where God, works and the conscience is in exercise, that the grace of God is apprehended.<a name=183:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What we find in the earlier psalms is the setting forth of Christ's name.<a name=194:1></a> A 'name' in Scripture indicates that which God sees fit to set forth in a person, and this holds good in Christ as become Man.<a name=194:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>we get the full glory of Christ's name set forth.<a name=194:3></a> In the former we have 'King of Israel' and 'Son of God', and in the latter the "Son of man".<a name=194:4></a> When He became Man He inherited these names; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>,4,5.<a name=194:5></a> Neither one nor the other gives exactly the truth of His Person, but they set forth His glory as <i>Man</i>.<a name=194:6></a> Thus the three titles which constitute His full glory as Man are Son of God, Son of David, and Son of man.<a name=194:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to notice how in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>Nathanael spiritually discerned the Lord, and saw <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>fulfilled in Him, and the Lord in His answer to him does not speak of judgment, but of a vast system of blessing, which God would establish under the Son of man: "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:51">John  1:51</a>.<a name=194:8></a> The Lord, as it were, completes the circle of His glory; Nathanael had confessed Him as the Man of the second Psalm, and the Lord answers him by referring to the eighth Psalm.<a name=194:9></a>

		I come now to the detail in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=201:4></a> "In that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:10">Romans  6:10</a>.<a name=201:5></a> I want to show you from this psalm what I think <i>life to God</i> is.<a name=201:6></a> It contemplates the Lord in respect to what He is in regard to God.<a name=201:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I see in the ways of God is this, if God was to bring blessing about down here there must be a Man before Him.<a name=201:8></a> To begin with, God must be completely glorified in Man down here and Satan must be completely defeated.<a name=201:9></a> The ground down here was to be held for God completely in a Man.<a name=201:10></a> That is the starting-point, I believe, of God's ways, so that Satan should be defeated in the very scene of his power.<a name=201:11></a> The earth is the scene of his power; he is the prince of the power of the air.<a name=201:12></a> Satan had ruined the first man, but there is a Man presented in Christ in whom God establishes glory and Satan is defeated.<a name=201:13></a> I can understand it would have been possible for God to sweep man off the earth and create another race, but that did not suit God; His way was recovery, and Satan was to be defeated in the scene of his power.<a name=201:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point comes out, that He associates Himself with the saints, "in the earth and to the excellent", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:3">Psalm  16:3</a>; He says: "In whom is all my delight".<a name=201:19></a> He takes them for companions.<a name=201:20></a> I can understand someone saying, Does not that contradict what you have been saying as to Christ being the starting-point

		Then He will have nothing to do with the violent (verse 4); He was entirely apart from evil; and in the rest of the psalm you get the wonderful way in which Jehovah was His portion.<a name=203:3></a> That is what made me say the burden of the psalm was life according to God.<a name=203:4></a> He had not to turn to anything else: "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:5">Psalm  16:5</a>.<a name=203:5></a> We often want a little bit of portion in some other inheritance.<a name=203:6></a> There was nothing of that kind in regard to Christ.<a name=203:7></a> It has often been said as to the Lord here upon earth: He began in a manger, in His pathway He had not where to lay His head, and He passed out of the world upon a cross.<a name=203:8></a> He had not a penny; when He wanted one He had to say, 'Show me one'; or to send Peter to get a fish!<a name=203:9></a> But He could say, "Thou art my portion"!<a name=203:10></a> "I have a goodly heritage", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:6">Psalm  16:6</a>!<a name=203:11></a> I wonder how far we can say that?<a name=203:12></a> It is a man in the full light of Jehovah.<a name=203:13></a>

		The next point is He had not to turn to man for wisdom (verse 7).<a name=204:3></a> It is a wonderful verse because there are very few of us so free of man that we do not turn to man for counsel: "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:7">Psalm  16:7</a>.<a name=204:4></a> He never turned to man; He found Jehovah enough for Him; He was in the blessed light of Jehovah; Jehovah maintained His lot.<a name=204:5></a> There is a very beautiful expression in John's gospel: "As I hear, I judge", chapter 5:30.<a name=204:6></a> He did not judge by the seeing of the eye as He might have done, but His judgment of man, His thought, came from above.<a name=204:7></a> He could have judged them well enough Himself, but He says: "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:7">Psalm  16:7</a>.<a name=204:8></a> What a wonderful expression for the Lord to use!<a name=204:9></a> He had no heritage as Man, no wisdom from man, no counsel from man, all from Jehovah.<a name=204:10></a>

		The essence of the psalm is what He found in God down here.<a name=206:1></a> I would not be without this psalm because it expresses so perfectly what a man can find in Jehovah in a world like this -- Jehovah his unfailing portion.<a name=206:2></a> Satan has been completely defeated and God completely glorified in Man.<a name=206:3></a> A Man has been here upon earth who has found His portion exclusively in Jehovah, outside of man altogether.<a name=206:4></a> That is the path Christ inaugurated, and that is Man to perfection, and that is the starting-point of everything.<a name=206:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I venture to say again, every family is to take its character from Him; nothing of the first man is to abide in the issue and result of God's ways.<a name=206:6></a> The first man has been set aside in order that God might introduce the second, not merely personally in Christ, but that everything might take its character from the second Man.<a name=206:7></a> What do you get in regard to us?<a name=206:8></a> "The second man out of heaven", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:47">1 Corinthians  15:47</a>; and what follows?<a name=206:9></a> "As the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>.<a name=206:10></a> How could it be otherwise?<a name=206:11></a> How could any but a heavenly man be independent of man and find his portion in Jehovah?<a name=206:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now at the close of the psalm (verses 10, 11) we find another feature.<a name=206:13></a> It is a great thing not only to have a portion in heaven, but to learn the good of <i>piety</i> down here.<a name=206:14></a> I find in the New Testament, "Piety is profitable for everything", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:8">1 Timothy  4:8</a>.<a name=206:15></a> There is such a thing for the christian as gladness down here and for the 'glory' to rejoice down here.<a name=206:16></a> I do not think it is merely a man hurrying through and finding nothing here.<a name=206:17></a> It is a great thing to find your resource in Jehovah and for your tongue to be glad.<a name=206:18></a> The path leads on in our case to heavenly glory.<a name=206:19></a> To Him at Jehovah's right hand there were pleasures for evermore.<a name=206:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing I would draw your attention to a point or two in the succeeding psalm (see verses 2-14, 13-15).<a name=206:21></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#17">Psalm  17</a>is not so exclusively applicable to Christ as <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>; it may be more or less the experience of

		others.<a name=207:1></a> But there was a great question between Him and man.<a name=207:2></a> When Christ came, man was in opposition.<a name=207:3></a> There is still the question between Him and man, and what I see in this psalm is, Christ does not decide it for Himself, but leaves His sentence to Jehovah.<a name=207:4></a> I think Jehovah has given the sentence; He whom men have rejected God has exalted to His right hand.<a name=207:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#15">Psalm  15</a>to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#17">Psalm  17</a>is thus different from the previous psalms.<a name=207:6></a> It is no longer the divine counsel, the glory of the Lord; all that has been fully established, but we come to the other side, that Christ is the complete answer to the question: Who is going to abide in Jehovah's tabernacle?<a name=207:7></a> If man is going to be placed in relationship to God and to be happy with God, the starting-point must be Christ.<a name=207:8></a> It <i>is</i> Christ; and you must be prepared to let everything go which is not Christ.<a name=207:9></a>

		This psalm is one of surpassing interest, and stands out distinctly as being more personal to the Lord than any other psalm.<a name=219:1></a> To bear this in mind will be a great help, because even in the latter part of the psalm, where the result of His work is seen, it is the place which the <i>Lord Himself</i> takes with regard to others which comes before us, rather than the blessing into which they are brought.<a name=219:2></a> There are two parts to the psalm, the first part refers to the sufferings of the Lord, and the second part to the place which the Lord takes consequent upon suffering.<a name=219:3></a> There is another thing which characterises this psalm, it does not go beyond the earth, and this is the position which is <i>generally</i> found in the psalms.<a name=219:4></a> There are one or two which speak of the Lord's present session at the right hand of God, but that is not the general line of things in the psalms.<a name=219:5></a> The great question in the Old Testament was, whether God or man was to have the earth.<a name=219:6></a> Man claims it for himself, but it belongs to God, and He will possess it in the Person of His anointed.<a name=219:7></a> It is very interesting to see that in the fourth book (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90">Psalm  90</a>to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106">Psalm  106</a>) you get the coming of the Lord, and the fifth book brings us to the closing glory.<a name=219:8></a> That which underlies the early psalms is, I should say, the truth of the Son of God.<a name=219:9></a> It is important to see this because it is the key to those psalms and especially to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=219:10></a>

		THE CHURCH ON EARTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>we get the earthly side of the church.<a name=248:1></a> It is not the church looked at as the fulness of Christ, and it is not union which is taught in the chapter, though unity is taught there, but the church as the body is the vessel in which are set all the manifestations of the Spirit, and it makes us all dependent one upon another.<a name=248:2></a> When I hear people saying, 'I never learnt anything from man', that is a pretty good proof to me that they do not know much.<a name=248:3></a> If they simply mean that they never learned anything from man as man, that may be the case; but if they mean that they never learned anything through the instrumentality or medium of man, then I say they must be very ignorant persons.<a name=248:4></a> Because had they known anything of christianity, they must have known it through members of the body.<a name=248:5></a> Paul and John were members of the body, though they were apostles, and all the light that comes to us -- the very Scriptures themselves -- comes to us through the apostles, and the apostles were set in the church.<a name=248:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The practical application of it in the present day is this, that we should recognise the truth of the one body, "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body", "and have been all made to drink into one Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>.<a name=248:7></a> That was not a kind of mystical idea; it was a reality down here which saints were to recognise, that is, that they were one body by the baptism of the Spirit, so that the apostle could say to the body of saints at Corinth, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>.<a name=248:8></a> Christ could not have two bodies at Corinth, any more than Christ could have two bodies in London.<a name=248:9></a> There is Christ's body in London, and it is a very great point to recognise the fact.<a name=248:10></a> Because if once I recognise it, I say I have done

		completely with anything which takes up distinctive sectarian ground.<a name=249:1></a> I will not be identified with apostasy like popery, nor with a state church, nor with denominations, for the simple reason that I recognise the fact, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>), and "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>), and the one body is the vessel here for the manifestations of the Spirit.<a name=249:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one point more, and it is that there must be room given for the Spirit, you must not place any kind of restrictions upon the Spirit.<a name=249:3></a> For instance, if you have an appointed minister, if you do not give liberty of ministry, you put restrictions on the Spirit.<a name=249:4></a> You can never tell who may be a vessel for the manifestation of the Spirit, for the Spirit sometimes uses very unlikely people; He does not always employ the kind of vessel that would be naturally approved by man, because the Spirit is sovereign, and uses whom He will.<a name=249:5></a> You must recognise the truth of the one body, which sets aside all idea of sectarianism, and you must leave room for the free action of the Spirit, who distributes to every man severally as He will.<a name=249:6></a> All this truth is as to the church on its earthward side, but it is vastly important; for if you do not recognise it, you cannot understand anything about the assembly as convened.<a name=249:7></a> The instruction is given to the Corinthians for the regulation of the assembly as convened, and to avoid confusion.<a name=249:8></a> We come together as mutually dependent, for we are all one body, and every member of the body is dependent upon every other member of the body, as well as dependent upon the Head.<a name=249:9></a>

		Suppose a man were to say, I am not going to concern myself about the body or about church principles, I am going to exercise the gift which the Lord has given me.<a name=249:10></a> My answer to him is this, God has set the gift in the church, and if you recognise that fact, you cannot ignore the church.<a name=249:11></a> Let a man be the most distinguished evangelist that ever was, he cannot

		Now turn to the prayer which is addressed to the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ -- God is the source of creation, but the name of Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is identified with <i>counsels</i>.<a name=277:8></a> Then we get the power of that same Person -- different from the power of creation.<a name=277:9></a> The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is exercising His mighty power in regard of the inner man of christians; the inner man is what is of God; our outward man comes under discipline, not the inner man.<a name=277:10></a> The mighty power of the Spirit of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is set for the strengthening of our inner man, and the more it is so the more we are delivered from the depressing circumstances of the outward man.<a name=277:11></a> The object is that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=277:12></a> In the universe of God everything will come under the anointing; Christ is the

		"THE OLD MAN", "THE FLESH" AND "SIN"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are certain Scripture terms in common use amongst us with which most are very familiar, but to which we should, if challenged, find it perhaps difficult to attach any very distinct or definite meaning, or to clearly distinguish one from another.<a name=279:1></a> Such are "the old man", "sin", and "the flesh", the intimate connection between which must be evident enough to all.<a name=279:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose to enlarge on the terms a little, in the hope that the moral force of each may be more clearly apprehended.<a name=279:3></a> I may say, at the outset, that I am unable to realise much difference between the old man and the flesh.<a name=279:4></a> "Old man" may perhaps present a more complete idea than "flesh".<a name=279:5></a> "Old man" describes a certain order of man which can now be designated as old, because the new has appeared on the scene.<a name=279:6></a> I am not aware that the expressions 'old' and 'new man' are found save in Ephesians and Colossians, in both of which the thought of creation is introduced in connection with the new man.<a name=279:7></a> We find there the old and new man set strongly in contrast -- the one after or according to the lusts of deceit, the other created after or according to God.<a name=279:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I judge that the term 'man' speaks of an order of intelligent being set in certain relationships, and endowed with affections suited to those relationships; and this is true in both the old and new man, though in the old all is marred by sin.<a name=279:9></a> The term 'man' conveys to us the idea of what is outward and evident, an object to be apprehended by the mind or senses, and thus the new man is for the christian the foundation of testimony.<a name=279:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in 'flesh' the point of contrast is not 'the new man', but 'the Spirit' or 'spirit'; and the idea is thus evidently in distinction from that of 'man',
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=280>[Page 280]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		who can be apprehended as an object.<a name=280:1></a> The term plainly conveys to us the thought of what is inward or subjective -- a source of thought and feeling and purpose.<a name=280:2></a> It is undoubtedly used in a moral sense, and hence presents more than the thought of mere animal existence or nature.<a name=280:3></a> A man may be 'after the flesh' or 'after the Spirit' -- may find his springs in the one or in the other.<a name=280:4></a> But if in the one, he is, so to say, abstracted from the other.<a name=280:5></a> Now it is plain that this abstraction could not be until the Spirit was given.<a name=280:6></a> In Old Testament saints faith was evidently a most potent factor, and as they were helped of God there was practical righteousness; but until the cross there had not been such a setting aside of the flesh for God's glory as that the Spirit could be communicated, and consequently the saint in his experience could not be abstracted from the flesh as to his <i>habitual</i> moral state.<a name=280:7></a> He was even as a saint in the flesh.<a name=280:8></a> It was the state in which God took account of him, though, withal, helping him in it, or in spite of it.<a name=280:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'The flesh' is so habitually used in connection with sin and evil, that it becomes a little difficult to identify the term with an unfallen being like Adam; and yet I think it might be said that "in the flesh" was true of Adam, though, of course, without evil.<a name=280:10></a> Evidently the love of God was not shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit given to him, nor did he find his springs of affection, feeling, and thought in the Spirit, though as God's handiwork he was very good.<a name=280:11></a> Now, alas!<a name=280:12></a> flesh is characteristically flesh of sin.<a name=280:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that we have seen thus far that, while 'old' or 'new man' presents the idea of an object or order which is evident and observable, '<i>flesh</i>', in contrast to it, gives the idea of a moral spring which governs the mind, temper, and spirit of man, and has its issue in practice.<a name=280:14></a> And in this connection we may take up the subject of sin.<a name=280:15></a> It is clear that sin exists apart from the state of man or flesh, for the devil sins from the

		outset.<a name=281:1></a> It is a principle that has come into the world by man, and that holds man in bondage; and the scripture has defined it as 'lawlessness', i.<a name=281:2></a>e.<a name=281:3></a>, creature will impatient of restraint.<a name=281:4></a> Now will, as in flesh, may be spoken of in an innocent sense, i.<a name=281:5></a>e.<a name=281:6></a>, as mechanical -- the power of volition.<a name=281:7></a> A man must will to lift up his hand in order to lift it up, and this is part of flesh or man's bodily condition.<a name=281:8></a> It is not in this sense that we are now speaking of will, but purely in a moral sense -- in the sense in which, in its full development, it will be seen in antichrist -- defiant disregard of, and opposition to, God.<a name=281:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is perfectly compatible with a morality (like that of Paul) which claims and obtains the respect of man.<a name=281:10></a> The fact is that sin, as to the principle of it, is only known in relation to God, and it is the full revelation of God in Christ that has brought out sin in its enormity.<a name=281:11></a> The Lord said, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin", <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:22">John  15:22</a>; and the testimony of Christ brought out the fact that hatred of God is an essential and necessary element of sin -- God is not only defied, but hated.<a name=281:12></a> But this may and does exist in the condition of flesh; hence it is, I think, simple to apprehend the distinction between 'sin', 'the old man', and 'the flesh'.<a name=281:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to come to the moment when this is apprehended.<a name=283:9></a> The first apprehension of divine things is that of the grace of God presented in the gospel.<a name=283:10></a> Every man must begin with the glad tidings.<a name=283:11></a> If it were otherwise, it would set aside the relative position of God and man.<a name=283:12></a> But when a person has apprehended the grace of God in the glad tidings, a moment may come when he apprehends that Christ had a very special object in what He did.<a name=283:13></a> (See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:44">Matthew  13:44</a>-46.<a name=283:14></a>) Many have wrong ideas of these two parables -- they make men the seekers, and what is found is salvation.<a name=283:15></a> But it is not so.<a name=283:16></a> In these parables the kingdom is looked at from the divine side.<a name=283:17></a> Christ bought the field for the sake of the treasure, but this He hid.<a name=283:18></a> So the church has not yet been made <i>manifest</i>, but it will come out into manifestation.<a name=283:19></a>

		when the soul comes into the sense that it belongs to that for which Christ gave Himself.<a name=284:1></a> It is a great moment to come to that He loved <i>me</i> and gave Himself for <i>me</i>; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=284:2></a> Now His death was the expression of His love to the church, and greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<a name=284:3></a> If I can show you how it is that Christ gains the appreciation and affection of His people, I shall be able to show you how He sanctifies and cleanses the church by the washing of water by the word.<a name=284:4></a> These two things must infallibly work together.<a name=284:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to refer to three passages to show you how we are led on in our appreciation of Christ.<a name=284:6></a> See <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:1">1 John  2:1</a>, "Jesus Christ the <i>righteous</i>"; also verse 20, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One"; verse 13, "Ye have known him that is from the beginning".<a name=284:7></a> Chapter 5:20, He is "the true God, and eternal life".<a name=284:8></a> Manifestly there are four thoughts presented in regard to Christ: (1) The righteous One, the propitiation for our sins; (2) He is the Holy One;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) He is from the outset; (4) He is the end, He is eternal life.<a name=284:9></a> These passages open out the truth in regard to Christ; it is in that way and order that we learn to appreciate Christ.<a name=284:10></a> It will become manifest when Christ comes again in the heavenly city that He is "the true God, and eternal life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>; and it is all the more remarkable because He suffered here.<a name=284:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to illustrate these thoughts in connection with the first -- the righteous One (see <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:41">Luke  7:41</a>-50): "She hath washed my feet with tears", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:44">Luke  7:44</a>.<a name=284:12></a> To whom much is forgiven, the same loveth much.<a name=284:13></a> This illustrates Christ as the righteous One, and is the best illustration of it that I know.<a name=284:14></a> There are two things which must be in the righteous One: one is that He must accomplish righteousness, and secondly, He must put Himself in communication with man.<a name=284:15></a> He must bear the judgment under which man lay

	<div class="paragraph">
		He must put Himself in communication with man.<a name=285:1></a> The righteous One is a Man.<a name=285:2></a> The woman in the city appreciated Christ as the righteous One -- she loved Him, and for this reason, that He brought God close to her in grace.<a name=285:3></a> Her heart had this appreciation of Christ: He announced righteousness to her, "Thy sins are forgiven" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:48">Luke  7:48</a>), and the effect of righteousness is peace, and so He said to her, "Go in peace".<a name=285:4></a> If you do not appreciate Christ as the righteous One, in whom God has approached men, and who has accomplished righteousness, you have not learnt the grace of God.<a name=285:5></a> We must all begin there, just where the woman began.<a name=285:6></a> It is the poor sinner who appreciates Christ as the righteous One, and the secret of her appreciation was that He brought God close to her in grace.<a name=285:7></a>

		THE GOSPEL AND FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say a few words to show the contrast between John's epistle and John's gospel; for these distinctions are of very great importance.<a name=454:1></a> First, as to the different way in which the same Person is presented to us in each.<a name=454:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel the Son, though become Man, is presented on the divine side; and in the epistle mediatorially <i>as Man</i>, though at the same time the true God; and it is in this connection eternal life to us comes in.<a name=454:3></a> To prove it to you, I have only to call your attention to the beginning of each book.<a name=454:4></a> (See <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>, etc.<a name=454:5></a>).<a name=454:6></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=454:7></a> The first thirteen verses present an epitome of what He was, and the effect of His manifestation down here; it is not till verse 14 we get incarnation stated.<a name=454:8></a> The object of what is recorded is seen in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:30">John  20:30</a>,31.<a name=454:9></a> "These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name".<a name=454:10></a> Jesus (His personal name), the lowly Man, is the Christ, in whom is the accomplishment of the hopes and promises presented in the Old Testament, and at the same time the Son of God who has revealed the Father.<a name=454:11></a> He is thus the object of faith, that you might have life through His name.<a name=454:12></a> The object for which the gospel was written was to unfold the truth as to the only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, who has declared God.<a name=454:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle the same Person is presented to us on another side, as I have said, mediatorially as Man.<a name=454:14></a> We have what is true in Him and in us.<a name=454:15></a> You must have Christ as Man for that.<a name=454:16></a> In the gospel it is rather what is true in the Father and the Son.<a name=454:17></a> I have no

		part in Him as God, for I never cease to be a creature, though I may be richly blessed as such; it is on the human side only we can have any part in Christ.<a name=455:1></a> In the gospel He takes the ground, "before Abraham was, I am", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:58">John  8:58</a>.<a name=455:2></a> Here in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1">1 John  1</a>it is what He was from the outset, that is, of that which the apostles had seen and heard of in Him as Man down here, from a point of which they could take account; the passage may possibly go on to resurrection, but refers to Him down here, as they had actually seen and known and been familiar with Him; but while presenting this, the epistle closes with the positive statement of the divine glory of His Person: He (Jesus Christ) is the true God and eternal life (s<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>).<a name=455:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point of difference between the gospel and the epistle is in the way in which eternal life is spoken of.<a name=455:4></a> In the gospel it is referred to as given, and viewed chiefly on the gift side.<a name=455:5></a> In the epistle we have the experimental side, the progress and apprehension of the soul.<a name=455:6></a> You must hold to what Scripture teaches on both sides: for instance, in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1">1 Peter  1</a>we have saints 'called', 'redeemed' and 'born again'--all this is what God has done, while in chapter 2:2-5 we have the advance and progress of the soul to salvation and the apprehension of corporate privileges.<a name=455:7></a> The epistles generally are for the instruction and leading on of believers, unfolding the features of their blessings that they may be able to give an account of them.<a name=455:8></a> The difference of intent between the gospel and the first epistle of John is seen by contrasting <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a> already quoted, and <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:13">1 John  5:13</a>: "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God: that ye may know that ye have eternal life".<a name=455:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more point of difference is as to the position of Jesus.<a name=455:10></a> In the gospel the glory of His Person is unfolded; but He appears as Man here in humiliation, having taken that form in order to suffer and thus

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to note that the Spirit of God takes account of the saints in their very early exercises; He not only takes account of the advanced, but in these two epistles to the Thessalonians we see the divine interest in their very early stages.<a name=457:1></a> We do not begin as full grown; we have to begin as babes.<a name=457:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		These epistles are, perhaps, the two earliest written.<a name=457:3></a> They are written to those who have just been enlightened by the gospel.<a name=457:4></a> What is recognised in them must be true; they had not much intelligence in the scheme of God's purposes, but there is the recognition of the very first elements of christianity as being true of them.<a name=457:5></a> These first elements do not alter; in a way we may come to apprehend more, but what we began with always remains; but we cannot live for ever on what we begin with only, we want to go on to know the purpose of God.<a name=457:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is just to touch on the <i>very</i> earliest elements of christian experience; they come out in these chapters remarkably.<a name=457:7></a> In chapter 1 we get what was the simple effect of the truth; in chapter 2 we get the testing of the saints; for every one who gets light will shortly be tested.<a name=457:8></a> If God is before us we shall answer to the test; these Thessalonians stood the test.<a name=457:9></a> The points in chapter 1 which indicate the first effects produced by the gospel are both living and real.<a name=457:10></a>

		Now, with these Thessalonians, the effect of the glad tidings being received was that they "turned to God from idols", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:9">1 Thessalonians  1:9</a>.<a name=458:15></a> That was one part; but there was another, "and to wait for his Son from heaven", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:10">1 Thessalonians  1:10</a>.<a name=458:16></a> They recognised the <i>true</i> God, that is, the God who has revealed Himself.<a name=458:17></a> God has proved Himself to be a <i>living</i> God in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<a name=458:18></a> The effect of the glad tidings was to bring those who believed into living relations with the true God, and that is one of the first elements of christianity -- the turning to <i>God</i> from idols, and it was to a <i>living</i> and <i>true</i> God.<a name=458:19></a> There was nothing that was living or true in dumb idols.<a name=458:20></a> What can be more important than to have to say to a living and true God?<a name=458:21></a> I have no doubt that the very testimony of the forgiveness of sins is to the end that people may recognise the living and true God.<a name=458:22></a> You could not recognise it if there were not the forgiveness of sins, for people otherwise would be afraid of the thought of God.<a name=458:23></a> Forgiveness

		Take a man like Luther.<a name=461:8></a> He stood faithful to the light God had given, and the practical result was that the light remained.<a name=461:9></a> Can you conceive of a more disastrous thing than to surrender light which God has given?<a name=461:10></a> If a man like Paul had in any way surrendered the truth, what a disaster indeed!<a name=461:11></a> The last test he had was the greatest.<a name=461:12></a> He was brought before the emperor.<a name=461:13></a> Suppose Paul had been disposed to accommodate himself to the circumstances in which he was, it would have been disastrous to the truth, but he stood true to the light amidst all the pressure brought to bear upon him.<a name=461:14></a> He could say at the end, "I have finished my course, I have kept the faith" <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:7">2 Timothy  4:7</a>.<a name=461:15></a> He was entitled to the crown of righteousness.<a name=461:16></a> He could not have said so if he had not been tested.<a name=461:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer now to chapter 3:6, but would remark first on one other point which comes out in chapter 2, that is, the great interest with which the testing is watched.<a name=461:18></a> The apostle had the greatest possible interest in the Thessalonians.<a name=461:19></a> The servant watches, but the Lord watches, too.<a name=461:20></a> It is a matter of great interest to the Lord, and I go further; it is, I believe, a pleasure to the Lord that those who have received the gospel should stand firm.<a name=461:21></a> I would not wish to have escaped anything to which I have been subjected in the way of test, for if through grace one has answered to it, the Lord has given one confirmation.<a name=461:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer you now to chapter 3:13: "In order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:13">1 Thessalonians  3:13</a>.<a name=462:13></a> The working of that is the love of God being shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.<a name=462:14></a> It is in this way that we get a true sense of holiness.<a name=462:15></a> If you come under the influence of the holy love of God you will not countenance impurity or corruption; then, too, we love one another, "and abound in love toward one another" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:12">1 Thessalonians  3:12</a>.<a name=462:16></a> If I love God, I love what is of God, and I have no selfish object in my love to the saints.<a name=462:17></a> It is a wonderful thing that in this corrupt world there should be such a thing as love.<a name=462:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way to promote holiness is in the exercise of love to one another, and for this your own heart must be kept by the Spirit of God in the sense of the holy love of God.<a name=462:19></a> The importance of recognising relationship is that you come under the influence of those to whom you are related.<a name=462:20></a> In the case of a child, it is not only that the child has a father and mother, but that he comes under their influence.<a name=462:21></a> May God in His grace maintain us in the sense of this, so that we are characterised by that which is vital in christianity.<a name=462:22></a>

		These epistles deal with believers in their first stage of christian experience.<a name=463:2></a> Doctrine is not unfolded but christian walk.<a name=463:3></a> We cannot have doctrine before walk.<a name=463:4></a> As soon as we have received the Spirit, walk begins.<a name=463:5></a> If people are not walking according to the truth of the gospel, they will not make much headway spiritually.<a name=463:6></a> What we want to see with the young is walk -- suitable walk -- a desire to walk to please God.<a name=463:7></a>

		I refer for a moment to what we spoke of on a previous occasion, that is, the light in which Christ is looked at in the epistle.<a name=463:8></a> All that comes out in the epistle will more or less take its colour from the way in which Christ is presented.<a name=463:9></a> It speaks of Him as our Saviour, and in chapter 5 it says, "God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:9">1 Thessalonians  5:9</a>.<a name=463:10></a> Our Lord Jesus Christ is looked at as Saviour, in connection with His coming again; it is not His first coming that is in view here, but His second coming.<a name=463:11></a> In the first, He came to do the will of God and to accomplish redemption; in the second coming He comes as the Saviour.<a name=463:12></a> The harvest and the vintage are both spoken of when He comes again.<a name=463:13></a> In regard of the harvest He will come to gather in all that God has been working: "My Father worketh hitherto" <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>.<a name=463:14></a> The Lord speaks about the fields being white to harvest, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:35">John  4:35</a>.<a name=463:15></a> He is the great Harvester, He will come as Saviour -- His Son, God's Son -- He came as the Bridegroom the first time.<a name=463:16></a> But the Bridegroom was taken away; now we wait for Him as the Bridegroom.<a name=463:17></a> The Bridegroom

		There is that here on earth which is irreconcilable.<a name=464:2></a> The Jew had proved himself irreconcilable and wrath has come upon him nationally to the uttermost; <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:16">1 Thessalonians  2:16</a>.<a name=464:3></a> The same thing will come to pass in regard to the gentile, "otherwise thou also shalt be cut off", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:22">Romans  11:22</a>.<a name=464:4></a> When the apostasy is complete and men have given up God absolutely, then the great day of His wrath will have come, but the true character in which Christ comes again is that of Saviour.<a name=464:5></a> We "await his Son from the heavens, .<a name=464:6></a>.<a name=464:7></a>.<a name=464:8></a> our deliverer from the coming wrath" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:10">1 Thessalonians  1:10</a>.<a name=464:9></a> God has been working all through the ages, and all that work of God will be gathered up by Christ; the harvest will be gathered in.<a name=464:10></a> "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:28">Hebrews  9:28</a>.<a name=464:11></a> He was manifested the first time to take away sin -- He was the appointed Victim -- He comes the second time apart from sin, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:28">Hebrews  9:28</a>.<a name=464:12></a> The second coming is the completion of His first coming.<a name=464:13></a> He had to die, and He must come again to gather up the harvest.<a name=464:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these Thessalonians, as we have already seen, had been put to severe testing.<a name=464:15></a> Those who had been converted among the Jews were subjected to persecution from the Jews, and the mind of the gentiles is just as hostile to the gospel as that of the Jews.<a name=464:16></a> But the Thessalonians stood their ground, and Paul rejoiced.<a name=464:17></a> They had stood firm in the faith in spite of the testing.<a name=464:18></a> The testing had not turned them away from the truth, indeed they were confirmed in it, and that is the result which the test effected.<a name=464:19></a> It has been said that times of persecution only tended to establish the saints.<a name=464:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle enjoins on the saints a walk.<a name=465:8></a> It is really the direct fulfilment of the law.<a name=465:9></a> The law is God's rule for man down here on earth; the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>.<a name=465:10></a> "Love is the fulfilling of the law", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:10">Romans  13:10</a>.<a name=465:11></a> Now that is a very important point.<a name=465:12></a> We cannot stop with faith.<a name=465:13></a> The real test of faith is that what you believe governs you.<a name=465:14></a> I believe a great many things in the world, but they do not govern me.<a name=465:15></a> I believe there is a President in the United States, but that does not affect me at all.<a name=465:16></a> The earth travels round the sun, but that fact does not affect me, but the fruit of real faith is that you are governed by what you believe.<a name=465:17></a> If I see a person not governed by what he believes, I shall begin to be sceptical of his faith.<a name=465:18></a> If the light of God is in the heart, it is bound to produce a result in the saints.<a name=465:19></a> Paul says, "I live by Christ".<a name=465:20></a> That was the effect of the light in the heart of the apostle; he felt bound to give himself up to the will of God.<a name=465:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come to another point.<a name=466:2></a> "Ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:9">1 Thessalonians  1:9</a> and the way we are taught is by the revelation of the love of God, and that is divine teaching.<a name=466:3></a> No one could be under the influence of the love of God without loving others.<a name=466:4></a> I am confident that if the love of God is in our hearts we shall love each other.<a name=466:5></a> If we do not love one another it is because we know very little about the love of God -- the love of God which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>.<a name=466:6></a> If that be known the practical working of it will be that we shall love one another.<a name=466:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is a further practical point: "that ye study to be quiet .<a name=466:8></a>.<a name=466:9></a>.<a name=466:10></a> and to work with your own hands" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:11">1 Thessalonians  4:11</a>.<a name=466:11></a> We want to commend the truth of God to those that are without.<a name=466:12></a> We are to treasure the truth in our own hearts, but it is extremely important to walk in such a way as to commend it to those who are without.<a name=466:13></a> Orderly walk in christians is the effect of the light of God in the heart.<a name=466:14></a> There was to be the absence of lust, God having called them in sanctification of the Spirit; then brotherly love is enjoined, and quietly working with their own hands.<a name=466:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to two other points: comfort and hope.<a name=466:16></a> Comfort is a very great point in regard to christians when they are no longer affected by the fear of death.<a name=466:17></a> I believe people are more affected by the thought of death than by anything else.<a name=466:18></a> See how they will try to preserve their lives and how anxious they are about their bodies.<a name=466:19></a> But the christian is not waiting for death.<a name=466:20></a> We are waiting for Christ as Saviour.<a name=466:21></a> The apostle says, "We shall not all sleep" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:51">1 Corinthians  15:51</a>.<a name=466:22></a> If we are looking for Christ as Saviour we are not looking for death.<a name=466:23></a> No christian is justified in looking for death, but for the Lord Himself: "Lord Jesus Christ our hope" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:1">1 Timothy  1:1</a>.<a name=466:24></a> These Thessalonians had become

	<div class="paragraph">
		disquieted in regard to those who had died, so the apostle brings comfort in; there was a way through death: "them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:14">1 Thessalonians  4:14</a>.<a name=467:1></a> "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout" <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:16">1 Thessalonians  4:16</a>.<a name=467:2></a> There is the power of His voice which will speak to those who have fallen asleep.<a name=467:3></a> It is wonderful to think that God will make a way through death.<a name=467:4></a> He made a way for the children of Israel through the Red Sea, which naturally speaking was certain death to them, but the rod of God came in and a way was made through for the people, so that instead of the Red Sea being death the Red Sea was protection to them.<a name=467:5></a> In a certain sense we have passed through, too; the way has been made through, and what we are waiting for is not death, but the Lord Himself from heaven.<a name=467:6></a> It is an immense point whether we think of ourselves or of those departed that Christ has annulled death, <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a>.<a name=467:7></a> He went into death and a way was made through.<a name=467:8></a> We are "married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>.<a name=467:9></a> Death has been dealt with, beloved friends, that is a very great point, and it only wants His voice to awaken those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.<a name=467:10></a> "Wherefore comfort one another with these words", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:18">1 Thessalonians  4:18</a>.<a name=467:11></a> In our ordinary walk down here God would have us to be in comfort.<a name=467:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the mind of God, too, that we should be taken out of occupation with times and seasons: "But of the times and seasons brethren.<a name=467:13></a>.<a name=467:14></a>".<a name=467:15></a>, <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:1">1 Thessalonians  5:1</a>.<a name=467:16></a> In <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:17">2 Peter  1:17</a>-21 we read there is given to christians a light shining in a dark place.<a name=467:17></a> This refers to the prophetic word.<a name=467:18></a> So we cannot speak of christians being in darkness, for for them the day is dawning, the darkness is passing, "the true light now shines".<a name=467:19></a> So we are not of the night, we are of the day, beloved.<a name=467:20></a> We should not be children of light if the day had not dawned; the day star has arisen, too, in our hearts (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:19">2 Peter  1:19</a>) -- the coming of the Lord -- the hope of salvation.<a name=467:21></a>
