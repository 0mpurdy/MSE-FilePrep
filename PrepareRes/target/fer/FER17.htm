		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A general desire having been expressed that another visit should be paid to the American continent, similar to that which took place in 1898, the same brethren sailed from Liverpool on 18th September, 1902, and they arrived back again on 15th November.<a name=1:1></a> During that period they visited Quebec, Rochester, Chicago, Indianapolis, Knoxville (Tennessee), Baltimore and Plainfield.<a name=1:2></a> At most of these places meetings were held for three consecutive days, consisting of readings in the morning and afternoon, and addresses in the evening.<a name=1:3></a> At several places there were many present from distant gatherings, At Chicago, where the meetings were intended chiefly for the local residents, there were readings late in the afternoon and addresses in the evening, but a great many from Chicago also went on to Indianapolis.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before sailing from New York there were two afternoon readings there with addresses in the evening.<a name=1:5></a> The character of the meetings throughout was free and happy, and many stated that they had received help and encouragement, The second visit necessarily differed in many respects from the first.<a name=1:6></a> The novelty had passed off and the actual state of things was more apparent.<a name=1:7></a> One result of this was that the ministry took more the direction of meeting the condition and needs of those present, than a simple setting forth of truth as on the last occasion, It is therefore not so easy to summarise the subjects which occupied attention, nor to refer to them in such a connected form as before, but it may be useful to direct attention to a few of the leading thoughts which were taken up in detail at several places.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two which stand out prominently, and they are
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>That it has pleased God to make Himself known to man, and to come, so to speak, within his reach, in spite of all his ignorance, his disobedience and his wickedness.<a name=1:9></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<li>That from the moment sin came into the world God has wrought in view of <i>another</i> world, which is not yet displayed, but to which faith has always looked on, and of which Christ, having accomplished redemption, is now established as the Sun and centre.<a name=2:1></a></li>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the first point it is clear that if God, who is (a) Spirit, and who dwells in unapproachable light, was to make Himself known to man, He must come near him in <i>man</i>, and therefore the Word became flesh -- the Son became incarnate -- took part in flesh and blood.<a name=2:2></a> Even so, however, He would still have remained alone -- sinless and perfect in a world of sinful men -- but as men lay under the sentence of death He Himself went down into death, and laid down the life which none could take from Him, so that rising out of it there might be set forth in Him, in resurrection, all that was in the mind and thought of God for man.<a name=2:3></a> These blessings are not, so far as the presentation of them goes, limited to any particular class of men, but are for all and every man.<a name=2:4></a> The believer is, however, the only kind of man who comes into the actual good of them.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of great importance to keep quite distinct in our minds that which in the goodness of God is presented to us as testimony, which man is responsible to receive, and the <i>work</i> of God in the souls of men by which they are brought into the good of it.<a name=2:6></a> This last has to do with the sovereignty of God, whilst the former is presented to the responsibility of man.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In considering the second point we must remember that this earth was created and made in view of man being established as head over it.<a name=2:8></a> Adam failed entirely to maintain such a position, but the purpose of God as set forth in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>will yet be made good, and the scene and time of this being displayed will be "the world (or age) to come".<a name=2:9></a> As already stated, from the moment that sin came into the scene God wrought in view of <i>that</i> world, and the faith of His saints was, in one way or other, directed towards it.<a name=2:10></a> When the suited moment had arrived He who alone was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		competent to be the Head of that world appeared (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:9">2 Timothy  1:9</a>, 10) -- a divine Person, but taking the place and condition of a Man.<a name=3:1></a> As such He tasted death for everything, and having by that death accomplished redemption, the work which brings in reconciliation, He takes His place in resurrection as the Head of every man, and as Head over all things to the church which is His body, all power being given to Him in heaven and upon earth.<a name=3:2></a> We do not <i>yet</i> see all things put under Him, but faith knows it to be true, and all that remains is to wait for the introduction in manifested power of that world, or age, which takes its character wholly from Him who is its Sun and centre.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To be in the light of the knowledge of God as He has been revealed by the Son, and of that "world to come", which, though not yet actually displayed, is established morally in Christ, is the blessed privilege of the christian today.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great help in understanding man's relationship with God to remember that sin is really "lawlessness".<a name=3:5></a> The word "sin" has lost its meaning in many minds, partly no doubt from the unfortunate error in the ordinary translation of <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:4">1 John  3:4</a>, which states it to be "transgression of the law".<a name=3:6></a> An illustration drawn from the 'solar system' helps us to understand lawlessness, and what the contrast to it actually is.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The earth and all the other planets have their appointed places in relation to the sun, and are held in attachment to it by certain fixed laws.<a name=3:8></a> Each one is maintained in its proper place and there is no disorder.<a name=3:9></a> In those rare cases in which a body seems to break loose from its place the result is destruction, as with the wandering stars of which Jude speaks.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In applying this figure to man it must be remembered that he is a moral being.<a name=3:11></a> As such he was created and placed in relationship with God, and though fallen he still owes an "account of himself to God".<a name=3:12></a> Through disobedience he broke away from this relationship and so
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		became a lawless being.<a name=4:1></a> His history ever since is one of unrighteousness.<a name=4:2></a> Each one has followed his own way, with the result that evil of every kind has developed and man is lost -- is on the way to final destruction.<a name=4:3></a> When God graciously intervened to bring in salvation, the first thing we find is a <i>Man</i> in this scene who "loved righteousness and hated lawlessness".<a name=4:4></a> This righteous One laid down His life for those who were unrighteous in order that He might bring them to God.<a name=4:5></a> He having tasted death for everything, God has given Him a place over all things and all men.<a name=4:6></a> In virtue of what He has wrought God now presents in His name forgiveness of sins to all, and to him who receives the testimony Christ gives the Spirit as "living water".<a name=4:7></a> This becomes in the believer a spring, welling up into eternal life.<a name=4:8></a> From another point of view, by receiving the Spirit the believer is 'firmly attached to Christ' <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>, New Trans.<a name=4:9></a>: note.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ being, as already stated, the Sun and centre of that new moral system where all is according to God, he who is thus attached to Christ is brought into and maintained in his true place and relation to God.<a name=4:11></a> He is now no longer lawless, but is duly subject to Christ, and practises righteousness.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such are the wonderful effects of appreciating what God has set forth as to the place which Christ now occupies, and we understand in measure the force of the statement that "grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:21">Romans  5:21</a>.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the subject of eternal life it was pointed out that whether life is looked at physically or morally it is dependent on certain conditions.<a name=4:14></a> Those conditions exist when any person is born, that is begins to live.<a name=4:15></a> They are necessary to the infant, and the life is lived <i>in</i> them.<a name=4:16></a> The moment a child is born it comes under the influence of the laws which govern all material bodies, and it requires and finds rule and air and light.<a name=4:17></a> In spiritual things there are what correspond to these, all found in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ.<a name=5:1></a> He is "eternal life", and to be really in it one must abide in Him.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to redemption it is important to remember that only the one to whom an inheritance belongs has the right to redeem it for himself, and this brings before us the great fact that God as Creator has rights over men, and that when Christ -- a divine Person -- accomplished redemption He was really (to use the figure) discharging the liabilities which encumbered His own property.<a name=5:3></a> Man may refuse to come into the benefits of what has been done, but that in no way alters the fact.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another interesting point which was brought out is, that in each of the epistles Christ is presented in some special character, and that the appreciation of this is a key in each case to the right understanding of the epistle.<a name=5:5></a> As to the gospels this has often been remarked, and it is true to a large extent as to the prophets.<a name=5:6></a> It may suffice here to say that in 1 Corinthians Christ is presented as the Wisdom and Power of God by which all that dominates man is set aside in order that all that is of God may be introduced in men, and all on the ground of resurrection.<a name=5:7></a> In 2 Corinthians He is seen as the One in whom all the promises of God are established, and in the epistle of John He is "the true God and eternal life".<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sole object of these remarks being to direct particular attention to some of the subjects dwelt upon during the meetings, it is not desirable to extend them further.<a name=5:9></a> It only remains to add that there was a strong feeling expressed that in these closing days, whilst it is most important to have an enlarged appreciation of the extent and character of God's thoughts, purposes and ways as set forth in Christ, it is also of the deepest importance to understand that it is only by the <i>individual</i> apprehension of these things in the power of the Spirit, and by being in the condition morally suited thereto, that there can be any real answer in us to what God has been pleased to unfold to us.<a name=5:10></a> There is little or no trace of anything formal or ecclesiastical in the early days of the church -- everything

	<div class="paragraph">
		was set up and carried on in the power of the Spirit.<a name=6:1></a> If this was the case, then it must surely be necessary now, when everything external is in ruin, and so we may justly appropriate the exhortation to Timothy, "Take heed unto <i>thyself</i> and unto the doctrine".<a name=6:2></a><p>J.<a name=6:3></a>S.<a name=6:4></a>A.<a name=6:5></a>

		READINGS ON THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (1)

		<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:1">John  3:1</a> - 21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:1></a> Could you say in a few words what the subject of this gospel is?<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=7:3></a>R.<a name=7:4></a> I think the point in it is the presentation of Christ according to what Christ is.<a name=7:5></a> It differs in that way from the other gospels, because they present Christ more or less officially, while John presents Christ according to what Christ is.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:7></a> What He is in His own Person?<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=7:9></a>R.<a name=7:10></a> Yes, personally; therefore I look upon John as being in a sense the backbone of all the gospels.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:12></a> It is not Christ in relation to anything that existed previously?<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=7:14></a>R.<a name=7:15></a> I think not.<a name=7:16></a> In Matthew's gospel Israel is taken up in Christ.<a name=7:17></a> In Luke's gospel man is taken up in Christ, and in Mark the prophetic word is taken up.<a name=7:18></a> But John's gospel is different.<a name=7:19></a> It presents Christ as the Son of God.<a name=7:20></a> It is in fact the revelation of God.<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=7:22></a>A.<a name=7:23></a> I suppose the result of that as affecting man is that there must be a new kind of man or being to say to Him?<a name=7:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=7:25></a>R.<a name=7:26></a> The Son of God is the starting point.<a name=7:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=7:28></a> I suppose that is brought out in the preaching of the apostle, God "was pleased to reveal his Son in me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>.<a name=7:29></a>
	</div>

		F.E.<a name=8:2></a>R.<a name=8:3></a> The Son of man lifted up is really the testimony of God.<a name=8:4></a> It is God coming out in love -- the Son of man lifted up is the point of attraction.<a name=8:5></a> "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=8:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=8:12></a>R.<a name=8:13></a> That is incidental in it; the point is the testimony itself.<a name=8:14></a> The death of Christ is the great testimony of divine love.<a name=8:15></a> The Son of man must be lifted up, for God so loved the world.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is God coming out in love to take up the liabilities under which man was, hence the Son of God must needs become incarnate, so that all that lay upon man might be taken up in a Man, but it was the testimony of divine love.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=8:18></a> So the removal of man was incidental.<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=8:20></a>R.<a name=8:21></a> The point is what was behind it on the part of God, and that was the love of God.<a name=8:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=8:23></a> When it is a question of the Son of man being lifted up, that does not bring in divinity; is not that in the Son of God more?<a name=8:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=8:25></a>R.<a name=8:26></a> He must be lifted up as Son of man.<a name=8:27></a> It is only thus He could be lifted up.<a name=8:28></a> He must assume that condition to be lifted up, but the point is that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.<a name=8:29></a> The Son of man is the only begotten Son of God who must be incarnate to be lifted up.<a name=8:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		F.E.<a name=9:11></a>R.<a name=9:12></a> Exactly; that leads you to what lies behind Scripture.<a name=9:13></a> The Scriptures are inspired and give us the account of the revelation and how the revelation has been received, and the responsibility connected with the revelation, but the revelation itself is behind it all.<a name=9:14></a>

		R.S.<a name=9:30></a>S.<a name=9:31></a> We have been in the habit of saying that in Old Testament times God was partially revealed and made known.<a name=9:32></a> For instance, in the way He spoke to Moses, "by my name Jehovah was I not known".<a name=9:33></a> Would you not speak of that as revelation?<a name=9:34></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=26:3></a>R.<a name=26:4></a> I think so.<a name=26:5></a> It is in one sense a pity that the gospel is divided into chapters; it is more a series of subjects.<a name=26:6></a>

		R.S.<a name=26:7></a>S.<a name=26:8></a> Would you give us a little idea of those subjects?<a name=26:9></a>

		F.E.<a name=26:10></a>R.<a name=26:11></a> The first two chapters are the confirmation of everything, on the ground of resurrection, to the Jew.<a name=26:12></a> Then in the third and fourth chapters the Jew is done with in a sense, for the time being, and it is the world that is in view.<a name=26:13></a> In the third chapter it contemplates man in darkness and in the fourth chapter in thirst.<a name=26:14></a> The two moral conditions in which the world was are darkness and thirst.<a name=26:15></a> Then we see the way in which God has come in to meet these conditions.<a name=26:16></a> The third chapter brings in light, and the fourth living water -- the light to dissipate the darkness, and the living water to meet thirst.<a name=26:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=26:18></a>S.<a name=26:19></a> Is the love of God the light?<a name=26:20></a>

		F.E.<a name=26:21></a>R.<a name=26:22></a> Yes, the testimony of God's love in the death of Christ.<a name=26:23></a> Christ is the light and the light has come into darkness.<a name=26:24></a> Then in the fourth chapter Christ gives living water.<a name=26:25></a> You may depend upon it where darkness is there is thirst.<a name=26:26></a> On the other hand where light is there is satisfaction.<a name=26:27></a> We know it in natural things.<a name=26:28></a> People in darkness do not know where they are going; they are not content or easy -- but when you come into light you get a kind of satisfaction.<a name=26:29></a>

		F.E.<a name=26:32></a>R.<a name=26:33></a> Of course God gave them glimpses of light.<a name=26:34></a> He sustained them with hopes and expectations, but what has come in now is that the darkness is passing and the true

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=27:6></a>S.<a name=27:7></a> He referred to the Spirit when He said that, but in what way?<a name=27:8></a>

		F.E.<a name=27:9></a>R.<a name=27:10></a> As an energy in the believer, like a well of water, so that you may understand your relation to Christ.<a name=27:11></a> The Spirit brings you into attachment, then you understand by the Spirit, what Christ is to you, for Christ is eternal life.<a name=27:12></a> It never could be said we have that in us; Christ is eternal life and the Spirit springs up in us so that we appreciate what Christ is to us.<a name=27:13></a> It is thus we come into eternal life.<a name=27:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=27:15></a>P.<a name=27:16></a> "Springing up into eternal life".<a name=27:17></a> Is that the understanding of eternal life now?<a name=27:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=27:19></a>R.<a name=27:20></a> I think it is the understanding and appreciation of the conditions which God has established in Christ.<a name=27:21></a> In Christ God has established conditions in which it is possible for man to live morally.<a name=27:22></a> That is what we can see, and the Spirit is a well of water in the believer that, springing up, brings you into the understanding and appreciation of those conditions.<a name=27:23></a> No one ever had everlasting life except by an indwelling Spirit, that is the Spring in us.<a name=27:24></a> Paul's testimony was in principle just the same, "he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting".<a name=27:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=28:5></a>R.<a name=28:6></a> The conditions are illustrated by what is essential in natural life.<a name=28:7></a> The first is rule, the second is atmosphere and the third is light.<a name=28:8></a> These are essential to life morally, as naturally.<a name=28:9></a>

		F.E.<a name=28:12></a>R.<a name=28:13></a> I think so.<a name=28:14></a> The gospel brings out more the kind of person who has it, the epistle what he has.<a name=28:15></a>

		F.E.<a name=28:18></a>R.<a name=28:19></a> It is the effect of attachment.<a name=28:20></a> Whatever is brought into attachment comes under rule as whatever is attached to the sun comes under the rule of the sun.<a name=28:21></a> So it is regarding believers.<a name=28:22></a> As the apostle says, "not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ".<a name=28:23></a> Every inch of His body was subject to rule, just as every inch of our natural body is subject to rule.<a name=28:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=29:9></a> The contrast would be, "she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:6">1 Timothy  5:6</a>.<a name=29:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I may call the first great lesson of the many that we have to learn as christians is that of the righteousness and faithfulness of God.<a name=44:1></a> Around us in the world there is everything to call this in question.<a name=44:2></a> So you can easily understand how important it is.<a name=44:3></a> Then there is another point connected with it; it must be the moral foundation in our souls.<a name=44:4></a> If you have not some sense of the righteousness and faithfulness of God, you have not a God on whom you can rely.<a name=44:5></a> Reliance and confidence on God are all founded on that.<a name=44:6></a> There may be but a poor sense, but any sense of the righteousness and faithfulness of God is a wonderful stay.<a name=44:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I said, the knowledge of the righteousness and faithfulness of God is really the foundation in the soul of every believer.<a name=44:8></a> In the most elementary of Paul's epistles, the epistle to the Romans, the great point is that Christ has come out and accomplished redemption in witness of the righteousness and faithfulness of God.<a name=44:9></a> That is the subject of the epistle.<a name=44:10></a> Jesus is set forth as a mercy-seat to declare God's righteousness, that is, in redemption.<a name=44:11></a> God has declared His righteousness in regard of all men in grace.<a name=44:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law in a sense witnessed the righteousness of God, but in the way of demand, and rightly so, too, because God had rights, but it was no good to man, because man could not answer to the demand, but in redemption God sets forth His right in grace, for redemption is His right, and that in grace, so that He might be able to communicate His Spirit to the believer.<a name=44:13></a> That is the difference between the law and the gospel, but in either case there is the witness of God's righteousness.<a name=44:14></a> The apostle speaks of the righteousness of God being witnessed by the law and the prophets, but it has been declared in redemption.<a name=44:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=45>[Page 45]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Redemption meant God taking up man's liabilities so that He might impart to the believer the gift of the Spirit.<a name=45:1></a> That is the first part of the epistle to the Romans; but there is another part, and that is the declaration of the faithfulness of God, for the position of the Jew, as scattered over the face of the earth, and not having come into the fulfilment of the promises, has called in question the faithfulness of God.<a name=45:2></a> That point is taken up in the latter part of the Romans, and the faithfulness of God is vindicated in Christ just as in the first part the righteousness of God is vindicated in His present dealings in grace.<a name=45:3></a> So although the gentiles have a place for the moment in the olive tree, yet if they continue not in the goodness of God they will be broken off, and the Jews will be grafted into their olive tree.<a name=45:4></a> All will prove and experience the mercy of God.<a name=45:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have referred to that because it is the subject of the most elementary treatise to believers.<a name=45:6></a> God will do right, and nothing but right, and God is faithful after all.<a name=45:7></a> It is a great thing for us all to apprehend.<a name=45:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can truly know anything about the love or the holiness of God until they have come to a sense of the righteousness and faithfulness of God.<a name=45:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you get the same principles brought out in the gospel of Luke.<a name=45:10></a> We might sing this song of Zacharias, the application of which is undoubtedly to Israel.<a name=45:11></a> It does not go beyond Israel, and outwardly and nationally what is spoken of in the song has never yet been fulfilled.<a name=45:12></a> John the baptist was born as a witness of it.<a name=45:13></a> He was to be the forerunner, "And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins".<a name=45:14></a> The song is prophetic.<a name=45:15></a> Zacharias spoke by the Holy Spirit, making known nothing new; but confirming what God had previously declared of His thought with regard to His people Israel.<a name=45:16></a> But though outwardly the song has never been fulfilled, I am going to show you it has been fulfilled

		in principle.<a name=46:1></a> And it has been fulfilled in such a way as that the gentile should be brought into it.<a name=46:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now referring again to what I was speaking of, that is, righteousness and faithfulness of God, it is remarkable that it is what the Lord in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>takes up continually.<a name=46:3></a> He says, I have declared Thy righteousness and faithfulness.<a name=46:4></a> This was in His ministry down here.<a name=46:5></a> And now both are witnessed in Christ on high, for on the one hand He is the expression of God's righteousness, and at the same time He is the Deliverer who is to come out of Zion to turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<a name=46:6></a> All the hopes of Israel are bound up with Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=46:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great thoughts in this song, salvation and light.<a name=46:8></a> It is with these I want to take up your thoughts.<a name=46:9></a> They were in the mind of God for His people.<a name=46:10></a> Notice verses 69 to 72, and 74 and 79.<a name=46:11></a> It is remarkable that though Zacharias was the father of John, and what was celebrated was the birth of John (the Lord was not yet born), yet Zacharias said but few words about John.<a name=46:12></a> You will find a great deal about Christ.<a name=46:13></a> John was not the horn of salvation; Christ was that.<a name=46:14></a> John was not of the house of David; Christ was of the house of David.<a name=46:15></a> Then the day-spring from on high to give light to them that sit in darkness was not John but Christ.<a name=46:16></a> John had his own place as the friend of the Bridegroom, "thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways", but the whole song is a prophetic celebration, by the Spirit of God, of Christ -- He was the horn of salvation and the light; that is, the dayspring from on high to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.<a name=46:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to revert to the thought of salvation and light, the two blessings which God proposes for His people.<a name=46:18></a> Evidently it is a great thing for people to get light.<a name=46:19></a> Nothing could be greater, and salvation is equally important.<a name=46:20></a> It contemplates this, that the natural man is in darkness and

		Now, I want to point out that the thoughts of God are enlarged.<a name=50:1></a> These same thoughts that have come before us must go out to the gentiles.<a name=50:2></a> I would refer again to the verses in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:44">Luke  24:44</a> - 48, also to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:46">Acts  13:46</a> - 48.<a name=50:3></a> In the latter passage the apostle says it was necessary that "the word of God should first have been spoken to you".<a name=50:4></a> The word of God had not exclusive reference to the Jews; it was only necessary that in the faithfulness of God it should first have been spoken to them, but the word of God contemplated things beyond the Jew, and when they refused it it was spoken to the gentiles.<a name=50:5></a> God did not propose something different to the gentiles.<a name=50:6></a> He only waited until the Jew rejected it, then He showed that the word of God had as much reference to the gentile as to the Jew.<a name=50:7></a> I have spoken of the faithfulness of God, and how what was spoken of in the song of Zacharias was made good in a remnant, but now I come to the righteousness of God, and in the righteousness of God He must go out to the gentiles, "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=50:8></a> "Thus it behoved" is an expression which indicates the righteousness of God, and therefore Christ had to die and to rise from the dead the third day.<a name=50:9></a>

		I understand the passage to refer to redemption, and redemption is not a question merely of the grace of God, but of the righteousness of God.<a name=50:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>, where the point is redemption, the Spirit of God is declaring the righteousness of God.<a name=50:11></a> He says, God hath set forth Jesus "to be a propitiation though faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness".<a name=50:12></a> He does not say the grace of God, though the word '<i>grace</i>' might be put where righteousness is.<a name=50:13></a> But the point is to declare His right, and grace is God's right.<a name=50:14></a> God's righteousness simply means what is right, and grace, through redemption, is that which is morally right.<a name=50:15></a> I have illustrated it in this way: if I had an inheritance and it was encumbered by mortgage, if I
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=51>[Page 51]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		could discharge the encumbrance I would be right in doing so, and nobody else in the world could do it; that is, only the person to whom the inheritance belongs has the right of redemption.<a name=51:1></a> Now, supposing that men were the inheritance of God, because God created them; they had come under mortgage; that is, they were under liabilities by the judgment of God.<a name=51:2></a> Well, God alone had the right of redemption.<a name=51:3></a> No other had; man had no right whatever to redeem himself, nor could anyone have redeemed man, for nobody had any right to man except God.<a name=51:4></a> God saw fit to take up the liabilities, to discharge the mortgage; redemption is the exercise of a right that properly belonged to God.<a name=51:5></a> Therefore it is the declaration of His righteousness.<a name=51:6></a> I believe this is the principle on which the grace of God has gone out universally to men.<a name=51:7></a> You must remember that although Israel belonged to Jehovah, yet after all, all men belonged to God; God was not only Jehovah to Israel, but He was Creator of all men.<a name=51:8></a> Therefore, the Lord Jesus says "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=51:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Therefore, you get in this gospel the two principles which are of so much importance with regard to our knowledge of God, that is, the faithfulness and the righteousness of God, in which God has taken up His right of redemption in respect of all men.<a name=51:10></a> Therefore, the testimony of the grace of God has gone out to all men, and yet, even here, the faithfulness of God is seen.<a name=51:11></a> It was not until the Jew had put the word of God from him that the word went to the gentiles, and then the testimony is, "I have set thee to be a light of the gentiles".<a name=51:12></a> The dayspring from on high had visited the gentiles and salvation, that is, by the horn of salvation, had gone out to the ends of the earth.<a name=51:13></a> What God had proposed in His faithfulness to Israel, now went out world-wide to all men.<a name=51:14></a> Now Christ is a light to the gentiles and God's salvation to the ends of the earth.<a name=51:15></a> Christ stands in that way in relation to the gentiles.<a name=51:16></a>

		There are very few that apprehend this, but it is a great moment when people do apprehend it.<a name=52:1></a> If you look into the heart of God, what wonderful things you find there.<a name=52:2></a> God's heart has been laid bare to us, and you find there nothing but love.<a name=52:3></a> You know that the source and spring of everything which God does is love.<a name=52:4></a> Even judgment, strange as it may seem to say it, is of love, and I will tell you why, because it is not according to love to allow lawlessness.<a name=52:5></a> Therefore, love will put down lawlessness in judgment for the blessing of the universe.<a name=52:6></a> God is love.<a name=52:7></a> That is a most absolute statement, and we are permitted to look into the heart of God so that we might know what is in that heart in regard of man.<a name=52:8></a>

		I admit that in that heart there are counsels of wisdom, but they are devised by love.<a name=52:9></a> It is a wonderful thing to be in the light of love; to be able to say like the apostle John in chapter 4 of his epistle, "we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=52:10></a> God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him".<a name=52:11></a> That is light, and on the other hand, we have salvation.<a name=52:12></a> We are no longer in fear of enemies.<a name=52:13></a> Are you?<a name=52:14></a> It is a poor thing if you are; if you have the Spirit of God it is that you might not fear enemies.<a name=52:15></a> Are you afraid of death?<a name=52:16></a> Christ has opened a way through death, just as Moses opened a way through the Red Sea to Israel.<a name=52:17></a> We have passed out of death into life in a sense already; are risen together with Christ.<a name=52:18></a> Are you afraid of man?<a name=52:19></a> The apostle Paul was not afraid of man.<a name=52:20></a> He had to stand before the emperor, the greatest dignitary upon earth, but it gave him opportunity for the testimony.<a name=52:21></a> Are you afraid of Satan?<a name=52:22></a> You have only to be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, and you need not be afraid of Satan for a moment.<a name=52:23></a> The truth is, salvation is in Christ, a horn of salvation has been raised up that we might be free from the fear of our enemies.<a name=52:24></a> There are those that hate us, but we are delivered from their power that we might serve God without fear in holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.<a name=52:25></a>

		As an illustration of it, I will ask your attention to <a href="../bible/John.htm#9:34">John  9:34</a> - 39.<a name=100:8></a> You see the Lord had virtually left the world.<a name=100:9></a> In the previous chapter He had passed out of the midst of the Jews.<a name=100:10></a> He had not yet died, but He had left the world in spirit.<a name=100:11></a> Well, He had given sight to the blind man, and the blind man had found out the hollowness of the world.<a name=100:12></a> I cannot say he had quite judged it all, but he had found its hollowness and had been cast out.<a name=100:13></a> He had simply attributed the fact of his having sight to the work of Jesus.<a name=100:14></a> Then the Lord finds him and brings him to the point of confession that he believes in the Son of God.<a name=100:15></a> Then it was, I take it, that he overcame the world.<a name=100:16></a> I have no doubt when he was first cast out that he was miserable enough, for he was alone, but it was another thing when Jesus found him, then he believes on the Son of God and does Him homage.<a name=100:17></a> He could not perhaps go so far as to say, "the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me", but he could have said the Son of God who has opened my eyes.<a name=100:18></a> It is an illustration, in that sense, of one who had overcome the world.<a name=100:19></a> You have to take into account that the Son of God has now no part in the course of things down here.<a name=100:20></a> The Son of God is at the right hand of God, and we walk by the faith of Him, and what we believe governs us in our course and conduct down here.<a name=100:21></a> In human things a wife does right when she

		Now I want to go on to another point, that for which I read a passage in this same epistle, that is, "faith which worketh by love", (chapter 5: 6).<a name=101:7></a> When saints get away from the influence of the love of Christ, they soon get to biting and devouring one another.<a name=101:8></a> They do not give up outward proprieties; the tendency of the Galatians was to go back to circumcision and law.<a name=101:9></a> No doubt regard to circumcision and law would bring about a good deal of outward propriety, but, as regards one another, love was not there.<a name=101:10></a> Depend upon it, where people are legal the tendency is to bite and devour one another.<a name=101:11></a> That is where the Galatians had got to.<a name=101:12></a> People begin to stand on their rights, and that is always a dangerous thing.<a name=101:13></a> It is only one step from biting and devouring one another.<a name=101:14></a> In contrast to that the apostle says, "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love".<a name=101:15></a> That is the point I desire to touch on.<a name=101:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not know much about circumcision or uncircumcision, but in their place we get orthodoxy and heterodoxy and there is no power in one or the other.<a name=101:17></a> Circumcision was better than uncircumcision because it was ordered of God.<a name=101:18></a> So good doctrine may be better than heterodoxy, but neither in orthodoxy nor heterodoxy is there power.<a name=101:19></a> The correct man, like the Pharisee, has a good deal of credit attaching to him, but there is no more power in it than in heterodoxy.<a name=101:20></a> The divine principle is faith that worketh by love; that is a most important principle.<a name=101:21></a> We cannot talk much about faith if there is not love.<a name=101:22></a> When

		Just to give you an illustration of that, I will call your attention to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:38">Luke  10:38</a> - 42 and <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:1">John  12:1</a> - 7.<a name=102:2></a> 1 refer to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>because that is the first allusion we have to Mary of Bethany and the attitude of Mary was that of sitting at Jesus' feet and hearing His word.<a name=102:3></a> That is, in other words, she was under the influence of the Son of God.<a name=102:4></a> The Lord commended her.<a name=102:5></a> Martha found fault with her, because she was herself occupied with serving.<a name=102:6></a> She was legal and where people are legal they are fussy and active.<a name=102:7></a> That is generally an evidence of legality.<a name=102:8></a> It was not but what she believed in Christ just as really as Mary, but she had not come under the influence of the Son of God and Mary had.<a name=102:9></a> That is seen in her sitting at the feet of Jesus.<a name=102:10></a> It is blessed to sit at Jesus' feet because you come under His influence.<a name=102:11></a> When a little child sits at the feet of its mother, and hears her word, he not only hears what the mother has to say, but comes under the mother's influence.<a name=102:12></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>faith is seen operative in Mary by love, that is, that Mary would devote the most precious thing that she had, to distinguish the Lord; she thus made evident her faith.<a name=102:13></a> It was operative by love.<a name=102:14></a> She would anoint the Lord for His burial.<a name=102:15></a> What she had before her mind in connection with Christ was His burial.<a name=102:16></a> There may have been faith as to His resurrection, but the Lord's interpretation was that she anointed Him for His burial.<a name=102:17></a> It was an act of devoted affection on her part.<a name=102:18></a> The disciples blamed her for it; they thought it waste.<a name=102:19></a> They were poor judges.<a name=102:20></a> I have seen this in life -- if faith is operative in you, people of the world will blame you.<a name=102:21></a> They will think you are losing opportunities.<a name=102:22></a> You must be prepared for that.<a name=102:23></a> When faith works by love it will break through the laws of human prudence, but human prudence is not very far off from covetousness.<a name=102:24></a> Christ was life to Mary and she sought to distinguish her life.<a name=102:25></a> Every

		If you will turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:15">John  21:15</a> - 19, we can carry the thought on there in regard of Peter; he had faith, but there was a passage in his life when his faith was certainly not operative by love.<a name=103:11></a> Another thing came in; Peter, being a rather rash man, entered into temptation.<a name=103:12></a> The Lord had taught the disciples to pray that they should not enter into temptation, but Peter ran into temptation.<a name=103:13></a> He did what a great many of us have done sometimes.<a name=103:14></a> He got into a position for which he had no faith, which is always a mistake, for you are bound to fail.<a name=103:15></a> People may extend to you the courtesies of the world, and you may go into worldly company, having no faith for it; and it will not be for your credit or honour.<a name=103:16></a> You do not want to get into a position for which you have no faith.<a name=103:17></a> Peter did and the fear of man came in and led to the denial of the Lord.<a name=103:18></a> He denied the Lord three times, and that is why possibly the Lord challenged him three times.<a name=103:19></a> But faith in Christ was there.<a name=103:20></a> We have good evidence of it, because the Lord said, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not".<a name=103:21></a> There was the terrible breakdown, but instead of Peter going out and giving up in despair, he wept bitterly and Peter was in result restored.<a name=103:22></a> But now the Lord was about to leave the earth and the faith of Peter was to become operative by love.<a name=103:23></a> How could it go out?<a name=103:24></a> Now the Lord gives direction to it.<a name=103:25></a> He challenges Peter three times and the point of all was this, that his

		I speak first in regard of the opening of the eyes of the blind man.<a name=124:11></a> It was not an uncommon miracle with the Lord.<a name=124:12></a> It has been said that there was an idea among the Jews that opening the eyes of the blind was a miracle reserved for Messiah.<a name=124:13></a> I do not think you will find any case in the Old Testament of the eyes of a blind man being opened.<a name=124:14></a> I would not lay much stress upon that, but as a matter of fact, we know that was one of the particular things which the Lord did.<a name=124:15></a> He did it literally, but He did it morally too.<a name=124:16></a> In the case in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>it was not only that the man's eyes were opened literally, but the eyes of his mind were opened.<a name=124:17></a> What came to pass was analogous to what we get here, Jesus revealed Himself to him as Son of God, and he worshipped Him.<a name=124:18></a> That was the end of it.<a name=124:19></a> In other words, the man recognised Jesus in that way and did Him homage.<a name=124:20></a> I think that was really the work of Christ, for the Lord evidently did not attach much importance

		to the miracles He did except in so far as they were witnesses to who He was and whence He came.<a name=125:1></a> The Lord did not attach importance to faith which rested simply on miracles, "many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.<a name=125:2></a> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men".<a name=125:3></a> The point was this, that a link between God and man should be formed by the word of God, not by miracles.<a name=125:4></a> People might be struck with wonder at miracles, and forget all about them, and therefore they were not any real link between man and Christ.<a name=125:5></a> Those who have a real link are those that hear the word of God and do it.<a name=125:6></a> Nothing ever proved how completely blind man was, like the coming of Christ into the world.<a name=125:7></a> If a man is short-sighted and you draw his attention to some object in the distance, he may not see it, but that man sees the sun.<a name=125:8></a> If a man does not see the sun you have proof that he is blind, and that was the case when Christ was here.<a name=125:9></a> The proof of the condition of man spiritually was the coming of Christ into the world, "I am come a light into the world".<a name=125:10></a> One might almost render it, 'a luminary', and the light was not apprehended of men.<a name=125:11></a> "The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not".<a name=125:12></a> The Jews at the first had a certain regard to Christ on account of what He did and said.<a name=125:13></a> It could not be denied.<a name=125:14></a> Even their messengers had to say, "Never man spake like this man".<a name=125:15></a> Man ought to have seen in Christ, and did see in a kind of way, though he would not acknowledge it, that God was presented in Him.<a name=125:16></a> He was the Light; He declared God.<a name=125:17></a> No one had seen God at any time, the "only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=125:18></a> He did not speak from Himself.<a name=125:19></a> Whatever He said or did had its source in the Father.<a name=125:20></a> He did the Father's will and spoke the Father's mind.<a name=125:21></a> There was something totally different in Christ to anything that had been seen or heard before.<a name=125:22></a> He declared God.<a name=125:23></a> Every word He spoke told of God.<a name=125:24></a> The Lord could speak of things He knew and of what He had seen.<a name=125:25></a> No prophet could ever have spoken in that way.<a name=125:26></a> A

		Now the great mass of people were quite blind.<a name=127:3></a> They did not discern the light; they did not care about God.<a name=127:4></a> People in the present day, too, think a great deal more about the almighty dollar than about God.<a name=127:5></a> They do not care much for goodness or grace or righteousness or love or holiness.<a name=127:6></a> I never came across a man who naturally cared to hear about holiness and righteousness, what is morally perfect.<a name=127:7></a> That is too severe for people.<a name=127:8></a> They are content to accept things as they are.<a name=127:9></a> They are much like the people of Gadara, more content to have the man with the legion of devils than to have Christ who cast out the devils.<a name=127:10></a> Whatever may be the evils of the world, and people admit them -- man would rather have the world as it is, and the devils, than have Christ here who would talk to them about the love and the holiness and the righteousness and the faithfulness of God.<a name=127:11></a> People take no account of these things, and yet any sober person must admit that they are right.<a name=127:12></a> Surely there are such things as holiness and righteousness and truth, all have come to light in the revelation of God.<a name=127:13></a> In Christ that revelation was there.<a name=127:14></a>

		But there was another thing that should have been apprehended in Christ, that was, He was a Man pre-eminent above all other men.<a name=127:15></a> This came out at the birth of the Lord, in the acclamation of the heavenly host; then again, at the baptism of the Lord the Spirit of God descended upon Him; then on the mount of transfiguration the voice came from heaven; it was evidenced repeatedly that He was not like any other man.<a name=127:16></a> He was the anointed Man and pre-eminent; the first, and qualified in that way to be intelligence for man down here.<a name=127:17></a> He was on the one hand the revelation of God, bringing home to man what the disposition of God was toward man, but by the very fact of that, He was the one Man, and the only One who was competent to be intelligence for man.<a name=127:18></a> The apostles found that out.<a name=127:19></a> If I may use the expression, they gave up their own heads and trusted Christ, and they were right.<a name=127:20></a>

		As a matter of fact, very few eyes were opened.<a name=128:6></a> There is a remarkable expression in regard of the Lord in the prophet Isaiah, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain", and yet there was result, so that the Lord Jesus could say, "Behold, I and the children which God hath given me", but the mass of people who came in contact with the Lord were manifestly blind.<a name=128:7></a> They did not see God when God was there, in the divinely-appointed Man who alone was qualified to be wisdom for man.<a name=128:8></a> He is made wisdom to us, that is, intelligence.<a name=128:9></a> He alone could lead men through the perplexities of this world of moral confusion, where there is no way.<a name=128:10></a>

		Christ is no longer here, but sitting at the right hand of God -- and when He moves from the right hand of God it will be in the execution of judgment for the age to come.<a name=129:1></a> But at the present time there is such a thing as following Christ, and if you do not follow Christ it is not a good sign.<a name=129:2></a> If I were not following Christ I would be settling down content with the present order of things in this world.<a name=129:3></a> If you follow Christ you are always in movement, for the Lord is in movement, not in actual physical movement, but He walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks, and ever will be in movement until He brings about the result which God intends.<a name=129:4></a> You remember the word in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart".<a name=129:5></a> Until Christ has accomplished the will of God and has made righteousness to be the law of the moral universe, there will be no cessation in the activity of Christ; and I think it is an immense point to follow the activities of Christ.<a name=129:6></a> If we trace the history of christianity we can see all along the line the activities of Christ, and we can discern those activities by the Spirit at the present time; it is a great thing to be aroused out of quiescence and satisfaction with the course of things down here to feel the activities of Christ, and to have our minds set on the result that Christ will bring about for the glory of God, "looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life".<a name=129:7></a> Jesus alone glorified God and you will only glorify God by following Jesus; there is a way of acting as He acts, and it is for us to follow Him in that way of activity, and to have clearly and definitely as the standard before our minds the great result which Christ intends to bring about for the glory of God.<a name=129:8></a> It is all-important to us to see that everything is to be headed up in Christ for God's glory.<a name=129:9></a>

		Now, if we have reached the second step and are following Jesus, we shall find Jesus the satisfaction of our hearts.<a name=129:10></a> Look again at the case of Zacchaeus.<a name=129:11></a> The people said, "He is gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner".<a name=129:12></a> They only thought of Zacchaeus as a lawless man, but they

		but specially in Paul.<a name=170:1></a> The apostle Paul speaks of himself in that way as one to whom the ministry of reconciliation had been entrusted.<a name=170:2></a> He says, "and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation".<a name=170:3></a> Then he goes on to say how he besought men to be reconciled unto God.<a name=170:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to give you an idea of what reconciliation means.<a name=170:5></a> Evidently reconciliation is for God; man comes into it, so does everything, for everything in the universe has been dislocated by sin.<a name=170:6></a> Sin has had its effect not only on things on earth but on things in heaven, so that things on earth and things in heaven have to be reconciled.<a name=170:7></a> Confusion and alienation have been brought in by lawlessness, and hence all things are to be reconciled.<a name=170:8></a> Reconciliation means this, that where distance was, there should be complacency.<a name=170:9></a> I do not think anything short of that gives the idea of reconciliation.<a name=170:10></a> We have an illustration of it in the case of the prodigal.<a name=170:11></a> There had been distance, but there was complacency.<a name=170:12></a> He had on the best robe and the ring and the shoes and it is the father who says, "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad".<a name=170:13></a> "Make merry and be glad", are the marks of complacency, but the point is it was where there had been distance, and I have no doubt that is the principle of reconciliation.<a name=170:14></a> It will go on to all things.<a name=170:15></a> Wherever there has been moral distance there will be complacency.<a name=170:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ is the One in whom all this is accomplished.<a name=170:17></a> All was dependent on the Son of God becoming man, hence we read, "that God was in Christ".<a name=170:18></a> The thought and purpose of God was that everything was to be taken up in Christ, and hence everything was regarded as on a different footing the moment Christ came in.<a name=170:19></a> God was presenting Himself in an entirely different attitude in regard to man.<a name=170:20></a> "Reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses".<a name=170:21></a> The secret was that the point of reconciliation was there, Christ was regarded from

		heaven as the point of complacency.<a name=171:1></a> You see that over and over again in the gospels: at His birth, at His baptism, on the mount of transfiguration, again in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>.<a name=171:2></a> He was God's beloved Son in whom God was well pleased, He was the point of complacency.<a name=171:3></a> Hence He was the reconciliation.<a name=171:4></a> But then there was another thing, and that was by redemption to remove the distance caused by sin, so that there should be both the distance removed, and a point of reconciliation.<a name=171:5></a> That is what has now come to pass, and reconciliation entirely depends upon everything being brought into subjection to Christ; what subsists in Christ is divine complacency in man, the distance removed in the work which Christ accomplished.<a name=171:6></a> The prodigal was in a far country, in the place of distance.<a name=171:7></a> Christ entered into the distance, but He entered into it according to the righteousness of God to remove it.<a name=171:8></a> He was forsaken of God, had real experience of the distance such as no other ever will have; but we read, He "was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=171:9></a> All things are to be reconciled by being brought into accord with Christ.<a name=171:10></a> That is the divine thought, and it is that which Christ will most surely effect, as He has the power to subdue all things unto Himself.<a name=171:11></a> Many are now brought, and many will yet be brought into accord with Christ.<a name=171:12></a> Israel and the nations will in a sense be subject.<a name=171:13></a> God's Spirit will be poured out on all flesh, all will be brought into accord with Christ, and in that way all things reconciled.<a name=171:14></a> Whether you understand me, or not, I have stated what is of immense importance, that in spite of all that we see in the world, confusion and moral evil, God is carrying out His blessed purpose, and in spite of what men may think or believe the point of reconciliation is there, and, for God, the distance and alienation have been removed in the death of Christ.<a name=171:15></a> It is said, "he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=171:16></a> Everything has to be reconciled in Him.<a name=171:17></a> There is terrific self-assertion at the present time on the part of man, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will indicate the way by which reconciliation is reached in regard to us.<a name=172:4></a> I do not need to speak about "all things", because all things, except as a matter of interest, do not concern us immediately.<a name=172:5></a> I think you will see it in the three parables I read.<a name=172:6></a> They are a group of parables quite peculiar to the gospel of Luke.<a name=172:7></a> You will not find any one of them in any other gospel.<a name=172:8></a> They accord with the spirit and character of that particular gospel.<a name=172:9></a> In that gospel you get the great idea that "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them".<a name=172:10></a> The first point in it is the attitude of God toward all men.<a name=172:11></a> I believe that to be a matter of the last importance.<a name=172:12></a> It is brought out in the parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, "There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.<a name=172:13></a> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both".<a name=172:14></a> There are certain things on the part of God which are provisional, and it is by these things man is being tested.<a name=172:15></a> When God brings final things to pass testing will all be over.<a name=172:16></a> And the attitude of God in regard to the world is in a sense provisional.<a name=172:17></a> God is giving opportunity, and the mind of God toward man universally is forgiveness of sins.<a name=172:18></a> When the Lord Jesus was here God was not imputing trespasses.<a name=172:19></a> The Lord said to a woman, when she was manifestly sinful, "neither do I condemn thee".<a name=172:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the ministry of the apostles was a continuation of that, or rather an advance upon it.<a name=172:21></a> They made known to men that forgiveness of sins was in the mind of God, in regard to all men.<a name=172:22></a> That is what marks this moment, and is really made known to us in the parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=172:23></a> "When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them

		both".<a name=173:1></a> Many may be indifferent to the mind of God, blind in regard to it, and they do not get the good of it, just as a blind man does not get the light of the sun, but none the less the mind of God at the present moment in regard of all men is forgiveness of sins.<a name=173:2></a> I admit it to be provisional, not final, men are being tested by the truth at the present moment.<a name=173:3></a> The question is, will men accept Christ as Head?<a name=173:4></a> If they do, they get forgiveness of sins.<a name=173:5></a> The first principle of reconciliation is that the attitude of God toward man without distinction is forgiveness of sins.<a name=173:6></a> The glad tidings are preached to every creature under heaven, the glad tidings are of a risen Christ, in whose name is preached repentance and forgiveness of sins.<a name=173:7></a> That is where faith comes in on the part of man.<a name=173:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I mean is, that man's faith apprehends the attitude of God made known in testimony.<a name=173:9></a> It is set forth in the power of the Holy Spirit, and the faith of man apprehends it, and the history of a soul with God begins when that soul apprehends the attitude of God.<a name=173:10></a> Men do not know it naturally, that is certain, they think of God in some different way.<a name=173:11></a>

		kingdom".<a name=175:1></a> I think the apostle had the satisfaction of knowing, not simply that Christ had bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, not simply that he was carried along by the power of Christ, but that the Lord took care of him, that He would deliver him from every evil work, would not commit him to the power of his enemies, but would preserve him to His heavenly kingdom.<a name=175:2></a> You can understand what kind of appreciation the apostle had of Christ.<a name=175:3></a> He recognised the mercy of Christ, so we find Jude speaking of "the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=175:4></a> What was seen in regard to Paul was mercy, the mercy of the Lord.<a name=175:5></a> He had mercy on Paul from beginning to end.<a name=175:6></a> Christ was Neighbour to him, and his one thought in regard of Christ was that he might have Him for gain.<a name=175:7></a> He was prepared to be divested of anything that might give him self-distinction -- that he might have Christ for gain.<a name=175:8></a> That indicates his appreciation of Christ, and then Paul acted like Christ.<a name=175:9></a> He went about ministering mercy.<a name=175:10></a> He was not always well treated, even at the hands of those who professed to be christians.<a name=175:11></a> In spite of that, he knew that Christ was his Neighbour, and had shown him mercy, and took care of him, so he followed the injunction of the Lord Jesus to the lawyer, "Go and do thou likewise".<a name=175:12></a> That is the second step.<a name=175:13></a> The way in which I would desire to help you is in the appreciation of Christ as neighbour.<a name=175:14></a> He is at your service until He has you with Himself.<a name=175:15></a> You do not need to complain of weakness here.<a name=175:16></a> You might be able to say with the apostle, "the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work".<a name=175:17></a> I think that might be echoed in many a heart.<a name=175:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the third step, and that is seen in the parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>-- that is the climax, for we have arrived at a point where the father has complacency in the prodigal -- not simply has the prodigal come back to the father, but he is there in such a way as to command the complacency of the father.<a name=175:19></a> Reconciliation has in view, not simply that man shall be brought back to God, in appreciation of Christ, but that he shall be set before God in

		I trust you have followed me in these steps.<a name=177:4></a> I do not think they are difficult to follow.<a name=177:5></a> The order in which the parables are put in Luke is an evidence of the divine character of the word of God.<a name=177:6></a> You could not alter the order without spoiling all.<a name=177:7></a> The attitude of God toward man must be the first thing, the appreciation of Christ the next, and to be suitable to God, for divine complacency, must be the climax.<a name=177:8></a> If you are suitable to God, God will have you in His own habitation.<a name=177:9></a> Christ not only brings us to where He dwells, but He makes us conscious of the Father's love, and if the Father loves us He will have us in due season in His own habitation.<a name=177:10></a> Why do people go to heaven?<a name=177:11></a> Because God loves them.<a name=177:12></a> Why did Israel go into the land of promise?<a name=177:13></a> Because God loved them.<a name=177:14></a> God will satisfy His love.<a name=177:15></a> "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=177:16></a> Christ's desire is that where He is there we may be also.<a name=177:17></a> I do not suppose that we often apprehend things in the order in which they are presented in Scripture, but I think God would have us apprehend them in divine order.<a name=177:18></a> I do not much mind how a person is converted, so long as the person is converted, but the time will come in our history when things have to be put in divine order in our souls.<a name=177:19></a> The more you have things in divine order the more capable you are of using those things for the benefit of others; and therefore the order in which things are presented in Scripture is of the greatest moment, because it is of the Spirit of God; hence

		the order of the three parables which I have just brought before you.<a name=178:1></a> The great thing is the appreciation of Christ.<a name=178:2></a> It is a wonderful thought that He is man's neighbour, neighbour to the man who is needy, and He proves that He is neighbour in showing mercy.<a name=178:3></a> God is rich in mercy, and Christ has come close to man to be neighbour to him who is needy, and it is of all importance that we should appreciate the neighbour.<a name=178:4></a> He has come close to us in the mercy of God.<a name=178:5></a> As you sit there, and as I stand here, we are being taken care of by Christ.<a name=178:6></a> He will never fail to do it till the moment arrives when we shall need no longer care, and then He comes to take us to Himself, that where He is there we may be also.<a name=178:7></a>

		F.E.<a name=179:1></a>R.<a name=179:2></a> We must keep before us the light in which we have been looking at this epistle, that is, the working out of the thought of Christ as the wisdom and power of God.<a name=179:3></a> That line is traceable through the epistle.<a name=179:4></a> We have had two points of great moment; that is, the temple of God, and of necessity, the oracles of God.<a name=179:5></a> The value to us of the temple of God is derived from the oracles of God being there.<a name=179:6></a> Then there is the anointed vessel so that the oracles are brought into contact with men.<a name=179:7></a> The oracles would be of no avail if not brought into such contact.<a name=179:8></a> The anointed vessel is analogous to what was true in Christ Himself, He was the anointed Man to preach the gospel.<a name=179:9></a> Now we get another point of great interest, in which is more the thought of the power of God.<a name=179:10></a> Christ is not only the wisdom of God but the power of God.<a name=179:11></a> The apostle says, "we preach Christ crucified, .<a name=179:12></a>.<a name=179:13></a>.<a name=179:14></a> Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God".<a name=179:15></a> Well, I take it that He is the power of God, so that everything may be put on resurrection ground and death be dispossessed.<a name=179:16></a> You get in this chapter, "The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam .<a name=179:17></a>.<a name=179:18></a>.<a name=179:19></a> a quickening spirit".<a name=179:20></a> Then, afterwards, "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven", and what the chapter goes on to is not the rapture, which is not introduced here, but victory over death.<a name=179:21></a> Certain things have to come to pass, the dead raised and the living changed, and then will be fulfilled the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<a name=179:22></a> This is a quotation from the prophet Isaiah.<a name=179:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=180:51></a>R.<a name=180:52></a> It refers to Christ's quickening power, no doubt.<a name=180:53></a> Though quickening is not exactly the same thought as resurrection.<a name=180:54></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:3></a>R.<a name=181:4></a> It is looked at as being an enemy to us.<a name=181:5></a> At the end of the chapter the question is raised, "O death, where is thy sting?<a name=181:6></a> O grave, where is thy victory?<a name=181:7></a>" So, too, in Romans, "That as sin hath reigned unto death".<a name=181:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=181:9></a> What distinction do you make between resurrection and quickening?<a name=181:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:11></a>R.<a name=181:12></a> I think quickening has its application to those who are living here when the Lord comes.<a name=181:13></a> Resurrection more to those who have died.<a name=181:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=181:15></a> So that verse in Romans refers to living saints, "if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you".<a name=181:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:17></a>R.<a name=181:18></a> Exactly.<a name=181:19></a> It is the quickening of your mortal bodies.<a name=181:20></a> We all have mortal bodies.<a name=181:21></a> It looks at us as here.<a name=181:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=181:23></a>A.<a name=181:24></a> The idea of 'mortal' is not a body that is dead but a body that is liable to death.<a name=181:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:26></a>R.<a name=181:27></a> So, too, the distinction is made here, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed".<a name=181:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=181:29></a> If we had only this epistle we would not know that we left the earth at all.<a name=181:30></a> It is all resurrection.<a name=181:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:32></a>R.<a name=181:33></a> That is intelligible, because the point of the epistle is to set forth what is involved in Christ as the wisdom of God and the power of God.<a name=181:34></a> That is, how God has taken in hand to bring to nought all that existed here and to establish that which is of Himself.<a name=181:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=181:36></a> So the epistle is complete.<a name=181:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:38></a>R.<a name=181:39></a> Yes, and really every epistle is complete in a way.<a name=181:40></a> In order to make up the completeness of truth we must take in all, but there is a kind of completeness in each; the detail of each follows on the particular light in which Christ is presented, and every epistle has its own completeness; and yet all are needed to give you the completeness of Christ.<a name=181:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.M.<a name=181:42></a> I suppose in that way Hebrews proceeds on the lines of the Apostle and High Priest, and completes that.<a name=181:43></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=181:44></a>R.<a name=181:45></a> Quite so.<a name=181:46></a> We see the way in which God has been working in order to put things on the ground of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=182:3></a>A.<a name=182:4></a> The idea of the resurrection of the dead is not so much a question of raising of bodies as of setting up a man on the earth in a condition beyond the power of death.<a name=182:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=182:6></a>R.<a name=182:7></a> I think so.<a name=182:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=182:11></a>R.<a name=182:12></a> Resurrection of the dead; but the point to my mind is the way in which it is brought about.<a name=182:13></a> All depended on a Man, a Man who could not be holden of death, but who could enter into it, although for others; to accomplish redemption and discharge every liability under which man was.<a name=182:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=182:18></a>R.<a name=182:19></a> That is the last Adam.<a name=182:20></a> He subsists in His own personal perfection as the righteous One, but in the power of redemption.<a name=182:21></a> That is, He has redemption rights, for He is God.<a name=182:22></a> Death is completely in result dispossessed.<a name=182:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=182:26></a>R.<a name=182:27></a> Exactly, because God alone had title to the inheritance, and evidently the one who has title to the inheritance is the one to redeem.<a name=182:28></a> I could not redeem another man's inheritance if he had mortgages on it, I mean not so as to have any claim of myself; I would not have redemption rights.<a name=182:29></a> They were particular about that in Israel.<a name=182:30></a>

		THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD AND HIS COMMUNICATIONS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:1">Hebrews  12:1</a> - 29
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a connection of thought all through this chapter.<a name=195:1></a> The first part is taken up with discipline.<a name=195:2></a> The Hebrews were, I suppose, suffering under persecution, and God was using it in the way of discipline.<a name=195:3></a> Many things that happen to us down here in circumstances are discipline on the part of God.<a name=195:4></a> These things are trying to us.<a name=195:5></a> They were so to the Hebrews, involving the spoiling of their goods.<a name=195:6></a> In those days people did not gain by christianity in this world; they lost continually.<a name=195:7></a> The spoiling of our goods would not be a pleasing experience to any of us, but the apostle presented it to them as discipline on the part of God, and the end of discipline is that we might be partakers of His holiness, and yet that is not quite the end, for there is another point, that we may get the gain of His communications.<a name=195:8></a> God brings us into circumstances in which the springs that work in us are brought to light.<a name=195:9></a> We become aware of things in us of which we had not much idea previously.<a name=195:10></a> The process through which we go may be painful, but the result is good, it leads to self-judgment, and in that way we become partakers of God's holiness, and that is by entering into His love.<a name=195:11></a> If we enter into the life of God, that is all good, but we have the painful lesson to lean, that is, there is no spring of good in us.<a name=195:12></a> All our springs are polluted and contaminated.<a name=195:13></a> We have to learn, "that in me (that is, in my flesh), dwelleth no good thing".<a name=195:14></a> All goodness is of God, and as we learn that it assists us in our education; we become partakers of God's holiness.<a name=195:15></a> A family is never well brought up if there is no discipline.<a name=195:16></a> If children are independent and take their own course, it will be prejudicial to them in the long run.<a name=195:17></a> We bring our children under discipline because there are certain

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		tendencies in them which in after-life might hinder them a good deal.<a name=196:1></a> You want to show them the distinction between right and wrong, and where the springs of right and wrong are, so that they may discern between the two, and choose the good and refuse the evil.<a name=196:2></a> And if that be so with us, how much more so with God.<a name=196:3></a> He brings us under the influence of His love to promote holiness in us, and He assists it with discipline.<a name=196:4></a> You get a striking instance of it in Job.<a name=196:5></a> He was brought under discipline, and the result was that, seeing God, Job loathed himself.<a name=196:6></a> He learned the rebellious springs that existed in him; that he had put himself on a level with God to argue with Him, and he came to abhor himself.<a name=196:7></a> So does any one of us when we see the terrific presumption and rebelliousness which lies in the heart against God.<a name=196:8></a> We repent in dust and ashes.<a name=196:9></a> Job learned, too, the end of the Lord, that He is very pitiful and of tender mercy, and, in result, he got twice as much as he had before.<a name=196:10></a> If we answer to the discipline of God we get divine communications.<a name=196:11></a> Discipline is intended to pave the way for communications, and the communications of God are the greatest riches which God can confer upon us.<a name=196:12></a> I can conceive of nothing to compare with them in point of value.<a name=196:13></a> They are far better than diamonds or gold, or any thing that man can conceive of.<a name=196:14></a> There is nothing to be compared with them.<a name=196:15></a> See what gracious work it is on the part of God to put us under discipline to prepare us for His riches.<a name=196:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a warning at the close of the chapter, which I can understand in the case of the Hebrews, and that was lest they should turn away from Him that spake.<a name=196:17></a> There is always a danger of apostasy if we are not kept of God, and the apostle warns them of it here, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh".<a name=196:18></a> There is a tendency in the human heart to turn away from God, and the way by which we are kept is by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.<a name=196:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things against which we are warned; the one is, despising the chastening of the Lord, and the

		other, refusing the Speaker.<a name=197:1></a> It should be an exercise with us that we get communications from God.<a name=197:2></a> God has His own way of bringing communications home to us.<a name=197:3></a> There are no fresh revelations, but yet God knows how to bring communications to us.<a name=197:4></a> Now, one word as to the communications.<a name=197:5></a> God's communications all have reference to a risen Christ.<a name=197:6></a> When God spoke to Israel He spoke to man on man's level; that is, of man's responsibility and of what was connected with that.<a name=197:7></a> At the present time God does not speak on that level.<a name=197:8></a> He speaks from heaven, and when He speaks from heaven He speaks of His own things; that is, the things which He has in His purpose to establish in Christ.<a name=197:9></a> Any one can appreciate the difference between the two.<a name=197:10></a> Everything which God purposes to establish is centred in a risen Christ, who is the Head and centre of the whole divine system of purpose, just as the solar system, with which we are acquainted, is centred in the sun.<a name=197:11></a> I want to point that out in a few details, and you might, in that connection, turn again to verses 18 - 25.<a name=197:12></a> It is evident that the reference here is to the communications that God made at mount Sinai.<a name=197:13></a> There were three steps in regard to the children of Israel: the first was they were delivered from Egypt; the second, God communicated with them, and the third was, He brought them into an inheritance.<a name=197:14></a> The first was their salvation, the second was God's covenant, that is, God making known to them the terms on which He was going to be with them, and all was in view of their entering into the inheritance which God purposed for them.<a name=197:15></a> God had told them that He would not only bring them out, but that He would bring them in; between the two you get the covenant.<a name=197:16></a> They were to come into the land under the covenant which God made with them, and the covenant set forth the terms on which God saw fit to be with them; the surroundings, however, tended to strike terror into the people.<a name=197:17></a> They were greatly awed.<a name=197:18></a> The voice was so terrible that Moses said, "I exceedingly fear and quake".<a name=197:19></a> But the striking thing was, that although all was so terrible, the people soon got

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the same principles apply to us.<a name=198:9></a> There are three steps; the first is to bring us out of the world.<a name=198:10></a> Egypt corresponds to that.<a name=198:11></a> The next is to bring us into inheritance, and between the two God brings us under covenant, or, to put it another way, He makes known the terms on which He is pleased to be with us here.<a name=198:12></a> Otherwise we could not have liberty with God.<a name=198:13></a> In any employment workmen work happily and cheerfully if they know the terms on which their master is with them.<a name=198:14></a> The new covenant is intermediate, in a way, in view of our coming into the inheritance which God has purposed.<a name=198:15></a> There were two things presented in the gospel which Paul preached: forgiveness of sins and inheritance.<a name=198:16></a> The Lord sent him to the gentiles, "To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified".<a name=198:17></a> God has in view an inheritance for His people.<a name=198:18></a> He had in view an inheritance for the children of Israel, and His purpose was to bring them into it, and so God has regard to us to bring us out of the world into His inheritance.<a name=198:19></a> The New Testament speaks of inheritance.<a name=198:20></a> We are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise.<a name=198:21></a> Then, as I said, between the deliverance out of the world and our being brought into the inheritance, God establishes with us His covenant.<a name=198:22></a>

		It is a great thing to be rightly impressed with the One with whom we have to do, that is Christ.<a name=225:1></a> We often want to accommodate Him to our ideas of right and wrong, but He has His own thoughts and His own way of looking at things.<a name=225:2></a> He will not judge according to our thoughts, and we have to take that into account.<a name=225:3></a> We shall see this coming out in a remarkable way in this parable.<a name=225:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable is one of a series of four.<a name=225:5></a> You will find one in chapter 18, this one in chapter 20, another in chapter 22, and the last one in chapter 25.<a name=225:6></a> In the gospel of Luke you get a remarkable series of three parables, that is the creditor with two debtors, the good Samaritan, and the prodigal; and there is a great contrast between the character of these two sets of parables.<a name=225:7></a> The parables in Matthew to which I have referred are more or less on the ground of responsibility.<a name=225:8></a> The parables in Luke are on the ground of grace.<a name=225:9></a> The creditor forgave both debtors.<a name=225:10></a> The Samaritan had mercy on the man that fell among thieves; and the father expressed his own joy in the prodigal.<a name=225:11></a> Here, on the other hand, you get a succession of similitudes of the kingdom of heaven, and from the very fact of the kingdom of heaven being in view -- things are taken up more on the footing of responsibility.<a name=225:12></a> In chapter 18 we get the order or rule of the kingdom.<a name=225:13></a> That is, that I have to act as I have been acted to on the part of God.<a name=225:14></a> Man's idea is retaliation.<a name=225:15></a> If a man is struck, he will strike again, but the divine principle is to act as God has acted to me.<a name=225:16></a> If I have been forgiven ten thousand talents, I have to go out in the spirit of forgiveness.<a name=225:17></a> I have not to take my debtor by the throat, and say, "Pay me that thou owest".<a name=225:18></a> The principle of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=226>[Page 226]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		responsibility comes into the parable, for the Lord adds, "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses".<a name=226:1></a> The man that owed ten thousand talents probably represented the Jew, and in visiting man, as God did in Christ, He forgave him the ten thousand talents; and yet the Jew was not affected by it, he went on the principle of legality and exaction to his own debtor, and hence he has to pay all his debt.<a name=226:2></a> God's provisional dealings are all as was the case with the Jew when Christ was presented.<a name=226:3></a> If man does not answer to those dealings, there will be the same result in christendom.<a name=226:4></a> Christendom is enjoying enormous benefits at the present time through the gospel, but if it does not answer to the goodness of God it will come under the whole weight of its debt, the wrath of God.<a name=226:5></a> There is no doubt that such will be the end of christendom, but the present moment is one of great privilege.<a name=226:6></a> Even the material advance that has occurred in christendom has, to a very large extent, been the effect of the light of christianity coming into the world.<a name=226:7></a> But there will be a dark day, for undoubtedly the general spirit of christendom is not according to the grace in which God has been pleased to visit the world.<a name=226:8></a> That is the first parable.<a name=226:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the second parable shows the dispensation of the kingdom, I mean the way in which the Lord deals things out.<a name=226:10></a> Then in the third parable is the marriage supper, in which we see the king's right of inspection.<a name=226:11></a> There again you get the thought of responsibility.<a name=226:12></a> There was a man which had not on a wedding garment.<a name=226:13></a> He had no right to come in to the supper without such a garment.<a name=226:14></a> Then you get the climax of these parables in the ten virgins, and that brings in the bridegroom.<a name=226:15></a> These four parables are peculiar, and you will do well to study them, for we have to face these things.<a name=226:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I have said enough to show that these four parables as similitudes of the kingdom of heaven all go on the ground of responsibility, just as the three
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=227>[Page 227]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in Luke go on the ground of grace.<a name=227:1></a> Both are true.<a name=227:2></a> You see our responsibility to continue in the light of grace, and when people get away from that light they fail in responsibility.<a name=227:3></a> Our responsibility is to continue in the faith and not to be moved away from the hope.<a name=227:4></a> As long as we continue in the faith we are in the light of grace.<a name=227:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to this particular parable, there is just one word prefatory which I would like to say.<a name=227:6></a> Some people raise a difference between the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God.<a name=227:7></a> It is an interesting point because the distinction, and there is a distinction, what I might call a nice distinction, is important enough to be understood.<a name=227:8></a> I understand the kingdom of God to mean support.<a name=227:9></a> None of us can do without it.<a name=227:10></a> It is connected with the Spirit of God.<a name=227:11></a> The Spirit of God maintains in us the moral sway of God, and that furnishes moral support.<a name=227:12></a> The heart of man is a feeble vessel, and there is no heart but wants divine support down here.<a name=227:13></a> We are maintained here by the kingdom of God, which is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.<a name=227:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom of heaven presents another thought, and the best illustration that I know of it is the sun in heaven, we all require the sun in order that we may walk down here.<a name=227:15></a> It is a difficult thing to find your path here if you have not light.<a name=227:16></a> We can walk very well on a bright moonlight night, but the light of the moon is only the light of the sun reflected; in a general way we walk in the day because we want the light of the sun so as not to mistake our way and stumble over this and that thing.<a name=227:17></a> And the value of the kingdom of heaven to us is that we walk now in the light of the day, in the light of that luminary which God has been pleased to establish in heaven.<a name=227:18></a> In Genesis God set a great light to rule the day.<a name=227:19></a> God has now set in heaven a great moral light so that man here may not walk in darkness, but may have direction and guidance in regard to his way.<a name=227:20></a> Everyone will understand to what I allude.<a name=227:21></a> God has set Christ in heaven, to be light down here upon earth, so

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that man may walk under the sway and in the light of that which God has been pleased to establish in heaven.<a name=228:1></a> If a christian does not walk in the light of Christ in heaven he will not do the right thing.<a name=228:2></a> People in the present day are trying to build something upon earth.<a name=228:3></a> Some will build up an institute, others a missionary society; all kinds of organisations are built up by people in the world.<a name=228:4></a> I think it to be a mistake because in the question of our service we ought to maintain the principle of individuality.<a name=228:5></a> We are not to combine to form some great institution.<a name=228:6></a> If a man has a gift to preach the gospel, he might go out with a fellow, for God may approve of two going together, but any man who goes out in the way of service has to go out on his individual responsibility, and has to walk in the light of the sun in heaven.<a name=228:7></a> He does not want to get his direction from institutes or missionary societies or churches or anything of that kind.<a name=228:8></a> It is contrary to the spirit of Scripture.<a name=228:9></a> An apostle went and did his own work without conferring with any one else.<a name=228:10></a> Paul did not confer with anybody.<a name=228:11></a> The same was true with Peter and John.<a name=228:12></a> They took their direction from heaven, each one for himself, and so it was with all the workers of whom we read in Scripture.<a name=228:13></a> Apollos did not confer with the apostles where he should go or what he should do.<a name=228:14></a> He took his direction from Christ.<a name=228:15></a> The same principle holds good at the present time, and where the appreciation of Christ is, as a great luminary in heaven, you will get real guidance as to your pathway down here.<a name=228:16></a> It is a great thing to be delivered from the combinations and organisations which men have formed and to understand one's own responsibility as to service, and that is made effectual by light from Christ.<a name=228:17></a> There are many who seek to serve the Lord.<a name=228:18></a> They need not go and consult with other people what they should do or where they should go.<a name=228:19></a> I suppose there is not one here who is not capable of some kind of service, even if it be small and not of much account.<a name=228:20></a> You have to maintain the principle of individual

	<div class="paragraph">
		responsibility.<a name=229:1></a> You stand or fall to the Lord.<a name=229:2></a> Take your guidance for service from the Lord.<a name=229:3></a> Let it be a matter between you and Him.<a name=229:4></a> There is a great light in heaven, and in that light a man has to walk down here.<a name=229:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will tell you one first principle in regard to that, because I want to make the truth practical if I can.<a name=229:6></a> You will not get much light from heaven if you disregard that which belongs to Christ down here, and that is the church of God.<a name=229:7></a> The church is not to direct me in regard to service, but if we disregard that which Christ has built, and which is of extreme importance in the eye of Christ, we will not get very much light from the luminary in heaven; and the reason is this, not that there is not light for you, but you have a kind of scales over your eyes which prevent your seeing what is important in the eye of Christ.<a name=229:8></a> I pity people who are looking to some great organisation down here.<a name=229:9></a> That is not the church of God.<a name=229:10></a> Christ builds nothing that the eye of man can see; anything which the eye of man can take account of is not the building of Christ.<a name=229:11></a> You can only apprehend Christ's building by the Spirit of God, and it is a great thing to have your eyes anointed with eye-salve so that you can apprehend Christ's work down here.<a name=229:12></a> What He builds is inconsiderable in the world, but it is perceived by those who have spiritual intelligence.<a name=229:13></a> And if you apprehend what Christ is building and seek to walk in the light of the church, of what is according to Him, you will find yourself in very real light as to your individual pathway of service.<a name=229:14></a>

		Now I come to our parable, verses 8 - 16.<a name=229:15></a> It is called out by what occurred in the latter part of the previous chapter.<a name=229:16></a> Peter began to say, "Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?<a name=229:17></a>" Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=229:18></a> And every one that hath forsaken houses, or

		I desire to dwell for a moment on the contrast between the Old Testament and the New.<a name=271:1></a> The one, to a large extent, may be called a book of demand, and the other a book of supply.<a name=271:2></a> That is, what is constantly looked for and panted after in the Old Testament, is found in the New.<a name=271:3></a> In the Old Testament we see the desire for Christ and salvation, but in the New Testament the desire has come.<a name=271:4></a> The word of God is not a compilation of moral sentiments.<a name=271:5></a> The prophecies in the Old Testament look on to the Kingdom, and in the New the Kingdom has come.<a name=271:6></a> I am quite alive to the fact that Christ has not yet come in a public way in the glory of the kingdom, but there remains the great fact on which christianity is based, that is, Christ is come.<a name=271:7></a> I take this from the passage I have read, that is, "the Son of God has come".<a name=271:8></a> Not in glory yet, but He has come and has given us an understanding.<a name=271:9></a> In a world of darkness and of dearth, everything must have been in the nature of desire till Christ came; now, that Christ has come, everyone that is of God ought to be marked by satisfaction, no longer by thirst and desire, and we cannot give any greater proof of the reality of our christianity than in the fact that our satisfaction is evident and apparent.<a name=271:10></a> This is not always the case.<a name=271:11></a> Often, to our shame, we find ourselves craving after one thing and another.<a name=271:12></a>

		I take up now two or three thoughts suggested by the scriptures before us.<a name=271:13></a> I dare say most of you are acquainted with the fact that the Psalms are divided into five books, and each book has its own particular line.<a name=271:14></a> This psalm is the introduction to the second book.<a name=271:15></a> The second book has this character.<a name=271:16></a> It looks at Israel as scattered, and away from their own land, and to a large extent under pressure, but at the same time there are genuine desires

		after God.<a name=272:1></a> The same thing may be true now in any one in whom God has been pleased to work by His Spirit.<a name=272:2></a> The effect of a person being born again is not exactly that that person is brought into life, but that right desires are awakened in that person.<a name=272:3></a> That person's eyes are opened to a true apprehension of the character of things around, and that there is nothing in them which can satisfy the heart of man, and hence desires are awakened after God.<a name=272:4></a> So the same kind of experience which is depicted in the early part of the Psalms may occur in a person at the present day.<a name=272:5></a> A great many people go to the Psalms because they find in the Psalms that expression which they want.<a name=272:6></a> We are all much attached to the Psalms.<a name=272:7></a> There is hardly one of us but is in the habit of referring to them.<a name=272:8></a> We find a great deal in them which meets our state of mind, and for a great many christians in the world at the present time, what comes out in the early part of the Psalms is more or less true.<a name=272:9></a> They thirst after God.<a name=272:10></a> If we thirst after God it is proof that we have not found God.<a name=272:11></a> Evidently thirst is not satisfaction.<a name=272:12></a> They are in contrast.<a name=272:13></a> In this Psalm we get thirst and in the New Testament we get thirst recognised, but the point there is that there is a perfect answer to thirst, "And let him that is athirst come.<a name=272:14></a> And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=272:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point in the Psalms.<a name=272:16></a> That is what I dare say people are often exposed to in the present time, the taunt of the enemy.<a name=272:17></a> "My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?<a name=272:18></a>" I should suppose that is an experience to which a great many have been subjected.<a name=272:19></a> They thirst after God and could not say they have found God, and in that way they become exposed to the taunt of the enemy, "Where is thy God?<a name=272:20></a>" People say, 'What are you better off for all your thirsting after God?<a name=272:21></a>' "Where is thy God?<a name=272:22></a>" 'Show me something, some proof of it'.<a name=272:23></a> I can understand a wanton infidel mind saying to people, "Where is thy God?<a name=272:24></a>" 'You cannot show me anything at all of your

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point, "When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day".<a name=273:4></a> Now that verse to my mind shows a disposition to refer to the past.<a name=273:5></a> I have known people who lived on remembrances and I doubt if remembrances are very much to live upon.<a name=273:6></a> In natural things people do not live on remembrances, but on the present, and in the circumstances which are.<a name=273:7></a> People who live on remembrances are not generally marked by much brightness.<a name=273:8></a> They think of the times which have been, that they were much better than the times which are, and that is not much food for the soul.<a name=273:9></a> All these psalms have been written in view of the future, and the experiences through which the people of God, that is Israel, will pass in time to come; I take them up because so much that is presented in the Psalms expresses what is not uncommon among people in the present day.<a name=273:10></a> If there were not a work of God I do not think any part of this psalm would apply, because no soul naturally pants after God.<a name=273:11></a> There may be an uneasy conscience sometimes, but if there be a thirst after God it is the proof that the Spirit of God has awakened desires which are according to God, and which nothing whatever but the knowledge of God can satisfy.<a name=273:12></a> I say one word more in regard to Israel, God will appear for them, and they will be blessed with temporal blessings in earthly places, but that will not satisfy them.<a name=273:13></a> Nothing will content them but the knowledge of God.<a name=273:14></a> Hence it says in connection

		Now I want to present the contrast to those things which christianity brings to us.<a name=274:5></a> I read <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:6">Revelation  21:6</a>, "And he said unto me, It is done.<a name=274:6></a> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.<a name=274:7></a> I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely".<a name=274:8></a> Again <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>, 17, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.<a name=274:9></a> I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.<a name=274:10></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=274:11></a> And let him that heareth say, Come.<a name=274:12></a> And let him that is athirst come.<a name=274:13></a> And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=274:14></a> I want to enlarge on the thought which I put out a few moments ago, that the New Testament furnishes the supply.<a name=274:15></a> The spirit of the New Testament is Christ.<a name=274:16></a> The Son of God has come, and in the coming of the Son of God one of the first things spoken of is the satisfaction of man's heart by the knowledge of God.<a name=274:17></a> That is what the Lord Jesus proposed in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>to the woman at the well of Sychar.<a name=274:18></a> He says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=274:19></a> That is, the Lord Jesus proposed to give to one who was athirst living water.<a name=274:20></a> Now we cannot attach too much importance to the truth that Christ has come in as the Head and centre of the moral universe.<a name=274:21></a> When you talk to people about a moral universe they scarcely understand what you mean.<a name=274:22></a> They know

		Now I come to the consequence of that.<a name=276:14></a> If you have living water you do not thirst, and how do you think that is?<a name=276:15></a> You can understand how natural water quenches thirst.<a name=276:16></a> How is it living water quenches thirst?<a name=276:17></a> Living water in the believer is the witness to God.<a name=276:18></a> It is really God in the believer, and the work of the Spirit is to shed abroad in the heart the love of God, and if you have the love of God shed abroad in your heart you could very well say, I do not thirst.<a name=276:19></a> What have you to thirst for?<a name=276:20></a> What can you have more than the love of God?<a name=276:21></a> You could not turn to God and say, 'I thirst', for God would rebuke you and say, 'I have given you of My Spirit, and the knowledge of My love, and if you are not content with that there is no more that I can give you'.<a name=276:22></a> God begins with the greatest gift, and if you are not content with the greatest gift you will not be content with any gift short of that.<a name=276:23></a> There is nothing that God could give to compare with

		F.E.<a name=282:8></a>R.<a name=282:9></a> I think being born of God supposes that you are a partaker of His nature.<a name=282:10></a> Being "born again" does not go so far as that, but is connected with the ability to see.<a name=282:11></a> "Except a man be born again, he cannot see".<a name=282:12></a> In one born of God, as John says, His seed abides, that is His nature.<a name=282:13></a> It is the divine nature, of which one is partaker.<a name=282:14></a>
