		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> I think God has found a way by which He may dwell: Christ has prepared a house for Him.<a name=1:3></a> We have our part in that, but it is not the purpose of God in it; the purpose of God in it in regard to us is to bring us into the sanctuary.<a name=1:4></a> There is great gain in being brought to the house of God, but His purpose is to bring us to the sanctuary; you are brought to the sanctuary when you are prepared for it.<a name=1:5></a>

		F.E.<a name=1:9></a>R.<a name=1:10></a> Yes, God dwells to make Himself known.<a name=1:11></a> It is not only that He may be revealed; He was revealed before the house was here at all.<a name=1:12></a> God was first revealed, then He establishes the house that He may be known by those in the house.<a name=1:13></a> You get no divine teaching until you are brought to the house.<a name=1:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=2:3></a>H.<a name=2:4></a> I had thought that covenant is that God instructs us as to His intention.<a name=2:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:6></a>R.<a name=2:7></a> He instructs us not in His mind, but in Himself and hence it is said, "All shall know me, from the least to the greatest".<a name=2:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		T.H.<a name=2:9></a>B.<a name=2:10></a> Is that the limit of the teaching?<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:12></a>R.<a name=2:13></a> The only limit is God Himself; because He is the Teacher.<a name=2:14></a> We do not strictly come under the covenant, but we must come under the principles of it, that is divine teaching, so the apostle says to the Thessalonians, "Ye yourselves are taught of God to <i>love</i> one another", that is the effect of the love of God.<a name=2:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:18></a>R.<a name=2:19></a> I think so, but you get the teaching even in chapter 5: "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts", verse 5, it begins there.<a name=2:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B.<a name=2:21></a> I thought that if any man learned any truth at all either about God, or himself, it was by divine teaching he learned it.<a name=2:22></a> Suppose I have learnt my state of guilt and sin, is it not divine teaching?<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:24></a>R.<a name=2:25></a> That is not what I should call divine teaching.<a name=2:26></a> Divine teaching is leading you into the light of God.<a name=2:27></a> The man who knows God best, knows himself best.<a name=2:28></a> New birth is not divine teaching, but it is divine operation.<a name=2:29></a> You cannot speak of divine teaching until the Holy Spirit is received.<a name=2:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:38></a>R.<a name=2:39></a> Coming to the Father is coming to Christ really for light.<a name=2:40></a> All the light of God is in Christ.<a name=2:41></a> He was speaking to the Jews at the time, and no one came to Him except the Father drew him.<a name=2:42></a> It is akin to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:28">Matthew  11:28</a>

		The Spirit begins with righteousness and then you get to holiness in that way.<a name=4:29></a> You are led on and instructed.<a name=4:30></a> The moment you come to holiness you must bring in love.<a name=4:31></a> Righteousness connects itself with grace, and holiness with love.<a name=4:32></a> You get the knowledge of these things by the Spirit of God bringing your soul into direct contact with God Himself.<a name=4:33></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=5:4></a>R.<a name=5:5></a> I would in a way; there it is that the body may be built up, that instead of being children and tossed about with every kind of doctrine, they might be able to stand as men.<a name=5:6></a> That is all connected with intelligence.<a name=5:7></a> It is divine intelligence but you cannot get divine intelligence except by the knowledge of God morally.<a name=5:8></a> What man wants is moral backbone, and then he gets divine intelligence, the two go together.<a name=5:9></a> I think if you examine the passage in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, it is intelligent growth, not moral.<a name=5:10></a> Do you remember an expression of Mr.<a name=5:11></a> Darby's?<a name=5:12></a> It used to puzzle me a good deal: he said that in divine things you learned the words by the things, and if you have not got the things you cannot learn the words.<a name=5:13></a>

		F.E.<a name=6:28></a>R.<a name=6:29></a> It is a great thing to get an idea of the sanctuary.<a name=6:30></a> It is certain to me that the love of God cannot rest in the house of God as it is now, but there is a spot in the house where it can rest; you could not touch the sanctuary except by the house.<a name=6:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is a mistake to suppose that marriage as it is now has reference simply to the interests of this present life.<a name=70:1></a> It is a relationship connected with this present life, I quite admit, but we take up marriage now, not from Adam and Eve, but from Christ and the church, and that brings into it very much more of the moral element; it places it, in that sense, in connection with what is above and beyond this present life.<a name=70:2></a> I think it is very important to have marriage in that connection.<a name=70:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Marriage is the crucial point in the history of a man for good, or for evil.<a name=70:4></a> It may work disastrously or otherwise; experience has shewn us that often enough, and we have to look to it that it may turn to good.<a name=70:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my object is to seek to shew how marriage may connect us with what is eternal.<a name=70:6></a> It may become an occasion in the grace of God, for those bound together in marriage, of forming special spiritual links, which are beyond all that is present.<a name=70:7></a> There may be a result of marriage which goes beyond all question of happiness, or of natural joy in the present life.<a name=70:8></a> I think it would be well indeed if the natural were sacrificed to the spiritual, if present gain were sacrificed to the spiritual and eternal; and if marriage be taken up in that light, I think we would gain great good from it.<a name=70:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you find Peter speaking to the husband and wife here as "heirs together of the grace of life".<a name=70:10></a> That could not have been said to Adam and Eve, but now another element has come in, and husband and wife are "heirs together of the grace of life".<a name=70:11></a> It is wonderful to look abroad in the world, and see the traces of the goodness of God still.<a name=70:12></a> You get something of that kind brought out in the passage I read in Proverbs.<a name=70:13></a> You could not fail to see traces of the goodness of God in existing relationships:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=71>[Page 71]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you see it in parents and children, and with husband and wife.<a name=71:1></a> While man on his part has become lawless, and turned to sin, yet you find certain traces of God's goodness remaining.<a name=71:2></a> I think that is perfectly evident, and as I said, you get a wonderful picture of it in Proverbs.<a name=71:3></a> All that was of the wife, and all her doings, and energies, were to be contributory to the husband.<a name=71:4></a> Mischief began by the woman losing the sense of the head; she got on on her own understanding, and lost the sense of the head, and that has never been recovered.<a name=71:5></a> Now the great point evidently in regard of marriage is that the wife must be prepared to sacrifice her own individuality, and her own interests, and all that, and her part is to be contributory to her husband.<a name=71:6></a> She must not seek to glorify herself; she has accepted a head -- for that is what is done in marriage, the man is the head of the woman -- and her energies and her doings are to be contributory to the man.<a name=71:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the care of the household, and the bringing up of children and all that, she is to be the glory of the man.<a name=71:8></a> She was not to shine in her own glory, the woman is the glory of the man.<a name=71:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when you come to christianity, what I want to point out is this: we do not stand properly in relation to this world, but we stand in relation to the living God, and you cannot connect the living God with a scene which is dominated by death.<a name=71:10></a> That is a point of the last moment to my mind.<a name=71:11></a> God stands in relation to a scene of life.<a name=71:12></a> He is the "preserver of all men", I know, but the very idea of the living God is that He stands in relation to all that is life; and all that is of life stands in relation to a living God.<a name=71:13></a> If we accepted that, it would tend to separate us more in mind and spirit from the scene of death.<a name=71:14></a> We have to take up many things in connection with this scene of death, but at the same time, a man may be dissociated from the scene which is dominated by death, and we may all be conscious of being in relation with the living God.<a name=71:15></a> He has not yet come out publicly in that character, but when He comes out as the living God, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		whole scene will be filled with life -- it will be a wonderful day!<a name=72:1></a> Many of us have come to be fairly well content with this scene, when things are fair, but we have to remember that it is a scene dominated by death; no one can doubt for a moment that it is so.<a name=72:2></a> But if you have to do with the living God, He connects us with all that is of life, and all that is of life connects itself with the living God.<a name=72:3></a> The church is the church of the living God, and Christ is the living stone, and we, coming to Him as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.<a name=72:4></a> I believe it is a point of the last moment that God should give us some apprehension of the living God, and of all that stands in relation to the living God.<a name=72:5></a> In result all will take its character from the living God, He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all live unto Him.<a name=72:6></a> Abraham and Isaac and Jacob all stand in relation to the living God and the church is the church of the living God.<a name=72:7></a> I want us to recognise that more and more.<a name=72:8></a> If people give themselves up to present proprieties and the amenities of life, they are acting to a very large extent in the light of a world that is dominated by death.<a name=72:9></a> People are to a great extent governed by it, you can see it by their appointments, their homes, and in their dress -- they make it manifest that they are more or less dominated by the scene which is under death.<a name=72:10></a> But what we want to make manifest in all that we are, and in the way too in which we carry out our natural relationships, is that we stand in relationship to the living God.<a name=72:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now husband and wife are to walk together as heirs together of the grace of life.<a name=72:12></a> There was no question of their being heirs together at the outset, but it is a very important point now in regard to the marriage tie, and the practical result is that spiritual ties are formed, which are not for time but for eternity.<a name=72:13></a> It is not a question of mere natural happiness, or of what is agreeable to us in this life, but as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.<a name=72:14></a> I am sure it is a most important point to see, placed together in such close
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=73>[Page 73]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		relationship as husband and wife, that there should be the formation of spiritual links which are connected with the living God.<a name=73:1></a> The relationship itself must of necessity come to an end with the life down here, but in regard to christians, God allows it to go on so that it might become the means of forming special and spiritual links which are for eternity.<a name=73:2></a> It is of all moment that our beloved brother and sister should take their light from Christ and the church.<a name=73:3></a> Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it, and the church is subjected to Christ.<a name=73:4></a> So with the wife, she does not shine in her own light, but she is contributory to her husband, and the husband gives direction to his wife, he is head over her.<a name=73:5></a> I do not mean in the sense of lording it over her, but he brings in his influence in connection with all that is right, he directs her.<a name=73:6></a> And we who are husbands have to look to it that we lead our wives aright so that headship is seen.<a name=73:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the place of the wife is evidently that in the detail of life she is to be contributory to her husband.<a name=73:8></a> The great point is that the husband should go right, for then as a general rule you may say that if the husband goes right, then the wife will go right too.<a name=73:9></a> I believe if you trace it fairly you will find that the real reason why things have not gone right with many is that the husband did not go right.<a name=73:10></a> He is to take the initiative -- he is to direct his wife, and she on her part is to be subject to her husband, and if they carry that out they will walk together as heirs together of the grace of life, and will increasingly know what it is to stand in relation to the living God, and all that stands in relation to the living God is eternal.<a name=73:11></a> All that issues from the living God to us is what stands in relation to the living God, and which must therefore subsist eternally, because it has the blessed character of life in contrast to the death that dominates here in this scene of death.<a name=73:12></a> I would desire then that they might take their light from Christ and the church, and that they might stand in relation to the living God not merely in future relation, but in present relation to the living God, and

		I want to say a little with regard to "the word of God".<a name=75:1></a> It is important to understand, the idea which is intended to be conveyed by it.<a name=75:2></a> Reference was made to the way in which, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, the Lord spoke to the two disciples.<a name=75:3></a> No doubt in that chapter the Lord, in a sense, took the place of the Spirit in expounding the Scriptures to His disciples.<a name=75:4></a> We must enter a little into the position they occupied, and indeed into that of all the Old Testament saints.<a name=75:5></a> What they had up to then, "the law and the testimony", was everything to them, but in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>the point is, that while everything previously spoken was confirmed in Christ, it was He Himself who then spoke to them.<a name=75:6></a> He was the 'Yea and Amen' of all.<a name=75:7></a> And He was going to the Father to send to them the promise of the Father.<a name=75:8></a> Not merely was it that everything that God had purposed had its confirmation in Christ, but the power of all was to be down here in the Spirit.<a name=75:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the Spirit in which He blessed them, and "he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven".<a name=75:10></a> He went up to heaven to send on them the promise of the Father, and we have now, in contrast to what saints in previous times had, Christ, and every thought of God, everything spoken in anticipation, now established in Christ; the reality has come in, and, at the same time, the power of it down here in the Spirit.<a name=75:11></a> In every way you will find a correspondence in the Spirit to whatever has come out in Christ.<a name=75:12></a> The Spirit is spoken of as the Spirit of Christ, but also as the Spirit of God and even the Spirit of the Father.<a name=75:13></a> Everything is now witnessed and maintained here in the Holy Spirit.<a name=75:14></a> Christ went back to the Father that He might send from the Father the promise of the Spirit.<a name=75:15></a> That is what we get in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=75:16></a> I call attention to the contrast between what had been,

		To make things clear, I would notice a distinction between "the truth" and "the word of God".<a name=76:2></a> God's word is truth.<a name=76:3></a> Scripture says, "Thy word is truth".<a name=76:4></a> But there is, I think, a distinction between "the truth" and "the word of God".<a name=76:5></a> Scripture appears to make the distinction.<a name=76:6></a> "The truth" is the revelation of God.<a name=76:7></a> On the other hand, speaking in a general way, "the word of God" gives the idea of the revelation of God's thought and mind in regard to men.<a name=76:8></a> It may indeed go wider than man; but in general it is the expression of His mind with regard to man; and His word is ever truth characteristically.<a name=76:9></a> But at the same time there is "<i>the</i> truth", and that is a great thing to hold by.<a name=76:10></a> Christ is "<i>the</i> truth", and the Spirit is "the truth".<a name=76:11></a> These are statements made in Scripture, and entirely incontrovertible.<a name=76:12></a> It is remarkable that while the word of God is the expression of His thought and purpose with regard to man which comes out in a sovereign way, yet the revelation of God has come out in relation to man's state and necessities.<a name=76:13></a> If you go through Scripture I think you will find such to be the case.<a name=76:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The name 'Almighty' came out in connection with the weakness of Abraham.<a name=76:15></a> God had made far-reaching promises to Abraham in connection with himself and his seed, and yet Abraham was under the common liability of death.<a name=76:16></a> All these promises depended, as far as Abraham was concerned, on resurrection, and it is in that connection that God made Himself known as the Almighty God who quickens the dead.<a name=76:17></a> You have only to read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>to see that "he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=76:18></a> That was in connection with the fact that Abraham was under the power of

		Everything precious entrusted to them they would certainly lose.<a name=77:4></a> That is met by the revelation of the name of Jehovah, which indicates the eternal faithfulness of God to His own engagements.<a name=77:5></a> That comes out in contrast to the weakness of the people who were sure to surrender all that God had given to them.<a name=77:6></a> The people soon forgot the promises, these lost power with them, they had the law, but the living promises of God were lost sight of; but after all God had revealed His name as Jehovah, and that secured the eventual blessing of the people, and their getting the promises in the sovereignty of God's mercy.<a name=77:7></a> You get that brought out in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=77:8></a> In chapter 4 you get the Almighty, in chapter 11 Jehovah.<a name=77:9></a> Both names come out in connection with the weakness of man.<a name=77:10></a>

		I refer to three points: the first is righteousness -- it was the first thing that it was necessary for God to establish; the next is sonship; the third is eternal life.<a name=79:6></a> I take up these three things as having been expressed in Christ, and I want to shew you that they are the mind of God in regard of man down here.<a name=79:7></a> These thoughts come out in the Old Testament.<a name=79:8></a> They are not new.<a name=79:9></a> We shall see this if we go back to Abraham for a moment.<a name=79:10></a> What came out in him was righteousness; promises were given him, but the great point in regard to him was righteousness by faith.<a name=79:11></a> Abraham was accounted righteous.<a name=79:12></a> He stood in the account of God in righteous relation to Himself.<a name=79:13></a> You get the great principle of righteousness established.<a name=79:14></a> He is the father thus of all that believe.<a name=79:15></a>

		In Israel we get another expression of the mind of God.<a name=79:16></a> God's word to Pharaoh was, "Israel is my son, my firstborn".<a name=79:17></a> "Let my son go, that he may serve me".<a name=79:18></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:22">Exodus  4:22</a>, 23.<a name=79:19></a> You get here the idea of sonship, I admit, in regard of the nation; but anyway there is the idea of sonship and service.<a name=79:20></a> Sonship implies that there should be a point where the love of God could rest, so that He might be served.<a name=79:21></a> God could not be served where His love could not rest.<a name=79:22></a> The great idea was a point where love could rest.<a name=79:23></a> If divine love could not rest in you and me and we be conscious of it, we could not serve God.<a name=79:24></a> It is an impossibility that He could be served otherwise.<a name=79:25></a> You are familiar with the passage in Zephaniah: "He will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing" (<a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:17">Zephaniah  3:17</a>) -- and that here upon earth.<a name=79:26></a>

		I pass on to the third point -- eternal life.<a name=80:2></a> It is curious that the thought of eternal life comes out in David.<a name=80:3></a> Righteousness in Abraham, sonship in Israel, and David is the first to speak of eternal life.<a name=80:4></a> He speaks of it in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#21">Psalm  21</a>and again in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>, which is "A song of degrees.<a name=80:5></a> Of David".<a name=80:6></a> "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore".<a name=80:7></a> These things were all in anticipation, for the reality could not come out then either with regard to Abraham, or Israel after the flesh, or David.<a name=80:8></a> David never came into eternal life down here, but it is evident that these things were the mind and thought of God in regard of man.<a name=80:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all has come out.<a name=80:10></a> The Son of God has come forth.<a name=80:11></a> He says, "Lo, I come .<a name=80:12></a>.<a name=80:13></a>.<a name=80:14></a> I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart".<a name=80:15></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:7">Psalm  40:7</a>, 8.<a name=80:16></a> The Son of God takes a path.<a name=80:17></a> The moment He takes a path as Man He is necessarily the righteous One.<a name=80:18></a> He was the righteous Jehovah, the righteous God, but the moment He becomes Man, He takes a path He never did before.<a name=80:19></a> God prescribes a path; man takes a path, and Christ becomes Man and He takes a path to fulfil all righteousness.<a name=80:20></a> He undertakes the responsibilities under which man lay that we might stand in relation to Him as the Sun of righteousness, like the moon to the earth or the earth to the sun.<a name=80:21></a> That is the relation in which we stand to Christ.<a name=80:22></a> Sonship is evident and everything takes it character from what Christ is Himself.<a name=80:23></a> He is Son.<a name=80:24></a> And eternal life has been manifested in Him.<a name=80:25></a> In Christ down here upon earth there was an energy of life which rendered impotent the power of death and the forces of evil, and that is what eternal life means in its principle.<a name=80:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Every thought of God in regard to man has its full and perfect expression in Christ.<a name=80:27></a> He is the truth, the revelation of God, but He is also the Word, that is, the expression of God's mind in regard to man, and the one hangs upon the other.<a name=80:28></a> There could be no thought in

		One word more.<a name=81:8></a> We have come into the full light of God's thought in regard of man, and Israel too will come into it.<a name=81:9></a> Even the nations will participate in righteousness and in a certain way in eternal life.<a name=81:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hold it to be an incontrovertible principle that what has been set forth in Christ as Man is God's mind for man.<a name=81:11></a> It is a great thing to get hold of a principle that can be carried through.<a name=81:12></a> We have now been brought into the light of God's word and it is Christ, and we have the answer to Christ in us.<a name=81:13></a> Christ was bent upon gathering those to whom He could impart His Spirit.<a name=81:14></a> From the outset you see this.<a name=81:15></a> He gives living water springing up in the recipient to eternal life -- that is in divine, quickening power in affection, so to fill us that the believer rises up to the full light of Christ, and in getting into the full light of Christ we come into the full light of God's mind with regard to man.<a name=81:16></a> It is not God's thought about any particular people, but about man; every man may have it, but through grace we have been brought into it, and we get it made efficient in us by the Spirit.<a name=81:17></a> We come into righteousness efficiently by the Spirit of God.<a name=81:18></a> I quite admit a man is justified by faith, but we come into righteous relation to God and to Christ <i>by the Spirit</i>.<a name=81:19></a> The Spirit is the seal of righteousness.<a name=81:20></a> The new man is created after God in righteousness and true holiness.<a name=81:21></a> You may apprehend that God can justify the ungodly,

		I need hardly say it is in the same way we come practically into sonship.<a name=82:3></a> The Spirit so makes us acquainted with the love of God in Christ that we come into the sense of it.<a name=82:4></a> The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit.<a name=82:5></a> The Spirit in us cries, Abba, Father.<a name=82:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, as regards eternal life.<a name=82:7></a> It is a question of proximity to Christ.<a name=82:8></a> If you get close to Christ you come into eternal life.<a name=82:9></a> "God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son".<a name=82:10></a> It seems a simple question of being brought by the Spirit into proximity to the Son.<a name=82:11></a> We get under the influence of that which marks the Son.<a name=82:12></a> "He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=82:13></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:11">1 John  5:11</a>, 20.<a name=82:14></a> Thus Christ is the Word of God, the perfect expression of His mind in regard of man.<a name=82:15></a> All is in connection with the light of which we have heard this morning.<a name=82:16></a> The immediate occasion of the revelation of God has been the weakness of man through sin.<a name=82:17></a> If that be the case, do not you think that man might trust God?<a name=82:18></a> It is not my strength or my suitability which has brought out the revelation of God, but my helpless condition -- and God in Christ has taken occasion to make known His thoughts in regard to man.<a name=82:19></a> His communications are livingly expressed to us in the Son of His love.<a name=82:20></a> It is not in terms but in a Person.<a name=82:21></a> Righteousness, sonship and eternal life we apprehend in a Person, and not only so, but that Person is represented in us by the Spirit.<a name=82:22></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=82:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no thought of attempting an exposition of these addresses to the churches; I want to speak of what the church is as witness, and what succeeds when it fails as witness.<a name=106:1></a> In the first of these addresses we get the church in its normal place, the place of witness.<a name=106:2></a> It is the only address in which allusion is made to the candlestick.<a name=106:3></a> When it ceases to be a witness here it is never restored.<a name=106:4></a> So far as the actual fact is concerned, the candlestick is hardly taken out of its place yet.<a name=106:5></a> The church is still responsibly in the place of witness, but you read no more of the candlestick.<a name=106:6></a> But then another order of things follows: not exactly witness, but life.<a name=106:7></a> Life comes in, and you can always fall back upon that, and it is a great thing to fall back upon.<a name=106:8></a> You will find the same principle pervading the writings of the apostle Paul.<a name=106:9></a> When things were normal, we get the epistle to the Ephesians, and that is the church as witness; but when the church has failed, the apostle has to look the failure in the face, and he falls back upon life.<a name=106:10></a> We can make nothing now of witness or testimony, but we can fall back upon life, and that is very important.<a name=106:11></a> It is what comes out in these two addresses.<a name=106:12></a> The great point in the present day is life, and life must, in a sense, be individual.<a name=106:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will speak a little about witness, and the place of the church as witness.<a name=106:14></a> You cannot give up a right thought, even if you see that a right thought can never again be realised down here: a right thought is ever your standard.<a name=106:15></a> I think that is one great reason why Scripture has been given to us, that we might have a perfect standard.<a name=106:16></a> In days of defection people are led back to the standard, and the effect upon them is they depart from evil.<a name=106:17></a> It was so in the time of Josiah; the king was brought back to the standard, and the state of things was judged

		by it.<a name=107:1></a> The same applies to the present day; when any kind of revival has occurred amongst saints, they have been led back to the standard, and were thus able to judge the defection.<a name=107:2></a> But then, the standard would not build people up; for that you want the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=107:3></a> Life can only be by the Spirit of God.<a name=107:4></a> Doctrine is not life; the Spirit is life.<a name=107:5></a> The well of water springs up in the believer into everlasting life; saints are built up in the energies of life.<a name=107:6></a> That is a great thing in a day of departure.<a name=107:7></a> It was pointed out years ago that in the later epistles, where the apostle is addressing himself not to churches but to individuals, he takes the ground of an apostle according to the hope of eternal life.<a name=107:8></a> There was no hope of the restoration of the church; and eternal life becomes to a large extent the point in the epistles to Timothy and Titus.<a name=107:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one word in regard to the witness.<a name=107:10></a> I think there was in the ways of God a kind of continuation of witness.<a name=107:11></a> So long as Christ was upon earth He was the great witness here of divine love: He declared God.<a name=107:12></a> Now when Christ comes in again He comes as the faithful and true witness; you get that lower down in the third chapter.<a name=107:13></a> But in the meantime the church is the witness, and expressions which were used in regard to Christ Himself are used in regard to the church.<a name=107:14></a> The Lord speaks of Himself as the light of the world; the church is the light of the world.<a name=107:15></a> He was the witness; the church is the witness: that is its normal place, a witness for God here, a living witness.<a name=107:16></a> It is the living expression down here of the love of God -- that is the true place of the church; and not only witness of the love of God, but of the wisdom of God.<a name=107:17></a>

		Now I will just ask your attention to a scripture or two in that connection -- <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:20">John  17:20</a>, 21.<a name=107:18></a> There you get the unity of the saints, and that as a proof that the Father sent the Son that the world might believe.<a name=107:19></a> Now pass on to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a> - 21.<a name=107:20></a> I think this prayer brings before us not simply the thought of unity, in which the saints were

		the witness that the Father sent the Son, but the competency of the church as witness.<a name=108:1></a> Nothing could go beyond this prayer in regard to witness.<a name=108:2></a> Now I call your special attention to the way in which divine persons are connected in this prayer with the church.<a name=108:3></a> The saints are to be strengthened of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by His Spirit, with might in the inner man, the object being that the Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith.<a name=108:4></a> Now, the subject of all testimony in Scripture, beyond contradiction, is Christ: "They are they which testify of me".<a name=108:5></a> So in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>"who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit"; and then, following upon the parenthesis which succeeds, you get, "The Lord is the Spirit".<a name=108:6></a> I am warranted in saying that Christ is the subject of the Scriptures.<a name=108:7></a> You will admit that the source of the Scriptures is the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, the immediate power by which the Scriptures have been indited is the Spirit, and the subject of the Scriptures is Christ.<a name=108:8></a> Now, the saints were to be strengthened with all might, that the Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith, that they, being rooted and grounded in love, might be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height, that they may be filled unto all the fulness of God.<a name=108:9></a> What I want to point out in that is the competency of the witness.<a name=108:10></a> They were to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.<a name=108:11></a> You can get no further.<a name=108:12></a> That was the competency of the church, and the end of it was that they might be filled unto all the fulness of God.<a name=108:13></a> What I understand that to imply is that the church was an adequate witness of God here in the world; it was not simply a witness by word of mouth, but morally.<a name=108:14></a> I could not give an exposition of the prayer in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>but it is one of the most remarkable passages you can find; it brings before us the mind of God in a most wonderful way.<a name=108:15></a>

		I refer to two other passages -- <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:11">1 John  4:11</a> - 14 and <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=108:16></a> In the gospel of John, Christ was the witness

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one more passage -- <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:10">1 John  5:10</a>, 11.<a name=109:7></a> The apostle says, "this is the witness, that God hath given to us eternal life".<a name=109:8></a> Read that in conjunction with what comes out in the previous verse: it is the witness that God has given of His Son.<a name=109:9></a> The church is looked upon as being in eternal life, and that is the witness which God has given of His Son.<a name=109:10></a> God has accomplished His purpose, the purpose for which the only-begotten Son came into the world (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>), and the accomplishment of that purpose is the testimony that God has given of His Son.<a name=109:11></a> Now you see the place of the church in witness here upon earth: witness to the Son of God, the love of God, the wisdom of God -- an expression of all the fulness of God.<a name=109:12></a> No one can speak about it at the present time with any great amount of power, because the witness is so obscured; but you can get the divine idea of it, and the effect will be that you will not care to have fellowship with anything that tends to obscure the witness.<a name=109:13></a> The witness will never come out in clear light again down here; it will come out in the heavenly city.<a name=109:14></a> I do not believe the candlestick will ever be brought back to its place, but I get the idea of the candlestick, and anything which tends to obscure the light I would seek to be apart from.<a name=109:15></a> As to the christianity current in the present day, I would not have anything to say to it; every day I live I desire to be more apart from it, because it is a great veil which obscures the witness of the church.<a name=109:16></a>

		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:2">Revelation  2:2</a> - 7.<a name=110:3></a> You see the departure there from the place of witness.<a name=110:4></a> The proof of it is plain, in that the Lord threatens to remove the candlestick out of its place unless there is repentance.<a name=110:5></a> I need hardly tell you that the church at Ephesus has long since ceased to exist; so has every other church in Asia Minor.<a name=110:6></a> The whole country was overrun by Mohammedanism, and the light of the church there extinguished.<a name=110:7></a> But that was only local.<a name=110:8></a> You may look at things in a broader way than that, that is, as to the church in general, for Ephesus is only a sample of the church in the place of witness.<a name=110:9></a> You will readily connect what I read with the prayer in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, which gives the idea of the church in the place of witness.<a name=110:10></a> Here the church has lost its witness, and the secret of it is that it has left its first love.<a name=110:11></a> When the church lost the sense of association with Christ, then, I do not doubt, it left its first love.<a name=110:12></a> I believe the idea of the church is set forth in figure in Aaron and his sons.<a name=110:13></a> There might not be any particular link of affection between Aaron and his sons; but in Christ and the church the bond is affection.<a name=110:14></a> His pre-eminence is the pre-eminence of affection.<a name=110:15></a> The bond of affection is in power in the sense of our being risen with Him according to the mind of God, and quickened together with Him by the work of God.<a name=110:16></a> So long as that was maintained the church was the witness; when the Head was let go the church ceased to be a witness.<a name=110:17></a> I have no doubt the secret of His being let go was unwatchfulness.<a name=110:18></a> People came in unawares, even unbelievers, and in that way spirituality declined, and eventually the witness was obscured.<a name=110:19></a> The church increased in worldly importance, but the influence of earth and of the world came in, and the witness was obscured.<a name=110:20></a> It has been said that the purest water spilt upon earth becomes mud.<a name=110:21></a> You get an idea from the passage I have read as to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=111>[Page 111]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the mind of God in regard to the church; but when the church came under the influence of earth everything became mixed; the witness was obscured, and the Lord takes account of this.<a name=111:1></a> Nothing escapes the eye of the Lord, and to my mind this is a great comfort.<a name=111:2></a> There never was a phase of the church as to which the Lord had not His particular mind.<a name=111:3></a> It is a great comfort, for it brings the sense to me of a living Head, who has His mind as to every moment and in every phase of the church's history.<a name=111:4></a> If I apprehend that, I shall desire to be in the secret of His mind, and then I would seek to be faithful to His mind, not to thwart it or to go on with anything which is not in accordance with it.<a name=111:5></a> He has His mind in regard to the church at this moment, as much as He had at the beginning.<a name=111:6></a> Laodicea is a very evil phase, but Christ has His mind in regard to that.<a name=111:7></a> If anyone there heard His voice and opened to Him they would come into accord with His mind.<a name=111:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have tried to make clear what is before me, and that is, to give an idea of the place of the church as witness, and its suitability for it.<a name=111:9></a> The witness was competent and suitable, but as a matter of fact the church left its first love, and when it did so, it ceased to be a witness.<a name=111:10></a> When it left its first love, human order came in; and that was, I suppose, almost the first sign of departure on the part of the church.<a name=111:11></a> The power of the Spirit declined, saints lost the sense of association with Christ, and then there was nothing left but to establish human order.<a name=111:12></a> When human order came in, the church ceased to be the witness which God intended it to be down here.<a name=111:13></a> Of course it has the responsibility of being witness until it is taken out of the place of witness, but morally it ceased to be witness when it left its first love; and although the Lord admonishes to repentance, yet, as a matter of fact, the church has never regained the place of witness which it lost.<a name=111:14></a>

		Now one word as to life.<a name=113:9></a> I think life practically is the enjoyment of the relationships in which it has pleased God to place us.<a name=113:10></a> In one sense, it is the power to enjoy the relationships; in another sense, it may be spoken of as the enjoyment of the relationships.<a name=113:11></a> If I speak of business life, I mean the associations and connections of business.<a name=113:12></a> Family life is in the affections and associations and connections of the family.<a name=113:13></a> And so in divine things.<a name=113:14></a>

		Life according to God is the enjoyment of the relationships and associations in which it has pleased God to place us -- not the natural relationships, but the spiritual ones; and if we are to enter into the enjoyment of these spiritual relationships there must of necessity be the fellowship of the death of Christ.<a name=113:15></a> If we are not prepared to accept that, we are greatly hindered in the enjoyment of the relationships of life.<a name=113:16></a>

		Now it is a great thing to be in the enjoyment of eternal things.<a name=113:17></a> We have a great deal to do with temporal things, but they are all transient; the great point is to be living in the relationships with which life according to God is connected.<a name=113:18></a> There is no single relationship of earth but what is dominated by death, but the relationships which God has been pleased to establish are all connected with a living God.<a name=113:19></a> It is impossible to connect

		I desire to make a few remarks on the difference between divine love in its application to us as saints on earth in our individual path, and in its application to us as privileged to be in association with Christ in a scene where God can rest in entire complacency, all being suitable to His glory.<a name=116:1></a> The first connects itself with our position as children in the presence of God, and the second with sonship and the assembly.<a name=116:2></a> A difficulty in understanding the matter may arise from the fact that, though both thoughts cannot be realised at the same moment of time, both are true now of believers.<a name=116:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing to be apprehended is our present recognised place down here as before God.<a name=116:4></a> We are evidently in the kingdom of God, justified and under the sway of grace.<a name=116:5></a> The same will, I apprehend, be true of Israel hereafter, but this does not fully describe the position of christians, they are "children of God".<a name=116:6></a> The children of the Queen are in the kingdom, and subject to its ordering and laws, but they are none the less the children of the Queen -- and christians as begotten by the revelation of God's nature, and partaking of that nature, cannot be less than children of God -- when the world knew not its Creator, and "his own" received not the light which had visited them; then it was that God saw fit to set forth His children.<a name=116:7></a> I judge that the object was that there should be those here who were morally according to Christ.<a name=116:8></a> I think that any careful study of the Lord's ministry on earth must end in the conviction that the purpose of His teaching was to lead the minds of those who listened to Him into the sense of being children.<a name=116:9></a> This is summed up in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:12">John  1:12</a>, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right

	<div class="paragraph">
		to be children of God, to those that believe on his name".<a name=117:1></a> In accord with this we have in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God;" and in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:16">Romans  8:16</a>, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God".<a name=117:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great point in reference to children is that they are in the light of divine love, and able to appreciate and enjoy the light because begotten of that love.<a name=117:3></a> "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him".<a name=117:4></a> If we apprehend that God began, and not we, then we can understand our place as children; a new generation, called out of darkness into light, to shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=117:5></a> Now the relationship of children, though connected with the idea of perfectness in practice -- for we are to be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect -- hardly conveys the idea of perfectness in point of state.<a name=117:6></a> Hence it is that such thoughts as discipline, purging, divine care, and exhortation to obedience are brought out in connection with it; and these thoughts are perfectly consistent with love.<a name=117:7></a> Discipline is an expression of a parent's love, and the absence of it would indicate rather the contrary.<a name=117:8></a> On the other hand keeping God's commandments is the evidence we give of love to God, and to talk of love apart from it would be vain on our part.<a name=117:9></a> A reference to <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>and to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>will shew the way in which the Father's love is exercised in regard of us, and the end which it has in view.<a name=117:10></a> It is vigilant and active -- for God withdraws not His eyes from the righteous -- it humbles us in exposing tendencies in ourselves of which we were probably unaware and our own inability to overcome them -- but all in view of the peaceable fruits of righteousness as the end of exercise, and, in result, of our becoming partakers of God's holiness.<a name=117:11></a> But concurrent with that we have the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit -- our hearts are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=118>[Page 118]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		being divinely instructed in the disposition of God towards us, and thus we are led into the enjoyment of liberty and confidence toward God.<a name=118:1></a> But all this, vitally important as it is to us, does not speak of love in rest -- but in vigilance and activity.<a name=118:2></a> In connection with it comes in also the service of priesthood, as in Christ's intercession for Peter that his faith should not fail.<a name=118:3></a> I think that I have said enough to indicate the relation of love towards us in the place of children here.<a name=118:4></a> It is made perfect in the day of judgment in that as Christ is, so are we in this world.<a name=118:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I desire now to touch for a moment on the thought of love in rest -- and this I judge must connect itself with perfectness in the state of those who are the objects of that love.<a name=118:6></a> It is in this connection that we can apprehend Christ as the centre of the throng in a scene filled by divine glory, and in which all is according to that glory.<a name=118:7></a> I suppose that sonship is that in which this is fulfilled in regard of us.<a name=118:8></a> Sonship properly belongs to heavenly places, and connects itself with a state which is entirely of, and according to, God.<a name=118:9></a> He has chosen us to be holy and without blame before Him in love.<a name=118:10></a> Now love can rest here, where all is suitable to God's glory.<a name=118:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question naturally arises how far can this be realised by us now?<a name=118:12></a> The answer is that we are encouraged of God to accept the truth of association with Christ; perfected for ever as to conscience.<a name=118:13></a> We are risen with Christ, and the work of God in us has been with the view that we might be capable for the holiest, at least in the point of affections.<a name=118:14></a> On the other hand it is in the power of God through Christ's death to view saints simply in the light of the holy affections which He has wrought in them, as in the case of the prodigal, apart from all that is connected with responsibility, or that would call for the exercise of discipline.<a name=118:15></a> Such things do not come into the thought of the holiest -- where all is necessarily of God and according to His glory.<a name=118:16></a>

		It is properly the privilege of heaven, though enjoyed now, in assembly, by those who have through grace been led to accept the truth of the calling, have forsaken all that they have that they may be disciples of Christ.<a name=119:2></a> It makes nothing of us, for we must feel how small we are in regard of these things, but it is none the less the proper inheritance of the feeblest saint, and to enter into it gives us a foretaste of God's eternal rest.<a name=119:3></a>

		DISCIPLINE AND LIGHT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:1">Hebrews  12:1</a> - 29
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to understand the book of Hebrews it is necessary to see that it largely corresponds to what Leviticus was to the Jew.<a name=147:1></a> The subject of the book is approach to God, but not as Jews; there was in Israel the idea of approaching God, but not as we approach.<a name=147:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Exodus gives us the redemption of God's people from the power of the enemy, and the consequent setting up of God's dwelling-place among the redeemed people: so we get the detail of the tabernacle.<a name=147:3></a> In Numbers the people are taken account of, first, as for the wilderness, and secondly, as the people of God who were to inherit the land.<a name=147:4></a> This is what is typified, I suppose, in the two numberings.<a name=147:5></a> Both thoughts are combined in the christian.<a name=147:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Between the books of Exodus and Numbers we get the book of Leviticus, and the subject of that is, as I have said, approach to God; and the priests therefore come into prominence.<a name=147:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Hebrews the truth all through is leading up to approach to God.<a name=147:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jew understood that the priests only could draw nigh; Aaron and his house were concerned with the worship of God; you can understand, therefore, the difficulty that a Jew had in understanding the common priesthood in christianity of believers; that through Jesus by one Spirit we <i>all</i> have access to the Father.<a name=147:9></a> Every christian must be a priest if indwelt by the Holy Spirit.<a name=147:10></a> There may be in many cases gift, but gift does not make a man a priest; the Holy Spirit constitutes a man a priest.<a name=147:11></a> Most of us have been brought up with Jewish notions regarding a priestly class as distinct from the laity, but these have no place in the christianity of Scripture.<a name=147:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another truth connected with the common priesthood of believers which comes out in Hebrews:
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=148>[Page 148]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		namely, that of boldness for entrance into the holiest, and consequently a place outside the camp.<a name=148:1></a> The Jew in the millennium will have neither the one nor the other.<a name=148:2></a> It is peculiar to the time when Christ is glorified in heaven but rejected here.<a name=148:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first two chapters of the epistle to the Hebrews are introductory, then warnings follow, but in general, up to chapter 7 the epistle is occupied with the <i>Priest</i>.<a name=148:4></a> Even in the Old Testament we find that the whole tabernacle system depended upon the priest.<a name=148:5></a> The secret of our priesthood is our identification with Christ the great Priest.<a name=148:6></a> He leads us to worship the Father.<a name=148:7></a> The question is, how is the Priest so to engage us that we may be drawn to Him.<a name=148:8></a> He is in heaven for us; and nothing will avail for heaven but love; faith and hope have no place there; our link with Christ in the Father's presence is love.<a name=148:9></a> I will quote a verse that proves this: "The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me".<a name=148:10></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:27">John  16:27</a>.<a name=148:11></a> Hence the service on the part of the High Priest towards us is with a view to engaging our affections with Himself where He is.<a name=148:12></a> He is the One who makes us at home in the Father's presence.<a name=148:13></a> You can see thus that the whole question of the service of God depends upon the Priest and our affection toward Him.<a name=148:14></a> It is not difficult to get the idea in type in the case of Aaron and his sons.<a name=148:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next great point in the epistle is the <i>sanctuary</i> (we have seen that the first is the Priest).<a name=148:16></a> The sanctuary I understand to be the full blessed light of God, as He has been pleased to reveal Himself in Christ in His purposes of grace; its character is moral, not material, and it is the Father's pleasure to have us there in the brightness of that light; that is the sanctuary as I apprehend it.<a name=148:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the last three chapters of the epistle you get the life of faith and the christian state.<a name=148:18></a> Chapter 10 presents privilege and brings us to what is collective; that is in the service of the sanctuary, but the life of faith is evidently <i>individual</i>, and in it we find ourselves surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.<a name=148:19></a> If you could have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		placed any one of these in the circumstances of another, his faith would have found expression as in the other.<a name=149:1></a> Faith has <i>God</i> in view, and the <i>world to come</i>.<a name=149:2></a> Every witness in chapter 11 was of some principle of the world to come.<a name=149:3></a> As the world got darker God gave more light as to the world to come, and faith walked in view of that.<a name=149:4></a> The object of chapter 11 is to put you <i>in a line</i>.<a name=149:5></a> You have been previously looked at in your priestly place, which is privilege, but in this chapter you are in the line of those who have gone in the path of faith.<a name=149:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 12 two very important principles are seen -- one is the <i>discipline of God</i>, and the other the <i>light</i> of God's will.<a name=149:7></a> The present moment is not that of display but of mystery, and that involves <i>testimony</i>.<a name=149:8></a> We have now not <i>one</i> testimony, but the harmonious meeting of <i>every</i> testimony, the full light of God, which centres in Christ, at the right hand of God.<a name=149:9></a> When all is accomplished and in display, it is no longer a moment of testimony: but now we all, by the Spirit, behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, and are changed into the same image.<a name=149:10></a> We are accustomed to say that we are in the light as God is in the light.<a name=149:11></a> This is true, but I ask, are you as to the joy of your heart <i>practically</i> there?<a name=149:12></a> Are you in spirit outside the darkness of this world, and in the enjoyment of that light in which God has shone out?<a name=149:13></a> With us it is too often true, 'If clouds have dimmed my sight', and our souls are not then in the brightness.<a name=149:14></a> A good many things come in to obscure our spiritual vision.<a name=149:15></a> A man with a cataract does not see clearly.<a name=149:16></a> It would be a very blessed thing for our souls to be kept abiding in the full light of God's testimony.<a name=149:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things displayed in Christ -- God's nature and His <i>testimony</i>, but I speak now of the testimony only.<a name=149:18></a> In order to be in the light of God's will you must accept the discipline of God.<a name=149:19></a> That which is of the world which attaches to us is intolerable to the holiness of God, and God's ways of grace (in which He uses discipline) are to this end, that we may be <i>in spirit</i> apart from

	<div class="paragraph">
		the course of things here.<a name=150:1></a> If we had any true sense of the holiness of God it would tell in our houses, in our ways and in our demeanour.<a name=150:2></a> Many things may in circumstances come in to try and to distress us, but God's end in all is to remove what obscures our vision, so that our souls may be in the blessed light of His testimony.<a name=150:3></a> This is not a question of the assembly, but that which attaches to us individually -- to be in the full light of the glory of the Lord.<a name=150:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall say a few words now about the light of the testimony.<a name=150:5></a> "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem", etc.<a name=150:6></a> (See verses 22 - 24).<a name=150:7></a> This passage presents to us God's various testimonies, and they converge at one point, and the value of this to us is that the soul should be in the full light of the things which are going to be shortly displayed.<a name=150:8></a> Now I see three great testimonies of God, which came out in detail in times gone by.<a name=150:9></a> (1) His purpose to <i>bless</i>, as seen in His dealings with Abraham; (2) His purpose to <i>dwell</i>, which comes to light in connection with Israel, "let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" Exodus 25: 8; (3) His purpose to <i>rule</i>, which comes out in the throne of David, and which brings in view the kingdom.<a name=150:10></a> It is blessed to observe that all these testimonies came out in favour of man.<a name=150:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law brought curse, but four hundred years previously to law, God had given to Abraham testimony of His purpose to bless, and you may be sure that there can be no such thing as sorrow in the blessing of God.<a name=150:12></a> Then in type was set forth the testimony that God would dwell with His people.<a name=150:13></a> This is even more wonderful than discovering His purpose to bless.<a name=150:14></a> He would set up His tabernacle among men.<a name=150:15></a> In connection with the tent of testimony God <i>moved</i> about with His people in the wilderness.<a name=150:16></a> When they dwelt in tents, God dwelt in a tent, and this was a greater witness of grace than even the temple in which God dwelt when they came into the land of fixed habitation.<a name=150:17></a> It is inconceivably blessed that God should

	<div class="paragraph">
		dwell with man.<a name=151:1></a> Then (3) He will <i>rule</i> in order to subjugate all the enemies of man and of God.<a name=151:2></a> This is the great end of the kingdom; the subjugation of evil, and "the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death", and when that is so, the kingdom is given up that God may be all in all.<a name=151:3></a> I believe in the enumeration here that we get all the testimonies.<a name=151:4></a> We have come to mount Sion, not to a power which strikes men with terror, but to the enduring mercy of God when man has by sin and perverseness forfeited all.<a name=151:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mount Sion means sovereign mercy when we have no vestige of title.<a name=151:6></a> The only ground upon which any can be with God is that of the sovereignty of His mercy, and only the <i>elect</i> of God understand the sovereignty of God's mercy.<a name=151:7></a> "The city of the living God" is the great ruling city.<a name=151:8></a> Jerusalem on earth was the "city of the great King".<a name=151:9></a> So "Jerusalem above" is the heavenly metropolis.<a name=151:10></a> Then other testimonies follow "to God the Judge of all", etc.<a name=151:11></a> Man is not the judge -- God is the true Judge of all the actings of men.<a name=151:12></a> "To the spirits of just men made perfect".<a name=151:13></a> These men are made perfect through redemption.<a name=151:14></a> And Jesus is in view as the Mediator of the new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, which witnesses to the righteousness of God established in the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=151:15></a> The blood of Abel was the witness of violent will, but the blood of Jesus is the witness of death accomplished for God's glory and the righteousness of God vindicated, and as a consequence there is a call for blessing, not for vengeance.<a name=151:16></a> Then follows the exhortation, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh".<a name=151:17></a> He speaks from <i>heaven</i>.<a name=151:18></a> When God spoke on earth, He spoke on the ground of man's responsibility, giving him a law, but when He speaks from heaven, He speaks of that which is His pleasure, of His purposes in Christ.<a name=151:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I ask you, are you conscious of being on the ground of sovereign mercy with God?<a name=151:20></a> It is a great thing for us to have our hearts on those things in which He finds His pleasure.<a name=151:21></a> God's testimony makes known

		The ministry is the proper function of Christ as Priest; His sympathy with us is incidental to our present condition as being down here.<a name=153:1></a> But the service of the sanctuary is the proper function of the priest.<a name=153:2></a> Ministry is the service of God in the sanctuary.<a name=153:3></a> But if people do not understand the covenant, it is impossible that they could be up to the ministry, that is, to the service of God.<a name=153:4></a> Approach to God all through Scripture is according to the covenant made.<a name=153:5></a> Abraham had more access to God than the people had under the law.<a name=153:6></a> God made known in a covenant what His disposition was towards Abraham, and his liberty followed and flowed from the knowledge of God's disposition towards him.<a name=153:7></a> The people under the law were made to feel the extreme difficulty of approach to God; they were made to feel the distance between them and God; and for this reason, that the order of the covenant for the time being was law.<a name=153:8></a>

		There is one thing striking in the ways of God, and that is, that His thoughts are repeated through the different stages of the world's history, as we get it in Scripture, and in that way we see the wonderful continuity of His ways from beginning to end.<a name=208:1></a> In this connection we can trace through Scripture the thought of the "rest of God".<a name=208:2></a> It comes out at the very commencement and again and again later, and then at the end it comes out in full development.<a name=208:3></a> Just turn for a moment to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23:1">Leviticus  23:1</a> - 3.<a name=208:4></a> The sabbath comes out in this chapter not exactly as a feast, but with the characteristics of one, bringing in the true thought of the sabbath.<a name=208:5></a> The occasion was the gathering of the people round Jehovah, but it began with the sabbath of rest, and so whenever people are in relation with God we get a sabbath; I do not mean a legal sabbath, but the moral idea of one, figurative of the rest of God.<a name=208:6></a> After the works of creation God rested, and then in connection later on in the communication made to Moses in the history of the children of Israel, the sabbath again comes in, and God's desire was for the people to enter into the thought of the rest of God.<a name=208:7></a> Man had never really entered into His rest or His thought of the sabbath.<a name=208:8></a> It is easy to see this in regard of man either at the time of the creation or through all the history of God's earthly people, and then when we come to the time of David in the Psalms (as we get it quoted in this chapter), "As I have sworn".<a name=208:9></a> It refers to what took place in the wilderness: Israel was not to enter into the rest of God, but while they were not to enter, the passage brings in some who would do so -- this is implied; it was God's mind for some to enter into it, and with this conclusion in view we get, "There remaineth therefore a rest".<a name=208:10></a> We get it literally

		in verse 10, "hath ceased from his own works".<a name=209:1></a> We still have to <i>labour</i>, that is a proof that we have not entered into the rest in actuality, for rest is a cessation from labour; we know it well in natural things.<a name=209:2></a> It was so with God when He found His rest in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=209:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point in regard to rest is the thought of complacency in that which the completion of the work produces; God could say at the beginning it was all "very good", and God's rest was connected with that.<a name=209:4></a> Complacency is a very essential element in the result of His labour.<a name=209:5></a> He has reached a spot where there is complacency.<a name=209:6></a> Sin came in, and all God's rest was marred by it; but the whole question has been taken up and all been settled in Christ, and He has now become the place for God's rest.<a name=209:7></a> Through Christ it has been passed on in the church, and then by and by creation will be brought into the good of it, as we get in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:19">Romans  8:19</a>, etc.<a name=209:8></a> It is only waiting for the revelation of the sons of God down here: it will then all come out in manifestation.<a name=209:9></a> I am not now speaking of the new creation, but in reference to what God created at the outset.<a name=209:10></a> A great sifting is going on and will go on, but it is for the purpose that there may remain a harvest for God, in which God will be able to find complete complacency.<a name=209:11></a> It is an immense thing to have the rest of God before us, and for why?<a name=209:12></a> The reason is that we should not find our complacency in things around us.<a name=209:13></a> If we want to enter into God's rest, it is impossible to find complacency in things around, we have to <i>labour</i>, and that is a great contrast to sinking down in satisfaction with the things of this scene.<a name=209:14></a> It is a danger we have to keep in view.<a name=209:15></a> I do not suppose that any of us here would think of going on in the indulgence of gross sins, but it is extremely possible to settle down here and not to 'labour', finding our satisfaction and pleasure in the things of the world.<a name=209:16></a> This chapter contemplates the danger: the belief here referred to is not in regard to the gospel as first accepted but in regard to God's purpose for us; we are "kept by

		Well now, the Spirit of God would guard us against all this in this chapter.<a name=210:2></a> It is a great thing to remember that a sabbath-keeping <i>remains</i>.<a name=210:3></a> Israel never entered into it, and we which believe have not entered into it, for we have to labour, though we can now be in the characteristics of it.<a name=210:4></a> We have to accept that labour <i>will</i> terminate, but that it is not <i>yet</i> terminated, though by faith the other conditions have been made good in us.<a name=210:5></a> If grace has brought you to righteousness, the effect will be to produce 'labour'.<a name=210:6></a>

		Now, beloved friends, I want to touch a little upon the divine provision that comes out for us in the latter part of the chapter, verse 12.<a name=210:7></a> I think in this passage there is a connection of great interest, that is, in the "word of God" and in the thought of the great High Priest that has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.<a name=210:8></a> We can put the two thoughts together.<a name=210:9></a> The word of God is <i>living</i>, and if we have a living thing it must of necessity be connected with a person.<a name=210:10></a> It does not say life-giving, but <i>living</i>, hence I have no manner of doubt that it is connected with a person.<a name=210:11></a> The wonderful thing is that when God saw fit to speak to man in His own Person He sent forth His own Son.<a name=210:12></a> He has spoken in Him; this is what we get in this epistle, God's speaking always had Christ in view, whether it was through the fathers or prophets, but at the last He spoke through His Son.<a name=210:13></a> He has become His own oracle, and then He passed into the heavens -- the great High Priest, Jesus the Son of God.<a name=210:14></a> He came into contact when down here with man, and into all the pressure of man's pathway here -- sickness, infirmities, bereavements, and it all produced exercise, and He has carried into the heaven as High Priest the experience He gained.<a name=210:15></a> The Son of God as the Word is God coming out, and the Son of God as High Priest is Man going in.<a name=210:16></a> We could not

		Now one word more as to the word of God: it is <i>living, discriminating, searching</i>, simply because it is the revelation of God, the expression of God's thoughts in regard to man, and His thoughts to man of Himself in Christ.<a name=211:2></a> We get the <i>living</i> bread in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>and we know it refers to Christ, the relationship has its perfect expression in Christ.<a name=211:3></a> It was all referred to in the past ages, and through God's previous dealings, and whichever way we look at it we find a reference to it in the Old Testament; all was foreshadowed, but it has now all been expressed in the Word of God, in the Person of the Son of God.<a name=211:4></a> It is God's perfect revelation of Himself all expressed in Christ.<a name=211:5></a> Everything in Him was a revelation of God.<a name=211:6></a> The light of the nature of God was all perfectly expressed in Him.<a name=211:7></a> If it is a <i>living</i> word, it is also discriminating and we live by it, it searches us; there is nothing more searching than the knowledge of God, it judges us, it breaks down the will of man.<a name=211:8></a> If you maintain a will you are not in the will of God.<a name=211:9></a> You cannot have anything of strength of will in the presence of the love of God, hence we must give up every purpose of will, and therefore it has to be broken.<a name=211:10></a> We get an instance of it in God's dealings with Job (chapter 33: 17), that He may "withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man".<a name=211:11></a> The ways of God are to that end; if man were right, <i>he</i> would <i>have</i> no purpose, no pride.<a name=211:12></a> God's dealings with us are to draw us away from our own wills.<a name=211:13></a> If man cherishes his own will and pride, he is going away from God and cannot enter into the thought of God's rest.<a name=211:14></a> It is impossible to cherish purpose of will or pride in the knowledge of God.<a name=211:15></a>

		NOTES OF READINGS ON JAMES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 3
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James labours to bring christians out into distinctness.<a name=215:1></a> The start is, "Of his own will begat he us".<a name=215:2></a> Then there is the receiving the implanted word with meekness, and salvation is by the implanted word -- that is, christianity.<a name=215:3></a> Then we get that there is no respect of persons in christianity in presence of the Lord of glory.<a name=215:4></a> Then in works you see unity: all distinctions are gone, and Abraham and Rahab are brought together by their works, prefiguring the Jew and the gentile together.<a name=215:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 you get the contrast brought out between the old man and the new man.<a name=215:6></a> The man of the world is known by the use of his tongue, the wise man -- the new man -- is known by wisdom; one is from beneath, the other from above.<a name=215:7></a> The wise man is one who has wisdom from above.<a name=215:8></a> The tongue is wrong, because man's will is wrong, and you cannot set the will right.<a name=215:9></a> Lying belongs to or characterises the old man, and the truth characterises the new, so we get in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>"putting away lying", and that the new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.<a name=215:10></a>

		The steps by which we enter in to God are the reverse to those steps by which God has come out.<a name=220:1></a> As to entering into the most holy place, to understand this you must know the way God has come out.<a name=220:2></a> He came out by Christ, and so He really came out by Himself; in that way He became His own testimony.<a name=220:3></a> I have pointed out before that where man ends there God began; the holiest is the highest, and there He began, God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.<a name=220:4></a>

		Christ came here in God's fidelity to the promises, but that was not the height from which God was acting, but it is seen in reconciling the world to Himself.<a name=220:5></a> He was no longer testing man, but took a new course, that is, reconciling the world to Himself.<a name=220:6></a> It is seen in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>where the multitude of the heavenly host say, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=220:7></a>

		That was the <i>birth</i> of Christ, but God draws even nearer still in the death of Christ.<a name=220:8></a> This shews His disposition toward us, it is seen in the new covenant.<a name=220:9></a> Then we get the proclamation, and next we get the entering into the holiest, and with this reconciliation, the two being intimately connected; but God started from the holiest, and that is where we find Christ now, where He abides in the holy love of God -- the holiest.<a name=220:10></a>

		Now in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>they are severed from the first husband that they might be married to another.<a name=221:3></a> A man <i>will</i> covet, he cannot help it, and the law only could condemn him for doing it; but as regards the christian we have the support of Christ by His Spirit: so the Lord said in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; .<a name=221:4></a>.<a name=221:5></a>.<a name=221:6></a> and ye shall find rest unto your souls".<a name=221:7></a> No one ever brought forth fruit to God save by the Spirit.<a name=221:8></a> Severed from Him we can do nothing.<a name=221:9></a> We all ought to be exercised about bringing forth fruit to God, and by the Spirit only is it done.<a name=221:10></a>

		The bearing of reconciliation is, that everything which is not of Christ must disappear.<a name=221:17></a> The application to us morally is, if any man be in Christ it is new creation; you cannot bear with or tolerate the inclinations of the flesh or will; now it is <i>new</i> creation; the meaning is that we might have boldness to enter the holiest.<a name=221:18></a>

		In Old Testament times the priest had to wash his body with water ere entering; now all takes place in the <i>mind</i> of the christian, and if you are before God in the holiest the old things have passed away and all things become new, and all things are of God: the product of His own grace and His Spirit in the soul, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him -- all was gold in the holiest, there the christian can be with no sense of the working of the flesh, that we might become so that God might have His delight in His people in the holiest.<a name=222:1></a> The great point of reconciliation is, that we should not receive the grace of God in vain, that is, we have our place in the world for the service of God.<a name=222:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the state of the mind, old things are passed away.<a name=222:3></a> It is a great thing to be before God, sprinkled as to our hearts from an evil conscience, and washed as to our bodies with pure water, then we can come out here in this world for God, we can turn God's grace to good account down here.<a name=222:4></a>

		You are before God for His perfect complacency; this is the third step, and it is a wonderful thing: old things are passed away.<a name=222:5></a> For God all is gone in the death of Christ, but it has to be recognised on our part that all for us has been terminated in the death of Christ.<a name=222:6></a>

		The immediate occasion of what we get in chapter 17 concerning the priesthood was the gainsaying of Korah.<a name=223:3></a> This is referred to in <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#11">Jude  11</a>, in which we are given prophetically in a few words the moral progress of defection in christendom.<a name=223:4></a> We get three landmarks of declension clearly stated:

		The climax presents the final state of corruption in christendom, that in which it <i>has</i> perished.<a name=223:6></a> That word 'perished' often occurs in the New Testament as representing a state of apostasy.<a name=223:7></a> "Son of perdition" is the same idea.<a name=223:8></a> Christendom has accepted and settled down in a condition and things in which morally it has perished, and there is no hope of its recovery.<a name=223:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sin of Korah was that the Levites claimed the priesthood.<a name=223:10></a> Now for priesthood there must be two qualifications: the call to it, and the grace suited to the call, and both from God.<a name=223:11></a> Korah claimed the priesthood without either the call or the grace for it.<a name=223:12></a> His company claimed it as Levites, and he and his house all perished by the fire of God.<a name=223:13></a> They were put to the test by the offering of incense.<a name=223:14></a> See chapter 16 verses 16 - 22.<a name=223:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Levites were properly <i>servants</i> -- their call was not to the worship of God, but to the carrying of the tabernacle and its vessels.<a name=223:16></a> The Levites were dependent for direction on the priests, but they had nothing to do

	<div class="paragraph">
		with the handling of the holy vessels.<a name=224:1></a> Now Korah and his company ignored this, and assuming priestly work, the judgment of God overtook them; and in the next chapter (chapter 17) God gives the proof of attestation of priesthood.<a name=224:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The budding and blossoming of Aaron's rod did not give Aaron title to priesthood, it was God's call which gave him title to it, and no doubt with the call he received the grace suited to the call, which sustained him in it.<a name=224:3></a> The budding of the rod was the <i>attestation</i> of his priesthood, and it signified life out of death (or resurrection in principle), as the witness and power of the priesthood.<a name=224:4></a> The people were so affected by it that they were overcome with fear, and exclaimed: "Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish".<a name=224:5></a> They felt that to come near the tabernacle was death to them, and they were right; for flesh and for rebellious man it presented death.<a name=224:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 18 God lays down the relative places of priests and Levites.<a name=224:7></a> There the Lord speaks to <i>Aaron</i>, not to Moses.<a name=224:8></a> The responsibility of the tabernacle and of its service fell upon Aaron and his sons.<a name=224:9></a> The Levites had the bearing of the tabernacle -- only they were not to come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary lest they should die.<a name=224:10></a> I think in this there was an expression of grace on the part of God, for they had offended, and offended grievously.<a name=224:11></a> God in His grace did not set the Levites aside, but assigned to them their proper place with regard to Aaron the priest and the tabernacle, and after this He says: "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death".<a name=224:12></a>

		Now the question for us is, What instruction do we get from all this?<a name=224:13></a> In our day we have certainly come to the gainsaying of Core.<a name=224:14></a> There is around us the exclusive claim to priesthood by those who are in the responsibility of ministers.<a name=224:15></a> Now the first question I should ask of such is, 'Show me your call;' and the next would be, 'Have you the grace for the call?<a name=224:16></a>' If you have not these, then you are in rebellion.<a name=224:17></a> That is the position of the clergy

	<div class="paragraph">
		of the present day.<a name=225:1></a> I do not suppose people have any idea of what an awful thing the principle of clergy is in the eye of God.<a name=225:2></a> It represents the apostate condition into which christianity has lapsed.<a name=225:3></a> The activities of the Spirit of God are not exercised through it but <i>in spite</i> of it.<a name=225:4></a> God's thought of priesthood is to be found only in life out of death.<a name=225:5></a> Now this proof of priesthood is seen only in Christ.<a name=225:6></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:15">Hebrews  7:15</a>, 16: "there ariseth another priest, who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life".<a name=225:7></a> The fact of an endless life in man is brought to pass in resurrection, and that is in Christ.<a name=225:8></a> The foundation of priesthood is in death, and the attestation of it in resurrection.<a name=225:9></a> There can be <i>no</i> priest but on the principle of life out of death.<a name=225:10></a> You get this set forth in type in Aaron.<a name=225:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the thought of priesthood is not limited to Aaron: there were also his sons, who were joined with him in the priesthood; so in order to get a complete idea of priesthood, we must take in Aaron and his sons, that is, not only Christ, but Christ and the church.<a name=225:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to bring this out in connection with the truth that God has appointed a Head for man, and that, in the Man who has accomplished righteousness; and in the Head we get One who communicates living water to man.<a name=225:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all this we have the expression of the grace of God towards man.<a name=225:14></a> Every man is tested by the introduction of a Head, and it is according to the thought of God that any and every man should come to Christ and get from Him living water.<a name=225:15></a> Righteousness and life in the Head are God's thought for <i>every</i> man.<a name=225:16></a> If I have apprehended the Head, and have received from the Head righteousness and living water, there follows another thing, and that is that I recognise the call of God.<a name=225:17></a> If you turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:34">Romans  8:34</a>, you will see that this passage brings in the thought of Christ's priesthood, and that is for the elect.<a name=225:18></a> "Who also maketh intercession for us", <i>not for everybody</i> and anybody.<a name=225:19></a>

		At first a believer knows nothing of the call of God, but a moment arrives in the history of the christian when he is bound to recognise that he is called of God.<a name=226:1></a> "Whom he called, them he also justified".<a name=226:2></a> When we have received the Spirit, we recognise that we are subjects of the sovereign mercy of God.<a name=226:3></a> Why do you love God?<a name=226:4></a> Because He first loved you.<a name=226:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I have said is in connection with Christ as Head.<a name=226:6></a> In accepting the Head, you get righteousness in Him and the gift of living water, and then you find that God first loved you, and that He has called you.<a name=226:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next point is, what are you called to?<a name=226:8></a> All saints are not called to the same things.<a name=226:9></a> Israel was called to national blessing; we are not called to that; it is evident from <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a> that we are called to sonship.<a name=226:10></a> God has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the First-born among many brethren: on our part -- that we should be in association with His Son.<a name=226:11></a> Christ is First-born, that is, pre-eminent among many brethren.<a name=226:12></a> God has seen fit so to call us.<a name=226:13></a> I cannot explain it, and I would not question it.<a name=226:14></a> God has been pleased so to call us that we should be in association with His Son as the First-born among many brethren.<a name=226:15></a> Priesthood comes in in connection with this, and we have thus the fulfilment of the type of Aaron and his sons.<a name=226:16></a> "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=226:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if a man says he is a priest, I would ask him on what ground.<a name=226:18></a> If you are a priest you must have received the call of God, to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the First-born among many brethren.<a name=226:19></a> There you get the first requisite of a priest, and a layman may be that; saints have been called to it, and the proof of it is that they love God by the Spirit of God.<a name=226:20></a> Any christian that recognises the call of God can say he is a priest.<a name=226:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Priesthood hangs upon sonship.<a name=226:22></a> Christ is priest

		because He is Son.<a name=227:1></a> We, too, are sons, and so we are priests.<a name=227:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is, the <i>grace</i> suited to the call to priesthood.<a name=227:3></a> Korah and his sons had neither the call nor the grace suited to it.<a name=227:4></a> Nor have those who assume the priesthood in christendom today -- that is the clergy; if they had, they would not assume the official position.<a name=227:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you desire to see what the grace suited to the call is, turn to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:13">Ephesians  2:13</a>, "<i>in</i> Christ Jesus <i>ye</i> .<a name=227:6></a>.<a name=227:7></a>.<a name=227:8></a> are become nigh".<a name=227:9></a> And further, in verse 18, "through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".<a name=227:10></a> Here we get the antitype of Aaron -- Christ, and through Him by the Spirit we have access, so that you have not only the call, but the grace for the call.<a name=227:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get the same in principle also in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, where the Lord, after He had said, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", breathes on the disciples and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit".<a name=227:12></a> We have here the antitype of Aaron and his sons.<a name=227:13></a> We are in association with Christ as the First-born among many brethren, and have access to the Father, through the Spirit.<a name=227:14></a> Christ communicated the Spirit that we might have access: we could not have it without the Spirit.<a name=227:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the proof of priesthood is life out of death.<a name=227:16></a> The principle on which priesthood hangs is resurrection, for we cannot be in association with the Son of God except on the platform of life out of death, that is, on resurrection ground.<a name=227:17></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit".<a name=227:18></a> Christ has been pleased to enter on that ground, and association with Him cannot be on any other.<a name=227:19></a> No one can be a priest except on that ground.<a name=227:20></a> All assumption of priesthood otherwise is an imposture.<a name=227:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may reply, 'But we are down here on earth, how can we then be in life out of death?<a name=227:22></a>' If you turn to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>, 13 you get two thoughts, one that we are risen together with Christ, and the other that we are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Even as regards Christ it says, "Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit".<a name=228:4></a> Now as risen with Christ we are men of another order, we belong neither to Jew nor gentile.<a name=228:5></a> Quickening results in a power of affection in the heart of the christian which can carry him superior to distinctions that exist in the flesh.<a name=228:6></a> There can be no distinctions of flesh in the presence of Christ.<a name=228:7></a> As quickened with Christ my slave is as dear to me as any other man.<a name=228:8></a> This can only be in the power of spiritual affection in the presence of Christ.<a name=228:9></a> Ye "have put on the new man .<a name=228:10></a>.<a name=228:11></a>.<a name=228:12></a> where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all".<a name=228:13></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:10">Colossians  3:10</a>.<a name=228:14></a> Every order of man has disappeared save Christ.<a name=228:15></a>

		We have had before us, first, the call; secondly, the grace in the saints suited to the call, and the proof of the call.<a name=228:16></a> Now return to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#18:7">Numbers  18:7</a>, "Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office .<a name=228:17></a>.<a name=228:18></a>.<a name=228:19></a> I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death".<a name=228:20></a> In chapter 17: 12, the children of Israel had said, "Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish".<a name=228:21></a> When the flesh comes into the presence of these things there is <i>death</i> before it, and so it must be, and we must accept death as to the flesh, for association with Christ is an end to all the things in which flesh lives.<a name=228:22></a> When the people saw the rod of Aaron budding, they recognised something too great for them.<a name=228:23></a> God is not served by man after the flesh.<a name=228:24></a> What is going on around us is mockery of God, who is not served, and cannot be by man as such.<a name=228:25></a> The very things in which life towards God consists are death to the flesh.<a name=228:26></a> None can serve God but those alive out of death.<a name=228:27></a>

		THE ACTIVITIES OF THE LORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:1">Acts  9:1</a> - 43
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to shew you, if I can, the great importance of what comes before us in this chapter.<a name=237:1></a> It presents a new starting-point in the ways of God, and I wish to make that plain.<a name=237:2></a> We have in this chapter the first account in the Acts of the Lord in activity from on high.<a name=237:3></a> In chapter 1 He gives commandments to the apostles, and ascends to heaven, and in chapter 7 Stephen looks up and sees Him standing on the right hand of God.<a name=237:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this chapter the Lord is seen in activity, and that signifies a new starting-point.<a name=237:5></a> What took place previously in a certain sense overlapped -- it was the end, but here we get the real beginning.<a name=237:6></a> And the chapter is interesting in that it presents the character of the Lord's activities from the start to the finish: it brings in view the "world to come", for that is, I suppose, the point at the end of the chapter.<a name=237:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think that people generally understand the difference between Christ as Head and as Lord.<a name=237:8></a> He is both.<a name=237:9></a> It is a question of the way in which you apprehend Christ.<a name=237:10></a> If you apprehend Him on the part of man He is Head, and if you apprehend Him on the part of God He is Lord of all.<a name=237:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As an illustration.<a name=237:12></a> Supposing the House of Commons were summoned to the House of Lords to hear a proclamation from the Prince of Wales on behalf of the Queen, it would go headed by the Speaker -- its head.<a name=237:13></a> In the House of Lords the Prince of Wales would represent the Queen.<a name=237:14></a> The House of Commons would be in accord with the Speaker, who is the first Commoner and the head, not the lord, of the house.<a name=237:15></a> In the House of Lords the Queen would be represented by the Prince of Wales -- he would represent the authority of the Queen.<a name=237:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Christ, as Lord, represents to us all the authority
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=238>[Page 238]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of God, but He is also Head as to man.<a name=238:1></a> He is the Head, and we are <i>of</i> Him, because we have partaken of His Spirit, and if we have partaken of the Spirit of Christ then we are Christ's.<a name=238:2></a> We recognise Him as Head, and He directs us.<a name=238:3></a> That is the position of christians.<a name=238:4></a> Now in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>we do not see the Head, but the Lord.<a name=238:5></a> We have the Person who is Head, but He is seen here as Lord.<a name=238:6></a> Two thoughts are connected with lordship -- first there is administration.<a name=238:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get an illustration of the Lord's administration in His feeding of the multitude in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>.<a name=238:8></a> He used the disciples in connection with the administration, but He Himself was the Administrator.<a name=238:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thought connected with lordship is subduing power.<a name=238:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:20">Philippians  3:20</a>) "We await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself".<a name=238:11></a> Here we get the subduing power which is His as Lord.<a name=238:12></a> There is also connected with Him as Lord the thought of authority and judgment, for all judgment is committed to Him; but that has mainly to do with enemies.<a name=238:13></a> God has brought us into the kingdom of the Son of His love that we may be able to stand against the power of evil.<a name=238:14></a> We are to "Be strong in the Lord".<a name=238:15></a> We ought to have a great sense of the authority of Christ as Lord as against all that is contrary to God; every enemy will be subdued by Him, even death itself.<a name=238:16></a> He will enforce authority over death, and the dead will come forth out of their graves; His authority is made good in that all judgment is committed to Him.<a name=238:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before taking up the detail of this chapter I refer to the two previous ones, chapter 7: 54 - 60, 8: 32 - 38.<a name=238:18></a> In chapter 7 we see Stephen looking up to heaven, where he sees the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, verses 55 - 60.<a name=238:19></a> The Jews stoned Stephen, calling upon God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<a name=238:20></a> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=239>[Page 239]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.<a name=239:1></a> And when he had said this, he fell asleep".<a name=239:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then at the close of the next chapter (verses 33 - 39) we get the account of the enlightenment of the eunuch.<a name=239:3></a> And Philip baptised him.<a name=239:4></a> He passed out of sight.<a name=239:5></a> What I want to shew is that we have in these chapters the termination of that which had previously existed for God; and this is important for this reason, you could not get a new starting-point in chapter 9 if all had not first been closed up with regard to the things that previously existed for God.<a name=239:6></a> You could not understand the Lord's action in this chapter otherwise, and it gives to this chapter great importance.<a name=239:7></a> The Lord has no present connection with this world.<a name=239:8></a> He is rejected, and sits on the right hand of God, and His present activity is to lead us outside this scene.<a name=239:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The time will come when the Lord will have to say to the world; that will be in authority and judgment, but that does not hinder His activities <i>now</i>, which are not exercised with relation to the world, and therefore I would not go to the <i>Lord</i> in connection with anything of the world.<a name=239:10></a> He is active as concerning His people down here, but His activity is in order to lead the subjects of it <i>out</i> of the world.<a name=239:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object of chapter 7 is to shew that every promise and purpose of God connected with the earth has been taken from the earth, and carried up in Jesus into heaven.<a name=239:12></a> Every interest of God connected with the Jew -- His earthly people -- has been carried up into heaven in the Person of Christ.<a name=239:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.<a name=239:14></a> The Son of man, the centre of all God's purposes, is on the right hand of God, and Stephen was going to heaven to Him.<a name=239:15></a> There was a complete end of all on earth.<a name=239:16></a> God had repudiated the temple.<a name=239:17></a> He says, "Heaven is my throne", &c.<a name=239:18></a> Every promise and purpose was carried up for the time into heaven.<a name=239:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in chapter 8 Philip explains to the eunuch in regard to Jesus that His <i>life is taken from the earth</i>.<a name=239:20></a> The
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=240>[Page 240]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		eunuch was a God-fearing man, but he did not understand what he read.<a name=240:1></a> Philip interprets it to him, and when he understood it he says, "See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<a name=240:2></a>" He apprehended that the life of Jesus had been taken from the earth, and he desired to be identified with His death.<a name=240:3></a> Baptism signified the end of every hope and expectation here, as connected with the flesh, and from the point of baptism there is nothing whatever for the one baptised but what is from the Spirit of God, and He will enable man's soul to live in the reality of the love and mercy of God.<a name=240:4></a> I wish all would take this in.<a name=240:5></a> The Spirit will enable you to live in the region which God has opened out for you in the revelation of His love and mercy.<a name=240:6></a> He will set Himself against the flesh.<a name=240:7></a> If you accept your baptism, you will expect <i>nothing</i> from the flesh, but you will find <i>everything</i> in the Spirit.<a name=240:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then chapter 9 is given to us to shew us the activities of Christ now as Lord on high, acting in subduing power here, and it carries us on to the kingdom and the power of the world to come, which is probably seen in the raising up of Aeneas and of Tabitha, at the close of it.<a name=240:9></a> I desire to shew you the effect of this power and these activities.<a name=240:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first to come under the influence of this power was Saul of Tarsus.<a name=240:11></a> Chapter 9: 1 - 9.<a name=240:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that the purpose of the Lord in this was to raise up a very special instrument, and the work of this instrument was to take precedence of all that had been before.<a name=240:13></a> Not that God ignored what had taken place previously to this, but the new takes precedence of the old.<a name=240:14></a> What is expressed in the case of Saul is not the exercise of authority in judgment, but subduing power.<a name=240:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saul was a most contrary man, but we see in him the Lord's activity in "the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself".<a name=240:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you ask me whether I do not think that there was also a work of God in Saul, I say there was, but that is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=241>[Page 241]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not the point here; the side we get here is the subduing power of the Lord, and Saul could not stand before it.<a name=241:1></a> In the lifetime of Christ on earth we find that the character of His activities was of the nature of subduing.<a name=241:2></a> If He found those who were suffering under the power of evil He subdued it.<a name=241:3></a> Here He subdues Saul of Tarsus, and He can do the same thing today if He sees fit; for that same subduing power is found in Him; and presently He will exercise that mighty power with regard to our bodies.<a name=241:4></a> It is a wonderful thought.<a name=241:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in verses 10 - 16 we come to another point and that is <i>administration</i>.<a name=241:6></a> The power of the Lord is there put forth not exactly in subduing, for Ananias was a disciple, but in appointing a vessel through which the Lord could administer.<a name=241:7></a> It is another interesting activity of power in connection with Christ as Lord.<a name=241:8></a> An object of His administration is to bring souls into christian fellowship.<a name=241:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Baptism is a very important point in this.<a name=241:10></a> It is intended to dissociate you from all that is contrary to the Lord, and the activities of the Lord are exercised in order to bring you into the blessings of christian fellowship, and we see here this administration, which belongs to Christ as Lord, and in which He takes up this person or that person to carry out His will.<a name=241:11></a> Ananias at first makes objections.<a name=241:12></a> The Lord says to him, "Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel".<a name=241:13></a> Christ in glory was to be preached by Paul to the gentiles, but the activity of the Lord towards Saul personally was to bring him into the reality and blessing of christian fellowship.<a name=241:14></a> It is a great thing now for a man to be separated from the contamination down here, so as to be a vessel sanctified and fit for the Master's use, for we have come to a time when only "the Lord knows those that are his".<a name=241:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 26, 27 there is a point further.<a name=241:16></a> When Saul was come to Jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples.<a name=241:17></a> But they were afraid of him.<a name=241:18></a> Then Barnabas
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=242>[Page 242]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		related how he had seen the <i>Lord</i> (not the Christ) in the way.<a name=242:1></a> All this shews the activities of the Lord.<a name=242:2></a> And Saul is a chosen vessel in whom He would shew His activities.<a name=242:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 31 we get the disciples walking in the fear of <i>the Lord</i> and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and being 'multiplied'.<a name=242:4></a> It is a beautiful picture of the effect of the activities of the Lord down here on earth.<a name=242:5></a> Now that is the end of that part.<a name=242:6></a> We have seen the activities of the Lord, and the purpose of them, not with regard to what transpires in the world, but in regard to His people and His own interests.<a name=242:7></a> What goes on in the world does not affect me, save that I ask, How is the Lord's testimony affected by it?<a name=242:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the raising up of Aeneas (verse 33) we get a sample of the power of the world to come: "And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and <i>turned to the Lord</i>".<a name=242:9></a> It does not say were converted, but they turned <i>to the Lord</i>, they were affected.<a name=242:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in verse 42 it is said, "many believed in the <i>Lord</i>".<a name=242:11></a> The effect of the Lord's activity through Peter in the raising up of Dorcas was that "many <i>believed in the Lord</i>".<a name=242:12></a> This activity of power shews that which will be in exercise in regard to the world to come, with the effect -- that "many believed in the <i>Lord</i>".<a name=242:13></a> It is connected with Peter and the kingdom.<a name=242:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it not a great comfort to know that the Lord can subdue now to Himself?<a name=242:15></a> He takes up often the most unlikely persons in which to exercise that subduing power; we are each and all a proof of it.<a name=242:16></a> He prepares instruments to do His work, and Ananias is an example of this.<a name=242:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How did it come about that the assemblies had rest from the persecutions they had been suffering through the hatred of Saul?<a name=242:18></a> Not by the crushing of the persecutor, but by taking him up in the subduing power of grace and making him an instrument of the Lord's own blessed activities; and right it was that the assemblies should have rest as the result of the Lord's gracious activity towards
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the persecutor.<a name=243:1></a> We can walk in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit now.<a name=243:2></a> The Lord says, as to Saul, "I will shew him how great things he must suffer for <i>my</i> name's sake".<a name=243:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was right that he should suffer, governmentally right, for he had made others suffer.<a name=243:4></a> The great apostle of the persecution was taken up and made a chosen vessel.<a name=243:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord exercises His subduing power with regard to saints, that they may be brought into the reality and blessing of christian fellowship, and prepares us for any little bit of service in which He may see fit to use us.<a name=243:6></a> The assembly is to be now walking in the fear of the Lord -- finding the Lord a present reality; and our mainstay down here is the comfort of the Holy Spirit.<a name=243:7></a> It is a comfort that never can fail you.<a name=243:8></a> If you look for comfort only in texts of scripture, that may fail you; but the comfort of the Holy Spirit will never fail you.<a name=243:9></a> We have to look to it that we are found walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.<a name=243:10></a> There will come a time when the powers of the kingdom will be made manifest by a general subjugation to the Lord.<a name=243:11></a> But <i>now</i> we have to say to the Lord in His blessed subduing power and administration.<a name=243:12></a> If you recognise that, you will desire to be a vessel sanctified and fit for the Master's use -- ready for any little bit of work which He may see fit to entrust to you.<a name=243:13></a>

		Another thing I want to touch upon is the place which the church has in the line of God's ways here upon earth.<a name=254:1></a> That is a very important point to distinguish.<a name=254:2></a> We have already had distinguished the place to which God has called us, and that which He has given us to occupy down here.<a name=254:3></a> You must distinguish between these, because when we are actually in the place to which God has called us -- that is, heaven -- we shall no longer occupy the place we now have down here.<a name=254:4></a> The two things are kept distinct in Scripture.<a name=254:5></a> It is very important to apprehend the place the church has in the counsels of God as unfolded in Ephesians; God's calling on high in Christ Jesus.<a name=254:6></a> But we want also to have a sense of the place in which we are set here in the line of God's ways on earth.<a name=254:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like just to touch on three things in the ways of God, which are realised, or are intended to be realised, in christians here on earth: first, a peculiar people, zealous of good works; secondly, the one flock of which Christ is the Shepherd; and thirdly, the house of God where God dwells.<a name=256:22></a>

		These are not new thoughts.<a name=257:1></a> But the remarkable thing is that while christians have properly no place here, these things come out in them morally, and the value of this practically is very great in regard to us.<a name=257:2></a> We are left down here to fill up an interval.<a name=257:3></a> Israel is set aside for the time being, but the church has come in to fill up the interval; and, while things belonging to Israel are realised in us we look for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ -- for the moment when all that God has in view will be brought to pass.<a name=257:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in regard to "a peculiar people, zealous of good works"; that is not the height of our calling, I admit, but it is a great thing that we are left down here to <i>be</i> that.<a name=257:5></a> What do you learn in that?<a name=257:6></a> You get the practical setting aside of the workings of your will; you abide in Christ.<a name=257:7></a> The other side is, that Christ abides in us, and that is of the last moment, for if Christ abides in us His mind is in us.<a name=257:8></a> We have His view of everything.<a name=257:9></a> It is a wonderful thing that it should be possible to apprehend things according to Christ.<a name=257:10></a> Our tendency is to look at things according to the outward appearance, but it is a great thing to apprehend things according to Christ.<a name=257:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as to the flock.<a name=257:12></a> What is the gain of that?<a name=257:13></a> You follow the Shepherd, and in following the Shepherd you learn what the Shepherd is.<a name=257:14></a> That is the value to us.<a name=257:15></a> A flock is not exactly the height of God's thought as to us.<a name=257:16></a> There is no flock in heaven, but it is God's thought for us down here.<a name=257:17></a> Just as I might (to return to my illustration) set my son to something that is not exactly in the height of his position.<a name=257:18></a> But the flock is a great thing for us.<a name=257:19></a> To learn the goodness of the Shepherd in following Him is a great thing.<a name=257:20></a> The Lord says, "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand".<a name=257:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23:1">Leviticus  23:1</a> - 14
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the early chapters of this book we have the "offerings"; they express the attitude of God towards the one who approaches Him by them.<a name=260:1></a> The flesh is there seen to be intolerable to God, and God will not have what is after it; He must get rid of the flesh.<a name=260:2></a> Afterwards in the 'feasts' we see how we can approach God, having learnt in the offerings His attitude towards us.<a name=260:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The feasts were institutions for Israel, but to us they represent formative principles, the means by which we are enabled to draw near.<a name=260:4></a> The chapters immediately previous bring out that man and all his doings are obnoxious to God, and that raises the question, how are we to be for God?<a name=260:5></a> It is by the formative work of the Spirit of God.<a name=260:6></a> Aaron had to go into the holiest covered by blood; man as such could not go in.<a name=260:7></a> Death was upon Israel which he represented, so Aaron had to go in with the witness of death.<a name=260:8></a> <i>Now</i> all must be by the Spirit of God.<a name=260:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first seven chapters present, as has been said, the attitude of God consequent on the offering of Christ.<a name=260:10></a> The burnt-offering was for acceptance, the sin-offering for restoration.<a name=260:11></a> Sins were not put to account when there was no law, so that there was no sin-offering until the law.<a name=260:12></a> In the peace-offering we apprehend that the cause of disturbance has been removed from before God, so that man is free to enjoy such prosperity as God may give him down here.<a name=260:13></a> Then from chapters 12 to 15 we get an idea of the sources of defilement which are in the flesh, and this is seen even from the birth.<a name=260:14></a> Then after the day of atonement, in chapters 17 to 22, we learn that the ways of the people of God must be consonant with the holiness of Jehovah, who would have neither the doings of Egypt nor of the Canaanites.<a name=260:15></a>

		We come then in chapter 23 to the feasts, in which we
	</div>

		<a name=261>[Page 261]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		can discern the principles by which we are formed for approach to God.<a name=261:1></a> The first great point in the formative work of the Spirit as illustrated in this chapter is the eating of unleavened bread; eating is appropriation, we begin with sincerity and truth.<a name=261:2></a> Then in the wave-sheaf is set forth in Christ risen the thought of acceptance for man, there is a point of rest for God.<a name=261:3></a> You begin with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, and then you apprehend man in acceptance in resurrection.<a name=261:4></a> We learn the value of the passover after we have believed the gospel; it is one thing to learn the attitude of God towards us, and another to approach God in the value of that attitude.<a name=261:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The sabbath is brought in because the rest of God is the end of all His ways.<a name=261:6></a> If you had not a prospect of enjoying the rest of God, you would not entertain the idea of approaching God now.<a name=261:7></a> You cannot get out of the life of responsibility as long as you are down here, but there is something outside of and beyond the life of responsibility.<a name=261:8></a> It is very important to apprehend God's rest, to know what God has secured for Himself.<a name=261:9></a> There is for God a point of complacency, in spite of a world of moral confusion, and that is Christ.<a name=261:10></a> The offerings present Christ in death; the feasts are connected with a living Christ.<a name=261:11></a> God rests <i>now</i> in Christ, and we labour to enter into that rest.<a name=261:12></a> We get an idea of this in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>, "Come unto <i>me</i> .<a name=261:13></a>.<a name=261:14></a>.<a name=261:15></a> and I will give you rest".<a name=261:16></a> The great point now is to find the spot where God is complacent, and this He has in Christ.<a name=261:17></a> Christ came to finish the work of God, and <i>He is</i> the finish.<a name=261:18></a> The work of the Spirit of God in us now is to bring our souls into the apprehension of this rest.<a name=261:19></a> God could not find any place of rest after sin had come in till Christ came, and if we want to find rest it must be where God rests.<a name=261:20></a>

		God's <i>activities</i> are shewn now in His ways and discipline with His people, but He wants to bring us to a point of rest, and unless we apprehend this we do not worship.<a name=261:21></a> People may praise God for His mercies, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first principle of christian life is sincerity and truth; we have to eat the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<a name=262:5></a> The sacrifice of the passover was, in the first place, for God, the unleavened bread was for the people.<a name=262:6></a> Having the Spirit, we must walk in self-judgment; the seven days of the feast represent the whole period of our time here.<a name=262:7></a> If there is not "sincerity and truth", we cannot maintain practical relations with God.<a name=262:8></a> Sincerity and truth are not found in any man until he is born again.<a name=262:9></a> No man "doeth truth" until he is born of God.<a name=262:10></a> Sincerity is that there is no kind of reserve on your part toward God.<a name=262:11></a>

		In the feast of first-fruits we have come to the sanctification of the church, to the apprehension of our being set apart for God in the Spirit.<a name=262:12></a> The harvest is for God.<a name=262:13></a> We have acceptance in Christ risen, "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=262:14></a> He is our righteousness.<a name=262:15></a> This settles every question.<a name=262:16></a> Everything unsuitable to God is excluded.<a name=262:17></a> It is not a question of how far we enter into it, but we are in acceptance in Christ risen.<a name=262:18></a> Christ is righteousness for us; if Christ risen is accepted for us, we cannot be under law.<a name=262:19></a> The apprehension in the soul of what Christ is as risen results in conformity to Christ, so that the purpose of God should be fulfilled in us.<a name=262:20></a> And this is accomplished in us now morally in the formative power of the Spirit.<a name=262:21></a> And

		The new covenant is the bearing of God towards us; reconciliation carries with it the thought of what we are in Christ to God.<a name=268:4></a> It brings us to the rejoicing over the prodigal; they began to be merry, and we never hear of their leaving off.<a name=268:5></a> It is a wonderful thing when you see the heavens opened and the glory of God and Jesus, and have no sense of the flesh which encumbers.<a name=268:6></a> The glory of God and Jesus fills the universe of bliss.<a name=268:7></a> When you apprehend the glory of God and Jesus, you apprehend all God's ways, there is nothing beyond; Stephen saw it.<a name=268:8></a> Stephen's address (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>) showed how everything had failed that God had been in down here, but he saw the glory of God and Jesus -- a <i>Man</i> who could abide the glory.<a name=268:9></a> The "world to come" is a foreshadowing of what will abide, we have the Spirit of God to bring us into the good of it <i>now</i>.<a name=268:10></a> Stephen reached that point; afterwards Paul carries on the ministry from that point.<a name=268:11></a> Paul <i>declared</i> it and maintained it.<a name=268:12></a> The disposition ever since has been to drop down from that level -- the glory of God and Jesus, and the flesh all gone for God.<a name=268:13></a> God is waiting for the display of His glory; He has to veil it till He has that which is according to His glory.<a name=268:14></a>

		The first great thought is that God has a Man who can abide His glory; then comes the church -- the heavenly city, and that is <i>of</i> Himself -- His own work, and thus it will abide His glory.<a name=268:15></a> There is glory to God in the church in Christ Jesus.<a name=268:16></a> The church is the medium for the display of the glory.<a name=268:17></a> The great point connected with the heavenly city is that it has the glory of God.<a name=268:18></a> No flesh can enter there, it is all glory.<a name=268:19></a>

		I took up this passage as indicating that it is a point of the greatest importance to get a distinct and definite idea in regard to <i>Christ</i>.<a name=270:1></a> The great mainstay in christianity is <i>Christ</i>.<a name=270:2></a> I feel more and more that Christ is the immovable rock -- nothing is a real rock except Christ -- and what I want is to give two or three points which come out here in regard to Him.<a name=270:3></a> The more we know of Him the more likely we are to be kept, and we shall get enlargement of mind.<a name=270:4></a> If a man wants to be enlarged in mind, it will be by the knowledge of Christ.<a name=270:5></a> Some people say you get enlargement of mind by reading, and some men read a vast amount, but their minds do not get enlargement morally -- that consists in the knowledge of Christ.<a name=270:6></a> They go back, after all, to things which are after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<a name=270:7></a> God brings before us what is after <i>Christ</i>.<a name=270:8></a> "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".<a name=270:9></a> Then you are likely to get great enlargement, morally as well as in mind.<a name=270:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question is between Christ and the world, because in Christ God sets forth His glory, and the world is the scene of <i>man's</i> glory, where <i>man</i> seeks for glory, and hence the system of the world, in its very nature, must be antagonistic to God, because God alone is to be glorified.<a name=270:11></a> In Isaiah it speaks of the day of the Lord, but the point of it is that God <i>alone</i> is to be glorified in that day.<a name=270:12></a> He will not tolerate anything that does not bring glory to Him.<a name=270:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am quite certain that no one would pretend that the glory of man is of God.<a name=270:14></a> You find very unrighteous and very wicked men glorified by this world, but a man would be very blind to think that could be of God.<a name=270:15></a> "Which receive honour one of another, and seek not

		the honour that cometh from God only".<a name=271:1></a> There is a great deal of honour in the world, but no one could think there was any honour from God.<a name=271:2></a> No one, as I said, can gainsay that on the one hand, God sets forth His glory in Christ -- that which has, and will, come to pass in Him -- and that, on the other hand, the world is a system of things where man has glory, but not from God.<a name=271:3></a> Therefore Christ and the world are antagonistic.<a name=271:4></a> The world has been tested by Christ, and now the spirit of antichrist is in the world, but this did not appear until Christ came.<a name=271:5></a> The apostle John says, "even now are there many antichrists".<a name=271:6></a> The system of the world will find its head in antichrist himself; who is yet to come.<a name=271:7></a> Apostasy is turning away from all revealed truth; it paves the way for antichrist, but the point is, there are many antichrists <i>now</i>.<a name=271:8></a> You find men denying the Father and the Son, and you find scepticism with regard to revelation.<a name=271:9></a> There was none of this until Christ came.<a name=271:10></a> All the spirit and power of antichrist is working down here to set aside, if possible, the idea of God.<a name=271:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two lines taken by the spirit of antichrist, the first is the denial that Jesus is the Christ, and the second is the denial of the Father and the Son.<a name=271:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There may be progress of a certain kind in the world as it is, but exaltation and honour in the eyes of man is only a proof that the world must be antagonistic to God and His glory.<a name=271:13></a> I can understand the statement of James, "Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God".<a name=271:14></a>

		Now, beloved friends, we are in the world, and we are liable to be affected by the influences about us, and the great question in regard to each one of us is as between Christ and the world.<a name=271:15></a> We cannot have the two -- they are absolutely antagonistic.<a name=271:16></a> Christ is the Head and centre of another world, and it is impossible for a man to have his heart in both worlds.<a name=271:17></a> Faith always connects itself with the world to come.<a name=271:18></a> God gave to men in the world, here and there, light as to the world to come, and

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now come to the passage I have read.<a name=272:2></a> I assume that all here would admit that Christ is the Son of God.<a name=272:3></a> That is the point of the gospel of John.<a name=272:4></a> "These [things] are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God".<a name=272:5></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>.<a name=272:6></a> "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God".<a name=272:7></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:34">John  1:34</a>.<a name=272:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just distinguish the gospels.<a name=272:9></a> In Matthew, Christ is spoken of as the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, the Son according to promise.<a name=272:10></a> In Mark, He is the Son of God, God's Servant.<a name=272:11></a> In Luke, He is the Son of man; and in John, the Son of God in all the greatness of His Person.<a name=272:12></a> Matthew and Luke present Christ under what I may call official titles, but in John the great point is the Person of the Son of God.<a name=272:13></a> So in chapter 2 the Lord says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=272:14></a> He spake of the temple of His body -- God was there.<a name=272:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the chapter I have referred to, you get the Son of God spoken of in three lights, and you get what I may call the climax in the beginning of chapter 2 (Read verses 17, 18, 33, 34, 48, 49.<a name=272:16></a>) These three passages are before me because they give us what is characteristic of the Son of God.<a name=272:17></a> Each presents the Son of God to us in a very distinct light, and we have to take in the whole to get the complete thought.<a name=272:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, He declares God.<a name=272:19></a> If He be the Son of God, in the very nature of things He declares God.<a name=272:20></a> He comes from God, and He declares God.<a name=272:21></a> God has come out in Him.<a name=272:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second passage you get another thing -- He baptises with the Holy Spirit; that is, He brings in the influence of the Holy Spirit to bear upon man in connection with the testimony, and in the third passage, in connection with Nathanael, He is privy to all the exercises of His people.<a name=272:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My object in speaking is to put these three thoughts

		<a name=273>[Page 273]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		together, to make them centre in the Son of God, and you get the consummation in the beginning of chapter 2; I will touch upon them in detail.<a name=273:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first, you see Christ contrasted with Moses -- "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ".<a name=273:2></a> "Grace and truth" were not <i>given</i>, they <i>came to pass</i> by Jesus Christ.<a name=273:3></a> No <i>man</i> could exercise grace and truth towards man; it could not be by the law and the prophets, but grace and truth came to pass by Jesus Christ, and the secret of it is given, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=273:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That which marks the present time is that God is declared, all the mind of God is declared, and everything is based on that great fact.<a name=273:5></a> God is love, and we have got the perfect expression of divine love in Christ.<a name=273:6></a> "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=273:7></a> Until the gospel came into the world, man had no idea of love.<a name=273:8></a> If you search for it amongst the ancient Greeks, you will not find it; all man's notions of love were completely debased, there was no true thought of love.<a name=273:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Christ has <i>declared God</i>.<a name=273:10></a> What could be greater?<a name=273:11></a> Whatever the Son of God came to do, the greatest thing was to declare God.<a name=273:12></a> I am not insensible to the greatness of redemption, but what transcends all is that <i>God is declared</i>.<a name=273:13></a> God is now in the light of declaration.<a name=273:14></a> John says, "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all", and "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light," <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>, 7.<a name=273:15></a> God has come out according to His own nature, because the Son has declared Him.<a name=273:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are brought into the light; it is a wonderful moment when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, and we are really in the light of God.<a name=273:17></a> "In him is no darkness at all".<a name=273:18></a> "God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us".<a name=273:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is in connection with the Spirit -- that He baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=273:20></a> It was indicated to

		John the baptist that upon whom he should see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same was He that would baptise with the Holy Spirit, and John adds, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God".<a name=274:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, I want to dwell a little more fully on this.<a name=274:2></a> It was a wonderful thing that had come to pass that there was a Man down here on whom the Spirit could come to <i>abide</i>.<a name=274:3></a> We read of the Spirit coming upon men, upon Samson, for instance, but He did not abide on them.<a name=274:4></a> On <i>Christ</i> He descended and <i>abode</i>.<a name=274:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"He which baptizeth with the Holy Spirit" I understand to mean that Christ is to bring all under the influence of what God is, that is the result of Christ's coming into the world.<a name=274:6></a> He was the anointed Man, and He was the beginning of things for God.<a name=274:7></a> The starting point of the ways of God, in that sense, was Christ anointed with the Holy Spirit.<a name=274:8></a> In this way the whole order of things was altered.<a name=274:9></a> Who could bring that about -- who could baptise with the Holy Spirit -- but the Son of God?<a name=274:10></a> In this chapter it is the <i>Person</i> who is before us, the One who is competent to declare God and to baptise with the Holy Spirit.<a name=274:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved friends, everyone would admit that the beginning of all things in God's world is the anointed Man.<a name=274:12></a> All began with Christ, and, in that sense, He is the Head of every man, and then there is another thing -- He accomplished redemption.<a name=274:13></a> He takes up all the liabilities of man and settles them.<a name=274:14></a> Further than this, He is the last Adam, the quickening Spirit, who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=274:15></a> Who but the Son of God could accomplish all this?<a name=274:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with regard to the third point (verses 43 - 51), the Son of God was recognised here by Nathanael, and He was privy to all the exercises through which Nathanael was passing.<a name=274:17></a> "When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee".<a name=274:18></a> It is in the same way we get the conviction
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=275>[Page 275]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the truth -- it is in this way I am searched by Scripture.<a name=275:1></a> I am searched and known.<a name=275:2></a> We are not told what passed under the fig-tree, but what was brought home to Nathanael was that he was searched -- Christ was privy to all his exercises.<a name=275:3></a> He knew Nathanael individually, and his individual exercises.<a name=275:4></a> Nathanael was known to the Lord.<a name=275:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the response -- "thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".<a name=275:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get from it all, the great thought connected with the Son of God that He is privy to all the exercises through which men pass with regard to God.<a name=275:7></a> God knows how to bring about exercise in man.<a name=275:8></a> There is a variety of ways in which God speaks to man -- by sickness, by circumstances; God has His own way, and men pass through exercise as the effect of the work of God.<a name=275:9></a> But the Son of God is privy to all the exercises -- as He said to Nathanael, "when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee", and it is blessed when the response comes, "thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".<a name=275:10></a>

		Now, beloved friends, I want to put these three things together -- they are very simple -- He declared God, He baptises with the Holy Spirit, and He is privy to the exercises of man.<a name=275:11></a> All this gives us a great idea of the Son of God.<a name=275:12></a> Just think of the competency of Christ to declare God, and that He should have the Spirit of God, so to speak, at His command to baptise with.<a name=275:13></a> The Holy Spirit is content to become the servant of Christ.<a name=275:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, further than this, that He should see all that is passing in the soul of man with regard to God!<a name=275:15></a> The Lord says of Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<a name=275:16></a>" He was a true Israelite, there was no kind of concealment, nothing hid, all was naked in the presence of God, and it is such a one who can give the suitable response, "thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".<a name=275:17></a>

		Now in chapter 2 we see the Lord acting here in the power of resurrection ("the third day").<a name=276:4></a> That assumes that redemption has been accomplished.<a name=276:5></a> That is the meaning of God acting in the power of resurrection.<a name=276:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the world to come, resurrection is the great principle.<a name=276:7></a> Israel is revived, and the nations are revived; everything in the world to come will be revived towards God.<a name=276:8></a> Christ was the true Israel -- "I .<a name=276:9></a>.<a name=276:10></a>.<a name=276:11></a> called my son out of Egypt" -- and He was a light to the gentiles.<a name=276:12></a> The restoration of Israel is life from the dead -- the great principle on which God acts -- the power of resurrection can come in because redemption has been accomplished.<a name=276:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in this second chapter, Christ turns the water of purification into wine -- "wine which gladdeneth the heart of man".<a name=276:14></a> The water of purification, in the power of Christ, really becomes the means of cheering the heart of man.<a name=276:15></a> The great hindrance to a man's joy is himself.<a name=276:16></a> I find out that I have not done with myself; I find that I myself have a certain place, and it is a great hindrance to my joy.<a name=276:17></a> Hence a christian has to become like a little child -- of no importance in his own eyes.<a name=276:18></a> I feel there is a vast amount of joy there for me, and I cannot enter into it because I have a certain importance in my own eyes.<a name=276:19></a> I am not prepared for the complete setting aside of myself.<a name=276:20></a> You want the water of purification in order to be purified.<a name=276:21></a> What from?<a name=276:22></a> From all importance in your own eyes, and from the world.<a name=276:23></a> When a man is purified from importance in his own eyes, he is purified from the world.<a name=276:24></a> The world is the scene of moral impurity, and if

		The light of God and His love brings one to the sense of one's own nothingness, then the water of purification is effectual, and there is joy and delight in the knowledge of God.<a name=277:10></a> The water of purification, in the power of resurrection, becomes the wine of joy.<a name=277:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this will find its complete fulfilment in the millennium.<a name=277:12></a> Nathanael represents a true Israelite according to God.<a name=277:13></a> What comes out in chapter 2 is what Christ will effect in Israel.<a name=277:14></a> First, they will be purged from themselves and the contamination of the world, and then, because redemption is accomplished, the water of purification will be turned for them into the wine of joy -- there will be the feast of tabernacles.<a name=277:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is all bound up with the Person of the Son of God.<a name=277:16></a> It is a great thing to get the apprehension of Christ in the light of His Person, and of what is characteristic of the Person.<a name=277:17></a> He declares God, He baptises with the Holy Spirit, and He is privy to all the exercises of man.<a name=277:18></a> It is very wonderful that each of us who are christians is known by the Son of God, that we have come under the

		Now, beloved friends, in the passage in Colossians which I read, all has reference to the Son of God's love.<a name=280:3></a> It does not state things in the same way as in Ephesians.<a name=280:4></a> These are not the things which are given to you, but what properly belongs to Him, the Son of the Father's love.<a name=280:5></a> "Who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love".<a name=280:6></a> Then we get a good deal predicated of the Son of His love in connection with taking up "all things".<a name=280:7></a> "All things" are taken up on two grounds -- first on the ground of creation, and then on the ground of reconciliation.<a name=280:8></a> These correspond with the two passages I have read in Revelation, "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created," while in chapter 5, the same things are taken up on the ground of redemption.<a name=280:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, we often talk of the world to come -- we are more accustomed to talk about it than formerly.<a name=280:10></a> The world to come is extremely important.<a name=280:11></a> Sometimes we speak of it as another world -- well, morally it is another world.<a name=280:12></a> This world has been built up on man departed from God, and the world to come is built up, so to speak, on Christ, and it is another world morally.<a name=280:13></a> As to the principles prevailing in the world to come, they are in the strongest contrast to those in this world.<a name=280:14></a> The principles of this world are the "lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life", but those of the world to come are righteousness and the love of God.<a name=280:15></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=281>[Page 281]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to this world.<a name=281:1></a> You get the expression "all things" several times in Colossians and also in Revelation.<a name=281:2></a> "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they <i>are</i>, and were created".<a name=281:3></a> What was created?<a name=281:4></a> "All things".<a name=281:5></a> "All things" belong to this world, but they are taken up by Christ -- they come under another Head, they are brought on to another ground.<a name=281:6></a> They are taken up, as I said, on the ground of creation first, and then on the ground of reconciliation.<a name=281:7></a> In both passages I have read you get the expression "all things".<a name=281:8></a> In heaven and earth all things were created by Christ and for Him, and He has "made peace by the blood of his cross".<a name=281:9></a> All is brought out in connection with reconciliation, while <i>we</i> get the present application given to us, "You .<a name=281:10></a>.<a name=281:11></a>.<a name=281:12></a> <i>now</i> hath he reconciled".<a name=281:13></a> We have to wait for the reconciliation of all things, but now it is said of us, "You .<a name=281:14></a>.<a name=281:15></a>.<a name=281:16></a> now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy, and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight".<a name=281:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, I come back, for a moment, to the subject of creation.<a name=281:18></a> He is the pre-eminent One in regard to everything created -- "All things were created by him, and for him".<a name=281:19></a> If you follow that out it gives a remarkable character to the Old Testament.<a name=281:20></a> You find there a vast number of things set up in the hand of man -- thrones and dominions and governments.<a name=281:21></a> Dominion was given to Adam over all creation.<a name=281:22></a> Then if you pass on to the time of the flood, God entrusted to Noah the sword of government, and later still God established the throne of David.<a name=281:23></a> Then another thing comes out in connection with David -- you get the headship of the gentiles.<a name=281:24></a> There are many things in the Old Testament I have not referred to, but I have just taken up these familiar ones.<a name=281:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all these things which were put under the hand of man failed, as we see, first of all, in Adam.<a name=281:26></a> So, too, the sword of government was entrusted to Noah, but Noah failed.<a name=281:27></a> God also had promised to establish David in the throne of Israel, but David failed in it, although dominion

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=282>[Page 282]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was revived in Solomon, who also failed.<a name=282:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It gives great interest to the Old Testament when you apprehend that all things were created by Christ, and for Him, as in Colossians, while Revelation expresses it, "For thy pleasure they are and were created".<a name=282:2></a> Now mark this -- "He is before all things, and by him all things consist".<a name=282:3></a> The different things I have referred to in the Old Testament all came in successively -- the throne of David followed the sword of government, and the sword of government followed the dominion given to Adam.<a name=282:4></a> You find the truth of all this brought out in the Old Testament, but these things were never connected, they never "consisted", or stood together.<a name=282:5></a> Now Christ is "before all things, and by him all things <i>consist</i>" -- all are gathered together in Him.<a name=282:6></a> God has made known the mystery of His will, to gather together in one all things in Christ.<a name=282:7></a> So, beloved friends, dominion is in the hand of Christ -- government and thrones are in the hand of Christ.<a name=282:8></a> The angel said to Mary, "he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever".<a name=282:9></a> So, too, He is the Head of the gentiles.<a name=282:10></a> This comes out in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>-- "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion, .<a name=282:11></a>.<a name=282:12></a>.<a name=282:13></a> Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee, .<a name=282:14></a>.<a name=282:15></a>.<a name=282:16></a> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession".<a name=282:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus all these things are taken up in Christ, and it gives great interest to the Old Testament when you study it, and see that all that God has established from time to time was created in view of Christ, and also created by Him.<a name=282:18></a> Hence when the Son of God becomes Man, He takes up all as Man, and on the ground of creation.<a name=282:19></a> "For thy pleasure they are and were created".<a name=282:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when Christ takes up all things, He finds man in possession, and man has to be dispossessed.<a name=282:21></a> When the Lord comes, He will not consider the rights of man at all.<a name=282:22></a> All that is of man will be entirely swept aside, and everything will be taken up on the ground of creation.<a name=282:23></a> Man has no rights except providential rights.<a name=282:24></a> <i>We</i> have to respect

	<div class="paragraph">
		the providential rights of man, but <i>Christ</i> will not respect them.<a name=283:1></a> He will sweep aside every such right, and take up all things on the ground that "all things were created by him, and for him: .<a name=283:2></a>.<a name=283:3></a>.<a name=283:4></a> and by him all things consist".<a name=283:5></a> I regard it as very important, beloved friends, to apprehend the ground on which Christ takes up all things according to God.<a name=283:6></a> He is "the first-born of every creature, .<a name=283:7></a>.<a name=283:8></a>.<a name=283:9></a> and by him all things consist".<a name=283:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we will pass on in the passage in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>to verses 18 - 22.<a name=283:11></a> In these verses you get an entirely different thought brought in, just as in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5">Revelation  5</a>, everything is taken up on the ground of redemption, and blessing and glory and honour are ascribed to Christ on that ground.<a name=283:12></a> Here in Colossians everything is taken up on the ground of reconciliation.<a name=283:13></a> This, so to speak, is collateral with what we have in Revelation.<a name=283:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All creation was the handiwork of God, but it did not <i>reveal</i> God.<a name=283:15></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a>.<a name=283:16></a> Men had the witness of creation, but it did not bring to light God's nature and character.<a name=283:17></a> Now, beloved friends, the Son of the Father's love has <i>revealed</i> Him.<a name=283:18></a> The most important fact that has come to light is that He has <i>revealed</i> Him.<a name=283:19></a> That is what I understand by "all fulness" dwelling in Christ.<a name=283:20></a> The Father was revealed and all the light of God came out in Christ for the first time.<a name=283:21></a> In the Old Testament, God interfered with the affairs of the world continually, although men were not willing that He should, but we do not get God <i>revealed</i>.<a name=283:22></a> "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath <i>declared</i> him".<a name=283:23></a>

		Put these two things together -- God revealed and man removed, they are two great things which come out in the death of Christ.<a name=284:6></a> "He made peace by the blood of his cross" in order to "reconcile all things unto himself".<a name=284:7></a> He brings everything, so to speak, into divine complacency by Himself taking up everything.<a name=284:8></a> That is the great scheme of reconciliation, that all things that God has established on earth will be brought under divine complacency by Christ's taking up all things -- the One who "made peace by the blood of his cross".<a name=284:9></a> Christ takes things up, not simply on the ground of creation, but also of redemption.<a name=284:10></a> He has made peace, and the practical result is that one Man is substituted for another.<a name=284:11></a> The one who brought confusion into the world had to be removed, and instead there was the Man who brought in God's glory.<a name=284:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What practically results is, "Death is swallowed up in victory".<a name=284:17></a> Why?<a name=284:18></a> Because Christ has annulled death, and there will be no more curse.<a name=284:19></a> There is the curse at the present time, but Christ was made a curse.<a name=284:20></a> Christ has taken up every liability which lay on man, that man may

		I think it is a wonderful thing for us to prove the way in which God is pleased now to act towards us.<a name=366:1></a> In all our minds, until we are set right by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, we think God requires us to be something.<a name=366:2></a> No one here would think of looking anywhere for salvation but in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=366:3></a> Everything there depends entirely on what has been wrought by the Lord Jesus -- it is the foundation of the faith of the soul for eternity.<a name=366:4></a> There faith rests entirely for eternity, as on the solid rock that cannot be moved -- on the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=366:5></a>

		It is when we come to the christian pathway that we make mistakes.<a name=366:6></a> The moment Israel really were brought into the truth of redemption, then began the wilderness pathway where they were tested.<a name=366:7></a> The great point of the testing was, were their hearts really towards God?<a name=366:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not say they broke down.<a name=366:9></a> The object of the pathway is testing; it is there where we often have an idea of a kind of requirement.<a name=366:10></a> While it is here that responsibility attaches to us, the great matter of responsibility is, that I have not the slightest confidence in myself.<a name=366:11></a> There are "ifs" -- "if we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit".<a name=366:12></a> But if there are "ifs" with regard to our responsible life down here, it is not if <i>you</i> do anything -- it is not that you and I can walk through the wilderness in any strength of our own.<a name=366:13></a> The contrast is brought out in the gospel of Matthew, chapter 21: 33, the parable referred to their responsibility.<a name=366:14></a> "There was a householder who planted a vineyard .<a name=366:15></a>.<a name=366:16></a>.<a name=366:17></a> and let it out to husbandmen .<a name=366:18></a>.<a name=366:19></a>.<a name=366:20></a> But when the time of fruit drew near, he sent his bondmen to the husbandmen to receive his fruits".<a name=366:21></a> He sent his servants to demand the fruit -- there was responsibility.<a name=366:22></a> That was the way in which God

		regarded the system of judaism, but there is nothing such as that in christianity -- the fruit must come from God, but you do not get that in the parable of the husbandmen, they did not yield the fruits.<a name=367:1></a> When the final point came, it was found that their hearts were really enmity against God.<a name=367:2></a> They slew His servants, and when the Son came they said "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance".<a name=367:3></a> There is the end of responsibility and it only brings out that in the heart of man there is enmity against God and that came out in the slaying of His own dear Son.<a name=367:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You might say, "But that is what the Jews did, you do not mean to say that I would do it?<a name=367:5></a>" No, I do not believe you would, but if you have learned your own heart, you would know that your flesh would.<a name=367:6></a> If you were to walk according to flesh, I do not know where you would get to.<a name=367:7></a> It was their walk through the wilderness that gives us to learn that.<a name=367:8></a> When Israel came to the brazen serpent, after forty years of the wilderness experience, the flesh in them was just as bad as at the beginning.<a name=367:9></a> That showed what the flesh was, and the great thing for us is to have no confidence in the flesh.<a name=367:10></a> Where you really learn it best is in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=367:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The parable I referred to first is followed by another where you do not get anything about man's responsibility, but God acting according to His own pleasure -- <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>, "A king who made a wedding feast for his son".<a name=367:12></a> The great point was the pleasure God had in His Son, and that is the other side of the matter.<a name=367:13></a> God did not say to man, 'There is My beloved Son and you ought to love Him', He says 'There is My beloved Son and I love Him'.<a name=367:14></a> "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=367:15></a> The moment you get to that you are entirely off the ground of responsibility.<a name=367:16></a> God will invite guests to come and see the love He has got for His Son, and if the question of fitness comes in, God provides the fitness -- everybody can come.<a name=367:17></a> When

		Now I have spoken of the failure of the church, and we can see from scripture how the church has failed.<a name=370:2></a> You must see how largely the coming of the Lord Jesus was enjoyed amongst the saints in the early days, but the church has forgotten what is in the heavens and has ceased to be the witness down here of the riches that are in Christ which she had had the knowledge of, but thank God we have been aroused a little, "awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ" -- there is no time stated.<a name=370:3></a> Supposing there had been in scripture a day set when the Lord Jesus should come, what would be the effect on souls?<a name=370:4></a> They would say, 'The Lord is not coming yet, we need not trouble ourselves about that'.<a name=370:5></a> But there is no excuse for the church going on with the world.<a name=370:6></a> The thing to me is, not 'when' the Lord is coming.<a name=370:7></a> His coming is not a matter of time.<a name=370:8></a> Dear friends, morally that is of no consequence.<a name=370:9></a> The nearness is this -- not of time but of affection, that the coming of the Lord is near to our hearts, that we love His appearing, not that we can calculate His appearing, but love it and thus the Lord's coming is near.<a name=370:10></a> Now it is so with us here, that all those unsearchable riches of the Christ are hidden in the heavens, and the church is made the testimony of it.<a name=370:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now verse 4, "the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus".<a name=370:12></a> I want you to see the way in which we are set in complete privilege, not in demand at all, and all the privilege in our Lord Jesus Christ -- not a question of "through" Him but "in" Him.<a name=370:13></a> And again, "of him are ye in Christ Jesus".<a name=370:14></a> Now what is the effect of all that on our hearts?<a name=370:15></a> I take the case of a poor man in a cottage and a rich man in his mansion.<a name=370:16></a> All the wants of the poor man are supplied by him, whatever necessity arises, he causes it to be met.<a name=370:17></a> But the poor man lives in his cottage and the rich man in his mansion.<a name=370:18></a> There is a great difference, however the grace may come, but if I have all the grace "in Christ", it shows I must be near

		Him.<a name=371:1></a> You must know that it is not merely that you have to send a prayer up to the throne of grace, so as to bring a favour down, but, beloved friends, by the Holy Spirit of God you know that God has made the saints down here the testimony of Christ.<a name=371:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 5, "that in everything ye have been enriched in him" -- it is all "in him".<a name=371:3></a> The church is a company of saints that is enriched "in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge", that is the great privilege of the assembly of God.<a name=371:4></a> The great thing for us is to understand what our privilege is and that the Spirit of God is here that we may enter into all the unsearchable riches of Christ, and that the coming day may be near to us, not as a matter of time, but that we love His appearing.<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that is connected with the church is that we should be held together in unity.<a name=371:6></a> I refer to what the Lord said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "that they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us", the unity of divine love, the Father loving the Son and the Son loving the Father.<a name=371:7></a> Now if we are kept in the sense of that, we are taken so clean off the ground of responsibility and brought so on to the ground of privilege, that everything might be according to what is in Christ Jesus -- we should be brought into that.<a name=371:8></a> Now that is what the Lord prays for all who are now on the ground of responsibility.<a name=371:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a wonderful thing unity is, unity of saints is the great testimony that we are free from man and free from the world.<a name=371:10></a> Oh!<a name=371:11></a> how wonderful the privilege we are brought into, how dim all this was to those Corinthians, how little they entered into it, so the apostle brings in the cross.<a name=371:12></a> If I look at the cross what do I see?<a name=371:13></a> That all I am and was, God hung it up to shame on the cross of Christ, so that I know that I cannot boast in anything of mine but only in my shame -- "their glory in their shame".<a name=371:14></a> God has hung it all up to shame that there should be no glorying in man or anything of the

		I have just read these two passages, not exactly to attempt to expound them, but more for the sake of the contrast which they present.<a name=373:1></a> You see it is the contrast of two men: that of the man driven out, and the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in His wings.<a name=373:2></a> The contrast between the two is what I want to speak a little of tonight, and to try to shew you that the Sun of righteousness has come into view for us, and how we stand in relation to Him.<a name=373:3></a> I think it is a point of great moment to seize the idea of the Sun of righteousness.<a name=373:4></a> We have often read the verse in the prophecy, but I am not sure whether we have apprehended the force and bearing of it.<a name=373:5></a> That is the great point with regard to scripture; not simply to dwell on statements of scripture, but to know the import of those statements.<a name=373:6></a> Taking scripture up in a dogmatic way is not the best way.<a name=373:7></a> Many rest on statements of scripture, but we want to know the why and the how of all that scripture sets forth, and that is what the Spirit of God reveals.<a name=373:8></a> For instance, if you take the very simple expression we get here, "the Sun of righteousness", what is the import of "the Sun of righteousness"?<a name=373:9></a> Have you studied that?<a name=373:10></a> I want to bring it before you in contrast to what I read in the beginning of Genesis.<a name=373:11></a> It has often been said, that in Genesis we get all the roots, and in Revelation the full blown fruit.<a name=373:12></a> Genesis is the beginning, and you get the ultimate close of things in the Revelation.<a name=373:13></a> Scripture is one connected whole, shewing how God works out His way, and what the end of that way is.<a name=373:14></a> Scripture is not the invention of man.<a name=373:15></a> I do not think men would ever have agreed to traverse all that ground.<a name=373:16></a> Scripture was not written contemporaneously.<a name=373:17></a> It was written at different times and by different people; but it is one

		complete whole.<a name=374:1></a> Genesis gives the beginning of things, and the working out of God's way is brought before us until you come to the final issue in the Revelation.<a name=374:2></a> You get the complete disentanglement of good and evil, so that each, in final result, finds its own place.<a name=374:3></a> You have presented to you in the Revelation on the one hand the lake of fire, and on the other hand the new heaven and the new earth.<a name=374:4></a> I take the meaning of that to be that God is pleased to bring before us the ultimate result, and to shew us that evil and good in ultimate result each find their own place.<a name=374:5></a> Evil finds its place with the source of evil in the lake of fire, and all good finds its place with God; and that is the new heaven and the new earth.<a name=374:6></a> Now, if we go back to Genesis, what we find is, that the man is driven out of paradise.<a name=374:7></a> He was no longer to be in the place which God frequented.<a name=374:8></a> The garden of Eden was where the tree of life was, it was the place which God frequented, and from that place God drove out the man.<a name=374:9></a> That man's sun set in darkness.<a name=374:10></a> It is a remarkable fact, but you scarcely get any further mention of that man -- of Adam.<a name=374:11></a> You read that he begat a son in his own likeness, and another son, and that he died.<a name=374:12></a> But as to the history of that man, we have none.<a name=374:13></a> That man is looked at in scripture as the man by whom sin came into the world, and death by sin, and the effect of this is he went into distance and darkness and death as the result of sin.<a name=374:14></a> He came under the power of death.<a name=374:15></a> That is what came to pass in Adam as the result of sin.<a name=374:16></a> Man had rebelled against God, had disobeyed Him, and had become alienated in heart from God, and God drove him out -- his sun set in darkness.<a name=374:17></a> That is the fact in regard to man whatever appearance man may get in the world.<a name=374:18></a> With all man's boasting, where is the man who evades death?<a name=374:19></a> Whatever advances men may make in the world in the way of discovery, man has not found any way to evade death.<a name=374:20></a> "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin".<a name=374:21></a> Neither can men find God.<a name=374:22></a> Indeed they are content to be without God, and they

		are becoming increasingly so, because they know if God comes in they will be rebuked.<a name=375:1></a> I believe that is why people hate scripture, because God rebukes them in it.<a name=375:2></a> God will not condone sin, pride, lust: if God comes in all that is rebuked, therefore men are content to be without God.<a name=375:3></a> But they cannot evade death.<a name=375:4></a> Man cannot relieve himself of the consequence of sin; he suffers many an ill in this world (disguise it as he may), and the course of man down here terminates in death, and that inevitably.<a name=375:5></a> In that respect the most intelligent, the most cultured and refined man really does not differ from the savage: "One thing befalleth them" -- death.<a name=375:6></a> Death is the common end of savage and civilised.<a name=375:7></a> The sun of man set in darkness because he rebelled against God; he practically lost God and went into death and darkness.<a name=375:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in contrast, we get in the end of Malachi, "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings".<a name=375:9></a> The figure employed is an extremely beautiful one, "the Sun of righteousness".<a name=375:10></a> I have no doubt that like every other prophecy, its literal application refers to the kingdom in the future; I do not think in strict application it refers to the present moment, but to Israel.<a name=375:11></a> "Ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.<a name=375:12></a> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord, of hosts".<a name=375:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That no doubt applies actually to Israel in the coming of the Sun above the horizon; that I may come to presently, as God may help me, but the Sun of righteousness is hidden now; He has not yet arisen above the horizon of man's vision.<a name=375:14></a> The sun in natural things is there in the early morning, but you do not see it until it is above the horizon; it is there all night long, but you do not see it in the night because the sun is set.<a name=375:15></a> It is gone below the horizon of man's vision.<a name=375:16></a> But the sun is there.<a name=375:17></a> When the morning comes you first see the morning star before the sun rises with healing in his

		wings.<a name=376:1></a> We find in natural things that people are sickly and weak unless they have plenty of the light and warmth of the sun; health does not flourish where people do not get the beneficial effects of the sun.<a name=376:2></a> Delicate people go to climes and parts of the world where they can have the benefit of the sun's light and warmth.<a name=376:3></a> Well, we read here that the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in His wings.<a name=376:4></a> Now, there can be no question that the allusion is to Christ, and to the truth of the character in which Christ will arise in the time to come.<a name=376:5></a> I was saying at the beginning that man's sun has set in death and darkness, but I come a little closer; here, Israel's sun had set in darkness and death.<a name=376:6></a> They were in captivity.<a name=376:7></a> God had allowed them to be scattered and brought into captivity to the gentiles.<a name=376:8></a> Jerusalem was in bondage to gentile power and the sun of Israel had set in darkness.<a name=376:9></a> It was a dark moment for the Jews in Malachi's day; it was some four or five hundred years before Christ came; and they got no more prophetic word after this.<a name=376:10></a> The prophetic word was the light of the people so long as it continued; but it ceased.<a name=376:11></a> Israel was to be a light in the world, but here the light of Israel had set in darkness and death.<a name=376:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you get a contrast to this in the promise: "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings".<a name=376:13></a> That is what I dwell upon for a moment, it is so extremely important as it throws light on the coming day.<a name=376:14></a> That is what will come to pass; the Sun of righteousness will arise with healing in His wings in regard to this world; and this world in a kind of way will be healed; you get the thought in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:29">John  1:29</a>, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"; He baptizes with the Holy Spirit; He gives life to the world; He came to save the world.<a name=376:15></a> That will be fulfilled when the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in His wings, and everything will then be revived for God.<a name=376:16></a> Everything that God ever set up upon the earth will be revived for

	<div class="paragraph">
		My point now is, as God may help me, to give you an idea of the Sun of righteousness, and to attempt to bring before you, if I can, that for us, that is for faith, the Sun of righteousness is already there; and I go a point further, that we, as believers, stand in relation to the Sun of righteousness.<a name=377:3></a> Now I will tell you what I understand by the Sun of righteousness; I understand the Sun of righteousness to be the Head and centre of the universe of bliss,

		It is important to notice one feature which marks the so-called catholic epistles; that is, those which are not addressed to any particular church, such as this epistle and the first epistles of Peter and John.<a name=386:1></a> It has been pointed out that all these contemplate the last time.<a name=386:2></a> Even the epistles written to individuals have that character, for instance, Paul's epistles to Timothy and Titus.<a name=386:3></a> They refer to the last days.<a name=386:4></a> They all contemplate the decay of christianity as a witness here.<a name=386:5></a> This is very much brought out in this epistle, and the same principle comes out in the writings of John.<a name=386:6></a> John speaks of the last time.<a name=386:7></a> "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time".<a name=386:8></a> There were many antichrists in the days of John and there are plenty of them in our time.<a name=386:9></a> John does not look forward to the last time, because in fact it had set in before the apostles passed off the scene.<a name=386:10></a> It is a very important point to bear this in mind.<a name=386:11></a> The time had not yet come for the revelation of antichrist himself, but there were many antichrists in that day; and I do not think we can doubt there are many antichrists in this day.<a name=386:12></a> In the first epistle of Peter it says, "the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God", because the house of God did not answer entirely to the mind of God.<a name=386:13></a> It was not the idea of the house of God at the outset that judgment should begin there.<a name=386:14></a> When we get the house of God in the early days of the apostles when they "had all things common" you would not connect the judgment of God with that; but even in Peter's time (and Peter could go back to the day of Pentecost) he has to say, "the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God".<a name=386:15></a>

		And in this second epistle it is much more advanced; you have only to read this second epistle and you will see a very dark picture drawn of what had come to pass, the introduction of damnable heresies that men would bring in, and that in that way christianity as a system on earth would be vitiated.<a name=387:1></a> That is what comes out in chapter 2 of this second epistle.<a name=387:2></a> When that comes to be the case you may depend upon it one thing is certain to happen, the kingdom will come into view.<a name=387:3></a> The same principle comes out in the Revelation.<a name=387:4></a> After the addresses to the seven churches, then you get judgment, and the introduction of the kingdom.<a name=387:5></a> There is nothing left but for God to come in, in the kingdom, when the church has failed as witness.<a name=387:6></a> This is exactly what we get in this second epistle of Peter.<a name=387:7></a> The apostle brings into view the kingdom, but in the second chapter he shows us the effect of these damnable heresies coming into the profession of christianity.<a name=387:8></a> He shews us the starting point of departure and the course the departure would take; it is all marked out in a striking way in chapter 2.<a name=387:9></a> These things to a certain extent are spoken of prophetically, though the germs of it were working in the apostles' day.<a name=387:10></a> Every apostle speaks of the decay and ruin of christianity as a system down here.<a name=387:11></a> Paul spoke of "grievous wolves" and "perverse men".<a name=387:12></a> John speaks of "many antichrists".<a name=387:13></a> Peter speaks of "false prophets".<a name=387:14></a> And one striking feature in regard to all is this, none of them held out any prospect whatever of recovery.<a name=387:15></a> Once decay set into the church accompanied by mischief and deceit, there is no prospect of recovery.<a name=387:16></a> God would come in and sustain faith and the faithful, but looking at the thing generally there was no hope of recovery.<a name=387:17></a> I see the great importance of saints being in the light of the future.<a name=387:18></a> We want to be very much in the light of the future.<a name=387:19></a> That principle comes out very distinctly here, and that is my reason for taking up this chapter.<a name=387:20></a> If we are in the light of what is to come, it has a reflex effect.<a name=387:21></a> We become light in a way; it is the day dawning and the day star arising in our hearts.<a name=387:22></a>

		<i>in us</i>, and there the character of Christ and the sensibilities of Christ all come out; all that is of Christ comes out in the christian circle down here, so that the christian circle is really the expression of Christ.<a name=404:1></a> It is His body.<a name=404:2></a> It is that in which Christ lives down here upon earth.<a name=404:3></a> It may seem a strange thing to say, but He lives down here in the saints.<a name=404:4></a> Personally He is at the right hand of God, but by the Spirit He lives in the saints down here.<a name=404:5></a> If anybody were to say to me, 'Give a definition of christianity?<a name=404:6></a>' I should reply, 'Christianity is Christ' -- Christ in the saints by the work of the Spirit; anything outside that is not christianity in the sight of God.<a name=404:7></a> Much that we see around which is called christianity is not christianity at all, it is spurious christianity.<a name=404:8></a> It is a christianity that had its birth in judaism and heathenism.<a name=404:9></a> Christianity in the true sense is Christ by the work of the Spirit in the saints down here, and if you read <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>you will find in what a wonderful way the sensibilities and character and marks of Christ shine out in them.<a name=404:10></a> They were to put on love.<a name=404:11></a> The bond of saints is spiritual affections by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=404:12></a> Then the word of Christ was to dwell in them richly.<a name=404:13></a> The christian company or circle was to be characterised by what is of Christ because Christ is in them.<a name=404:14></a> The body of Christ is that in which Christ lives down here by the Spirit of God, and on the other hand it is that in which Christ is expressed down here.<a name=404:15></a> If we refer to the second epistle of Peter we see the striking fact of the decay of christianity, what was coming in, and what had come in: the complete failure of christianity as witness for God; but in contrast we get there too all that is vitally important to the christian -- the way we are practically brought to God.<a name=404:16></a> "Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God".<a name=404:17></a> But, are we brought to God?<a name=404:18></a> If we are brought to God we must be brought to Him according to His nature.<a name=404:19></a> The path to it is shewn by the apostle here.<a name=404:20></a> You begin with faith and you end with love.<a name=404:21></a> When

		Then there is another point, and that is that in regard to the christian the day has dawned and the day star has arisen in his heart -- Christ is in his heart.<a name=405:7></a> The practical result of that is, that there is an air of brightness about the christian that you could not possibly find elsewhere.<a name=405:8></a> The day has dawned, the day star has arisen in the heart, the harbinger of the day giving brightness to the heart.<a name=405:9></a> It is impossible that the day star should have arisen in the heart without imparting to the heart a sense of brightness and hope in anticipation of the day.<a name=405:10></a> Thus it is that prophecy no longer has a special place to us, because prophecy had the peculiar character of "a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts".<a name=405:11></a> Prophecy cannot have the same place to us now as it had to the saints of old.<a name=405:12></a> It was to them as a light shining in a dark place.<a name=405:13></a> But now something else has come to pass, the day star -- Christ, has arisen in the heart of believers.<a name=405:14></a> You get something very nearly akin to it in the Revelation, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star".<a name=405:15></a> Then you get the response of the bride, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=405:16></a>

		help, is simply to suggest one or two thoughts that come out in a striking way in the prayer.<a name=406:1></a> I think we may all be helped in that way in the terms of the prayer.<a name=406:2></a> The first thing that strikes one in the prayer is the wonderful way you get divine Persons working in unity in order to bring about a certain result.<a name=406:3></a> The first thing to mark is that the persons who are in view as the subjects of divine interest and petition, are the saints.<a name=406:4></a> The apostle intercedes on behalf of the saints, but you get all the divine Persons, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, His Spirit -- the Spirit of the Father, and then the Christ; all are, so to speak, working together in connection with a certain result to be produced in saints.<a name=406:5></a> It is a very remarkable prayer in that way and it shews us the relative position of Each divine Person.<a name=406:6></a> I believe that is a great thing to get hold of.<a name=406:7></a> It greatly helps us.<a name=406:8></a> The passage connects the thought of divine counsels with the Father.<a name=406:9></a> "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole (or every) family in heaven and earth is named", &c.<a name=406:10></a> Therefore I think it is plain enough that our minds may connect the thought of divine counsels with the Father.<a name=406:11></a> There are undoubtedly many families on earth and in heaven.<a name=406:12></a> I could not attempt to enumerate them, but in heaven there are at any rate the following: the church and the Old Testament saints, all of whom are portrayed in the twenty-four elders in the beginning of Revelation.<a name=406:13></a> Then there is a variety of families on earth; take the gathering out from nations, and the nations; and there may be other families which my mind has not taken in, but all families in heaven and on earth are named of the Father.<a name=406:14></a> The Father has determined that which is to be set forth in each family; there is one thing to be set forth in the church and another thing in Israel, and another in the fathers.<a name=406:15></a> Each family has its place in connection with the counsels of the Father.<a name=406:16></a>
