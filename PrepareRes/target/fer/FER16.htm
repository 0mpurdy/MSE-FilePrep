		THE ABIDING CONDITIONS IN WHICH LIFE CONSISTS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:5">1 John  4:5</a> - 21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:1></a>R.<a name=1:2></a> It appears to me that chapters 3 and 4 show us the abiding conditions in which life consists, and which cannot be set aside.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=1:4></a>H.<a name=1:5></a> Do you refer on the one hand to freedom from sin and death and on the other to the love of God?<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:7></a>R.<a name=1:8></a> Yes.<a name=1:9></a> Freedom from sin hangs upon the fact that we abide in Christ in whom is no sin, and you are out of death because you are in the christian circle where the love of Christ gives impulse.<a name=1:10></a> Then chapter 4 brings out all the conditions in which we live.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=1:12></a> The fatness of the house of God?<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:14></a>R.<a name=1:15></a> It is that as far as it goes, but I mean more conditions which are essential to our living; human life is subject to certain conditions into which one is born, and it is in principle the same with eternal life.<a name=1:16></a> The difference between the gospel of John and the epistle, is that the gospel is essentially subjective, and refers to the work of God in the believer but the epistle gives us the conditions in which eternal life consists, which are abiding.<a name=1:17></a> No one of us is abiding, we are all liable to be removed in death, but eternal life abides continually by the very fact of its being eternal.<a name=1:18></a> People may come and go in this world, but the conditions of life never change.<a name=1:19></a> The sun never changes, the atmosphere and the light never change.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:21></a> Your thought of eternal life is connected with environment then?<a name=1:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:23></a>R.<a name=1:24></a> Yes.<a name=1:25></a> It is the conditions in which you live, and those conditions are unchanging.<a name=1:26></a> That is what you get in this epistle.<a name=1:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:28></a> Then in this chapter do you get what is objective?<a name=1:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=1:30></a>R.<a name=1:31></a> Yes.<a name=1:32></a> And so too in the previous chapter.<a name=1:33></a> The great point in the previous chapter is the place of Christ,

		what you may call the sun.<a name=2:1></a> I use it in the way of a figure and then you get another thing, that is, the christian circle, the brethren, where the love of Christ gives impulse.<a name=2:2></a> There is a circle down here which is affected by the love of Christ.<a name=2:3></a> It is a great thing to apprehend the divinely appointed conditions which are permanent and unchanging -- which cannot be moved.<a name=2:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:7></a>R.<a name=2:8></a> I think so.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McK.<a name=2:10></a> Why do you say you think so?<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:12></a>R.<a name=2:13></a> Because I do not want to attempt to limit God.<a name=2:14></a> God says in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:5">Revelation  21:5</a>, "Behold, I make all things new" and God may see fit to change things -- for the better, of course.<a name=2:15></a> The new heavens and the new earth will be better than what is.<a name=2:16></a> I think the Revelation gives that idea.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:18></a> You cannot have anything better than the love of God.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:20></a>R.<a name=2:21></a> No, but the application of the love of God will be a little different, because things will be changed in regard to us -- we shall be past the judgment seat, and we shall be with God, in His own abode.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:23></a> We shall not be held responsible to love one another then?<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:25></a>R.<a name=2:26></a> No.<a name=2:27></a> Again you certainly will not want boldness in the day of judgment in heaven.<a name=2:28></a> It seems to me to be very important for believers to apprehend what God has ordained, and which no power can change.<a name=2:29></a> To me it is a very great comfort to get to what is permanent and durable.<a name=2:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:31></a> When it speaks in verse 17 of the "day of judgment", does it refer to the judgment resting on the world?<a name=2:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=2:33></a>R.<a name=2:34></a> No.<a name=2:35></a> It refers to its application to us.<a name=2:36></a> The apostle did not care to be judged of man's day -- "do not judge anything before the time" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:5">1 Corinthians  4:5</a>, he said, the time is coming.<a name=2:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:38></a> You would say these things are unchanging because they flow from the very nature of God?<a name=2:39></a>

		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:1></a>R.<a name=3:2></a> Yes, and because they are what God has ordained.<a name=3:3></a> For instance, God has set the sun in heaven, and nothing can change that, and so God has set the christian circle down here -- people pass out of it, but nothing can set it aside.<a name=3:4></a> Then the divine light which comes out in this chapter, that cannot be changed.<a name=3:5></a> It is all unchangeable, immutable.<a name=3:6></a> People may pass off the scene and others come on, but things into which we have properly come cannot be changed.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:10></a>R.<a name=3:11></a> We are come into things which God has ordained.<a name=3:12></a> We abide in Christ the Sun of righteousness, and He is always abiding and what hangs on that is that there is a circle down here, in which the love of Christ gives impulse.<a name=3:13></a> "We have passed from death into life, because we love the brethren" that is an abiding circle.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:15></a> Do you exclude any subjective thought in the expression of eternal life?<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:17></a>R.<a name=3:18></a> Yes, because it is wholly objective, though it is intimately connected with our state.<a name=3:19></a> Take a new-born child.<a name=3:20></a> It is nourished with food, by which its constitution is built up, but there are certain conditions into which it is born, which are essential to its life -- I mean the sun, the atmosphere, and so on.<a name=3:21></a> These conditions are always existing.<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:23></a> So you speak of life and conditions of life?<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:25></a>R.<a name=3:26></a> Exactly.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:28></a> Do you not draw a distinction between life and eternal life?<a name=3:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:30></a>R.<a name=3:31></a> Yes.<a name=3:32></a> Eternal life refers to the conditions which are immutable and abiding.<a name=3:33></a> Life is connected with the believer in a general way.<a name=3:34></a> We have heard the voice of the Son of God, and having heard His voice, we live and then in a kind of way we are nourished with bread.<a name=3:35></a> That is what you get in chapters 5 and 6 of John.<a name=3:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:37></a> You would speak of that as subjective state?<a name=3:38></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=3:39></a>R.<a name=3:40></a> Yes.<a name=3:41></a> That is what comes out in the gospel.<a name=3:42></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=3:43></a>H.<a name=3:44></a> I think there is a difficulty in some minds in regard of what you get in the gospel where eternal life is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=4:3></a>R.<a name=4:4></a> In chapter 3 the Lord is speaking from the divine standpoint -- I mean as to what was in the thought and love of God.<a name=4:5></a> "God so loved the world" verse 16.<a name=4:6></a> It is a revelation -- it is light coming out, the divine thought in regard of the world.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=4:8></a>H.<a name=4:9></a> So what we get there is the believer -- the person who has eternal life.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=4:11></a>R.<a name=4:12></a> Yes.<a name=4:13></a> It is the "whosoever" -- the believing person, whoever he might be, Jew or gentile, was to come into it.<a name=4:14></a> So too in chapter 5, it is "he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me", verse 24, that is the kind of person who has eternal life.<a name=4:15></a> The same thing runs throughout the gospel, it is the kind of person who is in view, and the gospel gives the subjective side.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:17></a> Does the person get it by believing?<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=4:19></a>R.<a name=4:20></a> No.<a name=4:21></a> The Lord brings this out in chapter 4 of John.<a name=4:22></a> "The water that I shall give him .<a name=4:23></a>.<a name=4:24></a>.<a name=4:25></a> everlasting life", verse 14.<a name=4:26></a> Until a man is a believer he would not get the living water, but then the well of water in the believer springs up into everlasting life.<a name=4:27></a> The great point in the epistle is that you might enter into it.<a name=4:28></a> You could not be conscious that you have it unless you have entered into it.<a name=4:29></a> I should not be conscious that I have entered into my house, unless I have entered into it.<a name=4:30></a> The apostle unfolds the conditions in which eternal life subsists, so that you may see what they are, and having entered in, you are conscious that you have eternal life.<a name=4:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:32></a> Why is eternal life put in contrast to not perishing?<a name=4:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=4:34></a>R.<a name=4:35></a> Because it is either one thing or the other.<a name=4:36></a> Certain conditions have come in in connection with the revelation of God in Christ, and it is either on the one hand the entering into eternal life, or on the other hand, being under death.<a name=4:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:38></a> You said there was a difference between life and eternal life.<a name=4:39></a> Do you think it is life in the gospel?<a name=4:40></a>

		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=5:1></a>R.<a name=5:2></a> Yes.<a name=5:3></a> It is not that the expression 'eternal life' does not occur, but the prevailing thought in the gospel is the state of the person and that is life.<a name=5:4></a> It is the fruit of a divine work.<a name=5:5></a> If I am a subject of God's work, which has brought about in me a certain state, it is life.<a name=5:6></a> "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly", <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:10">John  10:10</a>.<a name=5:7></a>

		F.E.<a name=5:10></a>R.<a name=5:11></a> No.<a name=5:12></a> I think it refers to the state of the believer.<a name=5:13></a> You get life in divine power -- in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:15></a> Then eternal life is an expression which speaks of the conditions in which those who have life live?<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.E.<a name=5:17></a>R.<a name=5:18></a> Yes.<a name=5:19></a> I only judge that because you continually get the thought -- "springing up into everlasting life", "entering into it", "laying hold on it".<a name=5:20></a> It is the end unto which you endure.<a name=5:21></a> The man reaps it.<a name=5:22></a> It is continually presented in that way by all the writers -- Paul and John and others.<a name=5:23></a>

		F.E.<a name=6:9></a>R.<a name=6:10></a> I have no doubt that what a person is to get through the gospel is living water, and scripture closes with that -- "He that will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=6:11></a> I think that is the great end and purpose of the gospel.<a name=6:12></a>

		It is important to apprehend the distinctive place and character of each of the gospels.<a name=103:1></a> God has been pleased to give to us four, written by different persons; at first sight one might not discern the character and position of each, but it is very important to seek to do so, otherwise you do not really understand any one of them.<a name=103:2></a>

		The gospel of John has a marked character of its own.<a name=103:3></a> I look upon it as that upon which, in a sense, all the gospels turn.<a name=103:4></a> It is different from every other gospel.<a name=103:5></a> You may, of course, find things in John which are recorded in the other gospels, but it has a character quite different from all, and might almost be called the backbone of all.<a name=103:6></a> An apprehension of the gospel of John greatly helps you to see the position of any other gospel.<a name=103:7></a> Christ is the one great figure in all the gospels, but in John we have, undoubtedly, Christ presented to us in the light of a divine Person, specially in relation to the Father.<a name=103:8></a> John is the one employed by God to present Christ to us in the distinctiveness of His Person and as declaring God.<a name=103:9></a> A great many things depend upon that -- benefits to man, and so on; but what characterises the gospel is the Son in relation to the Father.<a name=103:10></a> You will recall one expression that frequently occurs on the lips of Christ.<a name=103:11></a> He calls Himself the Sent One of the Father.<a name=103:12></a> He is the Sent One, not merely to confer benefits on man, but, as the first point of His coming, to do the will of Him that sent Him.<a name=103:13></a> "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me".<a name=103:14></a> Again, He says, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work".<a name=103:15></a> It is the Son presented to us in relation to the Father.<a name=103:16></a> Specially in chapter 5 we see how Christ opens up the relations which subsisted between Himself and the Father.<a name=103:17></a> "The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth".<a name=103:18></a> I have said that John is the backbone of all -- I mean in the way in which

		In the other gospels we see Christ more in relation to men.<a name=104:2></a> It is one thing to apprehend Him in relation to the Father, but it is important also to apprehend Him in relation to men.<a name=104:3></a> The result of that is, that the history of man can be taken up afresh in Christ.<a name=104:4></a> That thought gives their peculiar character to the gospels of Matthew and Luke.<a name=104:5></a> In Luke the history of man is taken up in Christ, the Head, and in Matthew the history of Israel.<a name=104:6></a> You get a remarkable expression in the beginning of Matthew: "Out of Egypt have I called my son".<a name=104:7></a> That passage gives the idea of the history of Israel being taken up anew in Christ.<a name=104:8></a> In the providence of God it was ordered that His Son should go down into Egypt, not merely to escape the wickedness of Herod, but "that it might be <i>fulfilled</i> which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet".<a name=104:9></a> Certain things happened in regard of Christ, as one may say in a natural way, but to suppose that He went down to Egypt only to escape the wickedness of Herod would be very low ground.<a name=104:10></a> It was that the history of Israel was taken up afresh in Him.<a name=104:11></a> The importance of it is, that it affords a fresh standing ground for Israel.<a name=104:12></a> The same holds good in speaking of Christ as the Head of every man, it affords a new standing-ground for man -- a ground on which he can be with God.<a name=104:13></a> Every one who recognises Christ as Head has a standing-ground with God.<a name=104:14></a> The Head is there for every one to accept.<a name=104:15></a> If I accept Him as Head, God cannot reject me, because the Head is divinely appointed.<a name=104:16></a> God would have "all men to be saved".<a name=104:17></a> The Mediator is the One by whom any man can approach God, and it is an impossibility that God should reject any man who accepts the Head.<a name=104:18></a> He is available to every man.<a name=104:19></a>

		I make these remarks as preliminary; and there is one further remark I would offer.<a name=105:2></a> The history of Israel was taken up in Christ, but at the same time the advent of Christ was bound to bring about new and unexpected developments.<a name=105:3></a> I can shew you that from the scripture we have before us now.<a name=105:4></a> Christ being light from God was bound to test every man down here.<a name=105:5></a> He was the true light, and every man was tested by Him.<a name=105:6></a> It follows upon that that there must be new developments, as we see in the beginning of this chapter.<a name=105:7></a> The mass of the people who professed to be the people of God was rejected; but on the other hand there was faith found in the gentile who recognised Christ, and the gentile was brought into blessing in connection with the fathers.<a name=105:8></a> That is what I mean by a new and unexpected development; it is realised in the church.<a name=105:9></a> No Jew could have expected that the gentile would be joined with him in blessing.<a name=105:10></a> A Jew would not have entertained that thought for a moment, but it is that which has come to pass; and that development was according to the counsel of God, though it was brought to pass very much through the perversity of man.<a name=105:11></a> Christ came to His people, but they received Him not.<a name=105:12></a> The mass of them was perverse and lawless; they did not accept the light that came to them; but there was faith in the gentile which recognised Christ as God.<a name=105:13></a>

		What I want to touch upon in the beginning of the chapter (verses 2 - 13) is the position of the Lord.<a name=105:14></a> I sum it up in one word: it was <i>God</i> here.<a name=105:15></a> And God acting as God.<a name=105:16></a> That is what we see in the earlier part of the passage.<a name=105:17></a> It was not the presentation of God morally in nature as in christians, but God presented to man in a substantive way -- God manifest in flesh -- none the less God.<a name=105:18></a> It is a point of importance to be held in the present day.<a name=105:19></a> There is an attempt abroad to fritter away everything in Scripture in bringing all to a footing where it can stand on a level with the ideas of man.<a name=105:20></a> But God is presented here in a Person, and in such a way that man can take account of Him; and now when He begins to

		but on the part of the leper faith was there.<a name=107:1></a> The Lord answers both.<a name=107:2></a> It was a great mercy for the leper (and for many another too) that he had faith -- the Lord healed him for a testimony; but the faith of the centurion was the better.<a name=107:3></a> The Lord was equally ready to respond to the faith of both.<a name=107:4></a> But what was likely to be the result of that was that Jew and gentile must be found on one common ground.<a name=107:5></a> The leper was healed on the ground of the compassion of Christ.<a name=107:6></a> He could say, I had no merit, I was a leper, my condition was hopeless, and I have been healed simply as a question of divine compassion.<a name=107:7></a> Now the centurion comes forward, and he recognises that Christ is God; what can the leper say?<a name=107:8></a> Can he find fault with Christ or with the centurion if he was only an object of compassion himself?<a name=107:9></a> Can he complain of God having compassion on a poor gentile?<a name=107:10></a> It was impossible.<a name=107:11></a> His faith was less than that of the centurion; he had nothing to recommend him to Christ save that he was a subject for compassion.<a name=107:12></a> He appealed to Christ, and the Lord healed him and cleansed his leprosy; he could not complain if the gentile came forward and asked for and gained the Lord's compassion too.<a name=107:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My point is, that the presence of God here in Christ was bound to bring about a moral revolution, because the Jew was really only a subject for the compassion of God, and on the other hand, faith was found in the gentile.<a name=107:17></a> The leper was healed on account of need.<a name=107:18></a> It was his misery and leprosy, his appeal, that the Lord took account of.<a name=107:19></a> But then there was the same need in the gentile.<a name=107:20></a> There was faith there, and the Lord responded to his faith.<a name=107:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will ask you to look now at the end of chapter 11 (verses 20 - 30).<a name=114:2></a> The point that comes out first in this chapter is that the Lord pronounces woes on those cities wherein most of His mighty works were done, and the result is that they are, so to say, lost in the judgment-day.<a name=114:3></a> There is a comparison between Sidon and Tyre and those cities.<a name=114:4></a> That was the effect of the presentation of Christ to the responsibility of man; everything was ended in the judgment-day.<a name=114:5></a> There was nothing but lawlessness in the heart of man in regard of God.<a name=114:6></a> That is true now.<a name=114:7></a> You have only to look round to see the disposition there is to set aside every bond of God.<a name=114:8></a> It is not only that men set aside that which we believe to be the revelation of God, but they reject the thought of revelation entirely.<a name=114:9></a> There is a word abroad now, men call themselves agnostics.<a name=114:10></a> An agnostic regards revelation as an impossibility.<a name=114:11></a> The result of it is, that man must be left in the dark completely with regard to God.<a name=114:12></a> I merely speak of this as evidence of that which marks the mind of man.<a name=114:13></a> His mind is essentially lawless.<a name=114:14></a> It refuses the law of God.<a name=114:15></a> And yet when you look around in the physical universe you see everything governed by law, and men are ready enough to form rules and laws for themselves.<a name=114:16></a> If every one were lawless in this world, society could not go on.<a name=114:17></a> As men have congregated they have been obliged to make a system of laws to render life endurable.<a name=114:18></a> But with regard of God, man's mind is lawless.<a name=114:19></a> The effect in itself of the presentation of Christ's mighty works was to bring woes upon these cities.<a name=114:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is the effect as regards Christ Himself?<a name=114:21></a> It says, Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and He thanked God.<a name=114:22></a> Christ is spoken of in Scripture as the wisdom of God.<a name=114:23></a> I understand by that that He is God's resource.<a name=114:24></a> The occasion of Christ's rejoicing was the consciousness of the resource which God had.<a name=114:25></a> God had hid these things from the wise and prudent, and had revealed them unto babes.<a name=114:26></a>

		Suppose the revelation of God accommodated itself to the wise and prudent; suppose it needed a highly cultivated intellect to apprehend the things of God, what a poor look out there would be for the poor and ignorant!<a name=115:1></a> It seems to me, the revelation of God must suit the meanest and the poorest, because with Him there is no respect of persons.<a name=115:2></a> It is in a way a sort of accident that a man attains great culture -- many people have not the opportunity -- God could not take account of an accident in that way.<a name=115:3></a> It must be that any revelation of God, to be really a revelation, should be such as to suit itself to the poorest and meanest.<a name=115:4></a> That is exactly what God has done.<a name=115:5></a> He has "hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto babes".<a name=115:6></a> God could not put any sanction upon the cultivation of man.<a name=115:7></a>

		Well, the resource of God is found in the expression, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father".<a name=115:8></a> The Lord brings to light what existed in the heart of the Father.<a name=115:9></a> There are resources in God, and those resources really depend upon the truth of the Godhead.<a name=115:10></a> We can understand these resources of God, because we know the truth of the Godhead.<a name=115:11></a> There was One in the unity of the Godhead who could come forth from God.<a name=115:12></a> It was in becoming a Man that He came forth from God, and it is to Him who came forth from God, and who was God, that all things could be delivered: "All things are delivered unto me of my Father".<a name=115:13></a> The Father had counsels and plans and thoughts in His heart, and all was delivered to the Son in order that He might give effect to all.<a name=115:14></a>

		I believe that this involved two things, namely, that Christ should be a centre and point of gathering for man, and that He should accomplish redemption, that is, that the rights of God in regard of man should be maintained and vindicated.<a name=115:15></a> Man was under certain responsibilities and liabilities -- all that had to be maintained and vindicated in redemption; and the One in whom redemption was accomplished has become a centre and point of gathering on that ground for man.<a name=115:16></a> This was

	<div class="paragraph">
		The condition of man was brought out fully by the presence of Christ.<a name=116:10></a> The incarnation made things only darker as regards man; the mighty works made men more responsible; but there were resources in God.<a name=116:11></a> God has been presented in a man.<a name=116:12></a> Now He says, The Father has put all into My hands; I am going to accomplish everything.<a name=116:13></a> The terms were that He should taste death for everything, that the rights of redemption might be maintained in <i>Him</i>, and also that, on the ground of these rights, He might be a gathering-point for man.<a name=116:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Have you ever considered the point why Christ is the Sun of righteousness?<a name=116:15></a> The reason is plain: He is the righteous One who has accomplished righteousness.<a name=116:16></a> Redemption originated in grace, but the character of it is righteousness.<a name=116:17></a> Christ has maintained the rights of God, hence it is that He is the Sun of righteousness.<a name=116:18></a> He will arise with healing in His wings, but in the meantime He has become the gathering-point.<a name=116:19></a> That is implied, I think, in the expression here: "All things are delivered unto me of my Father".<a name=116:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another thing comes out.<a name=116:21></a> He is the Revealer of the Father.<a name=116:22></a> He came down here to give effect to the Father's will, and on this all the Father's counsels turned.<a name=116:23></a> But then, in the fact of His coming to accomplish the Father's counsels, the Father is revealed.<a name=116:24></a> It is a great point to apprehend what Christ is.<a name=116:25></a> We have come to a state of things pretty much analogous to that which existed in Israel.<a name=116:26></a>

		THINGS NEW AND OLD SECURED IN CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:34">Matthew  13:34</a> - 52
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think there can be no doubt that one of the peculiar marks of the gospel of Matthew is the bringing together of things "new and old", I do not know that you get even the expression elsewhere.<a name=121:1></a> The Lord uses it at the close of the passage I read: "Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old".<a name=121:2></a> Both are found in the kingdom of heaven.<a name=121:3></a> It is one of the results of God's ways in the bringing in of Christ.<a name=121:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church, which is new, has come in by Christ.<a name=121:5></a> And yet God has been in no sense unfaithful to what has been.<a name=121:6></a> You get the two brought together; the "old" is substantiated and confirmed, and yet God brings in "new" things.<a name=121:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is this bringing together of things new and old in a divine way that marks Scripture.<a name=121:8></a> I have no fear for all that man may do to Scripture, because all through it you have a living, powerful voice speaking in the same moral tones from beginning to end.<a name=121:9></a> One voice makes itself heard in strong moral accents.<a name=121:10></a> You cannot find a parallel to it anywhere else.<a name=121:11></a> It is not the voice of man speaking, or even man's conduct, that is the prominent idea; though there is a moral apprehension of things that are happening here; but it is one living voice making itself heard.<a name=121:12></a> And <i>that</i> is not going to be easily set aside.<a name=121:13></a> The voice of God is not to be set aside by the puny attacks of man!<a name=121:14></a> "The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon".<a name=121:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another reason why Scripture could not be set aside is, that things which are present and come under our observation are intimately connected with things that have been; we have, for instance, one peculiar people in all parts of the world that has a long previous history.<a name=121:16></a>

		The present condition of the Jew so links itself with the past that it remains as a standing witness of God's past ways.<a name=122:1></a> And yet, though the Jew be set aside for the time being, as Scripture predicted, God has never been and never will be unfaithful to His promises.<a name=122:2></a> He will remember the Jew.<a name=122:3></a> That has been my point in the previous lectures: the fidelity of God to the Jew, and yet His bringing in other developments.<a name=122:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Have you thought what the epistle to the Romans means?<a name=122:5></a> I believe it to be the fundamental epistle.<a name=122:6></a> It is essential for every one to be established in first principles, and they are God's righteousness and God's fidelity.<a name=122:7></a> If you look abroad in the world, you see what calls in question the righteousness of God and His fidelity -- you see the rights of God contested on every hand by the spirit of lawlessness prevailing.<a name=122:8></a> And you see another thing: the chosen people of God scattered all over the earth in contempt and reproach, not enjoying the promises made to the fathers; they are aliens, trodden down of the gentiles; all that seems to call in question the faithfulness of God.<a name=122:9></a> The epistle to the Romans is the answer to all that.<a name=122:10></a> The beginning of the epistle is the unfolding of the righteousness of God in Christ; and the latter part the unfolding of the faithfulness of God in Christ.<a name=122:11></a> So the christian has in Christ the answer to all here that seems to call God in question.<a name=122:12></a> I cannot see anything more important than that our hearts should be established in the knowledge of the righteousness and faithfulness of God.<a name=122:13></a> Lawlessness may prevail for a moment, but it is not going to set aside the righteousness of God; nor, on the other hand, can anything interfere with His fidelity.<a name=122:14></a> No failure on the part of man can alter the faithfulness of God.<a name=122:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may not see all this at first.<a name=122:16></a> The ways of God take a certain time to work out as men judge, but in the end God will vindicate Himself -- He has done it already.<a name=122:17></a> God has proved His fidelity to His people.<a name=122:18></a> In the introduction of the church, God took care to make provision for the believing remnant of the Jews.<a name=122:19></a> In the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I take up these parables now, for they are remarkable in this way, that you get things old and things new.<a name=123:4></a> You get the bringing together of things new and old, the new has not set aside the old, and the old does not interfere with the new.<a name=123:5></a> My main thought is that in the kingdom of heaven you get the church -- that was new -- and yet you get the kingdom of the Son of man -- that was old.<a name=123:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Jew was very restricted in his thoughts.<a name=123:7></a> He had carnal ideas with regard to the Messiah and the glory He would confer on the people nationally; he ought to have apprehended another thought, that is, the kingdom of the Son of man.<a name=123:8></a> The Jew will never be restored except in connection with that kingdom.<a name=123:9></a> It is a world-wide dominion.<a name=123:10></a> When God establishes it in a public way the Jew will get his own position nationally in Christ, and not till then.<a name=123:11></a> In the kingdom of heaven you get the idea of the kingdom of the Son of man, which is not a new thought; but we also have what is new, in the parable of the treasure hid in the field and that of the pearl of great price.<a name=123:12></a> These are not made manifest in any previous communications of God; they are new.<a name=123:13></a> It is to that the Lord alludes, I think, in speaking of things "new and old".<a name=123:14></a> We can understand it all now, because we have some intelligence with regard to the pearl and the treasure.<a name=123:15></a> In some way, too, the net was new; you do not get the idea in the Old Testament of casting the net into the sea and putting the good fish into vessels.<a name=123:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we go on to this we will just look at the exposition that the Lord gives of the parable of the tares (verses 36 - 43).<a name=123:17></a> I call your attention first to verses 24 - 30.<a name=123:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point to my mind in this parable is, that you get the thought of the kingdom of the Son of man.<a name=123:19></a> It is a very important thought.<a name=123:20></a> The kingdom of the Son of man is not existing in any manifest form at the present moment, but there is a form in which it does exist.<a name=123:21></a> For

		the moment it takes the form of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=124:1></a> The kingdom of the Son of man has reference to God's dispensations upon earth, hence you get twice over the thought of "the completion of the age" (verses 39, 40) That refers to the dealings of God on earth.<a name=124:2></a> A change will take place in God's dealings.<a name=124:3></a> The Son of man will purge out of His kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity.<a name=124:4></a> That is remarkable, as it puts together the age to come and the present age.<a name=124:5></a> "Things that offend" are finding their place at this time in the kingdom of the Son of man; they will be gathered out, and the kingdom will be taken up in power and glory.<a name=124:6></a> You get an allusion to this in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>"The world to come, whereof we speak".<a name=124:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kingdom of the Son of man connects itself, too, with what has been.<a name=124:8></a> The mind of the Jew overlooked the kingdom of the Son of man.<a name=124:9></a> That was the idea prophetically conveyed, it was not new at all.<a name=124:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of it comes out in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>.<a name=124:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>we get the King in Zion and authority over the nations, but in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>we see the universal dominion of the Son of man.<a name=124:12></a> "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands".<a name=124:13></a> And in the comment on that in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, we find there is nothing that is not put under him.<a name=124:14></a> There is no exception save in regard of Him who put all things under Him.<a name=124:15></a> It is the universal dominion of the Son of man based upon redemption.<a name=124:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>we find Jesus "made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death .<a name=124:17></a>.<a name=124:18></a>.<a name=124:19></a> that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man".<a name=124:20></a> I take it, that is the character of the kingdom, a universal dominion, characterised by grace because founded on redemption.<a name=124:21></a> It is by the grace of God Christ had to taste death for every thing.<a name=124:22></a> This is not a new thought.<a name=124:23></a> A Jew ought to have known of the universal dominion of the Son of man.<a name=124:24></a> A moment came when the Lord prohibits the publication of the testimony that He was the Christ.<a name=124:25></a> He speaks of Himself as the Son of man who should suffer and rise; but that was not new.<a name=124:26></a> The thought of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>you get the establishment in the Son of the throne of God -- a most important point -- and in chapter 2 the kingdom of the Son of man.<a name=125:5></a> The world that had been was put under angels, but the world to come is put under the Son of man, because, I take it, it is founded on redemption.<a name=125:6></a> That is not new.<a name=125:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking that directly we get the kingdom of the Son of man we have in view the enemy, the devil.<a name=125:8></a> It reminds one of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>.<a name=125:9></a> Directly the man-child is born, the dragon is there ready to swallow him up.<a name=125:10></a> The enemy, the devil, is against Christ, against the universal dominion of the Son of man.<a name=125:11></a> The world-wide authority of the beast comes in antagonism to the Son of man and His kingdom.<a name=125:12></a> The wicked one is ever opposed to the Son of man.<a name=125:13></a>

		We are told that "the field is the world".<a name=125:14></a> What I understand by the field is not the earth but the world, which, in regard to the people in it, has been bought by Christ.<a name=125:15></a> It all belongs to Christ.<a name=125:16></a> In the parable it speaks of the Son of man sowing good seed in His field.<a name=125:17></a> From that point of view all men belong to Christ, whatever they may think.<a name=125:18></a> He has acquired a right over all, and is Head of every man.<a name=125:19></a> It is a point of great moment to apprehend.<a name=125:20></a> If people reject Christ, they reject One who has divinely-given rights in regard to them.<a name=125:21></a> The distinction between those who are christians and those who are not, is that the christian recognises the right of Christ, and one who is not a christian does not; but the right of Christ is the same over both.<a name=125:22></a> The field is His.<a name=125:23></a>

		The coming of Christ into the world of necessity brought in new things.<a name=133:1></a> It was impossible that the Son of God should accommodate Himself to what existed here; He must bring in what was new; yet it is most important to see that God proved His fidelity to Israel and what had been.<a name=133:2></a> That is one of the great principles which I have endeavoured to make plain through this gospel.<a name=133:3></a> I continue that thought in connection with the passage which we have before us.<a name=133:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might call this chapter almost the most important one in the gospel.<a name=133:5></a> We get the death morally of all that had professedly been for God in the early part of the chapter.<a name=133:6></a> Then there is the real point of departure in that which God intended to establish.<a name=133:7></a> That point of departure is the living God.<a name=133:8></a> This is a remarkable expression which we find continually in Scripture; it is not confined to the New Testament.<a name=133:9></a> In connection with Israel going into the land of promise, the passing over Jordan was the proof that the living God was among them.<a name=133:10></a> God came out in that character.<a name=133:11></a> Such a title as that was doubtless in anticipation of what was coming.<a name=133:12></a> What really proved God to be the living God was the resurrection of Christ.<a name=133:13></a> We get in christianity the Son of the living God, the Spirit of the living God, the church of the living God, the service of the living God; everything connects itself with the living God.<a name=133:14></a> I would not attempt to give any definition of the expression, but it indicates surely One who is entirely above the power and dominion of death.<a name=133:15></a> God has come out in that way as the One who can deal with death.<a name=133:16></a> Men were powerless as to it, but God can deal with it.<a name=133:17></a> He proved this by the resurrection of Christ.<a name=133:18></a> The power of death was broken there, and God was proved to be the living God -- just as the entry of Israel into the promised land was a proof that the living God

		But I want to speak first about the state of death that existed in Israel.<a name=134:6></a> We get this brought out remarkably in the beginning of this chapter.<a name=134:7></a> A number of things come into view.<a name=134:8></a> The unbelieving Sadducees and Pharisees appear first; the Lord warns His disciples of the leaven of the Sadducees and Pharisees, then we find that people all entertained their own ideas with regard to Christ; one said one thing and another another.<a name=134:9></a> Well, what all that speaks to me of is death.<a name=134:10></a> The Lord speaks of a wicked and adulterous generation.<a name=134:11></a> A generation that were not faithful to the light they had.<a name=134:12></a> That was the character of the world which presented itself to Christ.<a name=134:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will explain what I mean.<a name=136:5></a> There is a certain class of mind that will come under authority in religion; they cannot help it; you might reason with them for ever, but you cannot prevent it.<a name=136:6></a> They are not all unintelligent people, often the contrary; but religiousness and authority suit a certain class of mind.<a name=136:7></a> That accounts largely for the status and continuance of popery -- there is a class of mind which prefers that state of things; that is the Pharisee.<a name=136:8></a> But there is another and large class that is sceptical about everything, disinclined to believe anything of which the mind of man cannot take cognisance.<a name=136:9></a> This is prevalent, but not universal for the reason of which I have spoken.<a name=136:10></a> So the Sadducee did not believe in "resurrection nor angel nor spirit", because they did not come within the cognisance of man.<a name=136:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now any <i>moral</i> operation of God does not come within the cognisance of man.<a name=136:12></a> If you say it is an impossibility for God to work in any way morally in His own creation, I do not admit the principle!<a name=136:13></a> God has constituted certain laws which operate in this universe of ours, and which are unvarying and consistent in action, but I do not think laws which God has constituted can limit God if He chooses to act.<a name=136:14></a> It is a weak position to take up, that one is only to believe what comes within the experience of man.<a name=136:15></a> The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees is at work in the world at the present time.<a name=136:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We come to another point.<a name=137:7></a> The Lord questions the disciples as to what man's thought was in regard to Himself.<a name=137:8></a> Some said one thing, and some another.<a name=137:9></a> It is pretty much the same at the present day.<a name=137:10></a> It is curious that people cannot leave Scripture alone.<a name=137:11></a> They do not like it, and cannot understand it; but they cannot leave it alone!<a name=137:12></a> Scripture is not learned in the letter; "the letter kills".<a name=137:13></a> Vast numbers of people come to Scripture not in the right spirit, and so are stumbled.<a name=137:14></a> The fact of its being inspired shews that you must get it by the Spirit and not in the letter.<a name=137:15></a> A great deal of Scripture is the record of the circumstances into which the word of God came.<a name=137:16></a> Take the utterances of Job's three friends, for instance.<a name=137:17></a> They were not giving the mind of God, but 'darkening counsel by words without knowledge'.<a name=137:18></a> We need to get at the spirit and thought of Scripture.<a name=137:19></a> But one person has one theory, and another another, and all are human and very much akin to the ideas entertained in regard of Christ when He was here.<a name=137:20></a> It was a state of moral death.<a name=137:21></a> They had no knowledge of Christ.<a name=137:22></a> The Lord had done many wonderful works, but they did not apprehend Him as what He was, the One promised; they were darkened by the unbelief that was covered up by asking a sign.<a name=137:23></a>

		The next thing is "The Son of the living God".<a name=138:15></a> It was revealed to Peter that Christ was the Son of the living God.<a name=138:16></a> This is morally antecedent to the beginning of Genesis, for, behind all that comes in, there the living God was.<a name=138:17></a> It is a great comfort to know that, whatever might come in, God was never taken aback.<a name=138:18></a> Sin and death came in; man became subject to death, and after death the judgment; but the living God was behind all.<a name=138:19></a>

		I have brought before you on previous occasions what is characteristic of the gospel of Matthew, that is, God coming out in faithfulness to the promises in His Son; but that in the very introduction of the Son of God other and new things necessarily come to light.<a name=144:4></a> For instance, there is the church.<a name=144:5></a> That comes to light in this gospel.<a name=144:6></a> Christ came in faithfulness to God's promises in regard to Israel, but being the Son of God, it could not be but that God should have other thoughts in His mind.<a name=144:7></a> It was impossible that the Son of God should come in to be the crown of things that existed here.<a name=144:8></a> He came to test everything that was here.<a name=144:9></a> If the Son of God became Man, He must be the beginning.<a name=144:10></a> It must be so by reason of what He is.<a name=144:11></a> He was the promise of God to Abraham and to David, but He must be the beginning of an order of things which should be entirely according to God.<a name=144:12></a> He is "the beginning of the creation of God", not simply the end of it.<a name=144:13></a> So we read in the epistle to the Colossians: "who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence", that is, the first place.<a name=144:14></a> I cannot conceive how it could be otherwise, when we consider that Christ is the Son of God.<a name=144:15></a>

		I am going to touch on these two parables with God's help.<a name=145:15></a> There is one essential point of difference in them.<a name=145:16></a> In the first the vineyard is in view; the second is a similitude of the kingdom.<a name=145:17></a> The point in the first is the bringing out of the responsibility of the husbandmen, those in charge of the vineyard.<a name=145:18></a> All through the vineyard is in view.<a name=145:19></a> God is sending to the husbandmen to receive of the fruit of the vineyard, to which He was entitled.<a name=145:20></a> He had formed it and cultured it, and was entitled to look for fruit -- evidently it is the vineyard and the husbandmen that are in view.<a name=145:21></a> It is man taken up on the ground of responsibility to bring forth fruit to God.<a name=145:22></a> It is not exactly man in nature, but under certain conditions and the enjoyment of certain privileges, with a certain experience of God, and so responsible to bring forth fruit to God.<a name=145:23></a> I do not think God looked for <i>much</i> fruit, but I think He looked for thankfulness and praise on the part of His people.<a name=145:24></a> He intended them to enjoy what He had put within their reach: His sun, His rain, His land; His favours which He had put in their possession.<a name=145:25></a> It says in one of the psalms: "Whoso offereth praise

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the second parable is a great contrast.<a name=146:2></a> It is the Son that is in view.<a name=146:3></a> The Son is common to both parables.<a name=146:4></a> He is the last One sent in the first; that is, the last test which God saw fit to apply to Israel.<a name=146:5></a> God had applied many before, but the last was God's Son.<a name=146:6></a> When here He gave abundant proof of who and what He was.<a name=146:7></a> "God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit".<a name=146:8></a> There was abundant proof in the power of the Spirit of God that Christ was what He maintained He was.<a name=146:9></a> The people were left without excuse.<a name=146:10></a> He was the final test.<a name=146:11></a> "But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said .<a name=146:12></a>.<a name=146:13></a>.<a name=146:14></a> This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.<a name=146:15></a> And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him".<a name=146:16></a> And that was the end of their responsibility.<a name=146:17></a> You have the witness of it at the present day.<a name=146:18></a> The Jews are a people under reproach, under the wrath of God, scattered over the face of the earth.<a name=146:19></a> They are a standing witness of the judgment of God.<a name=146:20></a> Though God afterwards offered mercy to them, they refused the Spirit of God, and wrath came upon them for their rejection and crucifixion of Christ and they are suffering under it now -- excluded from their land, having neither ephod nor teraphim.<a name=146:21></a> The apostle Paul says in regard to them, "Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost".<a name=146:22></a> And no doubt what has been is a foreshadowing of what will be to them in the judgment of God.<a name=146:23></a> They will have to suffer, as we read, "double for all her sins".<a name=146:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said this much because I want you to understand the different point of view in the two parables.<a name=146:25></a> Undoubtedly the first represents men in responsibility under the care and culture of God, enjoying advantages, a measure of light and the worship of God.<a name=146:26></a> There was no other people that enjoyed the like privileges on the face of the earth.<a name=146:27></a> They had a place where God had seen fit to set His name; they had the priesthood and the Urim and Thummim and the prophets.<a name=146:28></a> They had, too, God's discipline from the outset.<a name=146:29></a> God punished them for their

		iniquities.<a name=147:1></a> "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"; that was an advantage because the chastisement hindered them in the way of evil.<a name=147:2></a> It is so in a family; if we exercise discipline in regard to a child it is that the child may be kept from the path of evil and self-will.<a name=147:3></a> The discipline was a proof of faithfulness on the part of God to His people.<a name=147:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The vineyard represents the house of Israel and the husbandmen those in charge.<a name=147:5></a> It is to these God sent for the fruit of His vineyard.<a name=147:6></a> In any nation or company there are leaders; it is inevitable; so there were leaders in Israel; the husbandmen were specially responsible.<a name=147:7></a> The same principle is seen in the seven churches in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3.<a name=147:8></a> The "angels" are addressed, those in the church, whoever it might be, who came under special responsibility in regard to the state of the church.<a name=147:9></a> It was to such that the Lord spoke.<a name=147:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing more remarkable than the parables which the Lord uttered.<a name=147:11></a> They were pictures that could come only from a divine mind.<a name=147:12></a> They are not imaginations, but presentations of the position.<a name=147:13></a> Here it is the history of Israel extending over a vast period.<a name=147:14></a> Who could have given it from such a standpoint but One who was divine.<a name=147:15></a> The detail of it is furnished to us in the Old Testament.<a name=147:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the next parable, and that is what I want to speak more of, the Son, whom you get also in the first parable, is prominent.<a name=147:17></a> The Son is killed in the first parable, but He becomes the great figure in the second.<a name=147:18></a> We get in this parable a similitude of the kingdom.<a name=147:19></a> I have endeavoured previously to convey an idea of what the kingdom of heaven means, the rule and light of that which God has been pleased to set in heaven.<a name=147:20></a> That is the simplest idea I can give of it; and properly man is now under the sway and influence of the kingdom down here.<a name=147:21></a> It is akin to what we get in Genesis, where God made a great light to rule the day.<a name=147:22></a> God has now set a great moral light in heaven, and we come under the sway and influence of

		The prominent feature in this parable is not Israel, nor the servants, nor the guests; the one who had not on the wedding garment is not the prominent thought, though he comes in; the One prominent is the Son.<a name=148:3></a> The King would make a marriage supper for His Son.<a name=148:4></a> It is a celebration which has the Son in view.<a name=148:5></a> That is the first point in this parable, and it is a contrast to the preceding one where the vineyard and the husbandmen were in view.<a name=148:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth is this: God had a great purpose in His mind, and that was to bring in One who should be the pillar and centre of the moral universe.<a name=148:7></a> God did not bring Christ in at first, He brought in man at first and man was set up in innocence, and we know the result.<a name=148:8></a> But that was not exactly the purpose of God.<a name=148:9></a> Then He took up Israel, a people; then in David a kingdom; in Nebuchadnezzar He established imperial power in the hands of man; but there was no real pillar, no centre, no sun as the source of light and influence and rule.<a name=148:10></a> The history of the Old Testament fails of that; at the close of the Old Testament we read in Malachi, "Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings".<a name=148:11></a> That is where everything had failed in regard of the past.<a name=148:12></a>

		But there is another point.<a name=149:8></a> In order that the Son of God should come into contact with man, He must have a medium for the world to come.<a name=149:9></a> What I understand is, that there must be a body so formed and wrought in the knowledge of the Son of God as that the Son of God might be known through that body, and that body is the bride.<a name=149:10></a> I could scarcely understand the constitution of the world to come apart from that.<a name=149:11></a> I do not think that the Son of God could come into immediate contact with the world again.<a name=149:12></a> There is the idea of the bride, the heavenly city, which has the glory of God, the wall of jasper and every gate a several pearl.<a name=149:13></a> It is essential to the universe of bliss that the Son of God should be the Sun and light and principle of rule in it.<a name=149:14></a> Another thing seems also essential, that is, a body effulgent with His light.<a name=149:15></a> That is what I understand by the holy city, new Jerusalem, the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=149:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I follow on the line which has been previously before us.<a name=155:3></a> I have endeavoured to bring out the fidelity of God.<a name=155:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40">Psalm  40</a>the Lord speaks of the righteousness and faithfulness of God: "I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation".<a name=155:5></a> There is in that a foundation for the soul.<a name=155:6></a> The present time is a time of faith, not of sight; nothing is made manifest to sight yet; and we need to be in the faith of God, and in the apprehension of the first principles connected with God -- righteousness and faithfulness.<a name=155:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My point in connection with the gospel of Matthew is this: while the faithfulness of God to His people comes out continually, yet we observe that the advent of Christ brought in new things, which never entered into the mind of the Jew as connected with the Messiah.<a name=155:8></a> It was evident that their thoughts were carnal; they did not go beyond the glorifying of their nation.<a name=155:9></a> But then, Christ being the Son of God, if He came, He must sit at the right hand of God.<a name=155:10></a> It is the suited place for the Son of God.<a name=155:11></a> It was even spoken of in the Old Testament: "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=155:12></a>

		Another thing the Lord takes up, which is spoken of in Hebrews: The Son of man made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.<a name=155:13></a> It was not merely because of the sufferings of death that He sits at the right hand of God, but of necessity as Son of man He must be at the right hand of

	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more in regard of that.<a name=159:17></a> All this was spoken to Jews.<a name=159:18></a> That proved the fidelity of God.<a name=159:19></a> Christ does not call in gentiles to give these instructions to, but those who had been His companions while here on earth.<a name=159:20></a> He gives them charge in that way, and shews briefly what will take place in His absence.<a name=159:21></a>

		But I want to dwell for a moment on the following parables.<a name=159:22></a> Another thought comes in them, and that is, the preparation for the day of His glory.<a name=159:23></a> In both parables you get the thought of long absence.<a name=159:24></a> In the first it says, "While the bridegroom tarried"; He did not come

		I do not think that what comes out in chapter 24 goes necessarily beyond the Jew and those associated with the Lord at that moment; but the thought of the kingdom of heaven cannot be limited to any particular people.<a name=160:4></a> If God saw fit to set a great light in heaven it must be common to all the earth.<a name=160:5></a> You cannot limit the idea of the ten virgins to the Jew.<a name=160:6></a> In chapter 25 we are evidently on broader ground, for we have a similitude of the kingdom, that is, of those who profess to be in the light and under the sway of what God has been pleased to establish in heaven.<a name=160:7></a> All the ten virgins take that ground, they "went forth to meet the bridegroom".<a name=160:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we can easily read the parable, but what do you think the mind of the Lord in it is?<a name=160:9></a> Evidently the Lord has something to secure.<a name=160:10></a> What I see is this, in the system of the world to come there is to be a vessel in which the light of God will shine forth.<a name=160:11></a> Christ is to be effulgent, but in a vessel.<a name=160:12></a> I do not think Christ will come to be looked upon again as He was in time past.<a name=160:13></a> He will never come again in humiliation close to man, but to be glorified in His saints and admired in all them that believe.<a name=160:14></a> We get that thought in the end of Revelation.<a name=160:15></a> The holy city, new Jerusalem, comes down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God and her light like unto a stone most precious.<a name=160:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I judge that is what the Lord has in view.<a name=160:17></a> He wants the five wise virgins.<a name=160:18></a> All ten take the ground of being under the influence and sway of heaven, but the five foolish were deficient, gravely deficient; they had not the Spirit; they had no oil in their vessels with their lamps.<a name=160:19></a> Without oil one can really have no moral suitability to the Bridegroom.<a name=160:20></a> In the virgins you get the idea of those uncontaminated by the world and its influence; they need to be in moral suitability to the Bridegroom.<a name=160:21></a> That is brought about in our being led by the Spirit of God

		I see that thought in the four prophecies of Balaam.<a name=161:2></a> In the first prophecy we get separation; in the second justification; in the third comeliness; in the fourth glory.<a name=161:3></a> These things are necessary for the glory of God and the blessing and well-being of man.<a name=161:4></a> These are all found in Christ and could not possibly be found elsewhere.<a name=161:5></a> They could not be found in Israel.<a name=161:6></a> Israel will come into the gain of them as we have done; but they are found in Christ, and we undergo an education now by the Spirit of God which enables us to apprehend all that subsists in Christ.<a name=161:7></a> I think it is thus we learn what is involved in the thought of the Sun of righteousness.<a name=161:8></a> He is to rise with healing in His wings.<a name=161:9></a> In Him is found everything that is necessary for the well-being of man here on earth.<a name=161:10></a> Men will find in Him true separation from the course of the world; they will be justified in Him so that God can say, I "have not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither .<a name=161:11></a>.<a name=161:12></a>.<a name=161:13></a> perverseness in Israel;" they will find in Him comeliness under the eye of God, but the comeliness will be of Christ; and so, too, the glory will not be of themselves, it will be of Christ.<a name=161:14></a> Simeon said when he took the child Jesus in his arms, that He was the glory of God's people Israel.<a name=161:15></a> The moment is one in which we are learning all that is in Christ.<a name=161:16></a> We have our part in it, otherwise we could not learn it; and we get apprehension of what Christ is as Head and centre of the whole system of blessing which God has purposed for the world to come.<a name=161:17></a>

		I have taken up this passage because we get in it remarkable instruction.<a name=165:1></a> The instruction to a certain extent depends on the way in which things are put together.<a name=165:2></a> I do not know whether these things happened consecutively; but that is not the manner of Luke.<a name=165:3></a> Luke pays little attention to what was simply consecutive in point of time: his point is what is consecutive morally, and that is vastly more important than what is consecutive historically.<a name=165:4></a> Now these things are morally consecutive, and they have to follow morally in our apprehension.<a name=165:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to bring out of the passage is extremely simple, but has to be verified in the experience of every one who is going on with God.<a name=165:6></a> I see many people in the world -- true christians -- pretty much content with pious life down here, and correctness of doctrine.<a name=165:7></a> They are zealous in regard to doctrine; and it is often a mark of people who have departed from vitality, that they are zealous as to doctrine.<a name=165:8></a> You see this in Ephesus: they had left their first love, they had departed from vitality, and they were zealous in regard to doctrine.<a name=165:9></a> I believe the true way to get at doctrine is vitality.<a name=165:10></a> Pursue vitality: if you get into that, you obtain more correct thoughts in regard to doctrine.<a name=165:11></a> You learn the letter from the spirit, not the spirit from the letter.<a name=165:12></a> No one ever got the spirit of truth from the letter; but by getting what is vital, you come to understand the letter.<a name=165:13></a> It is extremely likely that there will be a great deal of blundering in that way, but one arrives at doctrine in a sounder and better way than if one simply pursued the doctrine in itself.<a name=165:14></a> I would venture to urge on everyone the pursuit of what is vital; not simply to go in for correctness of doctrine and walk, but to go in for what is vital.<a name=165:15></a> "Lay hold of what is really life".<a name=165:16></a> Riches, you can well understand, are practically the life of this world; a man cannot make

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak of the contrast which comes before us here; it is between man and Christ.<a name=166:8></a> Man has to go, and Christ has to become everything, and this has to be verified in our experience.<a name=166:9></a> All that we are has to come to an end in our own thought of things; but on the other hand, Christ has to become everything to us.<a name=166:10></a> I think that is the only safe thing for man down here.<a name=166:11></a> It is a great thing when it comes to pass.<a name=166:12></a> I am sure it is the true way of happiness, and I do not believe there is another way.<a name=166:13></a> People have their ideas of happiness, and their ways of pursuing it.<a name=166:14></a> I have had enough experience of life to see that paths which people think lead to happiness do not lead to it at all; they lead to self-gratification.<a name=166:15></a> Gratification is not happiness: it has a sting.<a name=166:16></a> In real happiness there is no sting.<a name=166:17></a> "The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#10:22">Proverbs  10:22</a>.<a name=166:18></a> With self-pleasing, which people pursue in many ways -- in reading and other things -- there is a sting, and it will not secure happiness.<a name=166:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is a great lesson.<a name=167:11></a> I see it exemplified in a great many people in the world; they may be pious, may have opportunities, favours and mercies on the part of God, and are very likely taken up with them, but these things come in practically between themselves and God.<a name=167:12></a> Their thoughts are taken up with their opportunities, and the favours and mercies which God has granted to them, and that has not the effect of bridging the distance between God and themselves; people of that description rarely come to close quarters with God.<a name=167:13></a> The very opportunities and mercies they have on the part of God really intervene, in a sense, between themselves and God.<a name=167:14></a> People with great opportunities and favours in this world are not to be greatly envied from a spiritual point of view; because what a man is in the mercy and favour of God down here, may so fill his thought and mind that it comes between himself and God, and he never really gets into intimacy with God.<a name=167:15></a> That was the case with Peter.<a name=167:16></a> He does not come into the presence of the Lord, but he says, Depart from me!<a name=167:17></a> What an appeal on the part of Peter, after all that the Lord had given to him!<a name=167:18></a> The truth is that what Peter needed, and what we have to come to, is that <i>we</i> have to go.<a name=167:19></a> A man has to get

		Now that had come to pass in the case of Peter.<a name=168:6></a> I cannot conceive that a greater favour could be granted to us on the part of God, than that our minds should be practically rid from the encumbrance of self.<a name=168:7></a> What belongs to oneself may have such importance in one's mind, that it practically becomes a hindrance to intercourse with God.<a name=168:8></a> When we come before God, what can we bring to Him?<a name=168:9></a> You cannot bring yourself before Him; what are you in the eyes of God?<a name=168:10></a> What are the favours you have in this world?<a name=168:11></a> We want to be before God in mind and spirit divested of their importance and power, so that we are before Him in nothingness.<a name=168:12></a> There is a hymn which expresses it: --

		It is not surprising that we find the same principles always appearing in Scripture, because Scripture is the utterance of the living God, whatever part it be; and God being one, you do not expect to find differences of principle in His utterances.<a name=175:1></a> You may find great differences in detail, and in the way in which God presents Himself at different times to men.<a name=175:2></a> Before the flood, God did not, in a sense, present Himself at all; He allowed men to walk in their own ways.<a name=175:3></a> Then under the law, the attitude of God was that of a legislator, and that attitude was more or less maintained in regard to Israel right on to the end of the Old Testament.<a name=175:4></a> When we come to the New Testament, we get another attitude which God has assumed -- that of a Saviour God.<a name=175:5></a> The apostle Paul very commonly uses that expression.<a name=175:6></a> Evidently the attitude of a Saviour God is different from that of a lawgiver.<a name=175:7></a> Hereafter God will assume the attitude of Judge of all (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>).<a name=175:8></a> So that you see there is a great deal of difference in the attitude which God from time to time assumes in regard to men, and yet that does not for a moment affect the truth.<a name=175:9></a> The same principles prevail in Scripture from beginning to end.<a name=175:10></a> "The Same" is a remarkable expression, used in regard to God.<a name=175:11></a> It is a title or designation; "Thou art the Same".<a name=175:12></a> He does not change; "I, Jehovah, change not".<a name=175:13></a> This is a great point, and as one comes to know more and more of Scripture, one sees the same principles prevailing throughout the entire dealings of God with men.<a name=175:14></a> It is a great expression of grace on the part of God that He has been pleased to give us the record of His dealings with His people of old.<a name=175:15></a> In a sense, those dealings do not immediately affect us, because God is dealing with us outwardly on a different principle, but they are of the deepest interest to us.<a name=175:16></a>

		widow woman in Kings is the principle of the gospel.<a name=176:1></a> Grace came in in regard to her, for Elisha was a prophet whose ministry was characterised by grace.<a name=176:2></a> Elijah had a different mission.<a name=176:3></a> He represented the claim and right of God, and sought to recall the people to allegiance to God.<a name=176:4></a> Elisha, on the other hand, came in the ministration of grace, and thus both are sustained.<a name=176:5></a> Surely God is entitled to reproach His people with departure, and to recall them to allegiance in connection with their responsibility; but if the work of God stopped there, it would not effect anything.<a name=176:6></a> God might reproach His people with departure, and did so continually in the prophets.<a name=176:7></a> It was perfectly right; the people ought not to have departed, and if they did, they ought to have returned, but they did not.<a name=176:8></a> Elisha supersedes Elijah, and comes to God's people in the ministration of grace in spite of everything.<a name=176:9></a> He represents, in a sense, the still small voice; he presents the grace of God coming in to deliver the people in spite of everything.<a name=176:10></a> The enemy that oppressed them at that time was the Syrian, and the people had deliverance from the Syrian by the intervention of Elisha.<a name=176:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But my point is that we get here what I may call a typical incident.<a name=176:12></a> The woman was an obscure person, a widow, of the wives of the sons of the prophets, but she was representative; what happened to her is in a way figurative of the ways of God in grace.<a name=176:13></a> The grace of God, by the prophet, came in to relieve her from her liability, but at the same time, the grace did not end there: the same grace which relieved her of her liability, enabled her to live.<a name=176:14></a> I think that is a great principle in the ways of God.<a name=176:15></a> The same grace which has come in to relieve us of our liability is the grace by which we are enabled to live according to God down here.<a name=176:16></a> I see the principle in the parable of the ten virgins, and we have it expressed in terms in the passage I read from Titus.<a name=176:17></a> The first aspect of the grace of God is that it brings salvation to all men, but then, it goes on to teach us.<a name=176:18></a> There is first the grace of God presented toward us, then

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is a point of great interest to see that this has ever been the principle with God.<a name=177:3></a> God is ever the same.<a name=177:4></a> Principles might not come out so clearly in the Old Testament as they do in the gospel, but they were there, and we have incidents related to us in Scripture which show that they existed, and they come out clearly enough in this case.<a name=177:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In one sense, the prophet did not do anything very striking; the woman had to provide vessels, and grace came to her in a simple kind of way, in the multiplication of her oil.<a name=177:14></a> The oil was increased, very much like you find the Lord making use of the five loaves and two fishes which the disciples had.<a name=177:15></a> The Lord did not ignore what they had; the five loaves and two fishes were multiplied so as to suffice for the needs of the whole multitude.<a name=177:16></a> Now Elisha does not ignore the pot of oil; he takes what the woman had, and in the hands of the prophet the oil becomes abundant, not only sufficing to pay the debt, but that she might live of the residue.<a name=177:17></a> The oil only stayed when there were no more vessels.<a name=177:18></a> The supply of oil was unlimited, but the vessels were limited, and when there were no more, the oil stayed.<a name=177:19></a>

		THE SERVICE OF CHRIST

		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:26">Luke  8:26</a> - 56

	<div class="paragraph">
		The interest of this scripture is that it furnishes an epitome of the service of Christ.<a name=185:1></a> It is what could not have been invented by man; it could only be given to us by one who had divine knowledge of things, that is, by the Spirit of God.<a name=185:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point comes out in connection with that; one sees in the passage how completely all the power of evil, everything that oppresses man, was under the hand of the Lord.<a name=185:3></a> We get devils -- a legion of devils; bodily infirmity in the case of the woman; then the pressure of death in the house of the ruler of the synagogue.<a name=185:4></a> All these are things which affect man.<a name=185:5></a> In the case of the daughter of Jairus, it was those who were living who were affected by death.<a name=185:6></a> The maid had passed away, but those who were living remained under the pressure of death.<a name=185:7></a> The power of evil and the pressure of death are weighing on man in the world; but we find in the Lord complete authority over all.<a name=185:8></a> He came here in the grace of God, with complete power over all that afflicted man, the blessed expression of divine grace toward man.<a name=185:9></a> The grace of God that brought salvation to all men had appeared; it was ushered in by the presence of the Lord Jesus here upon earth.<a name=185:10></a> There went virtue out of Him, and healed all.<a name=185:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak of that to give a general idea of the passage.<a name=185:12></a> It begins with the demoniac, and terminates with the raising of the daughter of Jairus.<a name=185:13></a> I say one word in regard of the last incident, because I shall not refer to it again; it no doubt carries us on to the time when Christ will come again.<a name=185:14></a> It is then that He will appear in the power of life and raise up the daughter of Israel.<a name=185:15></a> But I want to occupy your attention with what comes out in the case of the demoniac and of the woman with the issue of blood.<a name=185:16></a> I refer to what came out on the part of the Lord.<a name=185:17></a> It is a great thing to get a true thought of Christ,

		and of what appertains to Him, because it tends to increase our appreciation of Christ.<a name=186:1></a> We want not only to know who Christ is, but to apprehend all that is vested in and belongs to Him in regard to man.<a name=186:2></a> We find out thus what the value of Christ is in regard to man.<a name=186:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we see in the case of the demoniac the ability of Christ to bring everything to an issue -- I might put it in other words -- we have the power and authority of Christ to resolve the question of good and evil, to disentangle what has become entangled.<a name=186:4></a> The effect of sin and the power of Satan having come into this world has been to a large extent to entangle good and evil.<a name=186:5></a> If you look abroad in the world, you will admit that it is a scene of moral confusion.<a name=186:6></a> Well, no one can think that confusion is according to God; God is not the author of confusion; I think it would be a poor mind that would attribute confusion to God.<a name=186:7></a> But it does not take much perception to see that the world is full of confusion; everything is mixed up.<a name=186:8></a> If you look around the little circle which is known to you, you will see any amount of confusion.<a name=186:9></a> What I mean by confusion is the mixing up of good and evil.<a name=186:10></a> In any circle of society you may see remains of what is of God, and good, natural affection is in the world, intelligence, and conscience on the part of man.<a name=186:11></a> I am not now speaking of converted men; but of man as man, and in him you see many beautiful things.<a name=186:12></a> Amiability and the like; the Lord looked upon the young ruler and loved him.<a name=186:13></a> You see natural affection in a mother and her children; with children you often see a large measure of innocence -- I do not mean absolutely, but in a way.<a name=186:14></a> There are qualities in the world which are of God, traces of His hand in the world, and no one can deny their beauty.<a name=186:15></a> I pity the person who would.<a name=186:16></a> I have often thought that a saving clause in the world, as it is, is the presence of natural affection.<a name=186:17></a> It is the one thing which prevents the world being a kind of hell.<a name=186:18></a> No one can deny that these things are beautiful in their place, and that they are of God.<a name=186:19></a> But if I look at man as he is, these things are mixed up with an evil will; they are distorted

		That has been the work of the devil, just as in one of the parables of the kingdom of heaven (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>), the Lord referred to what would take place; He had sowed good seed in His field, but an enemy had sowed tares, so that there might be a mixture and the Lord said the mixture was to go on until the time of harvest; then the disentanglement would come.<a name=187:2></a> I only refer to it to show that entanglement is the work of the enemy.<a name=187:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with Christ is perfect authority and power to disentangle good and evil; that is, the Lord can bring, and will bring, everything to an issue.<a name=187:4></a> That is what God has been doing all along the line, and the last act in this disentanglement will be the great white throne, and in result, good and evil will each find their own place.<a name=187:5></a> What we find at the end of the Revelation is, on the one hand, the lake of fire in which are the devil and his angels, the beast, the false prophet, death, hell, and whosoever was not found written in the book of life; but, on the other hand, we have presented to us a new heaven and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.<a name=187:6></a> This shows the great end which God purposes to bring about, and for which He is working: the complete disentanglement of good and evil.<a name=187:7></a>

		It is a very interesting passage; but the point of moment is to see what appertains to Christ: He has power and authority to bring to an issue the question of good and evil.<a name=188:6></a> God cannot tolerate confusion for ever: everything in result will be disentangled.<a name=188:7></a> It is a great point when that takes place in regard to us.<a name=188:8></a> The work of grace in us is to disentangle good and evil; we get our senses exercised to discern both good and evil, and in that way we learn to approve of good and to refuse evil.<a name=188:9></a> How is the question brought to an issue?<a name=188:10></a> By the Spirit of Christ in us.<a name=188:11></a> It was predicted in regard of the Lord Himself, in Isaiah, that He should eat butter and honey, that He might know how to refuse the evil and choose the good, and that becomes verified in those in whom is the Spirit of Christ.<a name=188:12></a> The question of good and evil will be brought to a final issue at the great white throne; in the meantime it has been brought to an issue in regard to the Jew.<a name=188:13></a> The Jews are a public witness of it to the present day; they are lost in the sea of the gentiles, and what brought that about was their rejection of the light presented to them in Christ.<a name=188:14></a> They became possessed by the power of evil, and were hurried down to national destruction.<a name=188:15></a> But in the meantime God took care that there should be a remnant delivered from the power of evil, who should be at the disposal of the One who delivered them.<a name=188:16></a> The man who was delivered wanted to be with Jesus, but the Lord did not suffer him; He said, Go home, and show how great things God hath done

		But now the truth is this, that Christ is at the disposal of all.<a name=190:14></a> The woman had that amount of light, that there was virtue in Christ.<a name=190:15></a> That is the evidence of faith.<a name=190:16></a> You are not called upon to believe anything about yourself; the idea that Scripture gives is, that you apprehend what is in Christ, and this woman apprehended that there was healing virtue in Christ, and Christ was available to her.<a name=190:17></a> She was healed by the virtue which went forth from Christ.<a name=190:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to apply that to us, because I have no doubt that we get in the latter part of this chapter an epitome of the service of the Lord; and what took place in regard to the woman really gives us an idea of what is the present service of the Lord, just as what took place in regard of the demoniac presents to us what came to pass in connection with the presentation of Christ here.<a name=191:3></a> On the other hand, what came to pass in the case of the daughter of Jairus refers to what will take place when the Lord comes again.<a name=191:4></a>

		Now I put before you what all will allow; that is that at the present time Christ is available to all.<a name=191:5></a> He is the Mediator between God and men, and at the present time there is not a man in the world to whom Christ is not available.<a name=191:6></a> The only recommendation to Christ is that a man should have need, and be beyond the power of human physicians.<a name=191:7></a> Let a man come to that sense, that his life is ebbing out, that he is going on to eternity and is beyond human help -- he is in a fit state for Christ.<a name=191:8></a> But then Christ is always available.<a name=191:9></a> He is not simply available to a man who is awakened to his need, but always available.<a name=191:10></a> But if a man is to avail himself of Christ, he would not think of it until he comes to find his need of Christ -- and he finds that in apprehending that his life is fast ebbing, and that there is no human physician who can bring moral healing to him.<a name=191:11></a> People try all sorts of things in this world, and think they are going to get by them happiness and satisfaction.<a name=191:12></a> You may get gratification, but not happiness.<a name=191:13></a> Happiness is really a test of everything.<a name=191:14></a> The point is, what will minister it to you?<a name=191:15></a> Self-gratification will not.<a name=191:16></a> You may read novels, and get gratification; you may pursue music, and gratify yourself in that way; but depend upon it, no pursuit of that kind will bring content and happiness.<a name=191:17></a> Things may be pretty much measured by whether they bring content or not.<a name=191:18></a> None of the nostrums which

		Now Christ presents God to us in grace through redemption.<a name=192:3></a> That is a great thought to my mind; and what I mean by redemption is this, that God has been pleased to take up the liabilities under which man lay.<a name=192:4></a> I need hardly say that God did that by Christ.<a name=192:5></a> Man was under liabilities under the eye of God, and God in Christ took up those liabilities, so that they have been discharged.<a name=192:6></a> Christ is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the whole world.<a name=192:7></a> The liabilities have been discharged in the grace of God, so that Christ might be available to every man, and He presents God to us in grace through redemption, not simply in grace, but in grace through redemption.<a name=192:8></a> That is the light in which Christ presents God to man.<a name=192:9></a>

		There is nothing much more striking in Scripture than the way in which we get incidents grouped together in the gospel of Luke.<a name=195:1></a> It has been pointed out that Luke concerns himself very little about chronological order: his habit is to group incidents together so as to present a kind of picture.<a name=195:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I desire to put together the incidents and the parable related to us here, for they give us a very interesting picture of Christ.<a name=195:3></a> What we want is the apprehension of Christ.<a name=195:4></a> The apostle Paul could say that be counted all things loss for the "excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:8">Philippians  3:8</a>), he appropriated Christ in that way.<a name=195:5></a> Then again, the object for which gifts are given is "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God".<a name=195:6></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>.<a name=195:7></a> The faith and the knowledge of the Son of God would bring us into unity; and gifts were given to that end.<a name=195:8></a> Christ is the blessed Head, and we have to grow up into Him in all things; we grow up, in point of intelligence, in Him who is the Head.<a name=195:9></a> I will make use of the incidents I have read in order to present Christ.<a name=195:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is here brought before us in three aspects.<a name=195:11></a> In the first part of the passage I have read, we have the Son in relation to the Father.<a name=195:12></a> Then we learn what Christ is to man, as Neighbour; then what He is to the disciple; Mary sat at His feet and heard His word.<a name=195:13></a> In regard of the Father, all things are delivered to Him of the Father; then in regard to man, in being Neighbour to the one that fell among thieves, He is really Neighbour to every man; then as to Mary, Christ is light to the believer's soul.<a name=195:14></a> It is our privilege to know Christ in all these lights.<a name=195:15></a> Our blessing depends upon our being led by the Spirit of God into the knowledge of Christ.<a name=195:16></a> You have an unction from the Holy One, and know all things; we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=196>[Page 196]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		know the things which are centred in Christ.<a name=196:1></a> I cannot conceive that an unction from the Holy One would do anything else except lead us into the knowledge of Christ, and that which is centred in Him.<a name=196:2></a> You are not taught of man; you may have certain things brought under your attention; gifts are given to that end, that truth might be kept under the attention of the saints; but you are not taught of man.<a name=196:3></a> I am not your teacher, nor anyone else: you are taught of God.<a name=196:4></a> The anointing refers to the Spirit of God, who is the teacher of the people of God.<a name=196:5></a> The anointing teaches in an indescribable kind of way, I could not attempt to explain how people are taught by the Spirit of God.<a name=196:6></a> The mighty power of the Spirit in the believer brings his heart under the influence of the love of God, and if you come under the influence of divine love, you make rapid and natural progress in the things of God.<a name=196:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point I want to touch upon is that which Christ is to the Father.<a name=196:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we read that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father; here He says, "All things are delivered to me of my Father".<a name=196:9></a> The Son is the object of the Father's counsel and the subject of the Father's love: He is the centre of the Father's system.<a name=196:10></a> It is a great thing to apprehend that the Father has in view a system of blessing, a universe of bliss, in all its varied parts, which originated in the Father's counsels, and of that system Christ is the centre, so that He may order everything according to the love of God.<a name=196:11></a> We get an idea of it on the mount of transfiguration, when He received from God the Father, honour and glory.<a name=196:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one word more in regard of that: "No man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father".<a name=196:13></a> The Son is not known to us in His own proper being: He is only known to the Father in that way.<a name=196:14></a> We never know the Son other than become incarnate, and in that sense subject to the Father: "my Father is greater than I" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:28">John  14:28</a>.<a name=196:15></a> We know Christ as the blessed sent One of the Father, that He might make known the Father, and
	</div>

		<a name=197>[Page 197]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Father's counsels, of which He Himself is the blessed centre.<a name=197:1></a> There is nothing hid from us as to what Christ is morally; and we are privileged to know all that He is according to the Father's counsel, even what He is as an object of the Father's love; but His own proper being, as such, is known only to the Father.<a name=197:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may remember the remarkable prayer at the end of the third of Ephesians: the expanse of the system of which Christ is the centre is there brought before us, and the apostle prays that the saints might know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge.<a name=197:3></a> That gives us the idea of how Christ will order everything according to divine love.<a name=197:4></a> It is a great thing to apprehend what Christ is; Head of that system which originated in the counsel of the Father and in which God will be glorified, and every circle ordered and affected by divine love, so that the whole system will be pervaded by God.<a name=197:5></a> That is what Christ will bring to pass, that God may be glorified in everything; as we sometimes sing: --

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get the same thought stated a little differently in the gospel of John.<a name=197:11></a> The Lord says, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand".<a name=197:12></a> This brings in the additional thought that the Father loves the Son.<a name=197:13></a> John brings it in there to show that the Son is the test of everyone.<a name=197:14></a> He that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.<a name=197:15></a> The Son coming in has of necessity become a test to man: every man is tested by the Son.<a name=197:16></a> The Jew is an example of the one who is not subject to the Son, and has come under the wrath of God.<a name=197:17></a> Wrath has come upon them to the uttermost, because having been tested by the Son they are not subject to Him.<a name=197:18></a> The Jew after the flesh shall not see life, but the wrath of God continues on him.<a name=197:19></a>

		Now the One to whom all things are delivered of the Father has become Neighbour to man, and the distance is bridged between the Father and man.<a name=198:14></a> It is a very blessed thing to meditate upon Christ as man's Neighbour.<a name=198:15></a> In order to make that point clear, I refer to the man that fell among thieves.<a name=198:16></a> That man evidently presents to us the Jew, but not the Jew in his best estate, for the thieves had left him nothing, neither reputation, possessions nor covering; they had wounded him, and stripped him of his raiment, and left him half dead.<a name=198:17></a> That is the position in which the Jew was when the Neighbour appeared.<a name=198:18></a> The Neighbour did not appear before the Jew was stripped and impoverished.<a name=198:19></a> The Jew did not make use of the privileges and opportunities which God had placed within his reach, and God allowed him to be served in that way by the thieves.<a name=198:20></a> That was the position into which Christ came: Israel had been carried away captive by the Assyrian, and the Jew led captive by Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=198:21></a> The man that fell among thieves was beyond the power of priest or Levite.<a name=198:22></a> The truth is that the Jew represents man under culture.<a name=198:23></a> There are two

		Now it was into that state of things that Christ came.<a name=199:9></a> The Neighbour came when everything was it its worst, when the Jew was robbed, stripped, and half-dead.<a name=199:10></a> Things had come to that pass that the legal system was of no use to them.<a name=199:11></a> Then came the Neighbour, full of grace and truth, seeking to affect man by grace, bringing the light of what was in the heart of God.<a name=199:12></a> He came with illimitable power to support man, if they received the grace.<a name=199:13></a> He could support them down here; the Lord proved that in regard to the disciples.<a name=199:14></a> He supported them in all their ministry, so that He could turn to the Father at the end and say, "Those that thou gavest me I have kept" <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:12">John  17:12</a>.<a name=199:15></a> Not only did He minister to them of the abundance of grace, but, so long as He was down here, He kept them in the Father's name.<a name=199:16></a> When the Neighbour came upon the scene, it was the darkest day in the history of the Jew.<a name=199:17></a> It was not the beginning, when Moses or Joshua was there, but the day when everything had come to ruin on the footing of responsibility.<a name=199:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We come together in assembly really in order to bring in Christ as Head; this is the point of the Supper.<a name=218:3></a> We recall Christ, and He is only to be recalled by that which speaks of His death.<a name=218:4></a> The great point for the disciples was to recall Him when He was leaving or had left them, to bring Him to mind; so it is with us all along the line.<a name=218:5></a> <i>Paul</i> got it from heaven for revelation to the gentiles.<a name=218:6></a>

		The first great point in coming together in assembly is to recall the Head, and that is through the breaking of bread.<a name=218:7></a> We call Him to mind according as He has been set forth in death.<a name=218:8></a> No one else is known by his death, but with Christ it is so; you cannot properly know Him apart from His death.<a name=218:9></a> You see the great principles that ruled Him, and those principles were shewn out in His death; every act of His ministry really came out in His death.<a name=218:10></a> In death man was put out, but it was in order that God might be brought in.<a name=218:11></a> All His miracles brought God in, but then there was the exclusion of man; no pretension of man was allowed at all by Him; man had no place, but on the other hand God was brought in.<a name=218:12></a> All this was seen in its fullest extent in His death.<a name=218:13></a> Man was really condemned by the very fact of Christ becoming a Man, but then God came in.<a name=218:14></a> So we see that in the assembly there is no room for any pretension of man, but God is there.<a name=218:15></a>

		My object in reading these passages was to illustrate principles in the dealings of God with man.<a name=269:1></a> In the verse read from Hebrews you get the two principles -- righteousness and lawlessness.<a name=269:2></a> The place Christ has in relation to His "fellows" is really the result of the great question of righteousness and lawlessness being brought to an issue.<a name=269:3></a> In Old Testament times there might be a question as to the pathway of a godly person; not so now, everything is clearly and definitely defined, and therefore the path of Christ is our path, to love righteousness and hate lawlessness.<a name=269:4></a>

		We are become fellows of Christ; our practice must then be according to Him, and that way is loving righteousness and hating lawlessness, and the power has come in to enable us to refuse the one and to practise the other.<a name=269:5></a> We thus manifest that we are the children of God by our practising righteousness.<a name=269:6></a> When God created man there was no such thing as lawlessness; when it came in, then, as a result, death followed and hatred too; Cain hated his brother.<a name=269:7></a> It may be covered up in society, but underneath all you may be sure there is hatred.<a name=269:8></a>

		We get these two principles illustrated in Saul and David.<a name=269:9></a> Saul was a distinguished man after the flesh, and in the beginning Saul shewed his prowess; he was distinguished as a man.<a name=269:10></a> What we find in David is that whenever he was in a crisis righteousness prevailed.<a name=269:11></a> With Saul, when he was in a crisis we find that the <i>opposite</i> came out.<a name=269:12></a> Saul had to wait for Samuel seven days, and he was lawless and did not wait.<a name=269:13></a> What the prophet said to Saul was the word of God to him, and Saul did not wait for the word of the Lord; the fear of <i>man</i> was before him and that brings a snare.<a name=269:14></a>

		Amalekites; he did not do so -- he spared them -- the favour of man was before him; in both cases he was lawless.<a name=270:1></a> These two things are prone to govern us, the fear and the favour of man, and if we yield to their influences we shall be marked by lawlessness.<a name=270:2></a> Any one who has had experience of the world knows how we are tested either by the fear or the favour of man, and if you yield you become lawless.<a name=270:3></a> Saul had direction from the Lord; so that to act by the fear or the favour of man was to be lawless, and it is a shocking thing to be lawless.<a name=270:4></a> Some would say that he did not do anything gross, but we must not be biased by anything of the fear or the favour of man.<a name=270:5></a> Saul lost the kingdom; he was lawless; God does not allow the kingdom to a lawless man.<a name=270:6></a>

		In David you get a righteous man; in the two passages read you find the righteousness of David; to cut off a piece of Saul's skirt was to do dishonour to the Lord's anointed.<a name=270:7></a> I do not know if the Amalekite really slew Saul, but if he did it was very remarkable, because Saul had spared Amalek; but as for David he had the Amalekite slain because of the dishonour done by him to the Lord's anointed, and David shewed thus his allegiance to the Lord's anointed.<a name=270:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thing which is very marked in all the Scriptures, and that is that they are not simply a compilation of writings of different times, and by different people, but that in every book you get evidence of method which shows it to be part of a whole.<a name=310:1></a> I might take up various points and go into detail, but that is not my purpose; I only wish to refer to that as regards this particular epistle.<a name=310:2></a> Scripture is not a collection of wise sayings, nor is any epistle an elaborate treatise on christianity.<a name=310:3></a> The truth is given in detail, and it is only put together as a whole by the Spirit of God -- that is what He does in the souls of believers.<a name=310:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With regard to the place of christians as looked at down here, there are two things which go together -- inside the veil and outside the camp (verses 11 - 13).<a name=311:3></a> If on the one hand we have the privilege of going inside the veil, on the other hand our place in the world is outside the camp.<a name=311:4></a> If God encourages us to take up these peculiar and heavenly privileges, our only place in regard to the world is that which Christ has Himself taken, and thus we are in accord with His death.<a name=311:5></a> Anyone having the apprehension of Christ as having "ascended up far above all heavens, that be might fill all things", is in the fellowship of the death of Christ.<a name=311:6></a> The very thought of Christ filling all things is the setting aside of the world system.<a name=311:7></a> Scripture gives us a good idea of what is now filling the world, and that is lust, pride, and ambition.<a name=311:8></a> This world is a scene where man seeks his own glory and is glorified.<a name=311:9></a> If Christ is to fill all things, that of necessity must set aside the world as it is, because Christ is going to fill the universe with the knowledge of God, and men will be subdued by the light of God, that all may be according to the glory of God.<a name=311:10></a> If we have any apprehension of the place of Christ, our place is of necessity in the fellowship of His death.<a name=311:11></a> He has died once, and we also count ourselves to be dead to sin and to the world.<a name=311:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point before me now is, our dress as down here.<a name=311:13></a> In the first few verses we get brotherly love, hospitality, regard for those who are suffering, marriage, contentment, and finally to remember the leaders.<a name=311:14></a> This shows how a christian is to be marked.<a name=311:15></a> Brotherly love and hospitality are to have their place, then we are to regard the ordinances of God.<a name=311:16></a> Christians should not run after asceticism, but be content with their circumstances.<a name=311:17></a> If you are unquiet and unrestful in the circumstances in which you are placed in the providence of God, you will not make real progress spiritually.<a name=311:18></a> The principle is, "Be

		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		content with such things as ye have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee".<a name=312:1></a> We get two things coupled together, contentment in confidence in God, and not being in fear of man.<a name=312:2></a> If we expect anything from man we are afraid of man, but if we are content and expecting nothing from man we are not afraid, and can boldly say, "The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me".<a name=312:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But let us pass to verses 9 - 16.<a name=312:4></a> I am not seeking to present anything new in regard to the altar.<a name=312:5></a> The great point is, "We have an altar".<a name=312:6></a> There was no altar within the veil.<a name=312:7></a> There was the ark of the covenant, the mercy-seat, and the cherubim.<a name=312:8></a> But there is for us an altar.<a name=312:9></a> What I understand by the altar is the place of God's holy judgment.<a name=312:10></a> The patriarchs had an altar.<a name=312:11></a> It was an advantage to them, they could approach God, but the effect was that they came under the holy judgment of God; for the altar was the place of God's holy judgment.<a name=312:12></a> The place of God's holy judgment in regard to us was the death of Christ.<a name=312:13></a> In the death of Christ man's state as after the flesh, the old man, came under the judgment of God.<a name=312:14></a> Christ was made sin for us.<a name=312:15></a> The cross was the place where all things came to an issue.<a name=312:16></a> It was an appointed place and an appointed moment, and there was the termination of the old man under the holy judgment of God.<a name=312:17></a> On our part our minds are to be in accord with that altar.<a name=312:18></a> God did not appoint suffering to us, but He did to Christ.<a name=312:19></a> Christ suffered when the old man came under the judgment of God.<a name=312:20></a> But then as we eat of that altar our minds are in accord with that holy judgment.<a name=312:21></a> "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?<a name=312:22></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=312:23></a>" If we eat of that altar our minds are in the fellowship of Christ's death.<a name=312:24></a> "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=312:25></a> "Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ".<a name=312:26></a> "Our old man is crucified with him".<a name=312:27></a> This means that by the Spirit of God our minds are in accord with the holy

		judgment of God which came to pass in the death of Christ.<a name=313:1></a> If it be so, it is impossible to go on with the religious world.<a name=313:2></a> "We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle".<a name=313:3></a> Those who serve the tabernacle are not entitled to eat of our altar.<a name=313:4></a> It is impossible that they can have the fellowship of that altar, because they seek to maintain religion as connected with man after the flesh, and if our minds are in accord with the holy judgment of God, we cannot recognise one another as after the flesh.<a name=313:5></a> The terrible thing is that christendom recognises the old man.<a name=313:6></a> The state church takes account of every man in the country as a parishioner.<a name=313:7></a> A minister in a chapel takes account of all his congregation; the question is not raised as to whether they have put off the old man and put on the new.<a name=313:8></a> Such ministers in principle serve the tabernacle, and therefore they have no right to eat of our altar, because if one is identified with that altar it follows that his place down here is dead to sin and to the world, and especially in regard to the world in its religious aspect.<a name=313:9></a> I can show no fellowship with men in religious ordinances of any kind.<a name=313:10></a> I am outside of all by my mind being in accord with the holy judgment of God.<a name=313:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our coming together on the Lord's day morning does not mean that we are in accord with christendom, and that people may come to our meetings as they would go to chapel.<a name=313:12></a> What I mean is that we are not in accord with all that is around, but in coming together we come together in the fellowship of the death of Christ, and as separated by that death from all the systems connected with man after the flesh.<a name=313:13></a> We have gone outside the camp.<a name=313:14></a>

		We might look a little at <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:19">Revelation  3:19</a>, 20.<a name=313:15></a> My reason for referring to this scripture is that the Lord is presented in it as at the door and virtually saying, I have no sympathy with what is going on inside, though He takes account of all that goes on there and gives counsel, but He is morally outside of it all.<a name=313:16></a> "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should be glad if this point could be made plain, for probably many come together as a religious duty, and the question is not raised as to the ground on which they come.<a name=314:5></a> People know that there are certain obligations to God, and they come together to render what is due.<a name=314:6></a> This is so far right, but in coming together we are in the fellowship of the death of Christ, separate from the course of things connected with man in the flesh.<a name=314:7></a> They have no right to eat of our altar which serve the tabernacle; they are parted from us and we from them.<a name=314:8></a> It is an exceedingly important point in regard to our position down here.<a name=314:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to another point -- we bear the reproach of Christ.<a name=314:10></a> Christ came under reproach.<a name=314:11></a> He took the place of the old man, and the reproach was His identification with that man, and bearing the judgment that was his due.<a name=314:12></a> That man has come under the judgment of God, and we bear the reproach of that condemnation.<a name=314:13></a> Then we have here no continuing city, but we seek one to come (verse 14).<a name=314:14></a> I can understand a person saying to a christian, Well, if everyone thought as you do, the world would come to an end.<a name=314:15></a> I should not mind if it did.<a name=314:16></a> There is no assurance of permanency in connection with this world.<a name=314:17></a> If it should come to an end, we have to do with a <i>living</i> Christ.<a name=314:18></a> We are identified with a living Christ by the Spirit of God.<a name=314:19></a> The one side is as true as the other; if we are identified with the death of Christ, He is a <i>living</i> Christ to us; He lives again in the power of the Spirit.<a name=314:20></a> That is a wonderful thought, and we are attached to a living Christ by the Spirit which is given to us.<a name=314:21></a> Thus we can reckon ourselves dead to the world and the religious systems connected with man after the flesh, but are able also in Christ to reckon ourselves <i>alive</i> to

		Take an instance.<a name=315:12></a> Mary of Bethany sat at the feet of the Lord and heard His word; she had a great appreciation of Christ, and you may be sure she would offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, the fruit of her lips giving thanks to His name.<a name=315:13></a>

		I am going to speak of things which are incontestably true.<a name=317:1></a> If everything were to be made a question of philosophy, which is man's reason, or of science, which is largely man's deduction, then you might put moral considerations aside; but if our minds entertain any thought of God at all, we must bring in moral considerations, and if there are moral considerations, there are certain things which are incontestably true.<a name=317:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two simple thoughts before me with which we are all more or less familiar, but which I am going to present to you in a somewhat new dress: they are departure and recovery.<a name=317:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you entertain any thought of God at all, you cannot be taken up merely with material considerations.<a name=317:4></a> Surely we are moral beings: there is such a thing as conscience, and that is a moral consideration.<a name=317:5></a> So, too, in regard to affections: man is capable of intelligent affections, and if so there are moral considerations; and if you take them into account, you must admit the thought of departure and recovery.<a name=317:6></a> If you do not entertain the thought of departure, what you are reduced to is, that the handiwork of God is bad, because no one can deny that man is not entirely what he ought to be.<a name=317:7></a> If your mind entertains the thought of departure, you can understand that the work of God may have been good, but that man may have been corrupted from what God made him.<a name=317:8></a> But then you must entertain another thought, and that is recovery.<a name=317:9></a> God has not been pleased to cut man off suddenly, and that leads to the thought of recovery.<a name=317:10></a> One is the antithesis of the other.<a name=317:11></a> They are the subjects of the two great parts of scripture: the Old Testament is more or less taken up with the departure; you get gleams of light coming in here and there; but in the New Testament you get the recovery, for God was bent upon it.<a name=317:12></a> Both are presented in a striking way in the parable of the prodigal: departure

	<div class="paragraph">
		on the part of the prodigal, and recovery on the part of the father.<a name=318:1></a> I should be dead against the material infidelity of the present day: I think it so unworthy and so immoral, because, unless you exclude all thought of God, you must take moral considerations into account, and if you do so, then you must admit departure and recovery.<a name=318:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to touch upon the principles of each.<a name=318:3></a> The principles of departure were lawlessness and hatred.<a name=318:4></a> Consequently the principles of recovery must be correlative, and are righteousness and love.<a name=318:5></a> One deduces these things from Scripture: they are not inventions of the mind.<a name=318:6></a> I have great reverence for Scripture, and the effect it produces on my mind increasingly is that what is of God must be right.<a name=318:7></a> You may not for the moment be quite capable of discerning the rightness: but you may be sure it is right, and if you go on with God, He will show you the rightness of it.<a name=318:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will bring before you a few thoughts in regard to the departure.<a name=318:9></a> It is not a very happy subject, but it is very important that we should understand what has brought about the present state of confusion in the world.<a name=318:10></a> I should not give a man credit for much observation if he did not apprehend the confusion which prevails in the world.<a name=318:11></a> I do not want to occupy you with that alone; I desire you to see how God has wrought to bring about recovery, and how He has brought in the principles of righteousness and love.<a name=318:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will tell you what I mean by lawlessness: it consists in this, that a person is unattached.<a name=318:13></a> I know of no better definition.<a name=318:14></a> That is what came to pass in man departing from God.<a name=318:15></a> A bond had subsisted up to a certain point between God and man, and when man broke away from God and did his own will, he became morally unattached.<a name=318:16></a> In a sense, an attachment had come to pass between himself and Satan, but I am speaking for the moment in regard to God.<a name=318:17></a> Man had become unattached, and thus lawless.<a name=318:18></a> Man had broken his bond with God, and what followed in the train of that was hatred and the

		world; It was bound to follow, for when man broke away from God there subsisted no longer any real bond between man and man's neighbour; the principle of hatred came in, and Cain killed his brother Abel.<a name=319:1></a> It was just typical of the way in which the Jew behaved to Christ.<a name=319:2></a> Christ came to the Jew, and the Jew killed Him.<a name=319:3></a> It was the completion of sin; it was morally consequent upon lawlessness.<a name=319:4></a> Adam broke away from God and became unattached; then Cain comes out in another direction: he was unattached too, as lawless as Adam, but his lawlessness works out in another direction, and he kills his brother.<a name=319:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I allude to these things because they are manifestly the two principles of departure: lawlessness and hatred; and these two principles are taken up in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>lawlessness and hatred are met by righteousness and love.<a name=319:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on for a moment to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>.<a name=319:7></a> The psalmist looked up to heaven, as we might, to the material heavens; and there he saw no confusion.<a name=319:8></a> In a world where there is lawlessness and hatred you have confusion; but when the psalmist looked up to heaven, he saw no confusion.<a name=319:9></a> Every planet was moving in its appointed orbit; the sun as a bridegroom coming daily out of his chamber.<a name=319:10></a> Anyone who observes the heavens sees that there is perfect rule there.<a name=319:11></a> Order is the effect of rule, and that is seen in the heavens.<a name=319:12></a> The earth and the moon do not travel out of their appointed orbits, and the heavens declare the glory of God.<a name=319:13></a> Confusion is where there is absence of order: in the heavens there is order, hence there is no confusion.<a name=319:14></a> But when the psalmist looked down to earth, he could not look at man: everything was confusion.<a name=319:15></a> When Balaam looked from above on the children of Israel dwelling in their tents, according to their tribes, he saw no disorder or confusion.<a name=319:16></a> But if Moses had looked inside their tents, he would have seen things very differently.<a name=319:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, after the psalmist has spoken of the heavens, he is obliged to look at the law.<a name=319:18></a> There was no confusion there.<a name=319:19></a> All the principles of moral attachment were to be
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		found in the law, that a man should love God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself.<a name=320:1></a> If the law were made effectual in man, there would be an end of confusion, because man would be brought into attachment with God and with his neighbour.<a name=320:2></a> Instead of confusion there would be order; instead of lawlessness, righteousness; instead of hatred, love.<a name=320:3></a> The psalmist could not see that represented in man; he could only see it represented in the law of Jehovah, and, therefore, he celebrates the law of Jehovah.<a name=320:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I will show you how God has wrought for recovery.<a name=320:5></a> If God sets to work to bring recovery in, He of necessity brings in recovery in contrast with departure, and introduces principles opposed to the principles of departure, so that in recovery the first principles are righteousness and love.<a name=320:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will tell you where I think was the real beginning of recovery: on the day of Pentecost.<a name=320:7></a> What marked the day of Pentecost was this, that God was pleased to bring in points of attachment in regard to man.<a name=320:8></a> The first great point of attachment was Christ, and the second was the christian circle.<a name=320:9></a> The preaching of the gospel has been God's great means of recovery: the light of God has gone out in it to bring recovery about; but there was no preaching of the gospel until God had seen fit to establish points of recovery, and the two great points were, Christ and the christian circle.<a name=320:10></a> Christ existed, like the sun in the heavens, and the christian circle also existed, before ever the gospel went out in the world.<a name=320:11></a> The Holy Spirit had come and established the christian circle here upon earth; and when that was established, the gospel went out into the world.<a name=320:12></a> The power of recovery was there; righteousness and love were there, established in Christ, and in the power of the Spirit.<a name=320:13></a> It is a point of the last moment to see that God was pleased, at the very outset, to establish the great principles of recovery in contrast with the principles of departure.<a name=320:14></a> The principles of lawlessness and hatred were met by bringing in the principles of righteousness and love, in Christ and in the power of the Spirit.<a name=320:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I should like to call attention to the case of the blind man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>.<a name=321:1></a> The eyes of the blind man were opened by the grace of Christ, but the Jews excommunicated him.<a name=321:2></a> Surely that man had never been placed in so trying a situation.<a name=321:3></a> Excommunication was no slight thing: it meant being cast out, so that nobody would have any regard for him at all, and his being cut off from all that in which he had lived until then.<a name=321:4></a> Now the Lord goes after him; He did not lose sight of that man.<a name=321:5></a> He appeals to him, and says, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=321:6></a>" (verse 35).<a name=321:7></a> The man says, "Who is be, Lord, that I might believe on him?<a name=321:8></a>" (verse 36).<a name=321:9></a> And Jesus said unto him, "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is He" (verse 37).<a name=321:10></a> I lay great stress upon that expression.<a name=321:11></a> It conveys to my mind that the Son of God had come within the cognisance of man in such a way that man could see Him, and that He on His part could put Himself into communication with man.<a name=321:12></a> That is what I believe to be the beginning of recovery.<a name=321:13></a> The effect of it on the blind man was that he said, "Lord, I believe, and he worshipped Him".<a name=321:14></a> The blind man had found another world; he had found it in the Son of God.<a name=321:15></a> If I have the Son of God, I have another world.<a name=321:16></a> I am content to be turned out of this world, because I have found another.<a name=321:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first step which God takes to bring man back from lawlessness is in presenting Christ to man as a point of attraction.<a name=321:18></a> You must get attraction before you get attachment.<a name=321:19></a> You could not have attachment without a point of attraction, and God has brought in a point of attraction in Christ, the One in whom the grace of God is presented to man in order to attract man.<a name=321:20></a> That is the first principle of the gospel.<a name=321:21></a> The gospel sets before men the grace of God in a Man to attract men to that Man.<a name=321:22></a> It is not the end of the gospel; what God has in view is to form a bond; but before it can be formed you must get people attracted to Christ by the grace which is presented in Him.<a name=321:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the blind man presents that to us.<a name=321:24></a> He had been
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=322>[Page 322]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		attracted by Christ, at least in a measure; and when the Lord spoke to him in the way He did, he was in principle attached to Him, and in finding Christ he found another world.<a name=322:1></a> The same thing is true in regard to us.<a name=322:2></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>the Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out: and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me" (verse 31).<a name=322:3></a> He virtually says, I am the beginning of another world, the beginning of the creation of God.<a name=322:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These principles are brought out in the beginning of the third chapter of John's first epistle.<a name=322:5></a> We read, He was manifested to take away our sins.<a name=322:6></a> If so, surely Christ has a claim upon us.<a name=322:7></a> But that is not the end: it is the beginning, His having been manifested to take away our sins gives Him legitimately a claim upon every man.<a name=322:8></a> Then we come to another point: "In Him sin is not" (verse 5).<a name=322:9></a> He is the centre and Head of God's universe; in Him is no sin, and God in result intends to have a universe in which there is no sin, the beginning of it is the One in whom is no sin.<a name=322:10></a> We are first attracted to Christ by the grace which is presented to us in Him; but what God has in view is to bring about an attachment to the One in whom is no sin, so that we should abide in Him.<a name=322:11></a> Once that is the case, then we have escaped from lawlessness.<a name=322:12></a> Lawlessness is the contrast to attachment; bring about attachment, and we are delivered from lawlessness.<a name=322:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what comes to pass in the grace of God: Christ is presented to us, we are attracted to Him, then attached to Him by the Spirit of God, and then we are delivered from lawlessness, because God has been pleased to bring about attachment.<a name=322:14></a> That is a great thing to have been effected.<a name=322:15></a> I quite admit that the great point is affection; but you must have attachment before you have affection.<a name=322:16></a> When attachment is brought about by the Spirit of God, affection will follow in the train.<a name=322:17></a> My impression is that the moral order of things is attraction, attachment, and affection.<a name=322:18></a> Attraction is the answer to grace; then the next point is attachment; Christ gives living water to the one who has been attracted to Him;

		<a name=323>[Page 323]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		then when you have attachment, you get affection.<a name=323:1></a> I do not know whether all will agree with me, but I believe that the true affection between a man and his wife really begins when they are married.<a name=323:2></a> I do not say that there is not a sort of affection before; but my impression is that it is when the bond is formed the true affection really springs up.<a name=323:3></a> The bond is the true starting point; the man and his wife come to know each other's worth in a sense in which they never knew it before, and true affection is formed according to the bond in which they are linked together.<a name=323:4></a> Now, I believe that to be the case in regard to Christ and us.<a name=323:5></a> We are married to Christ; we have been first attracted to Him, then attached to Him, then we come under His influence, and it is the influence of Christ which brings out our affection to Him.<a name=323:6></a> If we are married to Him, He makes known to us all His worth, and He draws out in that way our affection to Him.<a name=323:7></a> He makes us conscious of His affection for us, His service and His care for us, and thus turns our affection towards Him.<a name=323:8></a> That is the way in which I should suppose affection really exists between Christ and those who have been attached to Him, and in that way we are delivered from lawlessness.<a name=323:9></a> Christ gave Himself for us, to deliver us from all lawlessness, that we might be attached to Him in the power of the Spirit, so that under the influence of Christ we might bring forth fruit unto God.<a name=323:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two great benefits of being attached to Christ are sunshine and rain.<a name=323:11></a> To take a figure from natural things: the earth derives great benefits from being attached to the sun: it gains sunshine and rain, and thereby becomes fruitful.<a name=323:12></a> If the question were put to me why there is so little fruit for God in saints, I should say it is because they come so little under the sunshine and rain which ought to result from their attachment to Christ.<a name=323:13></a> It is a great thing to be in the brightness of Christ; it is really the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=323:14></a> If you come under the influence of that brightness, you will also get rain.<a name=323:15></a> The sun draws up the moisture from the earth, and it returns to the earth in the form of rain.<a name=323:16></a> Rain is

	<div class="paragraph">
		dependent on the sun, and the same thing is true in spiritual things.<a name=324:1></a> All ministry is dependent upon our sun, and the brightness of our sun is the moral effulgence of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=324:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to have been recovered from lawlessness and brought into attachment, so that we can say we are righteous as Christ is righteous.<a name=324:3></a> Christ is the only point of righteousness, as He is the point of attraction and attachment; there is no righteousness in the universe except Christ.<a name=324:4></a> He is the righteous One, who has accomplished righteousness, in whom we are righteous, as He is righteous.<a name=324:5></a> We stand in relation to Him; we are no longer lawless or unattached; we apprehend Christ as the blessed beginning and centre of God's world, the universe of bliss.<a name=324:6></a> That is the first point of attachment, and it is of the greatest importance to apprehend it, so that we should come very definitely under the influence of our sun, that we might be fruitful.<a name=324:7></a> Then there is another point as to Christ: He has come within the range of man's vision, and He talks to us.<a name=324:8></a> If He could talk to the blind man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>, He can talk to us; He communicates with us, and we can sit at the feet of Jesus and hear His word, like Mary did.<a name=324:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there is another point of attachment, which is equally important, in order that we may escape the world and the hatred in it.<a name=324:10></a> God's work is perfect, and His way is perfect.<a name=324:11></a> When God set to work to bring about recovery for man, He had in view not only to recover man from lawlessness, but from hatred, and, therefore, before the gospel went out into the world God had established the circle of love down here upon earth.<a name=324:12></a> The apostles not only had the testimony of Christ, but there was also the circle of the brethren, and the gospel went out from that circle.<a name=324:13></a> It was a point of attachment, so that those who were attracted to Christ might be brought into it, and escape from the hatred in the world.<a name=324:14></a> If you come under the rule of Christ, you cannot remain in the world, because that does not come under the rule of Christ.<a name=324:15></a> I think the Father holds the world in hand; but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the rule of Christ refers at present to those who believe in Him, in order that they may be fruitful for God; they leave the world for the circle of love.<a name=325:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that is where a great many christians fail: they have come, in a way, under the rule of Christ, but they do not apprehend the christian circle; they are mixed up with the great christian organisations in the world; they have never really escaped from the world and its hatred.<a name=325:2></a> There is no escape from the world except in the christian circle, the circle of love.<a name=325:3></a> God saw fit to establish that circle here, the atmosphere of which was to be the love of Christ.<a name=325:4></a> In every company on earth -- the House of Commons or any other -- there is a sort of moral atmosphere.<a name=325:5></a> So it was with the company formed on the day of Pentecost: its moral atmosphere was the love of Christ.<a name=325:6></a> Souls who were converted were brought into it, and thus delivered from the poisonous influences which existed in the world: and they became conscious that they had passed out of death into life.<a name=325:7></a> They had left an atmosphere full of moral poison, and come into an atmosphere of life and love, the little circle which had its character from the love of Christ, and they were conscious they had passed from death unto life, because they loved the brethren.<a name=325:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it is in that way that the work of God is complete: not only to deliver souls from lawlessness, but from hatred, from everything that came in by departure.<a name=325:9></a> God's work is perfect in contrast with the departure, and, therefore, in the recovery you get the two points of attachment.<a name=325:10></a> The one, of supreme importance, is the Son of God, the beginning of God's creation, the head of every man; He is the first point of attachment, so that you may abide in Him.<a name=325:11></a> You come under His blessed influence, and get sunshine and rain.<a name=325:12></a> The other point is equally important, and that is, that you come into the christian circle, which you find ready prepared.<a name=325:13></a> The Spirit of God brings you into the circle of love, and you become conscious that you have passed out of the poisonous influences of the world into life, because you

		Now, if, through the grace of God, you are brought under the influence of Christ, you abide in Him; and if you find yourself in the christian circle, where the love of Christ prevails, you apprehend that you have come into a scene of moral order; you get the benefit of it in your own soul.<a name=326:5></a> Depend upon it, moral order can only be found in those who are under the rule of Christ, abiding in Him on the one hand and in the christian circle on the other, conscious that they have passed out of death into life, because they love the brethren.<a name=326:6></a> The world is a scene of confusion, full of noxious and poisonous influences.<a name=326:7></a> My heart aches when I think of the things to which the young are exposed in the world, the filthiness and abominations which are paraded before their minds.<a name=326:8></a> But there is an outlet, and the first point is to come under rule.<a name=326:9></a> Rule is a wholesome thing, it brings about order.<a name=326:10></a> It is so important to come under rule, to abide in Christ, the blessed Head and centre and sun of God's universe, and then to enjoy the christian circle, the atmosphere of which is the love of Christ.<a name=326:11></a> How wonderful to think that there should be a circle down here whose atmosphere is the love of Christ!<a name=326:12></a> It is a great thing to come into it and to fulfil our own obligation in it, that is, that we love: we love the brethren.<a name=326:13></a> You could not do that, if you did not first recognise that the brethren were there.<a name=326:14></a> You were brought into that circle; but it existed a long time before you were converted.<a name=326:15></a> It existed at the beginning, before any had been converted by the gospel.<a name=326:16></a> Christ formed it, and the Spirit of God sanctioned and gave character to it.<a name=326:17></a> Those converted by the gospel were brought into abiding in Christ on the one hand, and into the christian circle on the other.<a name=326:18></a>

		I do not touch upon this passage at all in a dispensational way, beloved friends, but entirely in a moral way.<a name=328:1></a> You see, everything has reached a very important point for us, for everything now has come under the survey of Christ.<a name=328:2></a> It makes all the difference in the world; everything, as I say, has come under the survey of Christ and therefore we get new light thrown upon everything and upon every relationship down here.<a name=328:3></a> I think in this passage we get new light thrown upon marriage.<a name=328:4></a> I feel this, we shall get on very well in the absence of lawlessness: lawlessness spoils everything.<a name=328:5></a> It came in at the beginning and spoilt everything morally and things have been spoilt morally ever since.<a name=328:6></a> There has been the coming in of lawlessness which spoilt all, but on the other hand we see the way in which Christ, in which God, has come in to meet it all.<a name=328:7></a> God has brought in a new and blessed centre and He has brought us into moral attachment to that centre so that all our movements begin from Christ and are ordered in relation to Christ.<a name=328:8></a> There is a moment of beginning for each one of us, a moment when we come into attachment to Christ, but being in attachment to Him our movements are from Him: we abide in Him and we sin not: we abide in Him and bring forth fruit to God and we carry out every other relationship according to God.<a name=328:9></a> It is an immense thing to have been delivered from sin and lawlessness, that is what we get from Christ, so that we can take up any and every relationship according to Christ.<a name=328:10></a> That is the only thing that will meet the present condition of things.<a name=328:11></a>

		Now, what I do desire, and it is what we all desire, I am sure, is that our brother and sister should be maintained in the light and grace of the testimony -- that they may abide in Christ, in fidelity to Christ; that is on their side, but the answer to it from Christ is that Christ will abide in them, and we get the power of continuance there.<a name=329:10></a> Our place is to abide in Him, but then He will be to us stay, and support, and power down here.<a name=329:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		well drunk, what is inferior comes before them, they are very speedily put to the test and their happiness does not continue.<a name=330:1></a> The wine which is inferior is the general history of things in the world because in man there is no real power of stay and continuance.<a name=330:2></a> But what we get in Christ is this, "Thou hast kept the good wine till now" -- the real secret of happiness and pleasure is in Christ.<a name=330:3></a> I have long ceased for myself to look for exuberant joy down here; I do not think it is our portion; but there is joy and in spite of all statements to the contrary I would maintain that, but the secret of it lies in having Christ for our stay.<a name=330:4></a> Then on our part we see to it that we maintain fidelity to Christ.<a name=330:5></a> There is many a temptation in the way to seduce us from the path of fidelity to Christ and from the separation that such a path entails, but I do not think that the turning aside from it will tend to happiness or joy, but whatever exercise we may be called upon to pass through, the true joy may be found and will be found in fidelity to Christ and to the testimony of our Lord Jesus.<a name=330:6></a> I would say, Seek to maintain fidelity to Him and to the testimony down here and Christ will be your stay and help: He will give you the good wine, and that good wine, and the power of it, and the stay of it, will be known to your hearts as long as you are down here.<a name=330:7></a> May our brother and sister know this to the full: we cannot do without Christ because, as I said, we are not sufficient for the state of things, but our one power of stay is Christ.<a name=330:8></a> Then on the other hand we get joy by abiding in Christ, it delivers us from lawlessness and He answers us by abiding in us so that we have the power of continuance in the relationships which God has ordained.<a name=330:9></a>
