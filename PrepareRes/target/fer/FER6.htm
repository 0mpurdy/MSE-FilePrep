		I should disclaim all idea of bringing forward anything new, for in one sense there is nothing new to be brought before saints.<a name=1:1></a> Things in Christianity are new only in the sense in which the Lord speaks of a scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven bringing out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=1:2></a> Certain things are characterised as new, for instance, a new song, a new covenant, and the like, and it is well to speak of these things.<a name=1:3></a> In fact they are the things of which we speak -- but this is not inconsistent with giving place to the old things.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going now to speak about new things in that light, not at all in the idea of ministering to a craving after that which is novel.<a name=1:5></a> There is such a spirit much abroad among men and even among Christians, but I want to minister, not to that desire, but of the things of which Christianity speaks, <i>new things</i>.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in two of the passages I have read we have kindred expressions with regard to Christ.<a name=1:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:9">Hebrews  2:9</a> we read, "But we see Jesus .<a name=1:8></a>.<a name=1:9></a>.<a name=1:10></a> crowned with <i>glory and honour</i>".<a name=1:11></a> Evidently the reference of the Spirit of God there is to Christ in His place at the right hand of God.<a name=1:12></a> He is crowned there.<a name=1:13></a> Peter in his second epistle, speaking of what happened on the mount of Transfiguration, says, "For he received from God the Father <i>honour and glory</i>, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=1:14></a> The words employed here are the same as in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:9">Hebrews  2:9</a>.<a name=1:15></a> Peter says He <i>received</i> honour and glory, and in Hebrews it is said He is <i>crowned</i> with glory and honour, and that is at the right hand of God.<a name=1:16></a> He could not be crowned on the holy mount.<a name=1:17></a> Testimony to Him was given

		there, but He could not be crowned, for it was not high enough.<a name=2:1></a> When He goes to the right hand of God, then it is He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what comes out in Peter is full testimony to the present place of Christ.<a name=2:3></a> Peter was an eye-witness of His majesty on the holy mount, and he was a witness, by the Spirit, of the glory He has at the right hand of God.<a name=2:4></a> He speaks of Christ as having suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, and afterwards says, "Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him".<a name=2:5></a> That is equivalent to, "We see Jesus .<a name=2:6></a>.<a name=2:7></a>.<a name=2:8></a> crowned with glory and honour", He has tasted death for everything, and now He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going to trace, with the Lord's help, the steps which have led to the present place of Christ at the right hand of God, and then to bring before you the significance of this in regard to us.<a name=2:10></a> In regard to God it has its significance, but my point now is its significance in regard to us.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things meet in Jesus.<a name=2:12></a> The one, all that is for God, and the other, all that is for man; they meet in one and the same Person.<a name=2:13></a> You cannot understand God's ways if you do not apprehend that.<a name=2:14></a> We see it in the first two chapters of Hebrews.<a name=2:15></a> You can examine the two chapters at your leisure; in the first you will find that everything is for God.<a name=2:16></a> It sets before us the throne, and shews thus the maintenance of what is due to God.<a name=2:17></a> The Son has inherited a more excellent name than angels and everything for God is secured in Him.<a name=2:18></a> He is the effulgence of God's glory, and the exact expression of His substance, and God has appointed Him the Heir of all things.<a name=2:19></a> Everything for God is secured in Christ.<a name=2:20></a> God has established the throne upon the basis of the perfect discrimination of good and evil.<a name=2:21></a> Those are the lines.<a name=2:22></a> In chapter 2 you have everything for man.<a name=2:23></a> To me this order is very

		beautiful, and I would not have it otherwise.<a name=3:1></a> People do not get established if they do not see that everything is secured for God.<a name=3:2></a> That is the first truth in connection with Christ; and then everything has been secured for man.<a name=3:3></a> The expression, "We see Jesus .<a name=3:4></a>.<a name=3:5></a>.<a name=3:6></a> crowned with glory and honour", involves that grace is equivalent to glory.<a name=3:7></a> That principle comes out in Luke's gospel; the greater the exaltation, the higher Christ goes as man, the greater the grace to man; for grace is commensurate with glory.<a name=3:8></a> If we knew more of the glory of the Lord we should know more of the power of grace.<a name=3:9></a> The throne of grace is spoken of later on, where we obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=3:10></a> The principle is that the grace is equal to the glory on account of the Person who is glorified.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am going to note two or three points in the path of the Lord Jesus, which has led up to glory, and will then endeavour to show you the bearing of it in regard to us.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In God's ways of grace in regard of man all began in the birth of Christ, and hence you get the remarkable celebration in connection with His birth.<a name=3:13></a> There was a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men", Evidently that was the point of departure, in God's ways, in regard of man.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step was the baptism of Christ; that indicated that the Lord saw fit to identify Himself with the repentant on earth.<a name=3:15></a> He said, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=3:16></a> He went into the waters of Jordan to mark His separation from what was ungodly on earth; from the course of the world.<a name=3:17></a> He took that place, but, at the same time, it was to identify Himself with the godly of the earth.<a name=3:18></a> It is very much a fulfilment of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, His delight was in the saints, the excellent of the earth.<a name=3:19></a> It was not, morally, a question of Himself at all, but of those with whom He saw fit to identify Himself.<a name=3:20></a> The answer to it was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the heavens were opened to Him.<a name=4:1></a> It indicates to me that you must not connect the Lord with the course of this world.<a name=4:2></a> Christ was here in the world as a man among men, but had no resources in it, and was in interest completely apart from man: He was ever true to the place He took in baptism.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step is the transfiguration, and that was figurative.<a name=4:4></a> Those who were on the mount with Him were permitted to see a vision of the kingdom, and hence what took place there was figurative of what was to take place on high.<a name=4:5></a> The principle of it was, that a man went up from the earth to receive from God the Father honour and glory in the recognition of who He was.<a name=4:6></a> By the fact of His birth and His baptism He identified Himself with man.<a name=4:7></a> He was the Son of man by being born of woman, and He identifies Himself thus with man, and in His baptism He identifies Himself with the godly of the earth; and now, on the mount of Transfiguration, He receives honour and glory and is saluted as God's beloved Son.<a name=4:8></a> He was the Son of man, Son of David, and Son of Abraham, and in going up above He presents Himself on behalf of man to God -- and there He received honour and glory when there came to Him such a voice from the excellent glory, "This is my beloved Son".<a name=4:9></a> There was a vision of the kingdom.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was the third step, but glory could only then be evanescent, redemption not having been accomplished what took place there could not be final.<a name=4:11></a> But the glory saluted Him.<a name=4:12></a> The <i>real</i> fulfilment of glory was when Christ ascended up to the right hand of God.<a name=4:13></a> When on the mount He had not suffered for man, but when He goes to the right hand of God it is as having suffered for man, redemption being accomplished.<a name=4:14></a> He had tasted death for everything, and He goes to the right hand of God on the behalf of man in the value of a work accomplished for man.<a name=4:15></a> It is not simply that He receives honour and glory, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is crowned with it.<a name=5:1></a> He has suffered for sins, as a man on the behalf of men, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit"; and "is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him".<a name=5:2></a> He is "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection from the dead".<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things have come to pass in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=5:4></a> One is that the kingdom in righteousness is secured for God; and the other, that everything is secured on the behalf of man.<a name=5:5></a> If you want to know the measure of grace, you learn it in Jesus crowned with glory and honour.<a name=5:6></a> The closer you come to God, the more conscious you must be of grace.<a name=5:7></a> There is nothing with God to repel, because Christ is crowned with glory and honour as a testimony to man.<a name=5:8></a> Man is invited.<a name=5:9></a> The whole course of the Lord -- His birth, baptism, and the mount of Transfiguration, and His being crowned at the right hand of God -- indicates to us that all that is for man is found there.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything for God and everything for man meet in the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=5:11></a> In one sense you can look at His work as accomplished for God, but even in that light it is spoken of as on account of us.<a name=5:12></a> "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=5:13></a> On the cross the Lord occupied our place: it was a work done for God's glory on man's behalf; He is raised, too, on our behalf, and gone to the right hand of God, and is crowned with glory and honour, as a witness to men of what subsists for man, namely, unlimited grace.<a name=5:14></a> The more we are apart from the course of things here, and the closer we are brought by the Spirit of God to the glory, the more conscious we become of the acceptance and favour in which we stand.<a name=5:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe, in regard of our pathway here, that there is no limit to the grace which is ministered to us.<a name=6:1></a> We cannot always count upon being delivered out of trying circumstances, but we can always count upon the plenitude of grace which will be with us in our circumstances down here.<a name=6:2></a> Christ went to the right hand of God to take up a place for man, and He makes intercession for us there.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak of the effect of this in regard to us, and I will read a few verses at the end of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a> - 18.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing here spoken of is a work done: that comes out in verses 14, 15.<a name=6:5></a> "That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who, through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage".<a name=6:6></a> Verse 15 describes a class which existed here.<a name=6:7></a> When the Lord came there were saints on earth who were subject to bondage through fear of death.<a name=6:8></a> This is hardly intended to describe a class which is here now.<a name=6:9></a> They were in bondage on account of the uncertainty to them of what was beyond death.<a name=6:10></a> They had glimpses of light, but they had no clear revelation of what lay beyond death, and hence they were distracted and terrified by the fear of death.<a name=6:11></a> You get that exercise, up to the time that Christ died, with godly people.<a name=6:12></a> Satan was active in it all, and we find him even coming against the Lord, but the Lord said, "The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me".<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By death Christ brought that to an end, for He came to destroy him, or rather the power of him, who had the power of death.<a name=6:14></a> God had seen fit to let the terrors of death be in the hand of Satan as against man who had listened to Satan, and hence it was that Satan affected man with the terrors of death and judgment; but the point upon which God is now bent is his salvation.<a name=6:15></a> I think that man wants salvation out of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		power of the enemy, and God has wrought to effect this.<a name=7:1></a> You see this in the case of the Israelites.<a name=7:2></a> God was declared in the blood on the lintel and door-posts, and so with us, the blood of Christ is the witness that God's righteousness has been vindicated and declared, and God presents Himself consequently in grace to man.<a name=7:3></a> The announcement of the gospel is the remission of sins, and this is proclaimed that man may be brought into salvation from the enemy.<a name=7:4></a> The salvation of Israel was from their enemies, and from the hand of them that hated them: from the power of the Egyptian.<a name=7:5></a> God was with them all through, but His purpose was that they might be delivered from the hand of their oppressor.<a name=7:6></a> He would bring them out of the land of Egypt that they might serve Him without fear.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has wrought deliverance for us that we might not be in the fear of death.<a name=7:8></a> Our knowledge of God is of the God who raises the dead.<a name=7:9></a> The God we have to do with is the Saviour-God, who raises the dead and calls the things which be not as though they were.<a name=7:10></a> We know Him in that character, and, if we know Him in that way, it is entirely impossible that we can be in the fear of death.<a name=7:11></a> God has raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, "who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification".<a name=7:12></a> We have to say to God, we pray to Him, give thanks to Him, and hope in Him, but it is in the God who raises the dead.<a name=7:13></a> All our acquaintance with God and everything in which we have to say to Him is in that light, and hence saints cannot be in the fear of death.<a name=7:14></a> The only God I know is the One who raised Jesus for us.<a name=7:15></a> And if death has terrors for me, it only proves that I do not know God.<a name=7:16></a> Christ has ended the fear of death.<a name=7:17></a> By death He has destroyed him that had the power of death: that is, the devil, to deliver them who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.<a name=7:18></a> Such a class could hardly exist
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		at the present time.<a name=8:1></a> When that class existed God was not declared in the power of resurrection.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham probably apprehended God in that way when he offered up Isaac.<a name=8:3></a> And all our hopes in connection with God are bound up with God, who acts in resurrection power.<a name=8:4></a> The Lord speaks of that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, "For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them: even so the Son quickeneth whom he will".<a name=8:5></a> The effect of apprehending this is to deliver us from the world and all connected with it.<a name=8:6></a> Many Christians cherish expectations in this life, and make a good deal of a pious life here -- which one would not at all seek to discourage -- but, at the same time, it must be remembered that our relations with God are with the God who raises the dead and calls the things that be not as though they were.<a name=8:7></a> God never intended to communicate to us blessings on this side of death.<a name=8:8></a> He has communicated the Spirit in order that our souls may be occupied with Him on the other side of death.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other point in the passage I last read comes out in the two last verses.<a name=8:10></a> "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people: for in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted".<a name=8:11></a> You must take into account, in regard of this chapter, that it presents Christ as on the part of man; hence it is that in the passage read the qualification of Christ to be Priest is presented.<a name=8:12></a> He takes the place of offering priest before He enters on the high priesthood.<a name=8:13></a> It behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren that He might first become an offering priest.<a name=8:14></a> No one could make atonement under the law or deal with an offering except a priest; and Christ must needs assume the place of offering priest.<a name=8:15></a> Who was to offer Christ except Christ Himself?<a name=8:16></a> And hence,
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		preparatory to His taking the place of High Priest, He is the offering priest.<a name=9:1></a> He makes atonement for the sins of the people as offering priest, but it is at the right hand of God that He is in the place of High Priest.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with God who raises the dead, we are delivered from the fear of death, and in connection with the offering of Christ we get the forgiveness of sins; but it is one thing to believe in forgiveness, and another to have the <i>consciousness</i> of forgiveness.<a name=9:3></a> According to the Apostles' Creed, all believe in the forgiveness of sins, but that is not the consciousness of forgiveness, which lies in the <i>appropriation</i> of Christ.<a name=9:4></a> Many a Christian believes in the forgiveness of sins, but is not conscious of it, because he has not learned to appropriate the Priest.<a name=9:5></a> Such do not know that in Jesus there is not simply everything for God, but everything for man; hence in the appropriation of Christ as Priest you get the gain of all that is connected with the Priest, and it is as offering priest He made atonement for the sins of the people, that we might have the consciousness of forgiveness of sins in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=9:6></a> The office of the Spirit is to lead on the soul to the appropriation of Christ.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same thing is seen in the fifth chapter of John's first epistle.<a name=9:8></a> "This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.<a name=9:9></a> And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth".<a name=9:10></a> When the apostle speaks of the witnesses in regard to us, he puts the Spirit first, because it is in the power of the Spirit of God, in appropriating the one witnessed of, we become conscious of the effect of the water and blood.<a name=9:11></a> Water and blood signify purifying and expiation, and the Spirit makes good in us the consciousness of these, and thus we can have fellowship one with another.<a name=9:12></a> In the light of God, and in Christian fellowship, we have a good conscience by the resurrection of Christ.<a name=9:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A good conscience is really in the Christian circle, into which baptism brings us, and is in the consciousness of forgiveness of sins, which lies, as I said before, in the appropriation of Christ on our side.<a name=10:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I could not do you a greater service than to impress upon you how completely Christ is on our side, and as such has gone to the right hand of God, where He is owned on God's side as His beloved Son.<a name=10:2></a> Now we have the kingdom, and in connection with it the offering priest, who, having effected everything for us here, has gone into heaven to take up the place of High Priest on behalf of His people.<a name=10:3></a> His qualification is seen in verse 18, "For in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted".<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I judge that succouring the tempted may be accomplished by Christ directly or indirectly.<a name=10:5></a> We see the Lord acting directly once and again in the case of Paul.<a name=10:6></a> The apostle got succour directly from Christ.<a name=10:7></a> There were circumstances in which he was placed and in which he might be distressed, but he experienced succour from Christ.<a name=10:8></a> He came into difficulties in his path, partly by the conduct of others, and partly by zeal on his own part, and then the Lord appears to him, He comes in to succour His servant.<a name=10:9></a> That was the interference of the Lord, directly communicating succour to His servant when he was tempted.<a name=10:10></a> Every one is in great danger when in a false position, like Peter in the high priest's palace.<a name=10:11></a> We sometimes, by zeal, or it may be by carelessness, get into a false position and are exposed to temptation, and then the Lord can come in to succour.<a name=10:12></a> I sometimes feel myself using the language of the Lord's prayer, "Lead us not into temptation", for I desire to be kept out of circumstances for which I have not faith; I would be extremely likely to fail, but, at the same time, there is the succour of Christ.<a name=10:13></a> It is that I might be recovered, that my faith may not fail.<a name=10:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		The end of priesthood is that we might hold fast our profession.<a name=11:1></a> It is that we may not fail, but if we have failed that we may be recovered.<a name=11:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christ can also succour through His people.<a name=11:3></a> If He is at the right hand of God, the hearts of all His people are at His command, and it is possible for Him to succour His people indirectly.<a name=11:4></a> Just as He can wash the feet of His people mediately so can He succour them.<a name=11:5></a> If we drink deeply into the Spirit of Christ, then we are qualified to sympathise with God's people and to help them in circumstances of temptation to which they may be exposed in some way or other upon earth.<a name=11:6></a> We should be desirous of occupying the priestly place here in regard to one another.<a name=11:7></a> Christ has the hearts of His own under control, and sets them in motion one towards another, and if we were near enough to the heart of Christ we would be used of Him to help one another.<a name=11:8></a> He is the great High Priest.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very blessed to think that, in Christ crowned with glory and honour, everything is secured for God in the Man who is gone up to the right hand of God on the behalf of man.<a name=11:10></a> The Son of man is the Man taken from among men, gone up to heaven, having accomplished redemption on man's behalf and the consequence of this is that He is the pledge of the complete overthrow of everything that is contrary to and opposes man.<a name=11:11></a> He is declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, on the principle of the mount of Transfiguration where He received from God the Father honour and glory.<a name=11:12></a>

		Now these things exist and are connected with the world to come.<a name=11:13></a> Do not get into the erroneous notion that the world to come is something future.<a name=11:14></a> It is not yet manifested, but that in no way proves that it does not exist.<a name=11:15></a> In Jesus crowned with glory and honour everything is secured for God and for man we know God who has acted in the power of resurrection, and have the consciousness of forgiveness of sins in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of all moment to see the purpose of the grace of God.<a name=12:2></a> The remission of sins is His glad tidings to man, God proclaims this in order that man may be delivered from the bondage of this world to serve God.<a name=12:3></a> That is God's purpose in the gospel.<a name=12:4></a> This leads on to the truth of the church.<a name=12:5></a> If God sets His people free to serve Him they must serve Him according to the appointed order.<a name=12:6></a>

		On the last occasion I was trying to point out the way in which believers are connected from the outset with the God of resurrection, that is, with God who acts in that power.<a name=13:1></a> It is evident that God could not act in that way until death had come in; but from Abraham onwards faith apprehends "God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=13:2></a> The link is formed thus as between God and man, and it is with God in that aspect that we have to do.<a name=13:3></a> We are greatly affected by links that are formed.<a name=13:4></a> That is true in natural things, but we are more affected by spiritual links than by natural links and ties.<a name=13:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point that came before us was that in the first two chapters of Hebrews we have presented, in Christ, both that which is for God and that which is for man.<a name=13:6></a> As to the latter it says in chapter 2, "We see Jesus .<a name=13:7></a>.<a name=13:8></a>.<a name=13:9></a> crowned with glory and honour"; that is on man's behalf.<a name=13:10></a> The Son of man has gone up, and that is the reception which He has met with at the right hand of God; just as He received on the mount of Transfiguration honour and glory; but it is a man going up on the behalf of men, having tasted death for everything, and He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=13:11></a> That comes out in chapter 2, where we have, "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=13:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to the thought of the link which has been formed between saints and Christ in resurrection.<a name=13:13></a> It is one thing to see Jesus crowned with glory and honour, but another to understand the link that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=14>[Page 14]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connects us with Him.<a name=14:1></a> I am sure that the apprehension of it must have a great effect upon us down here.<a name=14:2></a> I believe it to be so important, because the link being with Christ raised again from the dead, there is brought in the power of life.<a name=14:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All spiritual vitality has its spring the other side of death.<a name=14:4></a> Christ is the true source of it: we abide in Him, and His words abide in us, and then we get the evidence of vitality, which is fruit-bearing.<a name=14:5></a> In the first part of our chapter we have fruit-bearing, and in the latter part, testimony in connection with the Holy Spirit.<a name=14:6></a> Fruit-bearing and witness, I may say, are not exactly the same thing.<a name=14:7></a> Fruit is spontaneous and the evidence of healthy vitality.<a name=14:8></a> This is the case in a healthy tree.<a name=14:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not think that the bearing of resurrection is always understood, though the fact may be accepted.<a name=14:10></a> There is scarcely any truth presented to us in Scripture which has not been neutralised in its application in Christendom.<a name=14:11></a> You get the terms of truth maintained, but the bearing of truth has been falsified in the use of it.<a name=14:12></a> Events have been taken up as in connection with this world and commemorated in that way.<a name=14:13></a> Christ's birth is commemorated on one day and His death on another, and even His resurrection; and we have been brought up in this, and what we have learned traditionally is extremely likely to remain with us.<a name=14:14></a> Christ's birth and His death were events in this world, but resurrection cannot have that character.<a name=14:15></a> God never intended that it should.<a name=14:16></a> It is the beginning of a new order of things.<a name=14:17></a> Resurrection really means the introduction of another world, because it introduces another Man.<a name=14:18></a> There has been one world, and that world depended upon a man.<a name=14:19></a> I am not now speaking of the material world, but of the world in the moral sense.<a name=14:20></a> The existing world has been built up on one man departed from God.<a name=14:21></a> You never get a right idea of the world if you do not understand that.<a name=14:22></a> The

		expression 'world' is used in the writings of John for the people in it.<a name=15:1></a> But also indeed in a moral sense, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world.<a name=15:2></a> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof".<a name=15:3></a> Still John frequently uses the world for the people in it, and the world, as we know it, was built up on man departed from God.<a name=15:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But resurrection brings in another Man.<a name=15:5></a> "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.<a name=15:6></a> For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".<a name=15:7></a> The terms of the gospel, as stated in Scripture, are that "Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures".<a name=15:8></a> "Buried" is the end of a man so far as the world is concerned, no more is known of a person after he is buried.<a name=15:9></a> Christ died vicariously, and in the fact of His dying and being buried there was an end of that order of man.<a name=15:10></a> The passage goes on to say, "He rose again the third day, according to the scriptures"; but that brings in another order of man.<a name=15:11></a> The first man was the natural one, but the second Man is the spiritual one.<a name=15:12></a> The resurrection has brought to light the spiritual, and is by a man.<a name=15:13></a> "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead".<a name=15:14></a> The present world, as we know it, is built up on one man, and so also the world to come.<a name=15:15></a> You can see the world to come because you see the Man on whom it is built up.<a name=15:16></a> Until Christ was raised, the world to come was future but it is no longer future, because the Man is there upon whom it depends.<a name=15:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you can see how erroneous it is to connect the resurrection of Christ with this world.<a name=15:18></a> Resurrection is the platform for God.<a name=15:19></a> "God, who quickeneth the dead", is true in principle from the time that man fell.<a name=15:20></a> Abel's link with God, and Enoch's and Noah's,

		was with the God of resurrection.<a name=16:1></a> Abel came to God through a sacrifice which really involved resurrection, Enoch was translated, and in Noah you get the figure of death and resurrection.<a name=16:2></a> The same is seen with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<a name=16:3></a> Abraham is spoken of as having "believed even God, who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were".<a name=16:4></a> Christians "believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead".<a name=16:5></a> You have in Him the foundation, and on that foundation the world to come is built up.<a name=16:6></a> God has formed the link that connects Christians with Himself in the power of resurrection, and the effect is that death has lost its power.<a name=16:7></a> As you advance in life, death comes closer to you, but you find that the power of death is gone if you are conscious of being linked with the God of resurrection.<a name=16:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most confirmatory to faith to see that this has been the principle throughout the whole world's history from the time that sin came in.<a name=16:9></a> It came out before the flood, and more distinctly in those to whom the promises were confided.<a name=16:10></a> I feel intimately bound up with the Old Testament worthies, Abraham, Isaac, and David, men whose souls had faith in the God who quickens the dead.<a name=16:11></a> David learned that God would not establish his throne in his seed after the flesh.<a name=16:12></a> The true seed, according to God, was Christ, and David learned this, though it may have been obscurely.<a name=16:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My point now is to shew the link which <i>we</i> have with <i>Christ</i> in resurrection.<a name=16:14></a> The thought of being connected with the God of resurrection delivers the soul from the fear of death, but the point is our link with Christ.<a name=16:15></a> If a man marries a wife he forms a new tie, and that man is greatly affected by the <i>tie</i> he has formed; and if our souls are linked with Christ, the effect is that the power of resurrection is brought in and thus we are delivered from the fear of death.<a name=16:16></a> And being now linked with Christ the result is that we bring forth fruit; we give evidence of vitality.<a name=16:17></a> The

		apostle Paul in his second epistle to Timothy, when counterfeits and imitations were coming in, insists that the only answer to these was in vitality.<a name=17:1></a> Imitations could only be effectually answered by the real thing.<a name=17:2></a> There was a divine basis in Timothy himself.<a name=17:3></a> He had been instructed in divine things by the apostle, and from a child had known the holy scriptures; and the way in which he was to meet the imitations, was by the evidence of life.<a name=17:4></a> All spiritual vitality has its source the other side of death.<a name=17:5></a> To shew that, I will read a passage or two, first in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:4">Romans  7:4</a>, "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God .<a name=17:6></a>.<a name=17:7></a>.<a name=17:8></a> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held: that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter".<a name=17:9></a> Again in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:17">1 Corinthians  6:17</a>, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit".<a name=17:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in 1 Corinthians brings before us the truth that the link with Christ exists, not in the outward but in the inward.<a name=17:11></a> In a certain sense, when Christ was here, He was, as a Man, in association with the outward; but now, it is, "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit", and if the link is in spirit, manifestly it is in the inward.<a name=17:12></a> When you realise that you are joined to the Lord, there is unity of spirit apart from flesh.<a name=17:13></a> That is where the link subsists in which we are bound to Christ.<a name=17:14></a> The figure of marriage is employed, but we have to realise union in spirit in the inward apart from the outward.<a name=17:15></a> But few of us have learned to withdraw from the outward and retire into the inward.<a name=17:16></a> Scripture speaks of the inward and outward man, hence there must be such a thing as retiring from the outward into the inward.<a name=17:17></a> The idea of a sort of connection with Christ after the flesh has come into the professing church, but Scripture teaches

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read the passage in Romans for the purpose of shewing the object for which the link has been formed; we have been delivered from one order of things, in which possibly we were bound, in order that we might be married to another, or joined to another: to Him that is raised up from the dead, with the object of bringing forth fruit unto God, and that we might serve not in the oldness of the letter but in newness of spirit.<a name=18:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God has made Himself known to us in grace.<a name=18:3></a> The kingdom has come in that we are delivered from the power of evil.<a name=18:4></a> Grace has brought man salvation from the power of the enemy that we should serve God.<a name=18:5></a> God has not intended to set us free for our own wills, but that we might serve Him.<a name=18:6></a> The principle of this we find in Israel.<a name=18:7></a> Jehovah charged Pharaoh to let His people go that they might serve Him; and so, too, in regard of Christians.<a name=18:8></a> The purpose of God in bringing salvation to us is that we might serve Him in bringing forth fruit: but that really comes from Him who is raised up from the dead.<a name=18:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot conceive anything more important than to enter into the reality of the link which binds us to Christ.<a name=18:10></a> If there is that in us which is of service to God, in the way of fruit bearing, it lies in the apprehension in the soul of that link.<a name=18:11></a> We have to meet imitations today, and that can only be by the production of reality.<a name=18:12></a> We must give incontestable evidence of vitality; and the secret of that is in the knowledge of the link that connects us with Christ who is raised from the dead.<a name=18:13></a>

		Now to turn to our chapter, the first six verses prove that you cannot have any link with Christ after the flesh.<a name=19:7></a> He was the vine when He was here on earth, and there were the branches, but that state of things cannot exist now.<a name=19:8></a> You can no longer speak of Christ being the vine.<a name=19:9></a> Israel had had that place previously, and Christ took that place when He was here; but He has it no longer, and all that there is connected with earth now is the spurious vine.<a name=19:10></a> The Revelation shows us the spurious vine, and God dealing in judgment with <i>it</i>: there is no true vine upon earth at the present time.<a name=19:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 7 the idea of the vine is dropped.<a name=19:12></a> It says, "If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<a name=19:13></a> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit: so shall ye be my disciples".<a name=19:14></a> Now mark the succeeding verses, 9 - 12, "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love .<a name=19:15></a>.<a name=19:16></a>.<a name=19:17></a> This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you".<a name=19:18></a> The first principle of the link is, "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you".<a name=19:19></a> Do you believe that that is as applicable to us as it was to the disciples to whom the Lord said it?<a name=19:20></a> They were

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every one should accept the truth of the verse, "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you".<a name=20:4></a> You will never enter into the power of the link that binds you to Christ if you do not understand that the love begins with Christ.<a name=20:5></a> You will never understand that you are married to Christ if you do not see that the beginning is, "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you".<a name=20:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the following verses, we get the transmission of the love: the continuation of its character in the disciples.<a name=20:7></a> We come to Christ's commandments.<a name=20:8></a> But one might ask, what are the commandments?<a name=20:9></a> To Christ every expression of the Father's will was a commandment.<a name=20:10></a> Everything that He heard from the Father.<a name=20:11></a> All the commands are included within one circle, and that is the Father's.<a name=20:12></a> The Father will in result pervade and include and cover everything.<a name=20:13></a> Every family in heaven and on earth is named of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=20:14></a> Christ makes known to us in detail the Father's will, and everything in that sense is a command; and if we keep His commandments we continue in His love.<a name=20:15></a> The purpose of all was to separate His people from the world, and to bring them within the limits of the Father and of the Father's will.<a name=20:16></a> To confirm that, read verses 14 - 16, "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you .<a name=20:17></a>.<a name=20:18></a>.<a name=20:19></a> Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you".<a name=20:20></a> The ground that the Lord takes here is that

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the economy of grace everything is viewed as proceeding from the Father.<a name=21:5></a> Christ came from the Father, and the Spirit proceeded from the Father; the kingdom is the Father's, and eventually the Son, who holds it mediatorially, delivers up the kingdom, that God may be all in all; everything will be pervaded by divine love.<a name=21:6></a> The name of Father presents to us God revealed in love.<a name=21:7></a> The world is presented in the strongest contrast to the Father in John's first epistle.<a name=21:8></a> It says, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world".<a name=21:9></a> Hence one can see that it is a matter of the last importance for us to distinguish between the system of the world and that which is of the Father.<a name=21:10></a> The world is filled with lust and pride, while the system of the Father is pervaded by divine love.<a name=21:11></a>

		In connection with the thought of fruit-bearing, what was before my mind on the last occasion was that we might understand how that God has been pleased to connect us with what is on the resurrection side of death.<a name=24:1></a> We are individually, on this side of death, though risen together with Christ in connection with Christ and the assembly.<a name=24:2></a> But as a matter of fact, we are this side of death and expect to be quickened, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".<a name=24:3></a> At the same time, it is very important that we should apprehend the link which God has already formed to connect us with Christ on the other side of death.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The source of vitality to us is the other side of death.<a name=24:5></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, "Ye are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another" -- mark the next clause -- "to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God".<a name=24:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the same thing comes out in the chapter from which I have read, namely, <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>.<a name=24:7></a> Fruit-bearing is spontaneous, the evident effect of vitality, and the source of this is the other side of death.<a name=24:8></a> The apostle says, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=24:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to proceed now on the same lines, and the point to which I come is <i>witness</i>, which is a little in advance of fruit-bearing; and, in connection with witness, I want to shew the power for it, and that, I need scarcely say, brings in the thought of the Holy Spirit.<a name=24:10></a> The Lord takes that up at the close of the chapter.<a name=24:11></a> The chapter in the main is occupied with

		fruit-bearing, but, at the close, Christ speaks of sending the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, and He should bear witness.<a name=25:1></a> The apostles also were to bear witness, because they had been with the Lord from the beginning, or outset, of His ministry.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The witness of the Holy Spirit came out in a very marked way in Stephen.<a name=25:3></a> It came out also in Philip and others, but hardly perhaps in such a distinct way as in Stephen.<a name=25:4></a> He was a witness to Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=25:5></a> So far as we know Stephen had not been in the company of Christ upon earth, nor was he a witness of the resurrection; but he was a witness in the power of the Holy Spirit, he was full of the Holy Spirit; and the effect of that we are permitted to see.<a name=25:6></a> Stephen became a martyr, he had to suffer for his witness.<a name=25:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my first point is, that the Holy Spirit has come down here to witness.<a name=25:8></a> He has not come to establish anything upon earth, that is not the idea of the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=25:9></a> It is true that Jew and Gentile are builded together for a habitation of God by the Spirit, but that is not the establishment of anything upon earth.<a name=25:10></a> The object of the Holy Spirit is to establish the kingdom of God in the hearts of saints.<a name=25:11></a> The kingdom has come in the way of mystery, that is, not publicly, but at the same time, true in the hearts of believers.<a name=25:12></a> "The kingdom of God is .<a name=25:13></a>.<a name=25:14></a>.<a name=25:15></a> righteousness, and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit", and from the fact of the Spirit having come, to make good the kingdom, you get the house of God, Jew and Gentile built together for a habitation of God.<a name=25:16></a> The house is in a sense dependent on the kingdom, for it is evident that if God comes in in grace, the first thing He must do is to establish His sway over the heart of man; and that must be in grace.<a name=25:17></a> Judgment would assert and vindicate the rights of God, but grace establishes the sway of God in the heart of man.<a name=25:18></a> At the same time, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit of God has come to connect the hearts of believers with what is in heaven, and not only that, but to form them for it.<a name=26:1></a> You get the idea of this in the renewing of the Holy Spirit.<a name=26:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see the work of the Spirit exemplified in Stephen.<a name=26:3></a> He looked up to heaven and saw what was there, and bore witness of what he saw.<a name=26:4></a> He saw the heavens opened, first of all, and the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and he was sustained in power down here.<a name=26:5></a> He was qualified in the power of the Holy Spirit for a witness, and testified to what he saw in heaven.<a name=26:6></a> The Holy Spirit gave him not only the light of heaven, but the consciousness of what is there; and to that he bore witness, and that is the true witness of the Spirit of God.<a name=26:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Evidently the witness of the Spirit of God must be to what is in heaven.<a name=26:8></a> He has come down from heaven -- not as the Lord did, in incarnation -- and has brought from heaven the report of the glory there.<a name=26:9></a> The Spirit has not formed any links upon earth; Christ did, of necessity, in becoming man.<a name=26:10></a> Scripture speaks of Him as Son of Abraham, Son of David, and Son of Mary; but the Spirit reports that which is in heaven, the glory of God and Jesus at the right hand of God.<a name=26:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to dwell upon now is how <i>we</i> are formed for witness.<a name=26:12></a> I do not think a man is a real witness of anything which he simply believes.<a name=26:13></a> I may be able to speak of a thing and report it as fully believing it; but if I am to be a witness of it, according to the divine thought, I must be in the <i>consciousness</i> of the thing of which I am witness.<a name=26:14></a> I may have heard of some wonderful thing having taken place in some other part of the world, and fully believe it, and be able to report what I have heard, but I am not a witness of it, though I have the faith of it.<a name=26:15></a> If I have <i>seen</i> the thing then I am qualified to be a witness, because I have the <i>consciousness</i> of the thing of which I witness.<a name=26:16></a>

		Faith is divine light in the heart of man, and a man cannot please God without it; but the peculiar spirit and power of Christianity is not faith but consciousness.<a name=27:1></a> In Old Testament times, saints had the faith of things, promises and the like, but they could not have the consciousness of the promises, because the time had not come for their fulfilment; but that is not Christianity.<a name=27:2></a> We begin with faith.<a name=27:3></a> We believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, but, in the Holy Spirit, God has come in to give us the consciousness of the things that we believe.<a name=27:4></a> It is not only that we have heard a credible report, and can transmit it to others, but we are qualified to be witnesses of the things of which we have the consciousness, as was the case with Stephen.<a name=27:5></a> The glory of Christ has changed everything in regard to us.<a name=27:6></a> It has inaugurated a new order of things.<a name=27:7></a> The power of God in resurrection has brought to light a new Man, and consequently a new world connected with the new Man: and all God's ways, new covenant, reconciliation and so on, are connected with this new world, the centre of which is Christ, and that is very important for us to take into account.<a name=27:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been fully glorified, in regard of righteousness, in the death of Christ, and that has left room for the power of God to operate; and the result is that He has brought into view a Man whose origin was heaven.<a name=27:9></a> Resurrection really brought fully to light the heavenly Man, and the world to come is founded on Jesus, crowned with glory and honour; and hence it is that the Holy Spirit has come down to report the glory of God and Jesus at His right hand.<a name=27:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will say a word, in connection with the verses in Ephesians, as to how we are formed for witness.<a name=27:11></a> The text is, "Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom

		There are three things in the passage, (1) the hope of God's calling, (2) God's inheritance, and (3) the exceeding greatness of God's power; and the point is, that you should be conscious of these things; and the way in which you are to get at this is by the knowledge of the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.<a name=28:4></a> Evidently that must be by the Holy Spirit.<a name=28:5></a> The first beginning of all real knowledge of God is by the Holy Spirit.<a name=28:6></a> You have no real knowledge of God Himself until you love.<a name=28:7></a> "Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<a name=28:8></a> He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love".<a name=28:9></a> Apart from love, there is no real knowledge of God.<a name=28:10></a> The Holy Spirit has come in order that we may <i>know God</i>, not that we may know something about Him, but know Himself.<a name=28:11></a> You may hear a great deal about Him, but it is a different thing to know Him.<a name=28:12></a> I may hear a good deal about a man, but it is a different thing when I come to know the man himself.<a name=28:13></a> So with God; and you do not really know God if you do not love.<a name=28:14></a>

		The spirit of wisdom and revelation is that we may understand.<a name=29:10></a> What I apprehend to be "wisdom" is "resource" and "revelation" means "unfolding".<a name=29:11></a> You get the spirit of resource and unfolding in divine things, and the end is that you may be conscious of the hope of His calling, of His inheritance and of His power.<a name=29:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next part of Stephen's witness is, that he saw the glory of God and Jesus.<a name=31:9></a> What I understand by the "glory of God", is God's moral effulgence, that is, all His attributes effulgent, and, at the same time, perfectly in harmony with His nature, and that in regard of man.<a name=31:10></a> God has taken His own way to glorify Himself, and He is glorified, not in man, but in the Son of man.<a name=31:11></a> The Son of man is put in distinction from man, and in the Son of man God's glory is shining out.<a name=31:12></a> The One in whose face the glory of God is set forth is the One who is the centre and gathering-point for man.<a name=31:13></a> You must put these two things together.<a name=31:14></a> Nothing of God has failed.<a name=31:15></a> All is conciliated, and displayed in the One who is in heaven.<a name=31:16></a>

		There is another thing about Stephen; you find in him the evidence of power.<a name=31:17></a> He is prepared to face the bitter consequences of his testimony, and is sustained by divine power.<a name=31:18></a> His spirit is superior to all through which he had to pass.<a name=31:19></a> He was conscious of the power that was toward him, and he knew very well that that power would land him in the heavens which were open to him.<a name=31:20></a>

		I think that all would admit that it is a matter of profound importance to enter into the great consequences of the coming of the Spirit.<a name=34:1></a> In Christendom, generally, the truth which has been let slip is the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=34:2></a> It is not that the Person of the Holy Spirit is denied, but His presence is not apprehended.<a name=34:3></a> When I began to know anything at all about the truth of things, I could see that there were comparatively few Christians who apprehended the presence of the Holy Spirit; and, when realised, it had a most profound effect upon one's course here.<a name=34:4></a>

		If the mass of those around take no account of the presence of the Holy Spirit I think I can understand the reason of it.<a name=34:5></a> The tendency of modern times has been to adapt Christianity to the course of the world.<a name=34:6></a> This came in even in the time of the apostles.<a name=34:7></a> It is clear that it was that into which the Corinthians and Galatians were nigh falling, and from which the apostle sought to deliver them.<a name=34:8></a>

		The presence of the Spirit does not exactly test the world.<a name=36:8></a> The world has been fully tested by the presence of Christ in it.<a name=36:9></a> He was in it, and was the great test which God saw fit to apply to the world.<a name=36:10></a> When the Spirit came the world had been tested, and the Spirit came to bring the demonstration of the result of that testing; we are entitled now to have an apprehension of the great world system as it is in the eye of God.<a name=36:11></a>

		In John's first epistle the apostle takes this up and says, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one".<a name=36:12></a> The Lord probably refers to the wicked one in saying, "Of judgment because the prince of this world is judged".<a name=36:13></a> A difference between the gospel and the epistle of John is this: In the gospel the apostle speaks of faith, but in the epistle of the consciousness of faith, and hence it is he says, "We <i>know</i> that we are of God".<a name=36:14></a> He does not say, "We believe that we are of God", but we are <i>conscious</i> that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one.<a name=36:15></a> The Lord bears witness to that in the gospel.<a name=36:16></a> The prince of this world was judged.<a name=36:17></a> Christ had been the test.<a name=36:18></a>

		Christ was the test, and the test proved fatal.<a name=37:6></a> It discovered the self-will of man.<a name=37:7></a> Man was blinded by his self-will, and did not apprehend the witness which Christ brought.<a name=37:8></a> There was no lack of witness both in word and in work, but man's foolish self-will blinded him in regard of every evidence that Christ gave.<a name=37:9></a> "Many good works have I shewed you from my Father: for which of those works do ye stone me?<a name=37:10></a>" Man was so blind that he would stone the One who bore witness, and, therefore, the Spirit brings demonstration of sin, "because they believe not on me".<a name=37:11></a> They would not have been guilty in the same way if the evidence had not been there, but when Christ came the world was left without excuse.<a name=37:12></a>

		I do not doubt at all that the result would be the same today if it were possible for Christ to come again in humiliation; man would shew that he is blinded by his own perverse will in spite of the evidence that the Lord might give.<a name=37:13></a> "If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father".<a name=37:14></a> People were astonished at the works that Christ did, but they became accustomed to the mighty works, and self-will came in, and they did not believe in Him.<a name=37:15></a>

		But there is another thing, the prince of this world is judged, and that shews us the position of the world.<a name=38:4></a> The world has been tested by the presence of Christ, and found wanting.<a name=38:5></a> There is no more testing for the world, but the Spirit brings demonstration that all has been brought to an issue by the presence of Christ.<a name=38:6></a> It is God's purpose to deliver us from this present evil world.<a name=38:7></a> "Our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father".<a name=38:8></a> You do not find prophets talking about the deliverance of people from this present evil world, but in the New Testament you find that Christ died to that end.<a name=38:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that in what the servant said here we have a foreshadowing of the present moment.<a name=39:8></a> You get in John the remarkable statement, "All things that the Father hath are mine"; and the servant said, Jehovah has greatly blessed my master, and to his son hath he given all.<a name=39:9></a> That son was Isaac.<a name=39:10></a> Isaac was born outside of the power of nature, and all was given to Isaac.<a name=39:11></a> You can readily see that these two passages are very much akin.<a name=39:12></a> The Lord says of the Spirit, "He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you".<a name=39:13></a> That indicates to me the unchanging interest that Christ had in the disciples.<a name=39:14></a> I think, too, that all was bound up with the ways of God, for, in a sense, everything is looked at as coming from the Father.<a name=39:15></a> The Father is put in contrast to the world, and is presented as the source of everything which is for eternal blessing.<a name=39:16></a> The Son is regarded as the only-begotten coming forth from the Father: the Spirit proceeds from the Father: and the saints are given of the Father to Christ.<a name=39:17></a> The Lord Jesus Himself says, "Thine they were and thou gavest them me".<a name=39:18></a> In purpose they were the Father's, but the Father gives them to Christ: and

		They were the Father's, but given to Christ in order that He might conduct them to the Father.<a name=40:7></a> The world and the Father are put in contrast, the world system has been tested and is convicted; all its character is demonstrated by the Spirit, but in the Father we have the source of another system.<a name=40:8></a> Not simply is God revealed in love in the Father, but the One who is the Son and Heir of all that the Father hath, is presented.<a name=40:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point in the system of truth is the revelation of God.<a name=40:10></a> Everything which has come to pass is in the full light of God.<a name=40:11></a> When God created man, he was not in the full light of God, because the heart of God was not yet revealed.<a name=40:12></a> God created man perfect and set him in the presence of divine goodness, but he could not know the love of God till God revealed Himself.<a name=40:13></a> When man was created the moment had not come for God to reveal Himself.<a name=40:14></a> The revelation of God was, in a sense, gradual, for though in the Old Testament we get divine light coming in as to the character and attributes of God, we could not speak of the full revelation of God until the death of Christ.<a name=40:15></a> It was at the death of Christ that the veil of the temple was rent in twain, and then it was that God was revealed.<a name=40:16></a> Christ came here to reveal God.<a name=40:17></a> "The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=40:18></a> Eternal blessing is in the full light of divine love and glory.<a name=40:19></a> God is in the light; that is the principle to be apprehended.<a name=40:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point is that all is centred in the Son, "All things that the Father hath are mine".<a name=40:21></a> The Lord ever looks to the Father as being the source of everything.<a name=40:22></a> Every family is of the Father.<a name=40:23></a> Paul speaks of this in Ephesians, "Of whom every family in the heavens

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great issue of God's ways is, that God is to be all in all, and that is consequent upon Christ having become Man, and giving His own character to every family which is under Him.<a name=41:9></a> He could say, "All things that the Father hath are mine".<a name=41:10></a> The effect of that was to interest the hearts of the disciples in Christ.<a name=41:11></a> The Holy Spirit would come and make known to them all the counsels of the Father, and the place which Christ had taken in reference to these counsels.<a name=41:12></a> All was to the end that the hearts of the disciples might find their centre of interest in the Son.<a name=41:13></a> The Holy Spirit would make known to them the whole system of truth, and the life of their souls was to be in the truth.<a name=41:14></a> Christ was the Son of God, and was the centre for them, and He counts upon their being taken up with His things, by the Holy Spirit, according to the Father's counsels.<a name=41:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The announcement of the Holy Spirit has been made.<a name=41:16></a> God has made known the detail of His will which He hath purposed in Himself for the dispensation of the fulness of times, to gather together in One all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and on earth.<a name=41:17></a> God has given us an insight even into that which is to mark eternity.<a name=41:18></a> We have the light of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to say a word upon the practical effect of this.<a name=42:4></a> The Spirit of God, the Comforter, has come to give us the announcement.<a name=42:5></a> All is made known, but you do not enter into the understanding of it but by the Spirit.<a name=42:6></a> The natural mind of man cannot touch these things.<a name=42:7></a> It is not in the competency of man to take up these things at all.<a name=42:8></a> He could not understand them, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him".<a name=42:9></a> We get the power to understand these things in the Holy Spirit.<a name=42:10></a> "The spiritual discerns all things; and he is discerned of no one".<a name=42:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might venture to ask the question, What is the life in which you are practically living?<a name=42:12></a> I can understand a person living in the life of the world; but, on the other hand, I can understand a saint living in the life of Christ.<a name=42:13></a> You have to put two things in contrast.<a name=42:14></a> For instance, Moses proposed to Israel life or death, blessing or cursing.<a name=42:15></a> He urged Israel to choose life and not death.<a name=42:16></a> My own thought has been to leave the life of the world in order to live in the life of Christ.<a name=42:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What marks the life of the world, to begin with, is sin and the shadow of death.<a name=42:18></a> I think if you have any experience of it you will admit that the will of man and pride, covetousness, ambition, and self-seeking, all that kind of thing, go to make up largely the life of the world.<a name=42:19></a> Politics form a great part of the life of the world.<a name=42:20></a> The principles which lie at the bottom of all are expediency and covetousness.<a name=42:21></a> Many people in the world have strong natural force of character, which God has been pleased to allow in man; there are in

	<div class="paragraph">
		man, too, evidences of God's handiwork; but all that does not alter the world morally: it is still the sphere of covetousness and largely governed by expediency.<a name=43:1></a> Inventions would have but a poor chance of success if it were not that they promote moneymaking.<a name=43:2></a> Covetousness gives an impetus to inventive power.<a name=43:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while we have the life of the world on the one hand, we have the life of Christ on the other.<a name=43:4></a> And I touch on only two points in connection with it: love and holiness.<a name=43:5></a> These are the two great marks of the life of Christ.<a name=43:6></a> The life of Christ is morally divine, and must be so from the fact of who Christ is.<a name=43:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is this principle in love, it works in every direction.<a name=43:8></a> There is love to God, love to Christ, love to the saints, and love to one's neighbour.<a name=43:9></a> In that way it fulfils the law, for "love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore is the whole law"; and love is the true way to holiness.<a name=43:10></a> If you have part in the divine nature, you will not want holiness meetings.<a name=43:11></a> Holiness will be promoted in a very simple way.<a name=43:12></a> You cannot dissociate holiness from the divine nature.<a name=43:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point in connection with this is, that the life of Christ adapts itself to the circumstances in which we are here, and I am sure you can want nothing better or more suitable here; for humility, meekness and endurance all spring out of love.<a name=43:14></a> In the Lord there was love to perfection, and it adapted itself to the very incongruous circumstances in which He was found in the world.<a name=43:15></a> Love was natural to Christ.<a name=43:16></a> Love is the spring of everything that is comely and agreeable to God on the one hand, while, on the other, it is corrective of all which is unworthy and unseemly.<a name=43:17></a> If one needed proof of this, it is found in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>.<a name=43:18></a>

		I want to bring before you the great importance of Christians appropriating what God has been pleased to place within their reach.<a name=45:1></a> I have a strong impression that many do not get all that they might, they have not the full benefit that God intends them to get, because they fail to appropriate what He has placed within their reach.<a name=45:2></a> It is a defect that I have suffered from myself, and have seen many another suffering from, too.<a name=45:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Faith is one thing, but appropriation is quite another.<a name=45:4></a> No one, of course, could appropriate who did not first believe.<a name=45:5></a> Faith is the light of God received into the heart of man, and whatever light from God I have received reaches me where I am down here; but appropriation is a step beyond that.<a name=45:6></a> When once I have believed what God has set before me, and the light has come home to me, then I see that God in grace has put certain things within the reach of my appropriation; and if I fail to appropriate them, I fail to enter into all the good that it has been God's pleasure to put within my reach.<a name=45:7></a> The point of appropriation is what I want to dwell upon; and that, as far as I understand it, is connected with the priesthood of Christ, or with Christ as priest.<a name=45:8></a> If you answer to the thought of God in that way, and use what God has been pleased in grace to set before you, you will get great good, and you will then be prepared to go forth to Him without the camp; you will praise God, and do good to men.<a name=45:9></a> You will answer to the mind of God down here.<a name=45:10></a>

		combined.<a name=46:1></a> For instance, if a man offered a sin offering, he brought the victim, and killed it, and then the priest came and dealt with the blood; there had to be the offering priest.<a name=46:2></a> What man could offer himself an offering to God?<a name=46:3></a> The fact is that the man's own life was already forfeited.<a name=46:4></a> So that a man bringing his offering, and the priest offering the blood, proved that victim and priest were perfectly distinct.<a name=46:5></a> But when you come to God's ways in Christ, you get what was never set forth in any type, both victim and priest in One.<a name=46:6></a> As offering priest Christ had not yet taken up the office of high priest, He was laying the foundation; He offered Himself.<a name=46:7></a> What other sacrifice could He have offered save Himself?<a name=46:8></a> And, on the other hand, who, but Himself, could have offered Himself without spot to God?<a name=46:9></a> He was both victim and priest.<a name=46:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to a point of moment, that while there could be no revival of the victim, there is the revival of the priest; that is the truth in connection with the offering of Christ -- otherwise the point of appropriation could not come in; as far as the victim was concerned it was offered to God, and could not be revived.<a name=46:11></a> The blood was the witness of the life given up, which was the case as to the victim; but the priest remains.<a name=46:12></a>

		There is one more point of contrast I will allude to between Christ and law.<a name=47:10></a> Supposing a man brought a sin-offering to the priest, he could not offer the blood himself, the priest had to do that according to the divine commandment.<a name=47:11></a> But although the priest might offer a persons' offering, it did not at all follow that he had any particular affection for those whose offerings he offered.<a name=47:12></a> The priest was official, and that was the case all through that order of things.<a name=47:13></a> The Aaronic priesthood was official; the priest, as being of the sons of Aaron, was qualified to offer the sacrifices, but the priest had not necessarily affection for the people whose offerings he accepted.<a name=47:14></a> There was not the link

		Now I want to draw your attention to two words, verse 15, "<i>By him</i>" -- what I understand by those two simple words is -- they indicate the appropriation of the Priest, it is "By him"; you are governed by the affection of the Priest.<a name=51:4></a> I have apprehended Christ as the victim, who has satisfied every demand of righteousness; I am justified; cleared in that respect; but more than that -- the heart apprehends Him as the offering priest, who in love gave Himself for me; and you will never do anything agreeable to God except as you are affected by the love of Christ.<a name=51:5></a> All else is dead works, and your conscience is purged from these, to serve the living God -- but how?<a name=51:6></a> Only by the power of the affection of the Priest -- it is "By him".<a name=51:7></a> Now are you going to let that love lie idle?<a name=51:8></a> If you do, it is to your damage, you may be small for eternity because you neglect the love of Christ now, which lies at your service.<a name=51:9></a> Do ponder these two simple words "By him" -- that is, you are governed by the affection of the Priest.<a name=51:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A path is marked out in which the Christian is affected by the love of Christ, and it is a very happy thing when His love is appreciated.<a name=52:8></a> Love would never do harm to its object, but love allied to infinite power to help and succour is what we have found in the high priest.<a name=52:9></a> What is the worth of a high priest who has not affection for his people?<a name=52:10></a> In the case of the children of Israel, the high priest carried their names not only on his shoulder but on his breast.<a name=52:11></a> So with Christ; we are in the enjoyment of His affection, but affection which is inseparably allied to power; He can come in to our succour when we are under pressure, and under pressure we will surely come down here, and want succour; but there is succour for you because there is affection.<a name=52:12></a> It is succour dictated by affection.<a name=52:13></a> You see one instance of succour in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>.<a name=52:14></a> Jesus had allowed Lazarus to die, and why?<a name=52:15></a> I think it was because He was going to teach them His affection; but not only that, He was going to teach them a deep and divine lesson, that His affection was allied with infinite power.<a name=52:16></a> Mary never forgot that lesson; as long as they lived down here upon earth they could never forget the lesson that Christ taught them then.<a name=52:17></a> Not simply did they learn His love, but that His power was at the disposal of His love; there was infinite power to succour at the disposal of affection.<a name=52:18></a> He allowed them to be tried, for Lazarus died, but He was only waiting to teach them the lesson of His love.<a name=52:19></a> Mary says, "If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died".<a name=52:20></a> And you may wonder if Christ does not come in at the moment you would

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now do not forget the expression "By him" -- under the influence of the love of Christ you can give yourself up to praise God; you can walk in the path that is well pleasing to Him; instead of murmuring and complaining, there will be fruit to God, the sacrifice of praise continually.<a name=53:2></a> And then on the other hand, though you cannot praise men, it would not do any good to praise men, you can do good and communicate -- that is the path of the Christian.<a name=53:3></a> Your mind is in accord with the death of Christ, and hence it is that you go forth to Him without the camp; you accept that you have no part in the religious order of this world system.<a name=53:4></a> The world does not trouble itself much about me, it goes on with its own things without me; but if I am crucified to it, on the other hand, it is crucified to me.<a name=53:5></a> I discern its character.<a name=53:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now do not let the love of Christ lie idle as far as we are concerned.<a name=53:7></a> I would like everyone to be stirred up to appropriate the love which has been expressed in the offering of Christ, so that you can say with the apostle, "I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=53:8></a> And then you will go through the world, very glad to be apart from its religious order.<a name=53:9></a>

		It is important to notice that these words of the Lord Jesus were spoken at a critical moment in the course of His ministry.<a name=54:1></a> He brings out the point upon which everything turned.<a name=54:2></a> I doubt whether you get the force of the passage, if that is not apprehended.<a name=54:3></a> It must have been a peculiarly solemn moment when the Lord pronounced woes on the cities wherein most of His mighty works had been done.<a name=54:4></a> They had not repented, and the moment had come when the Lord took account of this.<a name=54:5></a> God knows the condition of things at any given moment, but often delays to take account of things, because when He does so, it must be in judgment.<a name=54:6></a> We see this in the days before the flood.<a name=54:7></a> The Lord too was conscious of the state of things which existed around Him, but He waited the moment when He should take account of it; and this passage shews us that the moment had come.<a name=54:8></a> And then we find that another order of things was to come in; Christianity was to come in, and take the place of the mighty works of Christ.<a name=54:9></a> The mighty works were properly the harbinger of the kingdom.<a name=54:10></a> There had been the mighty works of Christ, works of grace to man; and grace brought responsibility; the judgment of those cities would be greater than the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah.<a name=54:11></a> Where there has been no special testimony, there is responsibility, but at the same time, the greater the testimony the greater the responsibility.<a name=54:12></a> The gospel, which is the greatest testimony of all, fills up the measure of responsibility; people incur responsibility in hearing it.<a name=54:13></a> Now I am not going to speak about the woes, I only referred to them in order that you might appreciate the solemnity of the moment.<a name=54:14></a>

		It seems a strange contrast to the announcement of woes, that the Lord says, "I thank thee, O Father"; He finds occasion to thank the Father.<a name=55:1></a> We see these contrasts in the Lord's ministry.<a name=55:2></a> I think one can appreciate them as one enters into the wisdom of the ways of God; the Lord could here thank the Father for the wisdom of His ways: "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.<a name=55:3></a> Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight".<a name=55:4></a> "These things" are, I suppose, the things connected with God's gracious approach to men.<a name=55:5></a> Christ was on earth expressing that approach; His mighty works were an expression of it.<a name=55:6></a> But the fact is this, that the revelation of God is not couched in a form which commends itself to the mind of man; when God works it will commend itself to man's moral being, but it is not in a form which would suit the mind of man naturally.<a name=55:7></a> It does not accommodate itself to the mind of the philosopher, or of the scientific man.<a name=55:8></a> I mention those two classes because they represent two particular forms which the mind of man takes, and the presentation of God suits neither the one nor the other.<a name=55:9></a> Men were compelled to notice the gracious words that proceeded out of Christ's mouth; they were compelled to own that He knew letters though He had never learned, and yet, at the same time, His word did not commend itself to the leaders of the Jews.<a name=55:10></a> Divine things are not couched by God in a form which would put any sanction whatever upon the acquirements of man.<a name=55:11></a> Philosophy and science are nothing with regard to the things of God.<a name=55:12></a> It is a remarkable feature in scripture, and was true with the Lord Himself, that everything is narrated in the simplest possible way; not at all in a way that would fall in with the conceptions of the philosopher or the man of science.<a name=55:13></a> The Lord did not seek to please the great or the intelligent of the earth among

		whom He came; indeed, they found continual occasion of stumbling in Him; but though these things were hid from the wise and prudent, yet it was the Father's pleasure to reveal them to babes, and the Lord rejoices in this.<a name=56:1></a> It is the philosophers and men of science who are the greatest enemies of the truth, they claim absolute licence for the mind of man, and hence refuse the thought of a revelation from God; they reject any and every revelation of God by assuming that man's mind is to judge of it.<a name=56:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is the mind of man is opposed to God, and God will never endorse it, so we find He had "Hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes".<a name=56:3></a> Man is in a state of moral ruin, and God will put no honour upon his mind or intelligence.<a name=56:4></a> When the mind serves the purpose of an eye, it is useful, but we are dependent upon the revelation of God to know anything of God, and upon the work of the Holy Spirit; and the mind of man has to cease from activity.<a name=56:5></a> It is serviceable as an eye, but is most dangerous when it becomes active in the things of God.<a name=56:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we get a very important point brought out, and that is this, that Christ was the centre and head of everything for the Father.<a name=56:7></a> That is implied in what the Lord says here, "All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son but the Father: neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him".<a name=56:8></a> He was the centre, the head, as Man here, of everything of the Father.<a name=56:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point.<a name=56:10></a> There are depths in the Godhead which are beyond the ken of man, "No man knoweth the Son but the Father".<a name=56:11></a> God is known to us through revelation, and revelation connects itself with the economy of grace; our knowledge of divine persons is as they are connected with the economy of grace.<a name=56:12></a> When it says here "All things are delivered

		to me of my Father", it is not a question exactly of Godhead, but of the place of the Son in relation to the Father; the position of the Father is that He sent the Son, and the position of the Son is that He was there to be sent, and content to be sent.<a name=57:1></a> So, too, the Holy Spirit has come, and has seen fit to come as the Spirit of the Father and of the Son.<a name=57:2></a> It is in that way that we have divine Persons presented to us in the economy of grace, and our knowledge of them is limited by revelation.<a name=57:3></a> There is no such thing as absolute knowledge on the part of man in regard to the Godhead; as I said, our knowledge is limited by revelation, and revelation presents divine Persons to us according to the position in which they stand in relation to the ways of grace; that is, the Father as sending the Son, and the Son assuming a body that He might come; and the Holy Spirit coming as the promise of the Father.<a name=57:4></a> The Son goes back to the Father, and sends from the Father the promise of the Spirit.<a name=57:5></a> The office of the Son we get here, He reveals the Father to whomsoever He will.<a name=57:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the Son reveals the Father in His activities of love; in all that was coming out when Christ was here; for there was a point to which the Father could gather.<a name=57:7></a> The Father's activities could now be made manifest; there always had been the activities of the Father; all will remember the word in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, "My Father worketh hitherto" -- there ever were these activities, but when Christ came, they became manifest, because there was a point with which they could connect themselves.<a name=57:8></a> The Lord was continually speaking of the Father's activities, for all the activities of grace were connected with the Father; He said, "My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven"; then again the Father sought worshippers -- "The Father seeketh such to worship him".<a name=57:9></a> It was in that way that He was making known the Father, and it was His pleasure, for He did not speak from Himself,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish that all might take in the position of things, in regard of the Father's activities, and of the Son as the centre and point of gathering for those activities to work upon.<a name=58:12></a> We get the prayer of the Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "I have declared to them thy name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them", and the apostle Paul takes up the idea in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, "I am persuaded that neither death nor life .<a name=58:13></a>.<a name=58:14></a>.<a name=58:15></a> shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" -- He is the centre of those who are blessed in the presence of the Father's love.<a name=58:16></a>

		The first thought is this, there were those who were burdened and heavy laden; there were those here who were under the burden and weight of the legal system; the apostle Peter speaks of the law as a burden which neither they, nor their fathers, had been able to bear.<a name=59:1></a> It was the godly people who felt the burden, and they were unable to bear it; such was the condition of pious people at that time; they were under the yoke of the law, and laboured under it, and were heavy laden; and that was necessarily the state of such as were seeking to comply with the requirements of God.<a name=59:2></a> Of course as long as people were unconverted, they did not feel the burden, but where they were under exercise they felt the burden, and knew that they could not maintain themselves in relation to God by the law.<a name=59:3></a> They were very much in the position of the man in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>, who had fallen among thieves and had been stripped of his raiment -- that pictured the condition of many in the time when the Lord was here.<a name=59:4></a> God gave the law in His wisdom, but it was a ministration of death to man.<a name=59:5></a> The law never brought death, but it ministered death, it brought it home to man; the law did not bring condemnation but was the ministration of it.<a name=59:6></a> It was the bringing home to man of his inability to meet the requirements of God.<a name=59:7></a> When the law came to a man it shewed him that he was sold under sin, and the law killed the man; the apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, "Sin taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me", and again, "I through law have died to law".<a name=59:8></a> It was connected with man's working, and was burdensome to him; burdensome in observances, and institutions, and ceremonies; it was <i>not</i> written in his heart, but a burden.<a name=59:9></a> It brought no assurance, or peace, or rest, but was a burden which lay heavy upon man all the time he was down here, and from which he could not relieve himself; it was all connected with doing.<a name=59:10></a> Well now the Lord says, "Come unto me .<a name=59:11></a>.<a name=59:12></a>.<a name=59:13></a> and I will

		The greater part of us have no doubt often heard this scripture read and commented upon -- so that one cannot expect to present anything new in connection with it; but incidents of this kind are so full of character, that each time they come before us they present some fresh feature; and it is that which has encouraged me to read this passage at the present time.<a name=64:1></a> This particular chapter is a point of transition, and a point of transition is pretty sure to be a point of contrast.<a name=64:2></a> Now we learn most things by contrast.<a name=64:3></a> The Epistle to the Hebrews has often been said to be an epistle of contrasts; the Spirit of God uses the contrast between what has been, and what is, to convey to us the truth.<a name=64:4></a> The contrast is between what had been, and what is -- not between what <i>will</i> be, and what is.<a name=64:5></a> Stephen might have presented the contrast between what existed, and what would be, but that was not the mind of the Spirit; the mind of the Spirit was that he should present what he himself saw, and that was the transition from what had been to what is.<a name=64:6></a>

		I speak of these things, because in a sense they make up the sum of what had been; everything which God had proposed down here; all had broken down, all was marred, and was coming to an end.<a name=66:2></a> Who at the present moment thinks anything at all about the patriarchs who had the promises, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?<a name=66:3></a> Infidels possibly doubt even their existence.<a name=66:4></a> But they are the men who had the promises, and you could not conceive that God should fulfil the promises apart from them -- they must get the promises.<a name=66:5></a> They have died in regard to men, but they live to God; God is the "God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" -- that is what the Lord said to the Sadducees, He appeals to that as a witness to resurrection.<a name=66:6></a> But for the moment all had ended in weakness, the men to whom God had been pleased to give the promises were dead.<a name=66:7></a> As to the nation, God went on with it for a certain time, but it became idolatrous, and so went into captivity, and there was an end of it, and indeed of the temple too.<a name=66:8></a> God refused the temple, and it was trodden underfoot by the Gentiles -- there was an end of everything, all was virtually past, and Stephen reviews all in the early part of his address.<a name=66:9></a> It is wonderful to think that all that had been of God in the world should have come to an end; it is a strange thing outwardly, it would almost appear as though God were weak; to think that all those things which had been set up of God should end in utter weakness.<a name=66:10></a> The Jews in captivity <i>beyond</i> Babylon, at the same time the house of God repudiated, and the city trodden down of the Gentiles.<a name=66:11></a> If you take up these things in a natural way, you cannot understand them; but if God allowed these things to come to an end, He meant it; and He did not mean that they should be revived.<a name=66:12></a>

		Now I speak of these things as things which have been; but we see represented in Stephen the things which are, and the things which should occupy the attention of Christians.<a name=67:7></a> Whatever Stephen had in the way of intelligence, he had a large acquaintance with the scriptures, but what he speaks of is also what he apprehended at the moment; he was "full of the Holy Spirit", and announced what he realised, what came within his apprehension, in the power of the Holy Spirit, at that moment.<a name=67:8></a> Now I think that God gave to Stephen a kind of answer to all that had come in.<a name=67:9></a> Stephen had been permitted to pass in review the weakness that had marked everything which had been set up here upon earth.<a name=67:10></a> Everything in which the Jew would have rejoiced had failed utterly, and Stephen was permitted to see the termination of all.<a name=67:11></a> The patriarchs, the nation, the temple -- everything had failed; all hope on that ground was completely cut away, and God gave to Stephen, as far as I understand it, the great answer to it all.<a name=67:12></a> And the answer is the "Glory of God, and Jesus"; God had in reserve an answer to every bit of failure.<a name=67:13></a> So that although we

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the glory of God is a great point to begin with -- the glory of God is moral; Stephen did not behold it with his natural vision, he was full of the Holy Spirit.<a name=68:2></a> It was in Holy Spirit power, and by Holy Spirit vision, that Stephen saw the glory of God.<a name=68:3></a> The glory of God is what is distinctive of God, what is peculiar to Him.<a name=68:4></a> Glory is always distinctive, and the glory of God is glory that is God's, and in which no one can participate.<a name=68:5></a> If you ask me to go a little more into detail, I would say it is the displayed harmony of His attributes with His nature; and I think the Spirit of God gave Stephen an apprehension of it here.<a name=68:6></a> When sin came in God's attributes were not in harmony with His nature in regard to man; His love might be towards man as ever, but man had become removed from the righteousness of God by reason of sin.<a name=68:7></a> But now comes to light the truth that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=68:8></a> What has been brought to pass is that God has been glorified, and in such a way that His attributes might be in complete harmony with His nature, in regard of sinful man.<a name=68:9></a> God's attributes must ever be in harmony with His nature, if you speak of absolute Godhead, but if you bring in the thought of sinful man, then God's attributes need to be brought into harmony with His nature.<a name=68:10></a> In Christ God's righteousness is declared, His love manifested, and in the resurrection you get the testimony to the establishment of righteousness for man.<a name=68:11></a> God has been glorified, His righteousness declared, and God has a free hand, if one might so speak, to carry out the dictates of His love.<a name=68:12></a> God so loved the world, but in order that the love of God might be effective, the Son of man had to be lifted

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point comes out in connection with the glory, Stephen saw "Jesus", Man was there, and, mark you, Man crowned with glory and honour.<a name=69:4></a> He said, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God", Man had gone up to that height -- Man, born of a woman, had gone to the right hand of God, the proof and expression of the divine acceptance of man in Jesus.<a name=69:5></a> You have to put these two things together, God's glory secured, and Man in the place of highest acceptance and honour with God.<a name=69:6></a> That is what Stephen was permitted to see.<a name=69:7></a> He looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus on the right hand of God; then he bears witness to it, his testimony is to the Son of man.<a name=69:8></a> There are two lines in Scripture connected with the Lord Jesus, one is as the Son, and the other as the Son of man.<a name=69:9></a> As Son, He comes out to express God; and as Son of man He takes everything up on behalf of man.<a name=69:10></a> You will find these two lines pretty well marked in Scripture.<a name=69:11></a> In the fourth book of Psalms the burden is "Jehovah reigneth", but in the fifth book Christ comes in on behalf of man, and is welcomed in the very city from which He was rejected; that gives you the two sides of what is connected with Christ; He expresses God, and on the other hand, as the Son of man, He has secured everything for man.<a name=69:12></a> Man is in the highest place of acceptance and honour with God -- Jesus is there, the Son of man on the behalf of man.<a name=69:13></a> This is what came into view to Stephen, and if to him, to us too.<a name=69:14></a> Every hope as connected with earth is over, we have no hope for earth, and we have to take that into account; the natural desire of the human heart is to make something

		Well, Stephen saw the glory of God and Jesus.<a name=70:6></a> The greater the apprehension of the glory of Jesus, the greater sense we have of the place of grace for man; if we see the glory of Jesus, we have a sense of the acceptance and favour in which man stands.<a name=70:7></a> The greater the glory, the greater the grace.<a name=70:8></a> Stephen said he saw the heavens opened; he had an apprehension of what is in heaven.<a name=70:9></a> It was the first time that the heavens were opened to man; they had been opened upon Christ when He was here upon earth, but now they are opened to man, so that man by the Spirit may have an apprehension of the glory of God and Jesus.<a name=70:10></a>

		Now there are two things which come out in Stephen -- superiority to the power of evil, he triumphed over that; and then there was likeness to Christ; those are the two effects produced by the power of the Holy Spirit; and as to apprehension, it was the glory of God and Jesus; he says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit", then he could say, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" -- that was triumph over the evil.<a name=71:3></a> I think one might venture to speak of this as the proof of conformity morally to Jesus in glory.<a name=71:4></a> And that is the effect and fruit of the work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=71:5></a>

		Now in regard of ourselves -- Stephen is a beautiful picture of what the power of God can effect; but we need to remember that for us, too, the platform has been cleared, everything, so far as the earth is concerned, has completely failed, and Christians have to learn that they must not indulge hopes in regard to this earth; the hopes of a Christian are concerned with heaven, and things moral.<a name=71:6></a> That is a great point.<a name=71:7></a> God has not given to us a temporal or natural portion, but our portion is a spiritual portion, and it is of all importance that our attention should be taken up with what is moral.<a name=71:8></a> There is first the apprehension that the Holy Spirit gives you, and then also His work down here.<a name=71:9></a> The Holy Spirit carries out His own blessed work down here, that you might be in conformity to the glory of God, and to the One who is in heaven.<a name=71:10></a> That work was carried out in Stephen, and

		One question I would ask -- how far is it true of us that we are superior to the power of evil?<a name=72:2></a> How far are we proof against the god and prince of this world?<a name=72:3></a> so that we are not affected by the glory of the world.<a name=72:4></a> Satan does not come to us as a roaring lion in the present day, but with the glitter and tinsel of the world.<a name=72:5></a> How far are we superior in the power of the Holy Spirit to his allurements?<a name=72:6></a> Then there is another question, how far are we conformed to the One in the glory?<a name=72:7></a> There is a mighty power down here upon earth which can effect this.<a name=72:8></a> It came out in Stephen, He called upon God, and on the Lord Jesus, as the effect of the Spirit's teaching; all sprung from love in him, and where did that come from?<a name=72:9></a> From the sense of divine love; he had the blessed sense of divine love, and at the same time, he was in the knowledge of acceptance; and this came out in the way of conformity to the One in heaven.<a name=72:10></a> It is a great thing to apprehend the presence of the Spirit, and not only that, but the work of the Spirit, His actual positive work in conforming the saints to the One who is in the highest place of acceptance on high.<a name=72:11></a> These are great things to be occupied with, things which are unseen on earth, and yet are the very substance of Christianity.<a name=72:12></a> We have not the house, nor the nation, and if we have not the unseen things we have nothing; it is a great thing to be in the light of the glory of God, and Jesus, and in the knowledge, too, of the work of the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=72:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is on my mind to touch on the series of Psalms beginning with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>and including the three succeeding ones.<a name=74:1></a> What led me to this is the thought that the Lord is the spirit of scripture: and that the platform of God's ways is that of <i>resurrection</i>.<a name=74:2></a> It is wonderful how this comes out in the Old Testament.<a name=74:3></a> In the New Testament we have the fact; but in the Old, prophetically, everything depended upon this; and it is, indeed, very plain that resurrection must be the platform on which God displays Himself, man being under death.<a name=74:4></a> This comes out in these psalms as plainly as can be.<a name=74:5></a> When Christ was risen from the dead He was found in the midst of the disciples, and we read of Him, "And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself".<a name=74:6></a> That was Himself risen.<a name=74:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All things that were spoken of Him had to be fulfilled, as He said, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=74:8></a> God addresses Himself to man in the light of resurrection.<a name=74:9></a> I think, in writing <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>, the psalmist was looking away from the confusion which is in the world, to heaven, and there is no confusion there.<a name=74:10></a> Sin brought in the confusion.<a name=74:11></a> As a matter of fact, sin has been the occasion of all the confusion on earth.<a name=74:12></a> No one can fail to see the confusion, it is before you every day.<a name=74:13></a> The politics of the world, partition of countries, and the like, witness to the confusion, but the psalmist looks away from the confusion
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=75>[Page 75]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to the heavens, where order prevails.<a name=75:1></a> There is one thing upon earth in which there is no confusion.<a name=75:2></a> "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul".<a name=75:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the psalmist puts together in this psalm two thoughts: (1) the heavens declare God's glory, (2) His law is upon earth.<a name=75:4></a> The heavens declare God's glory to the earth, and the law of God is to rule upon earth.<a name=75:5></a> When you get these two things brought together there is an end to all confusion.<a name=75:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I quite admit that the psalmist was here speaking of the material heavens, but I do not think that the Spirit of God was limited to that.<a name=75:7></a> I take up the idea in a moral sense, as foreshadowing that which has been brought to pass in the resurrection and glory of Christ.<a name=75:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look up to the heavens we see there the glory of God, the perfect satisfaction of every attribute of God in harmony with His nature.<a name=75:9></a> That is what I understand by the glory of God: righteousness and love harmonise, and the heavens thus declare the glory of God.<a name=75:10></a> Stephen looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God.<a name=75:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not the glory of God in creation when sin had not been in question, but the glory of God when sin has been in question; every attribute of God in perfect harmony with His love.<a name=75:12></a> All has been effected as is set forth in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=75:13></a> "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=75:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another point comes out in the psalm in connection with the heavens.<a name=75:15></a> "In them he hath set a tabernacle for the sun".<a name=75:16></a> This is, I believe, a hidden allusion to Christ.<a name=75:17></a> The sun represents the kingdom of heaven in the Person of the Lord.<a name=75:18></a> Man upon earth walks naturally in the light of the sun, so Christians walk in the light of heaven.<a name=75:19></a> Faith walks now in the light of the Lord.<a name=75:20></a> Thus the heavens declare the glory of God,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=76>[Page 76]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and God has set a great moral light in heaven in order that man may walk on earth in that light.<a name=76:1></a> No one walks in light but he who is in the light of Christ.<a name=76:2></a> The light of the Lord is that in which the Christian walks.<a name=76:3></a> He is not doubtful about the way, he does not stumble, but knows where the way leads.<a name=76:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to see the heavens declaring God's glory; but there is also the law of God on the earth.<a name=76:5></a> "The law of the Lord is perfect".<a name=76:6></a> The law is God's rule for man upon earth.<a name=76:7></a> Christ is the light in heaven, but the Spirit is down here; and the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit; so that you thus get clear of the confusion here, and instead of confusion have life and peace.<a name=76:8></a> All looks on to the time when the kingdom will be displayed, when the heavens will declare the glory of God publicly.<a name=76:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the heavenly city comes down from God out of heaven it has the glory of God.<a name=76:10></a> The glory of God will be set forth from the heavens and the law of God established on earth, but all is true in principle to us now.<a name=76:11></a> Faith apprehends the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, we see the glory of the Lord, and walk in the light of it.<a name=76:12></a> In Ephesians we read, "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord, walk as children of light".<a name=76:13></a> The law of God is our rule for earth, the Spirit leads us in the path of God's will, and there everything is perfect.<a name=76:14></a> It is a blessed thing to turn away from the confusion to the Lord, where there is no confusion at all.<a name=76:15></a> If we apprehend Jesus in the heavens, and the character of God's law upon earth, we do not look at the confusion, but rejoice in that which is perfect.<a name=76:16></a> It is important to remember, that all that which we apprehend now will come out publicly in a later day.<a name=76:17></a> The glory of God will be displayed from the heavens in the heavenly city, and the law and testimony of God will be established here on earth.<a name=76:18></a> The time will come when it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>shews the effect of the law written in the heart: the law of God becomes the rule of man; and so with us, as we have seen, the righteous require-merits of the law are fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<a name=77:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, just a word about <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#20">Psalm  20</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#21">Psalm  21</a>.<a name=77:3></a> Here we see faith recognising and following the interests of the king.<a name=77:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#20">Psalm  20</a>we get the determination of trouble, and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#21">Psalm  21</a>the end of enemies: both one and the other are true in resurrection, for there may be trouble up to the point of death, and enemies, too, but neither trouble nor enemies can go beyond death.<a name=77:5></a> So it was with Christ.<a name=77:6></a> He entered into the experience of trouble here; He had part in it, and was exposed to enemies, too, but neither trouble nor enemies could pass beyond death: they are powerless there.<a name=77:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get the figure of this in Israel.<a name=77:8></a> The Egyptian was swallowed up in the Red Sea.<a name=77:9></a> Israel had both trouble and enemies up to the Red Sea, but at the other side of the Red Sea there were neither; and so if you can carry your thought on to Christ in resurrection there are neither trouble nor enemies to be seen.<a name=77:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ had sorrow: He could say, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death"; but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>He speaks to the disciples beyond sorrow and enemies.<a name=77:11></a> He is risen from the dead and is outside of trouble and enemies; so far as we are concerned, in the world we have tribulation and enemies; the Lord predicted that, "In the world ye shall have tribulation", but if we apprehend what it is to be risen with Christ <i>we</i> are in a scene outside of trouble and enemies.<a name=77:12></a> They do not invade there.<a name=77:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing that it is possible for saints to reach such a point.<a name=77:14></a> It is a point which faith is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is to recognise the King, and then to be identified with the interests of the King.<a name=78:3></a> We are in association with Christ, and in association with Him we reach the scene where there is neither trouble nor enemies.<a name=78:4></a> "Ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".<a name=78:5></a> That is the place:

		<blockquote>"In Him we stand a heavenly band; <br>Where He Himself is gone".<a name=78:7></a><a name=78:6></a> (<a href=".<a name=78:8></a>.<a name=78:9></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=78:10></a>htm#12:2">Hymn 12</a>)</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is, we are brought into the worshipping company, associated with Christ, and pass outside the reach of trouble and enemies, though we may have to encounter them in our individual path here.<a name=78:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle exhorted the saints in his day that they must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.<a name=78:12></a> It is not God's way that we should escape tribulation in the world.<a name=78:13></a> The world is a scene for faith, where we have to meet enemies, those who will not admit the rights and claims of Christ; but where Christ is, in resurrection, and in our recognition of Him there, you pass outside the world.<a name=78:14></a> May God lead us into the consciousness of association with the One to whom He has given life for evermore.<a name=78:15></a> "He asked life of thee and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever".<a name=78:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, and its character is, I may say, entirely different from the preceding ones of which I have spoken.<a name=78:17></a> In verse 22 it says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee"; then in verse 25: "My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him".<a name=78:18></a>

		Himself speaking: it is faith that recognises the King.<a name=79:1></a> "Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble".<a name=79:2></a> That is what faith says: it is the Spirit of God in the saints.<a name=79:3></a> "The king shall joy in thy strength, Jehovah; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!<a name=79:4></a> Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips".<a name=79:5></a> The Psalm speaks about the glory and honour of the King, but it is not the King that is speaking.<a name=79:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>Christ is the speaker.<a name=79:7></a> The first twenty-one verses are the rehearsal of His sufferings, but afterwards we get what He announces in resurrection; the place which He Himself takes.<a name=79:8></a> He first records His experience in the sufferings, and then announces the place which He could take only in resurrection.<a name=79:9></a> Everything depends upon the platform of resurrection: otherwise it is impossible to get outside of trouble and enemies.<a name=79:10></a> As I said the first twenty-one verses are the rehearsal of sufferings, but afterwards all is in the light of resurrection.<a name=79:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is remarkable that this should have been predicted.<a name=79:12></a> These psalms were written hundreds of years before Christ came, but they present such marvellous detail, and give us the place which Christ is pleased to take in resurrection.<a name=79:13></a> We get largely fulfilled in the New Testament what was spoken of prophetically in the Old, and the platform on which everything of the Old Testament was to rest is resurrection.<a name=79:14></a> All God's ways looked on to it.<a name=79:15></a> Satan has power up to the point of death, but when death is swallowed up in victory Satan will be bound; there will be an end of trouble.<a name=79:16></a> We pass out of death into life as quickened together with Christ, associated with Him, joined to Him who is raised up from the dead.<a name=79:17></a>

		A point of importance in this psalm is, that the seed of Jacob and of Israel are not mentioned until after the assembly.<a name=79:18></a> "Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear

	<div class="paragraph">
		him, all ye the seed of Israel", that verse brings in the seed of Jacob and of Israel, but in the statement in verse 22 there is no allusion to them.<a name=80:1></a> I have no doubt whatever that the first part of verse 22 was fulfilled in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>when the Lord sent the message by Mary to the disciples, "Go to my brethren and say unto them: I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=80:2></a> The Father's name was declared.<a name=80:3></a> Jesus had said previously "I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them" (chapter 17: 26); but in chapter 20 the Name is declared in resurrection, and Jesus sends Mary with the announcement to His brethren.<a name=80:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father's name was declared in order that the disciples might come under the Father's love, "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, <i>and I in them</i>".<a name=80:5></a> Christ Himself was to have a place in that company.<a name=80:6></a> If the Father's love was not there, Christ could not be there.<a name=80:7></a> It would be impossible for Christ to be in any circle in which the Father's love was not, but the Father's love being in that company, He can be there.<a name=80:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the midst of His own the Lord declared the Father's name, and there was no Gentile there; but the Spirit of God in the psalm leaves room for the Gentile.<a name=80:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, where this verse 22 of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>is quoted, we are told that God is bringing <i>many</i> sons to glory.<a name=80:10></a> Had it been Jews only, it would have been <i>few</i>, not many; therefore I judge that room is left for the Gentile.<a name=80:11></a> We see this also in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>.<a name=80:12></a> Jesus says, "Other sheep I have which are not of this fold".<a name=80:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very interesting to see in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>the successive designations under which the Lord speaks of Himself: the Shepherd of the sheep; the door of the sheep; the good Shepherd; then the one Shepherd.<a name=80:14></a> He was

	<div class="paragraph">
		Faith identifies itself with the King in the midst of trouble and of enemies, but in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>the Lord identifies Himself with the praises of the church.<a name=81:5></a> "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>.<a name=81:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You see the same thing in principle when the Lord was on earth; we read that they sang a hymn, and so He took His part in their praises.<a name=81:7></a> Thus it is in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.<a name=81:8></a> It is His pleasure to identify Himself with the praises of His people.<a name=81:9></a> He has declared the Father's name, that the Father's love may be in the saints, and now He identifies Himself with their praises.<a name=81:10></a> He is in the midst, and must be in the midst, being what He is.<a name=81:11></a> You may say that He is Leader of the praises, but my point is, that in the midst of the church He will sing praise.<a name=81:12></a> It is His place.<a name=81:13></a> In the assembly there is not only the Father's love, but <i>I</i> in them.<a name=81:14></a> He will have His place.<a name=81:15></a> It shews the place which the church has in the mind of Christ.<a name=81:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two leading thoughts which predominate in this psalm: one is of the city, and the other, of the temple.<a name=85:1></a> We have a description of the city of the great King.<a name=85:2></a> "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King".<a name=85:3></a> What is before me is the idea of a city.<a name=85:4></a> I do not propose to take up the second thought that we have in the psalm.<a name=85:5></a> "We have thought of thy loving-kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple", etc.<a name=85:6></a>

		I was attempting to maintain that everything for God must of necessity be on the principle of resurrection.<a name=85:8></a> It does not want much argument to prove that, for the reason, simply, that death lies upon all.<a name=85:9></a> It is entirely impossible for God to ignore His own judgment.<a name=85:10></a> Death is His judgment upon man by reason of sin, and whatever God establishes in connection with man must be on the principle of resurrection.<a name=85:11></a> If you invalidate the truth of resurrection, you cut away the whole fabric of scripture.<a name=85:12></a> Scripture from beginning to end depends upon the truth of resurrection.<a name=85:13></a>

		I would like to refer for a moment to the psalms preceding <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48">Psalm  48</a>.<a name=86:16></a> First, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:6">Psalm  45:6</a> we have: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.<a name=86:17></a> Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#46">Psalm  46</a>speaks of the experience gained by those who, in a sense, are the companions of Christ.<a name=87:12></a> "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble", etc.<a name=87:13></a> If you remember, the Lord referred to this psalm in saying to the disciples that if they had faith as a grain of mustard seed, they should say to this mountain, "Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea", and it should be done.<a name=87:14></a> Here we have the experience, that is, the knowledge of God, gained in the time of trouble.<a name=87:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it appears to me that, for God, a city is constituted by a covenant.<a name=88:9></a> The real value of a city in the eye of God is that is has been constituted by a covenant, and it is of no moral value beyond that.<a name=88:10></a> That principle is seen clearly in Galatians.<a name=88:11></a> It is said there, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother".<a name=88:12></a> That expression alludes really to the covenant, answering to Sarah.<a name=88:13></a> The city is dependent upon the covenant for its character, as Ishmael was dependent upon Hagar.<a name=88:14></a> He could not escape being a bondman, because his mother was a bond-woman.<a name=88:15></a> He was not on the line of promise, and the free woman was not his mother.<a name=88:16></a> He had no part -- looked at typically -- in the promise, and describes the position of the Jew in the past.<a name=88:17></a> The children of the flesh were not the children of promise -- they were the children of a legal covenant.<a name=88:18></a>

		What I want to make plain is this, that you have a double connection with Christ.<a name=91:6></a> A Christian has promise for father and a free woman for mother.<a name=91:7></a> That is the idea here, and you want both connections.<a name=91:8></a> It will be so too with the Jew in the future.<a name=91:9></a> The two principles are bound to go together, but my point for the moment is that you take your character from the mother, from the covenant, "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother".<a name=91:10></a> In this the apostle had in mind the idea of the covenant, though he does not speak expressly of it.<a name=91:11></a> Just as the <i>old</i> covenant was represented in the then Jerusalem, so the <i>new</i> covenant is represented in the Jerusalem above.<a name=91:12></a>

		I desire to draw attention to two lines of truth, which meet in Christ, and are connected with the ways of God toward man; they present two things which God has found the means of conciliating.<a name=96:1></a> The one is the establishment of His authority in man's soul, that is what the kingdom means.<a name=96:2></a> The other is the gaining of the confidence of man's heart.<a name=96:3></a> The two things go together in our experience.<a name=96:4></a>

		If God saw fit to establish His kingdom -- and no one can for a moment deny the propriety of His doing so -- there would not have been much in it if He had not been able to gain the confidence of man.<a name=96:5></a> The wisdom of God is manifested in the way in which He has brought about these two results.<a name=96:6></a> They will come out most distinctly when the kingdom is displayed: then the ways of God will have their issue.<a name=96:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the one hand, the authority of God will be publicly established in the world, and will be the guarantee to man of liberty from the power of the enemy; and, on the other, the result achieved for God is the confidence of His people upon earth.<a name=96:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can appreciate the wisdom in which God has been able to accomplish these two purposes when we take into account that man is in will departed from God and has wandered into the tortuous paths of self-will.<a name=96:9></a> The presumption and self-assertion of man are something amazing.<a name=96:10></a> You may see this all around.<a name=96:11></a> Man has set himself up as the rival of God, in fact, he displaces God altogether; that is the line of development of evil; yet the end and issue of God's ways is that He has established His authority in the kingdom, and has gained the confidence of man.<a name=96:12></a>

		This will be verified in the case of Israel, and these two thoughts will explain a great deal in the psalms, where the two lines are pursued.<a name=97:1></a>

		Now Christ is the wisdom of God.<a name=97:2></a> What I understand by wisdom is <i>resource</i>.<a name=97:3></a> Christ is the resource by which God has been enabled to work out the purpose of His will: to establish the kingdom and to gain the confidence of man's heart.<a name=97:4></a>

		The passages I have read are from two books of the psalms.<a name=97:5></a> The first two passages are found in the fifth book, and the last in the fourth book; both books celebrate the coming of the Lord, though in different connections.<a name=97:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might put it in this way: in the fourth book the coming of the Lord is celebrated as the establishment of the throne of Jehovah; in the fifth book the same coming is celebrated, but on the behalf of man.<a name=97:7></a> You can look at it in both lights.<a name=97:8></a> Christ comes on the part of God and on the part of man.<a name=97:9></a> The two lines are treated distinctly in the psalms, and are easy to apprehend in connection with the Lord.<a name=97:10></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99">Psalm  99</a>we read, "Jehovah reigneth: let the peoples tremble.<a name=97:11></a> He sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved", etc.<a name=97:12></a> The burden of these psalms is, <i>Jehovah reigneth</i>.<a name=97:13></a> The subject begins really in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#93">Psalm  93</a>; in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#97">Psalm  97</a>Jehovah has made known His judgments; then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99">Psalm  99</a>, "Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble", etc.<a name=97:14></a> Nothing can be simpler than the burden of these psalms celebrating the coming in of Jehovah.<a name=97:15></a> It is Jehovah coming in, in Christ, to establish the kingdom, and the throne of David.<a name=97:16></a> Jehovah is exalted.<a name=97:17></a> Now, so far, the truth is all on that side.<a name=97:18></a> It is Jehovah coming in to establish His rights in the world, and no one could deny the suitability of this.<a name=97:19></a> Christ comes in, in that way, as Jehovah.<a name=97:20></a> When, however, you come to the fifth book of psalms, it is not exactly the establishment of

		<a name=98>[Page 98]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah's rights that is in question, but the establishment of man's heart in confidence in God, and that is a very great point.<a name=98:1></a> The two things come to pass by Christ.<a name=98:2></a> He represents the authority of Jehovah, but at the same time He comes in in such a way as to establish the confidence of man's heart in God.<a name=98:3></a> What good could there be in the kingdom otherwise?<a name=98:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will read a verse or two in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<a name=98:5></a>.<a name=98:6></a>.<a name=98:7></a>.<a name=98:8></a> The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=98:9></a> In this particular psalm Christ is not viewed as Jehovah; but Jehovah speaks to Him.<a name=98:10></a> "Jehovah said unto my Lord".<a name=98:11></a> It is Jehovah speaking to David's Lord.<a name=98:12></a> The burden is not, "Jehovah reigneth", but Jehovah saying, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool"; and again, "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=98:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the idea of a <i>priest</i> is, that he is for men.<a name=98:14></a> He is ordained on man's behalf in things pertaining to God.<a name=98:15></a> The thought stands in contrast to that of mediator.<a name=98:16></a> The mediator is of God toward man, and the priest for man toward God; hence in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>Jehovah sware, and will not repent, "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=98:17></a> Melchisedec, you remember, brought forth bread and wine and blessed Abraham.<a name=98:18></a> He was on the behalf of Abraham, and so is Christ for us.<a name=98:19></a> We have a throne of grace to which we can come boldly to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need; that is the effect and fruit of priesthood.<a name=98:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118:22">Psalm  118:22</a> we read: "The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner".<a name=98:21></a> Then again, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord".<a name=98:22></a> That is not exactly the idea of Jehovah's throne, but of one coming in the name of

		<a name=99>[Page 99]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah, confirming the confidence of the people in Jehovah.<a name=99:1></a> When the Lord came to Jerusalem in the past, He said: "Behold your house is left unto you desolate; for I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=99:2></a> It is to that point that this psalm refers.<a name=99:3></a> It is Christ come in, in the name of Jehovah, on behalf of the people, in order that the confidence of the people may be established in Jehovah.<a name=99:4></a> The beginning of this is by priesthood.<a name=99:5></a> We get the benefit of this now, and so will Israel hereafter.<a name=99:6></a> He comes again; and when He comes again into the city from which He was cast out, the confidence of the people in Jehovah is fully established.<a name=99:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have the two things brought together, the establishment of God's kingdom, and of the confidence of the hearts of the people in Jehovah; and the secret of this lies in Christ, who has suffered on their behalf.<a name=99:8></a> He came here and tasted death for everything, and they will recognise in Christ their Saviour and Priest.<a name=99:9></a> He will come forth to bless Israel, as Melchisedec blessed Abraham.<a name=99:10></a> He will bring forth bread and wine.<a name=99:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get the idea of this in Moses and Aaron coming out of the tabernacle to bless the people.<a name=99:12></a> Moses represented the authority of God, and Aaron was the priest.<a name=99:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know anything much more important in connection with the kingdom than that in it authority and priesthood are combined.<a name=99:14></a> Christ has been received with acclamation in heaven.<a name=99:15></a> The children sang on His entering Jerusalem, "Hosanna".<a name=99:16></a> That was in view of Christ entering heaven, but He is going to enter the city with acclamation, and they will then say, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord".<a name=99:17></a> He will be welcomed, and the confidence of the people established in Jehovah.<a name=99:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if you follow me I think you will apprehend the perfect wisdom of God's ways: how He brings to pass two things which never could be if man had his way.<a name=100:1></a> If God had to deal with righteous people there would be no need to bring in the kingdom; but He has had to deal with sinful man, and in this it has been possible for God to conciliate the two things of which I have spoken; and the secret of all is that Christ has come in as Saviour and Priest.<a name=100:2></a> "He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death", etc.<a name=100:3></a> That is, having established righteousness, He has taken up the position of priest.<a name=100:4></a> He is Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=100:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two thoughts stand good in regard of Christians, and we get the gain of them.<a name=100:6></a> We rejoice in the authority of God, and delight to give God His place.<a name=100:7></a> One can see the terrible sin of the world in virtually ignoring the authority of God.<a name=100:8></a> God's name is used, but His authority is not admitted in the world.<a name=100:9></a> Do you think that politicians concern themselves about the authority of God?<a name=100:10></a> Do you think that people do generally?<a name=100:11></a> The principle which rules in this world is the will of man, and no one who knows the world can deny it.<a name=100:12></a> The worst form of it is in religious things, in which the will of man is rampant.<a name=100:13></a> Where do you think such things as Ritualism and Rationalism come from?<a name=100:14></a> From man's will.<a name=100:15></a> And infidelity, too, is an expression of that will.<a name=100:16></a>

		It is remarkable that there is nothing, in principle, working in the world of which you do not get a type in Scripture.<a name=100:17></a> One can see in the early books of the Bible the type of every principle of evil now prevalent.<a name=100:18></a> Take, for instance, apostasy from Christian privilege.<a name=100:19></a> Esau is a very apt type of a great deal which is going on today, men giving up their Christianity for some worldly advantage.<a name=100:20></a> This is the secret of much of the infidelity, and opposition to Christianity in the present day.<a name=100:21></a> Men, like Esau, barter their birthright for a mess

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, a true Christian delights in recognising the authority of God, and has confidence in the One who is presented to him in the Saviour and Priest; Christ has passed through the heavens to the throne of God, and sympathises with His people here in their infirmities; and the practical result is that we have a throne of grace to which we can come, to obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=101:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the next point.<a name=101:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>we read, "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord".<a name=101:6></a> And again, "I will keep thy statutes, O forsake me not utterly".<a name=101:7></a> I read also a verse or two in John's first epistle, chapter 4: 9: "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him .<a name=101:8></a>.<a name=101:9></a>.<a name=101:10></a> Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit".<a name=101:11></a> Also verse 16: "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<a name=101:12></a> God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<a name=101:13></a>.<a name=101:14></a>.<a name=101:15></a>.<a name=101:16></a> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment.<a name=101:17></a> He that feareth is not made perfect in love".<a name=101:18></a> At first sight you might hardly see the connection here, but both scriptures really hang on the new covenant.<a name=101:19></a> The covenant follows upon the kingdom.<a name=101:20></a> God has established the kingdom, and in connection with it you have the priest, who is also the Mediator of the covenant.<a name=101:21></a> That will be the case when Christ takes the kingdom.<a name=101:22></a> The people come under the teaching of the new covenant, and that we get expressed in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=102>[Page 102]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in other words, the psalm presents the effect of the law being written in the heart, which is the meaning and power of the new covenant.<a name=102:1></a> God will write His laws in their hearts, and their sins and iniquities will He remember no more.<a name=102:2></a> It is God's law, and no remembrance of sins.<a name=102:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of that is that Israel hereafter will become the expression of the law of God upon earth.<a name=102:4></a> They will love God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as themselves.<a name=102:5></a> They derive that from Christ, for they come under Him as the second Man; and what marks Him as Man is, "Thy law is within my heart".<a name=102:6></a> Israel will see the perfection of God's law as a rule for man upon the earth, and it will find its expression in them as a people.<a name=102:7></a> You get the accomplishment of this in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>.<a name=102:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we have in Christ the authority of God on the one hand, and confidence in God inspired on the other; we know Christ as Saviour and Priest, sitting at the right hand of God, giving us confidence of heart in God.<a name=102:9></a> In the midst of trouble we are not afraid, for we are supported.<a name=102:10></a> We get mercy, and grace to help in time of need.<a name=102:11></a> We are represented at the right hand of God and thus get confidence in God.<a name=102:12></a> If there were one thing which I would desire to do, it is to establish the heart of every saint in full confidence in God which nothing could shake, so that in coming into trials and difficulties there might be unwavering confidence.<a name=102:13></a> That is a service which Christ Himself alone can effect.<a name=102:14></a>

		As Christians we come under the spirit of the new covenant, and that is represented to us, I think, in the passage in John's epistle.<a name=102:15></a> The chapter looks upon the saints, not as in the sanctuary, but as in the place of testimony and responsibility.<a name=102:16></a> I will read verse 17.<a name=102:17></a> "Herein has love been perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; that even as he is, we also are in this world".<a name=102:18></a> Here the day of judgment is contemplated; that is not the thought of heaven,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Verse 9 carries us back to the beginning of our apprehension, "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that <i>we</i> might live through him.<a name=103:6></a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins".<a name=103:7></a> You see that the love of God was there before we loved God.<a name=103:8></a> It was manifested toward us.<a name=103:9></a> All began with the love of God.<a name=103:10></a> Then in verse 16, "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us".<a name=103:11></a> That is in regard of our pathway here.<a name=103:12></a> This is not the love of God as expressed in the past, but the love He <i>hath</i> to us.<a name=103:13></a> And finally in verse 17, "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=103:14></a> This fulfils the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them".<a name=103:15></a> That is what I understand by the covenant.<a name=103:16></a> Our hearts are established in the love of God.<a name=103:17></a> The point here is that the <i>love</i> of God is our testimony.<a name=103:18></a> We are not the expression here of the <i>law</i> of God.<a name=103:19></a> If we walk in the Spirit the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us; but that is hardly our testimony; our testimony is of the love of God, as expressed in Christ.<a name=103:20></a>

		Now, I have tried to show you that the principles of God abide.<a name=105:18></a> When Christ comes the throne is established and the law written in the hearts of God's people.<a name=105:19></a> But the kingdom is true to us now, Christ is Saviour and Priest, and our confidence is established by Him in God.<a name=105:20></a> We get the teaching of the new covenant by the Spirit of God; our hearts are established in the knowledge of God, so that divine love should find its expression in us.<a name=105:21></a>

		In looking at some earlier psalms I drew attention to the great importance of apprehending the principle of resurrection as pervading the whole collection.<a name=107:1></a> It is only through resurrection, that is, on the principle of life out of death, that God could bring to pass the world to come.<a name=107:2></a> Every purpose of God as regards man, whether for heaven or for earth, must be fulfilled on that principle, for the obvious reason that death is universally upon man down here in this world.<a name=107:3></a> There is nothing in this world that is not under the shadow of death -- the best things are as much under the shadow of death as the worst.<a name=107:4></a> Human relationships and ties are continually being broken in upon by death.<a name=107:5></a> Every one becomes familiar with it, at least in the bearing of it.<a name=107:6></a> All the ties with which human happiness is bound up are continually loosened by death, and the enjoyment of the best things is spoiled by it.<a name=107:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this being the case with regard to the best things, it is still more striking in reference to what is artificial.<a name=107:8></a> Whatever a man may have gathered by labour and thrift in this world he has to leave behind him, and he knows not whether what he has accumulated will do good or evil.<a name=107:9></a> All under the sun is vanity and vexation of spirit; if a man could follow out the effect of all that he has done and gathered in this world, I suppose that he would be sorely disappointed.<a name=107:10></a> However, I don't pursue that subject, but desire you to see how God has been at work in the behalf of man.<a name=107:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has been working from the beginning.<a name=107:12></a> You will no doubt recall an expression of the Lord Jesus in John's gospel, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".<a name=107:13></a> God has been working from the beginning,

		laboriously and patiently, but in view of the world to come.<a name=108:1></a> The work of God has not had for its ultimate object the amelioration of the condition of man in this world, but the establishment of the world to come.<a name=108:2></a> On the principle of resurrection He has proposed to establish an order of things which will be according to His mind, in which God may rest, and blessing be secured for man according to His mind.<a name=108:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every intervention of God in the Old Testament was really in view of the world to come.<a name=108:4></a> Whether it be what was promised to Abraham or to David, all had reference to the world to come, though there may have been already a provisional fulfilment; and, further, every dealing of God with man had in view the world to come.<a name=108:5></a> Faith ever had reference to the world to come, whether in Abraham, Moses or David.<a name=108:6></a> That is brought out in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=108:7></a> God was looking on to the time when He would dispossess death, the time of redemption.<a name=108:8></a> Redemption results in deliverance from all the power of evil.<a name=108:9></a> Death is God's judgment consequent on the coming in of sin, and God will dispossess death in virtue of redemption.<a name=108:10></a> In the Revelation the Lord Jesus says to John, "I am he that liveth and was dead and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death".<a name=108:11></a> He is able to dispossess death; for that is the power of resurrection.<a name=108:12></a> God has acquired that power through redemption, and that is the first principle of the world to come, and that principle comes out very abundantly in the psalms.<a name=108:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the psalms we have great detail of Christ's sufferings, and we find Him taking a new place in resurrection, and identifying others with Him in that place.<a name=108:14></a> That is also brought out in Hebrews, "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying: I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the later psalms we see the city and the covenant.<a name=109:4></a> Last time I spoke of the coming of the Lord.<a name=109:5></a> He is now seated provisionally at the right hand of God, but He is coming again, to be welcomed in the very place from which He has been rejected, and He comes, in the power of resurrection, to dispossess death, death will be swallowed up in victory.<a name=109:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the psalms I have read at this time furnish a climax to the whole.<a name=109:7></a> Properly speaking, the psalms close with 119 -- the law being written in the heart, that psalm is morally the close.<a name=109:8></a> Then we get the songs of degrees, which close with the three I have now read.<a name=109:9></a> They show how, in result, every divine thought is brought into accomplishment, and that is what I want to open out.<a name=109:10></a> If you get the rest of God, it can only be when He is glorified.<a name=109:11></a> It is impossible that God's rest could be until His purpose is brought into effect.<a name=109:12></a> He will rest in His love because He is glorified, and every purpose accomplished, and His promises fulfilled; then He rests.<a name=109:13></a> We have in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>the rest of God, and we who believe enter into rest.<a name=109:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have often said that the three great thoughts presented on the part of God in the Old Testament are <i>blessing</i>, <i>dwelling</i>, and <i>ruling</i>.<a name=109:15></a> Blessing, as I understand it, means eternal life in the victory over death.<a name=109:16></a> <i>Dwelling</i> is in the idea of God's house; and ruling is God's kingdom.<a name=109:17></a> These are the three great thoughts prominent in the Old Testament.<a name=109:18></a> When we get the climax according to God we have these three thoughts brought together.<a name=109:19></a> I will shew you how they are brought together in these three psalms.<a name=109:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		people are greatly concerned about the future, for myself I am more concerned about the present.<a name=110:1></a> Future things are not exactly things which are described as unseen.<a name=110:2></a> Faith is the substantiation of things <i>hoped for</i>, and hope does not connect itself so much with future things as with <i>unseen</i> things.<a name=110:3></a> You do not hope for what you see.<a name=110:4></a> "For what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for: but if we hope for that we see <i>not</i> then do we with patience wait for it".<a name=110:5></a> Hope connects itself with <i>unseen</i> things, and faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.<a name=110:6></a> It is a mistake to suppose that unseen things do not yet exist: they do exist, they are present, not future.<a name=110:7></a> The point is, that there is a power come in to make them good to us, and faith is the substantiation of things hoped for: that means the things made good to us in the present time.<a name=110:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the continual effort on the part of man is to put the <i>world</i> right.<a name=110:9></a> Men see certain blots on humanity, and they set to work to remove them.<a name=110:10></a> For instance, in movements to abolish slavery: it is agreed that it is a blot upon humanity, but the abolition of slavery meets with a very great deal of difficulty.<a name=110:11></a> In the abolition of slavery in America and Russia very many people both slaves and masters, were not willing for it, and it was not done without a very great deal of inconvenience and difficulty, and against the disposition of many concerned.<a name=110:12></a> The object of man is not to set man right, but to set the world right; and, in contrast to that, I see that God's way is not to put the world right but to put <i>man</i> right.<a name=110:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When man is put right God will easily put everything else right.<a name=110:14></a> If you could conceive such a state of things brought to pass as that man should love God with all his heart and his neighbour as himself, what would be the result?<a name=110:15></a> Man would want God brought in; and if he loved his neighbour as himself, he would not be able to bear the thought of inequality.<a name=110:16></a> You

		could hardly have distinctions between rich and poor, masters and slaves, if a man loved his neighbour as himself.<a name=111:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the distinction is very intelligible between man setting the world right, and God working to put man right.<a name=111:2></a> It is when <i>man</i> is put right that God displays the world to come, and in doing so answers right desires of man.<a name=111:3></a> He comes in when right desires on the part of man have been awakened.<a name=111:4></a> Every change in the world will entail great inconvenience and suffering when man works; but when God works to set man right, every change which takes place is the answer to right desires on man's part.<a name=111:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turning to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, I want you to follow the appeal made here.<a name=111:6></a> "Jehovah remember for David, all his afflictions", etc.<a name=111:7></a> That is a right desire awakened on the part of man, and then he appeals to Jehovah.<a name=111:8></a> "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength".<a name=111:9></a> That is another appeal on the part of man.<a name=111:10></a> God has awakened in man right desires; man loves God, and the expression of those desires is the appeal to Jehovah.<a name=111:11></a> "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy".<a name=111:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read now verses 11 - 18: "Jehovah hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne .<a name=111:13></a>.<a name=111:14></a>.<a name=111:15></a> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish".<a name=111:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first part of the psalm is the expression of godly, right desires on man's part, and the latter part is the answer which Jehovah is pleased to give in His grace.<a name=111:17></a> He fulfils the desire, and not only fulfils it, but He surpasses it.<a name=111:18></a> There are two points connected with the answer.<a name=111:19></a> (1) He establishes the throne of David; and (2) God comes in to dwell in Zion.<a name=111:20></a> The burden of the prophets is, that Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.<a name=111:21></a> If you were to go through Scripture and find

		out the number of times those two thoughts are spoken of, you would be surprised.<a name=112:1></a> We thus get two great thoughts fulfilled, Jehovah reigning and Jehovah dwelling.<a name=112:2></a> That comes out in the psalm, and when God comes the throne of David is established, it is in the Person of Christ.<a name=112:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is not only the Offspring but the Root of David.<a name=112:4></a> He occupies the throne of David, because He is the Offspring, but He is at the same time the Root of David; and hence the throne of David is identified with the throne of Jehovah.<a name=112:5></a> That, to me, is a wonderful thing.<a name=112:6></a> It is Jehovah who sits on the throne of David and dwells in Zion.<a name=112:7></a> When Jehovah dwells in Zion it is a time of prosperity and blessing.<a name=112:8></a> There will not be any marked distinctions in that day between rich and poor, master and slave, but satisfaction and abundance for all.<a name=112:9></a> "I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread".<a name=112:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God answers the desire of every living thing.<a name=112:11></a> He Himself comes in, and men find their portion and blessing in His goodness.<a name=112:12></a> The world then will not be full of men with unsatisfied desires, for they will be satisfied with the goodness of God.<a name=112:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To pursue the psalm.<a name=112:14></a> It says, "There will I make the horn of David to bud".<a name=112:15></a> This is what will mark that day, because God has come in to take up His dwelling in Zion in answer to the desires in man which His Spirit has awakened.<a name=112:16></a> He dwells in Zion, and reigns in the city of the great king.<a name=112:17></a> He is the God of the whole earth.<a name=112:18></a> He takes up the throne of David; and in the next psalm we come to the thought of <i>blessing</i>.<a name=112:19></a>

		may refer to the blessing to Abraham, and the promise of blessing to Abraham probably meant <i>life for evermore</i>, that is, that God would dispossess death.<a name=113:1></a> It would be blessing beyond the power of death.<a name=113:2></a> The proof of this is, that the blessing was confirmed to the seed of Abraham when there was a figure of resurrection.<a name=113:3></a> God promised the blessing to Abraham, and confirmed it to his seed, after the seed had, figuratively, been offered in sacrifice.<a name=113:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to mark the point at which the blessing is brought to pass, it is when there is dwelling in unity.<a name=113:5></a> When you have the unity of Israel and Judah, bound together in one stick, in the anointing of the Holy Spirit, then it is that God commands the blessing, even life for evermore.<a name=113:6></a> Now I think this shews how much importance God attaches to unity.<a name=113:7></a> The blessing is spoken of as commanded when Israel and Judah come under the influence of the Spirit, the law being written in the heart.<a name=113:8></a> They are in the light of Christ, and death is dispossessed.<a name=113:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God will have under His eye what is according to His mind, and then He will dispossess death.<a name=113:10></a> It was a sad moment before God when Israel and Judah became divided, for it was a mark of defection and sin, and therefore a trouble to God; what followed was that Israel soon fell away from God; but the prophets look on to the reunion of Israel and Judah in Christ.<a name=113:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On the table of shewbread in the holy place of the tabernacle there were <i>twelve</i> loaves, not two, nor ten, but twelve.<a name=113:12></a> God could not possibly recognise, in connection with Christ, two tribes or ten tribes.<a name=113:13></a> You get the same principle coming out in Elijah.<a name=113:14></a> There was the recognition with him of twelve tribes.<a name=113:15></a> When Christ came it was in connection with the twelve tribes.<a name=113:16></a> In the future, when Israel is connected with Christ, there will be twelve tribes, as prefigured in the twelve loaves; and when you get this union, in

		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:1">Hebrews  3:1</a> - 19
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire to do is to endeavour to trace the course of divine ways with us from the beginning to the <i>present</i> end which God has purposed for Himself.<a name=139:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That purpose is stated in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:39">Romans  8:39</a>: nothing shall "separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=139:2></a> That is God's purpose for us, and is the end that God has in view.<a name=139:3></a> Now so far as I understand, the purpose of God is to bring us to that confidence.<a name=139:4></a> It is not His purpose to take us to heaven yet: that awaits us; we shall be taken to the Father's house, but the point God has before Him to bring us to is to that persuasion that nothing can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=139:5></a> Everything is measured, height and depth, etc.<a name=139:6></a>, but the persuasion is, that nothing "shall be able to separate us from the love of God".<a name=139:7></a> The passage involves our association with Christ.<a name=139:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought is contemplated of love resting in perfect complacency in Christ Jesus, and we are there.<a name=139:9></a> We are in association with Him.<a name=139:10></a> God and saints meet in Christ.<a name=139:11></a> The fulness of God is in Him, and we are complete in Him.<a name=139:12></a> We are there.<a name=139:13></a> The apostle, having measured everything, had come to the persuasion that nothing could separate from the love of God.<a name=139:14></a> It is the grace of God to bring us to that point now.<a name=139:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would trace now the course which God takes with us to bring us to that point.<a name=139:16></a> The beginning of God's ways is Christ, and the course which God was taking was "reconciling the world unto himself".<a name=139:17></a> The way that God took to recover man for Himself was the introduction of a Head.<a name=139:18></a> But the introduction of a Head involves the setting aside of the Jew for the time

		being.<a name=140:1></a> "This child", Simeon said, "is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel".<a name=140:2></a> The introduction of Christ as the Head of every man involved the casting off of the Jew for the moment, but that involved the "reconciling of the world".<a name=140:3></a> What an immense difference the introduction of Christ meant.<a name=140:4></a> The mass of the nations was idolatrous, the Jew was almost as bad, but God's way was to introduce a new Head.<a name=140:5></a> "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself".<a name=140:6></a> The casting off of the Jew was the reconciling of the world.<a name=140:7></a> All the world in that way came near to righteousness by the very fact of God being near to men in the new Head raised up.<a name=140:8></a> Now that is the beginning of God's way.<a name=140:9></a> The next step is, Christ entered into all the liabilities which lay upon man.<a name=140:10></a> Death lay upon man; man was under wrath; the Jew was under curse.<a name=140:11></a> Well, Christ entered into all.<a name=140:12></a> He entered into death, into wrath, into every liability under which man lay, in order to lay the ground upon which God could bring in reconciliation.<a name=140:13></a> In Christ it is in the power of God to approach every man, even the reprobate Jew.<a name=140:14></a> "God was <i>in Christ</i> reconciling the world to himself", and the effect is -- righteousness lies very close to man.<a name=140:15></a> "The word <i>is nigh</i> thee".<a name=140:16></a> He does not need to go up to heaven or to go down to the deep.<a name=140:17></a> Righteousness lies quite close to every man.<a name=140:18></a> Repentance and remission of sins were to be preached in the name of the One who had suffered and was risen again.<a name=140:19></a> He was the light for the revelation of the Gentiles and for the glory of His people Israel.<a name=140:20></a> If you do not apprehend that, you could not see how God could go on with the world.<a name=140:21></a> Christ is the Head of every man.<a name=140:22></a> The "grace of God, and the free gift in grace .<a name=140:23></a>.<a name=140:24></a>.<a name=140:25></a> abounded by one man unto the many".<a name=140:26></a> Thus the effect of Christ being set as Head of every man is to sift men.<a name=140:27></a> The man who does not accept Christ as Head proclaims himself lawless.<a name=140:28></a> He is not prepared to submit to the new Head, and therefore
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=141>[Page 141]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there can be nothing for such but the judgment of God, and that is what will come to pass.<a name=141:1></a> The Head is a test of men, and if men do not answer to the Head, judgment will become a necessity, because they prove themselves lawless.<a name=141:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another point.<a name=141:3></a> All that state of things must lead up to Antichrist.<a name=141:4></a> Antichrist is the fittest man in that state of things, in a lawless world, and that will bring in the judgment of God.<a name=141:5></a> When Antichrist comes to the top the moment has come for the judgment of God.<a name=141:6></a> Now there is a testing process going on at the present time.<a name=141:7></a> Men are tested by the new Head.<a name=141:8></a> There are those who have believed in Christ; all do not believe in Him.<a name=141:9></a> God does not expect all.<a name=141:10></a> Faith is not the portion of all.<a name=141:11></a> God does not work in sovereignty in all.<a name=141:12></a> You must not expect it.<a name=141:13></a> If <i>you</i> have believed in Christ you are bound to own that it is through mercy you did believe in Him.<a name=141:14></a> The effect of believing is that the Spirit of God is given to those who believe.<a name=141:15></a> Those who believe receive from the Head the gift of living water.<a name=141:16></a> Now two things are true of those who have received the living water.<a name=141:17></a> They are: first, God's house, and, secondly, they are companions of Christ.<a name=141:18></a> "Whose house are we", and "we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold .<a name=141:19></a>the beginning of the assurance firm to the end".<a name=141:20></a> We have come to that point where we have received the Spirit of God, and we have become God's house.<a name=141:21></a> Christ is the builder of God's house, and <i>we</i> are God's house and <i>we</i> are also companions of Christ if we hold fast; it is subject to conditions, but I assume that all here have answered to these conditions.<a name=141:22></a> "If ye hold", etc.<a name=141:23></a> I want to dwell on these two points now, for it is that to which God has been pleased to bring us for certain purposes.<a name=141:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the house of God is composed of persons, of living stones.<a name=141:25></a> God's house is God's household.<a name=141:26></a> It is a spiritual house composed of living stones.<a name=141:27></a> There
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=142>[Page 142]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are two things which mark those who compose God's house, one is divine teaching and the other is discipline.<a name=142:1></a> We are brought to God's house that we may know God in His nature and become partakers of His holiness.<a name=142:2></a> We are brought to the abode of His holiness.<a name=142:3></a> It is the place too where we come under discipline.<a name=142:4></a> Christ attends to the ways of all those who compose God's house.<a name=142:5></a> He is Son over God's house, and we come under His inspection.<a name=142:6></a> He intercedes for us, too, and perhaps that we may not come under discipline; but in God's house we do come under discipline.<a name=142:7></a> No father disregards the discipline of his children, so God corrects His people, and all to one end, that we may be partakers of His holiness.<a name=142:8></a> We come under love to beget confidence, and we come under discipline to promote holiness.<a name=142:9></a> Love begets confidence, and chastening promotes holiness.<a name=142:10></a> There is confidence in children towards their parents in a well-regulated household, because they know there is love there.<a name=142:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another point.<a name=142:12></a> Priesthood helps to that end.<a name=142:13></a> You do not suppose that your ways are not inspected.<a name=142:14></a> All our ways are inspected, and Christ is extremely vigilant and has our good and blessing in view, and that because He is Son over God's house.<a name=142:15></a> He intercedes for us.<a name=142:16></a> It would be a very defective sort of love on the part of the parent if he disregarded the discipline of his children.<a name=142:17></a> At the same tune He is careful in regard to their ways that they may be according to God.<a name=142:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another thing.<a name=142:19></a> It is equally true that it is God's way that we should be "companions of Christ".<a name=142:20></a> It was in the mind of God that there should be a company of which Christ is the pre-eminent One.<a name=142:21></a> Aaron's sons were companions of Aaron.<a name=142:22></a> Christ is the Firstborn among many brethren.<a name=142:23></a> There is a fitting company in which Christ could sing praise unto God.<a name=142:24></a> "In the midst of the church will I sing

	<div class="paragraph">
		praise unto thee".<a name=143:1></a> The disciples were the companions of Christ here, and He sang a hymn with them.<a name=143:2></a> The Lord had great delight in their company.<a name=143:3></a> Now what marks the moment is that there is a company which Christ leads, and of which He is the pre-eminent One.<a name=143:4></a> We are God's house.<a name=143:5></a> Do you believe God is dwelling here?<a name=143:6></a> That is the great truth of the moment.<a name=143:7></a> Christ has built God's house in order that God might abide here.<a name=143:8></a> Redemption was accomplished that God might dwell here.<a name=143:9></a> We have to recognise that God is dwelling here by the Spirit, and our conduct is to be ordered in reference to the presence of God.<a name=143:10></a> How far are we regulated by the truth of God abiding here?<a name=143:11></a> It is important that the presence of God should be that which is before us as that which regulates our conduct, that we carry ourselves in all lowliness and meekness.<a name=143:12></a> We are Christ's companions, too.<a name=143:13></a> God has brought us to both things by the possession of the Spirit.<a name=143:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I want to come to is this, to refer again to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:37">Romans  8:37</a> - 39.<a name=143:15></a> "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=143:16></a>" Nothing shall separate us from the love of God.<a name=143:17></a> We get the thought that Christ makes intercession for us.<a name=143:18></a> "We have such an High Priest", and "such an High Priest became us".<a name=143:19></a> He ever liveth to make intercession for us.<a name=143:20></a> We have One who intercedes for us, but we are the companions of the One who intercedes for us.<a name=143:21></a> He intercedes for us because He loves us.<a name=143:22></a> He bears the judgment of His people upon His heart, as the high priest in Israel bore their names on his breast.<a name=143:23></a> Now who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=143:24></a> Persecution could not separate you from His love.<a name=143:25></a> We are more than conquerors through Him that loves us.<a name=143:26></a> He loves us because we are His companions.<a name=143:27></a> So, too, God loves His household.<a name=143:28></a> The love of God rests on the One who is Son over God's house.<a name=143:29></a> There is nothing to disturb the complacency which rests on the One who is Son there.<a name=143:30></a> We have found our home here.<a name=143:31></a> What

		I want to touch at this time upon the mystery of the Christ.<a name=151:1></a> It is evidently something great, for Scripture speaks of the riches of the glory of this mystery.<a name=151:2></a> Christ is in the saints, the hope of glory.<a name=151:3></a> Thus the glory is brought near to us.<a name=151:4></a> Glory is the consummation of everything which God has purposed to set forth.<a name=151:5></a> It is the climax and perfection.<a name=151:6></a> God is bringing many sons to glory, that is, to the consummation.<a name=151:7></a>

		These scriptures direct our attention to a very important subject, namely, the house of God.<a name=171:1></a> No material building can now claim to be the house of God, for we read that the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands.<a name=171:2></a> We will first refer to a few scriptures which, as I believe, will not only serve to bring before us the fact that God dwells here, but will indicate to us the importance of that fact.<a name=171:3></a> The last verse of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>reads, "In whom ye also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit", that is, God dwells amongst us in the Spirit; and in the beginning of chapter 4 we have brought before us the conduct which is proper to the house of God:

		The first passage to which I would call attention is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:35">John  1:35</a> - 39.<a name=171:8></a> We see there how the two disciples of John followed the Lord with the desire to know where He dwelt.<a name=171:9></a> The Lord put the question to them, "What seek ye?<a name=171:10></a>" They said, "Master, where dwellest thou?<a name=171:11></a>" and He answered, "Come and see".<a name=171:12></a> He encouraged them to come and see where He dwelt.<a name=171:13></a> We cannot believe that the disciples wanted to see the bare house in which He dwelt.<a name=171:14></a> That was nothing in their eyes, but the important thing was that He dwelt among a few disciples, and it was there that the disciples of John desired to be.<a name=171:15></a> I may live in a house of four walls, but, if you visited me with a view to know me better, walls, furniture and the like would not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will now pass on to chapter 14: 15 - 20.<a name=172:12></a> All that we have seen in chapter 1 is past.<a name=172:13></a> If I may so say, it was for <i>one</i> day.<a name=172:14></a> "They abode with him <i>that day</i>".<a name=172:15></a> He could not remain with them; He had to go away, as we see in chapter 14.<a name=172:16></a> He was on the point of going back to the Father, in whose house He would prepare a place for His own.<a name=172:17></a> We stand in the period of time between the going away of Jesus out of this world and His return to take His own to be with Himself.<a name=172:18></a> The passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>has relation to the present time, which is characterised by the presence of the other Comforter among the saints on earth.<a name=172:19></a> The Lord referring to it said that the Comforter would come to abide with His own <i>for ever</i>.<a name=172:20></a> "The world .<a name=172:21></a>.<a name=172:22></a>.<a name=172:23></a> seeth him not", He said, "neither knoweth him: but ye know him".<a name=172:24></a> The Lord Jesus could only remain with them for a time, and the two disciples, as we have already seen, only remained one day with Him, but the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=173>[Page 173]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Comforter would abide with them for ever.<a name=173:1></a> It is so wonderful that the Comforter should come in order to remain with them for ever.<a name=173:2></a> Let us give it due consideration.<a name=173:3></a> The Comforter is God -- God dwells down here now through the Spirit.<a name=173:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord spoke of the effect which this would have upon the disciples.<a name=173:5></a> One consequence of the presence of the Holy Spirit on the earth is that we see Jesus.<a name=173:6></a> "The world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also".<a name=173:7></a> This verse shews us that so far as life is concerned we are not dependent upon this world.<a name=173:8></a> We live because He lives, and He lives for ever; death cannot touch His life and therefore it cannot touch ours.<a name=173:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A second effect of the presence of the Spirit is that we <i>know</i>.<a name=173:10></a> "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=173:11></a> That is indeed a wonderful knowledge!<a name=173:12></a> The Holy Spirit gives us to know that Jesus dwells in the affections of the Father, and that we also have a place in His affections; and more than that, He is in us, He is the object of our affections.<a name=173:13></a> So we see how much better and greater is our situation than that of the disciples at the time in which the Lord uttered these things.<a name=173:14></a> He shewed the disciples plainly in this chapter that they would enjoy a much greater advantage by the coming of the Comforter than if He Himself were to remain with them.<a name=173:15></a> They knew that He had to leave them, but the Comforter was to abide with them for ever.<a name=173:16></a> Through Him we also see Jesus, and we live because Jesus lives.<a name=173:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in the Epistle to the Ephesians to which we will next turn, shews us the range or the extent of the house of God.<a name=173:18></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>we read of the dwelling of the Comforter among the disciples, but the point here is that believers from amongst the nations, as well as from amongst the Jews, are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit, and this shews us the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=174>[Page 174]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		extent of the house of God.<a name=174:1></a> If we only had the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>we could well suppose that the dwelling of the Comforter would be limited to the disciples, but this scripture teaches us that the house of God -- the habitation of God through the Spirit -- embraces the believers out of all nations of the earth.<a name=174:2></a> Verse 21 looks on to the glory, but in the meantime, as we see in verse 22, believers out of the nations are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=174:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now considered two points.<a name=174:4></a> First, that the Holy Spirit is down here and abides with us for ever; and secondly, that the house of God, which depends upon the presence of the Holy Spirit here on earth, is no material building, but is composed of persons.<a name=174:5></a> It is very important that we form a right conception of the house of God, and although it is no longer to be seen as it was before the failure came in, nevertheless the truth of it as well as the fact remains unchanged, that God dwells down here.<a name=174:6></a> The house of God is not brought before us in the scripture in the form of a local assembly; it includes, as we have already noticed, the believers out of all nations of the earth.<a name=174:7></a> We should manifest the same zeal for the house of God as the two disciples who could only be satisfied with knowing where the Lord dwelt.<a name=174:8></a> If we only resembled them in this respect the house of God would soon become a great reality to us.<a name=174:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I should like to refer to the advantage which accrues to us in the fact that God dwells down here.<a name=174:10></a> In the book of Exodus we get the first mention in the scriptures of the dwelling-place of God on earth.<a name=174:11></a> God saved Israel out of Egypt in order that He might dwell among them and bless them.<a name=174:12></a> He did not want to dwell among them to judge them, but to <i>bless</i> them, and that is very wonderful.<a name=174:13></a> Then He said, "I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that

		healeth thee", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:26">Exodus  15:26</a>.<a name=175:1></a> And God was also light among them; He entrusted to them His statutes, and all nations were to have the witness before their eyes that God dwelt among Israel.<a name=175:2></a> But the children of Israel did not yet realise the fact that God dwelt among them, and turned to idols; hence the severity of the judgment which He brought upon them.<a name=175:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An important point in connection with the dwelling of God amongst us is that we learn to know His attitude toward us.<a name=175:4></a> The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, and God dwells among us in order to bring us to the consciousness of His goodness.<a name=175:5></a> If God is present it is only to bless us.<a name=175:6></a> When Adam was driven out of the garden he found himself in a certain sense in a God-forsaken scene, but God has brought us into His house in order to lead us into the consciousness of His goodness.<a name=175:7></a> He has come near to us, so that we might, as His children, be in the consciousness of His favour and live in nearness to Himself.<a name=175:8></a> In the house of God we enjoy His favour.<a name=175:9></a> How else could we be happy as His children except in the consciousness of His favour?<a name=175:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, God dwells among His own to "heal" them.<a name=175:11></a> He heals us from the diseases of Egypt -- brings us spiritual healing from the corruption of the world.<a name=175:12></a> The world is full of moral sickness, but God brings us into His house and under His influence so that we might live in the consciousness of His love and His favour, and in this way be delivered from the moral diseases of the world.<a name=175:13></a> Then we are conscious that God dwells among us, because we are conscious of His blessing and His favour and His power which heals us, and instead of living in the confusion of the world, we enjoy the peace of God.<a name=175:14></a> The light of His love and of His will, as well as the knowledge of His favour, makes us perfectly happy.<a name=175:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as members of the household of God we enjoy still another favour, namely, His education.<a name=175:16></a>

		We come under the discipline of God.<a name=176:1></a> God really allowed the rest of the nations to go their own way; He gave up those who served idols so that they sank and perished, given up to uncleanness; but Israel was the house of God, and on this account He could say, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth".<a name=176:2></a> And further, "therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities", <a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:2">Amos  3:2</a>.<a name=176:3></a> By his chastisement God would hinder them from going down into the pit; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:24">Job  33:24</a>.<a name=176:4></a> But Israel did not pay heed to the discipline of God, and as a nation have rushed to destruction.<a name=176:5></a> If <i>we</i> then dwell where God dwells He takes notice of our ways.<a name=176:6></a> If we were not righteous before Him we could not be in His house at all; we <i>are</i> righteous, however, and we know that God does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous.<a name=176:7></a> He pays attention to our ways, tries our hearts, and disciplines us.<a name=176:8></a> He does not overlook our sins and we have to receive His chastening.<a name=176:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>we find this all confirmed.<a name=176:10></a> The Lord chastens us because He loves us, and if He did not chasten we should certainly go down into the pit; none of us would continue in the faith.<a name=176:11></a> We are "kept by the power of God through faith", that is, we are exercised and disciplined so that we are preserved and do not get away from the path of faith.<a name=176:12></a> In this way God exercises His power unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<a name=176:13></a> If God drew His hand away from us it would be the greatest calamity that could happen to us.<a name=176:14></a> We cannot let our children go their own way, neither can God.<a name=176:15></a> That explains much of what happens to us down here.<a name=176:16></a> The discipline of God has in view our being kept in the faith.<a name=176:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get in the passage in Exodus the point of departure in the case of Israel.<a name=220:1></a> There had been the lusting after evil things; but this was the great defection, on account of which they were carried away into Babylon.<a name=220:2></a> Although Israel entered the land of promise they did so only provisionally; they never entered it according to the pleasure of God.<a name=220:3></a> From the making of the golden calf God intended that they should be carried away captive into Babylon.<a name=220:4></a> The same defection is seen in the history of the church.<a name=220:5></a> That is my meaning in connecting these two scriptures.<a name=220:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What Israel did actually after the flesh, the church has done in a spiritual sense.<a name=220:7></a> Israel began first by lusting after evil things, and this was followed by idolatry.<a name=220:8></a> There were in Israel what answered to sacraments; they did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink -- it is what the Lord's supper is to us -- but there was unjudged flesh amongst them.<a name=220:9></a> Now I want you to see that the same character of departure has taken place in the church of God.<a name=220:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the occasion referred to Moses was absent.<a name=220:11></a> Moses was apostle in connection with Israel, Aaron was priest.<a name=220:12></a> Moses represented to the people the light and authority of God.<a name=220:13></a> In divine things rule and authority are connected with light.<a name=220:14></a> We see this even in nature.<a name=220:15></a> God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.<a name=220:16></a> God constituted light to rule, and so it is today -- light rules.<a name=220:17></a> I do not doubt that in putting things in this way in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>the Spirit of God had Christ in view.<a name=220:18></a> He is the great Light set in heaven,
	</div>

		<a name=221>[Page 221]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now light is connected with the apostle.<a name=221:2></a> In regard to Israel, Moses was apostle and brought the light, and light was to rule.<a name=221:3></a> Authority was connected with light.<a name=221:4></a> In this passage in Exodus we learn that Moses was absent, he was up in the mount with God.<a name=221:5></a> During his absence the people separated priesthood from true authority, and connected a false authority with the priest, and by doing so they practically degraded the priesthood.<a name=221:6></a> They separated the light and authority, which were vested in Moses, and connected them in their mind in a false way with Aaron, the priest.<a name=221:7></a> He was to be their leader, and to accommodate things to their taste.<a name=221:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This act resulted in the bringing in of idolatry.<a name=221:9></a> They said to Aaron, "Up, make us gods", and Aaron said, "Break off the golden ear-rings, which are in the ears of your wives" (verses 2 - 6).<a name=221:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have in this an epitome of the history of the professing church.<a name=221:11></a> Christ is absent; He, the Apostle, is lost sight of in the present day in Christendom because He has delayed to return, and the leaders have separated priesthood from true authority.<a name=221:12></a> They have degraded the priesthood by connecting authority with it; idolatry has been sanctioned, and the people under the influence of idolatry have become completely worldly.<a name=221:13></a> "The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play".<a name=221:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable that at the beginning of the history of the church God should have warned saints by this defection of Israel.<a name=221:15></a> We see the defection today, both in Romanism and in Protestantism.<a name=221:16></a> And it will be in the case of Christendom as with Israel, that because of this defection destruction will come upon it.<a name=221:17></a> It is of all importance to apprehend the course defection has taken in Christianity.<a name=221:18></a> It is easily seen that during the absence of the Apostle -- Christ, heavenly light and

		authority have been disregarded.<a name=222:1></a> A spurious priesthood has been introduced, the priest has sanctioned idolatry, and thus priesthood has become degraded.<a name=222:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been given to see this defection, and it is a great favour to have had our eyes opened to it.<a name=222:3></a> Now God's corrective I believe to be in the apprehension that what man separated God has brought together.<a name=222:4></a> Apostle and Priest go together in the one Person, and that makes Christianity, in its true power, perfection.<a name=222:5></a> As we accept the authority we get the gain of priesthood, and that is the point I want to bring before you.<a name=222:6></a>

		There are one or two expressions in the previous chapter of this epistle to which I will refer.<a name=230:1></a> "For first of all, when <i>ye come together</i> in the church .<a name=230:2></a>.<a name=230:3></a>".<a name=230:4></a> (verse 18).<a name=230:5></a> Then verse 20: "When <i>ye come together</i> therefore into one place .<a name=230:6></a>.<a name=230:7></a>".<a name=230:8></a> So again in chapter 14: "If therefore the whole assembly <i>come together</i>".<a name=230:9></a> I want to bring before you two or three thoughts in connection with the coming together of the assembly.<a name=230:10></a> I may say they are elementary, but it is not always a very easy thing to present the elements, because so few of us understand the science.<a name=230:11></a> All the world comes together for worship; that is, at all events, the idea in Christendom.<a name=230:12></a> It is only the ungodly who do not come together.<a name=230:13></a> Churches and chapels are filled, and people have the idea of coming together for divine service.<a name=230:14></a> Now if we come together in assembly, we do not come together in accord with all that is around us.<a name=230:15></a> With very many there is probably the thought that they come together as others do, but in a more scriptural way.<a name=230:16></a> We come together at the same time, on the same day, and it looks as if we were in accord with all around, but we are <i>not</i> in spirit in accord with anything around us.<a name=230:17></a> The saints at the beginning certainly did not come together in accord with heathenism.<a name=230:18></a> Judaism was immediately around, but they did not come together in accord with Judaism.<a name=230:19></a> The coming together of Christians was in most distinct separation from all around.<a name=230:20></a> Now we have got Christianism (if I might coin a word), but we do not come together in accord with Christianism.<a name=230:21></a> Just as Judaism was then the established order, so Christianity has become the same thing.<a name=230:22></a> There can be no real Christianity outside of the Spirit of God, and the world cannot receive the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to come to chapter 12, see verse 13.<a name=231:9></a> We come together in assembly in the unity of the Spirit.<a name=231:10></a> The Spirit has no regard to the distinctions of the world; the Jew is no better than the Gentile, the free man is no better than the slave.<a name=231:11></a> What distinction can hold in Christ's presence?<a name=231:12></a> The Spirit pays no regard to the distinctions of men, and in coming together in assembly the distinctions which exist in the world disappear.<a name=231:13></a> If we do not come together rightly in our feelings and thoughts with regard to one another, it is impossible to gain the presence of the Lord.<a name=231:14></a> The Spirit maintains what is according to Christ, not what is according to man, and so in coming together it will not do for us to maintain distinctions which the Spirit of God has disregarded.<a name=231:15></a> "We have all been made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=231:16></a> I am putting before you matters which are extremely

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to another point.<a name=232:3></a> It says in verse 27, "You are Christ's body".<a name=232:4></a> I refer you in connection with this to a verse in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=232:5></a> Read verse 20; that verse helps us to understand the statement which we get here -- "Ye are the body of Christ".<a name=232:6></a> The body is where the heart of Christ is.<a name=232:7></a> He says, "I am in my Father", that is, in the Father's heart.<a name=232:8></a> "Ye in me", that is, in the heart of Christ.<a name=232:9></a> "I in you", that is, the affections of Christ are here.<a name=232:10></a> Christ's affections are in His saints down here.<a name=232:11></a> It is difficult to realise this on account of the confusion around, but we have to regard the true character of things, as presented by the Spirit of God.<a name=232:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is, we do not come together in accord with things around.<a name=232:13></a> Secondly, we come together in the unity of the Spirit.<a name=232:14></a> Thirdly, we are conscious of being Christ's body.<a name=232:15></a> Christ is present there in affection.<a name=232:16></a> The Lord says, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you".<a name=232:17></a> It is very important that we should come together aright.<a name=232:18></a> We may so readily fall into what is prevailing in Christendom, only with a more correct form.<a name=232:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to call your attention to chapter 13: 1 - 13.<a name=232:20></a> We will suppose that the points that I have referred to are accepted, and that we are come together.<a name=232:21></a> In the assembly come together, love is the principle which regulates everything and puts everything in its place.<a name=232:22></a> There is no real corrective to what is unsuitable but love.<a name=232:23></a> It is love in regard to one another.<a name=232:24></a> Christ puts love in activity, and the working of love is to put all in order in the assembly come together.<a name=232:25></a> We have to follow after love.<a name=232:26></a> These things are all excessively important if the assembly is to have its character according to God down here.<a name=232:27></a> We have to take account

		give us the idea referred to in the parable of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, that is, of the tree, and partly because we get a remarkable expression there, that Nebuchadnezzar was to know that <i>the heavens ruled</i>.<a name=239:1></a> I want to touch on these two points for a moment.<a name=239:2></a> A tree is a conspicuous figure.<a name=239:3></a> The Babylonish kingdom was a conspicuous figure in the world; God allowed it to become that, and it sheltered the fowls of heaven.<a name=239:4></a> Now according to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>the kingdom of heaven has taken that shape: it has become conspicuous, a thing of renown in the world, and has afforded shelter to the fowls of heaven.<a name=239:5></a> The kingdom of heaven has become a great earthly organisation.<a name=239:6></a> That is not what God intended, but it has come to pass.<a name=239:7></a> The kingdom of heaven really came in by testimony, hence the Lord speaks about its having its origin in a seed which is the least of all seeds.<a name=239:8></a> It must have been so, because there was no kingdom set up in power; it sprang up as the fruit and result of seed-sowing.<a name=239:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the meaning of the kingdom of heaven, I do not connect it with the expression I read in Daniel that "the heavens do rule".<a name=239:10></a> I think that Nebuchadnezzar had to learn that in spite of all he thought of himself, the heavens ruled, and so they do.<a name=239:11></a> You get great dynastic changes taking place in the world; and they appear to be the workings of men; but what is behind all that is that the heavens rule.<a name=239:12></a> The Most High gives the kingdoms of men to whom He will.<a name=239:13></a> To our observation it would appear as though all these things were the fruit and result of human forces, but God makes men to feel that the heavens rule.<a name=239:14></a> But that is not to my mind the idea of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=239:15></a> What I understand by it is the moral sway of that which God has been pleased to set in heaven, and that is, a Man.<a name=239:16></a> The kingdom of heaven is the reign of grace, and that reign is brought about by the setting of a Man in heaven.<a name=239:17></a> God has been pleased, on the ground of redemption, to set a

		It is a great point to be in the light of the glory of the Man whom God has set in heaven, to be thus in divine light down here.<a name=240:5></a> It is a great point for the natural man to be in the light of the sun.<a name=240:6></a> We know what the effect of sunshine is in a room, how everything is brightened, how we are all gladdened by the rays of the sun.<a name=240:7></a> So it is in the light of the Man whom God has set in heaven; He represents the reign of grace, and our souls are in that light.<a name=240:8></a> The testimony came down here into the world like a seed.<a name=240:9></a> It had to be sown in the earth, and what has come up is not entirely according to the seed; what has come out of the earth is this great tree.<a name=240:10></a> The testimony of Christ has been adopted by man down here, and been made to serve his ends, and the outcome is the mustard tree, a great conspicuous system which affords shelter to the fowls of heaven.<a name=240:11></a> Now my point is that this is not according to God.<a name=240:12></a> The Lord foretold all in detail; there are parables I have not read, but I say without hesitation, all is not according to God's mind.<a name=240:13></a> When the Lord spoke of the tree, there was nothing of the kind; nothing but a small seed; but He foresaw what it would come to.<a name=240:14></a> In this country we see a great State church, under the name of Christ; we see also other great bodies, which, though they have departed from the State church, are still great organisations; all go to make up the mustard tree.<a name=240:15></a> But that is not according to the mind of God; hence it is morally a ruin.<a name=240:16></a> A great tree is an object in the eye of man, but if it is not according to God's mind it is a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But perhaps some would say, How do you know it is not according to the mind of God?<a name=241:3></a> Well, let us look at the second parable I have read, verses 44 - 48.<a name=241:4></a> In verse 44 you get the thought of "treasure", in verse 46, a "pearl of great price", and in verse 48, "the good".<a name=241:5></a> I think all ought to be ready to allow that evidently here we get something which is according to God.<a name=241:6></a> It is not a "tree", or "leaven", but "treasure", "a pearl", and "good".<a name=241:7></a> I touch on the first parable in connection with one important point: when the treasure was found, it was hid.<a name=241:8></a> If I interpret the parable aright, the man who found the treasure is Christ, and the reason why I should judge that it refers to Christ is that the man bought the field.<a name=241:9></a> The field represents all men, and buying the field suggests that Christ has a right and title in regard to all men.<a name=241:10></a> He has bought all men, because when He came He found that there was a treasure hid among all men.<a name=241:11></a> Christ came down to earth and began to look around and He found there was a treasure here.<a name=241:12></a> How it came to be a treasure is not my point; but when He came close to men He found a treasure.<a name=241:13></a> The treasure was something very insignificant in the Lord's day -- only a handful of people; but it was a treasure.<a name=241:14></a> I cannot tell how it is that diamonds exist in the earth, but they do exist, and when Christ came here, He found a treasure; and He did not make it a great, conspicuous tree, but He hid it.<a name=241:15></a> He bought the field, died for all, but His mind in buying the field was the treasure, which He did not allow to come into publicity or manifestation.<a name=241:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I bring that forward to substantiate the proposition I previously advanced, that the mustard tree is not according to the thought of God.<a name=241:17></a> This parable makes that point plain.<a name=241:18></a> The treasure was hid, and it was not

		the mind of the Lord that the treasure should come into manifestation.<a name=242:1></a> It was in His mind that the treasure should be here simply and only as a vessel of spiritual light.<a name=242:2></a> There is a day when the church comes out in manifestation, when it comes down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God.<a name=242:3></a> Nothing will suit save the glory of God.<a name=242:4></a> The heavenly city will be public and conspicuous enough then; and the Lord intended that the treasure should wait for that moment, that until then it should be hid, and if known upon earth, that it should be known morally as a vessel of light.<a name=242:5></a> I suppose all will accept that; and if you do, you will understand how little we can glory in any of the great organisations.<a name=242:6></a> The mustard tree may be glorious enough in the eyes of men, but it stands condemned in the eyes of those who have intelligence; because it is not according to the mind of God.<a name=242:7></a> If not, then it is really a ruin; and if we understand anything about the latter parable, our position down here in the world is that we are a witness to the ruin.<a name=242:8></a> What else can we be a witness to?<a name=242:9></a> We cannot be a witness to the church when the church is here.<a name=242:10></a> I am prepared to stand here in the place of reproach, even though my kindred leave me, and I be bereft of all, I would stand apart and bear the sorrow, but I would not approve in any way the mustard tree.<a name=242:11></a> I would stand apart from it with all the spiritual energy which the Lord would afford to me, because it is not according to the mind of God.<a name=242:12></a> I would seek to be maintained in the thought that Christ has bought the field, and the treasure is here, but hid.<a name=242:13></a> We are to be in the reproach of Christ, not in honour, or glory, or worldliness; in the sense that the treasure is here, and that we have part, by the work of God, in that which, in the eyes of Christ, is a treasure.<a name=242:14></a> It is a wonderful consideration, that Christ gave Himself for all, that He might possess the treasure.<a name=242:15></a> When He came to earth, He found a treasure, and for joy thereof, went

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I put these things forward because the two parables present such a striking contrast, and we have to see that the one is not what is according to the mind of God, although things have assumed that shape; but that in the other, we are let into the secret of the Lord: and it is a great honour and privilege to be in the secret of the Lord, although the knowledge of it, and seeking to maintain it, may expose us to reproach in the world.<a name=243:3></a> We may find one and another dropping off, but these things do not greatly oppress me, because I feel that the path in which we are called to walk is a path which demands that we shall not merely be Christians, but have divine intelligence for the moment in which it has pleased God to set us down here.<a name=243:4></a>

		So the apostle says to the Ephesians, "I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God".<a name=259:9></a> Then he begins to warn, as there were marks of declension, so the apostle brings this warning: "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh".<a name=259:10></a> They accept, in a certain sense, the first principles of Christianity -- there they stood.<a name=259:11></a> They had not gone on to be taught of God.<a name=259:12></a> If God has brought you to Himself, you may depend upon it God has something to communicate to you.<a name=259:13></a> Then it is of all-importance that you should be prepared to hear, and that you should seek to understand and not turn away.<a name=259:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think the covenant is established exactly with us, but being brought to God, God must be on some kind of terms with us.<a name=260:7></a> The terms on which He is with us constitute the covenant.<a name=260:8></a> Every Christian must learn, properly speaking, the terms on which God is with him.<a name=260:9></a> Christians must be very slack if they are not exercised to know the terms on which God is with them; if you are in relation with God there must be some terms on which God must be with you, and I think every Christian ought to be deeply exercised to know the terms on which God is with him, and that, to my mind, is the spirit of the new covenant.<a name=260:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think so.<a name=260:15></a> God has His own pleasure in His people; His love is upon them in that sense, and it is impossible that God can impute sin to those whom He loves.<a name=260:16></a> You would not impute sin to those you love.<a name=260:17></a>

		I think the new covenant indicates what God is for us, while reconciliation brings out what we are for God.<a name=261:1></a> Hence I think the important thing for a Christian is to learn reconciliation, and reconciliation indicates what they are for God -- for His pleasure -- that is, they are a new creation in Christ for God's pleasure.<a name=261:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I think I heard you say once, reconciliation is that there is but one Man.<a name=261:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; that is reconciliation.<a name=261:4></a> Every order of man, every kind of man has disappeared, that one Man may remain.<a name=261:5></a> That one Man is Christ, and you are of Christ.<a name=261:6></a> If any man be in Christ, there is a new creation.<a name=261:7></a> You are in Christ Jesus, that is reconciliation, but that is for God's pleasure, like the prodigal in the Father's house at the Father's table.<a name=261:8></a> He was there not for his own pleasure, he was there for the Father's pleasure.<a name=261:9></a> Therefore the Father says, "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad".<a name=261:10></a>

		It is in that way I take up a circumstance or two in connection with Abraham.<a name=262:4></a> Evidently Abraham is a striking figure in the ways of God.<a name=262:5></a> He occupies a place which no other person occupies in Scripture.<a name=262:6></a> He is one of the great landmarks in the ways of God, and the place he has is unique.<a name=262:7></a> He is the father of the faithful and was called the friend of God.<a name=262:8></a> I think if terms of that kind are applied to Abraham you may be sure that he occupies a conspicuous place, and further, he is the first instance in Scripture of the call of God.<a name=262:9></a>

		You see previously instances of men of faith, that is, having light from God.<a name=262:10></a> Abel had light from God, so too Enoch, but we do not read of Abel or Enoch being called.<a name=262:11></a> They are borne witness to in the New Testament as men of faith; they pleased God in that sense, but the call of God had not come in.<a name=262:12></a> I think the call of God did not come in until the world had virtually become apostate.<a name=262:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the beginning of this epistle, the apostle comes at once to the call of God.<a name=268:6></a> "When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen" -- that indicates the call of God.<a name=268:7></a> It was God expressing His love in His Son, in order that souls might be brought into sonship.<a name=268:8></a> It is not the glad tidings of the grace of God or the kingdom, but what lies at the back of all, the presentation of God's love, in order that we might be brought, in the sense of God's love, to the reality of sonship.<a name=268:9></a> It is of all moment to apprehend the call of God in that light.<a name=268:10></a> You get the thought of it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=268:11></a> The call of God comes out especially by the Apostle Paul, God revealed His Son in him to that end.<a name=268:12></a> And the apostle in chapter 3 says, "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=268:13></a> He speaks of that into which the call of God had brought them, and in the next chapter the same truth is brought out.<a name=268:14></a> "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship" -- that is the call of God.<a name=268:15></a>

		These prophecies do not then present to us Israel after the flesh, but the Israel of promise, an ideal Israel, which is in the mind of God.<a name=289:8></a> They are four distinct prophecies, although forming a complete whole.<a name=289:9></a> The first shews their sanctification; they were a people apart, and not to be reckoned among the nations.<a name=289:10></a> So in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:13">2 Thessalonians  2:13</a> the apostle says, "We are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth".<a name=289:11></a> It is the divine idea that there should be a people separate from the world -- not reckoned among the nations.<a name=289:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The two great points in the third prophecy are comeliness and strength.<a name=290:5></a> The comeliness of Israel was the order in which God had set them in their tents.<a name=290:6></a> The prophecy will be fully made good in Israel in a future day, for they will be established in the land of promise according to their tribes, and none will dare to stir them up.<a name=290:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is both our comeliness and strength.<a name=290:8></a> If viewed according to our ways down here there is much that is uncomely.<a name=290:9></a> God has made us accepted in the Beloved; we have Christ as covering; the best robe is that which comes under the eye of God.<a name=290:10></a> Then Christ is also our strength within.<a name=290:11></a> The apostle could say that he had strength for all things in Him who gave him power.<a name=290:12></a> We have no real strength but Christ.<a name=290:13></a> If He dwells in the heart by faith we are strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might; we can then stand in the evil day, and, having done all, stand.<a name=290:14></a> If we are minding any worldly status, or are under any worldly influence, we are assailable, for in that point we are weak, and the enemy can gain an advantage.<a name=290:15></a>

		When the Lord was here on earth there was no point at which the enemy could touch Him, because He was in no way dependent upon man, or upon things here.<a name=291:2></a> He was a stranger here, and entirely independent of the whole scene through which He passed, perfectly superior to it, so that at the close He could say, "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world".<a name=291:3></a> If He had sought the favour or approbation of the world He would not have been independent of it, but His ministry from the beginning to the end was the outcome of perfect love.<a name=291:4></a> He said, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me".<a name=291:5></a> Now, we have the privilege, in the power of the Holy Spirit, of being as independent of the world as He was.<a name=291:6></a> As men here on earth we may have duties connected with families and business, but in them we seek to please God, and do not look for the favour or approval of the world.<a name=291:7></a> Then if we are formed in the divine nature we walk in love to the brethren, and towards all, and thus walking we are unassailable.<a name=291:8></a> Christ is our strength.<a name=291:9></a>

		In these prophecies there is nothing about heaven; they all relate to a people here on earth.<a name=291:10></a> When we reach the fourth prophecy there is only one thing to add to what has gone before: that is, the coming of the Lord.<a name=291:11></a> When He comes He will deal with the deadly, pernicious influences which here on earth gain ascendancy over the mind of man.<a name=291:12></a> We do not look for the coming of the Lord exactly in the way that Israel will do.<a name=291:13></a> The Book of Psalms shews how they will look for Him.<a name=291:14></a> In it is traced the whole course of things on earth, from the rejection of Christ to the glory of the kingdom.<a name=291:15></a> But there is a great deal in it which would scarcely be fitting expression for Christians.<a name=291:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming of the Lord is here intimated by the two symbols -- the Star and the Sceptre.<a name=292:8></a> A star is conspicuous in the heavens, and a sceptre is the symbol of rule.<a name=292:9></a> Both will be realised in Christ, who, springing out of Jacob, will rule for ever over the house of Jacob.<a name=292:10></a> This prophecy does not relate directly to Israel, but to the natural and hereditary enemies of Israel.<a name=292:11></a> In some of them you get a mass of enemies that Israel on their way to Canaan were not allowed to molest.<a name=292:12></a> The hatred of Moab, Edom, Amalek, and Asshur to Israel was hereditary.<a name=292:13></a> Asshur (Assyria) is the great enemy of Israel when Israel is owned.<a name=292:14></a> The power of all these will be destroyed.<a name=292:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The significance to us is that there are relationships into which the church has entered down here which have involved questions beyond our power to deal with, and which can only be solved in the coming of the Lord.<a name=292:16></a> He will cut the knot, and will leave nothing remaining but that which is of Himself.<a name=292:17></a> If we are at all conscious of the hopeless confusion prevailing here, we shall, with the Spirit, say "Come".<a name=292:18></a>

		In what I have to say on this chapter I have no desire to bring forward anything that is particularly interesting or attractive to man; all that I desire to do is, in some little measure, to open up God's word so that every one may understand it.<a name=294:1></a> The direct effect of understanding God's word is that we are found in the path of His will while here in the world.<a name=294:2></a> There is a way through this world.<a name=294:3></a> I look upon the world as being a wilderness morally; it is no small difficulty to find a way through it; the only way that I know of is the path of God's will.<a name=294:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world is a scene of moral confusion, where good and evil are mixed up together, hence the difficulty of finding a way through it; the proper path is in avoiding the evil and cleaving to the good, and this is impossible for man apart from God.<a name=294:5></a> The grace of God has made a way through the perplexities and difficulties of the world, and that way is the path of God's will; it is a path of security that shines more and more unto the perfect day.<a name=294:6></a> It is a great thing to find that path and to be walking in it; that is what I would desire for everybody.<a name=294:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my present object is to shew God's way.<a name=294:8></a> If we understand God's way we are not long before we find out the path of His will.<a name=294:9></a> It is not in the course of the world.<a name=294:10></a> There is a remarkable statement at the close of the chapter: "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise", etc.<a name=294:11></a> (verses 27 - 29).<a name=294:12></a> I think that all will readily see that the world is a great system; it seems, in a sense, to grow greater and greater; but what I apprehend is that God will not bring to naught the great things of the world by the great things of the world, but He will

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May every one of us be enabled to see that God puts no sanction on the greatness of the world; it is nothing in His sight, it is not founded on moral foundations.<a name=295:3></a> You may be certain that nothing can be great for God unless resting on moral foundations, and no thoughtful person could say for a moment that the glory of this world, or indeed of any nation, is established on a moral basis.<a name=295:4></a> Nations may become great in the providence of God and exercise great power in the world, but if you could search into their origin, which is a point of very great difficulty, I doubt if you would find that much of the greatness has any real moral basis.<a name=295:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have said so much in connection with the thought that God would not put any sanction upon the greatness of the world.<a name=295:6></a> There is no doubt that Christianity has become a great force in the world; but it is not what God intended it to be; Christianity started with a babe born into the world and laid in a manger because there was no room for Him in the inn.<a name=295:7></a> The next great step in Christianity was a hundred and twenty persons of no account whatever in Jerusalem brought together by the testimony of Christ's resurrection, endowed with the Spirit of God; that was the true beginning of Christianity, but that was not a matter that entered into the account of the world.<a name=295:8></a>

		The next step was that the man who had sinned against God should be removed, with the liabilities under which he lay, vicariously from under the eye of God, in order that God's love might be made known to man.<a name=297:13></a> The question was of what was suitable to the glory of God, and what was suitable to the glory of God was the removal of the man who had sinned.<a name=297:14></a>

		In presenting God and His thoughts toward man, what we see is that through love righteousness has been vindicated and declared; God has no demand to make upon man, but on the contrary works to make His love known.<a name=298:6></a> He has removed every obstacle out of the way; sin, the flesh, and the curse have all been removed in the sacrifice of Christ, and the work of God is so to make His love known to man as to gain the heart of man for Himself.<a name=298:7></a> That I believe to be the attitude of God towards man, and in that sense Christ is the wisdom of God; that is, His resource, what God had in reserve -- the One who in due time came forth in order that God might be glorified.<a name=298:8></a> The Lord refers to this in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him".<a name=298:9></a>

		So Christ is not simply resource for God; He is resource to us; He is righteousness to us; our title, in that sense, to the world to come.<a name=301:9></a> He is sanctification also.<a name=301:10></a> He is the expression to us of God's mind as to our present place before Him, as priests having access to the living God.<a name=301:11></a> "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".<a name=301:12></a> That is our sanctification.<a name=301:13></a>

		Then He is redemption; we wait for the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour from heaven, "who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:20">Philippians  3:20</a>, 21.<a name=301:14></a> The moment Christ appears we shall be fully taken up by Him, and that will be final and complete redemption.<a name=301:15></a> We are waiting now in hope of the redemption of the body.<a name=301:16></a> When Christ rises from the right hand of God the first expression of His mighty power will be to change us completely into His likeness, and that is redemption for the saints.<a name=301:17></a> It does not mean redemption in its application to our souls; it is final redemption of the saints at the coming of the Lord.<a name=301:18></a>

		If you have followed me you will see that the passage presents Christ in two ways: what He is for God -- He is wisdom and power for God; and, on the other hand, what He is by God's abundant grace for us; and Christians are in this world begotten of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=302:1></a> They cannot be apart from the Head.<a name=302:2></a> That is, Christians have the source of their moral being in God Himself, but not apart from the Head, that is, Christ Jesus, who "is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord".<a name=302:3></a> And what are we?<a name=302:4></a> If one were the greatest in the land, one would be nothing in the eye of God any more than in the eye of death.<a name=302:5></a> If a man can accumulate millions, can he ward off death ten years?<a name=302:6></a> can he add a cubit to his stature?<a name=302:7></a> With all the wealth in the world man can do neither.<a name=302:8></a> What is the good then of glorying in man?<a name=302:9></a> If he is rich, he has to leave all behind he grows old in spite of all the doctors in the world; he cannot evade sickness or death.<a name=302:10></a> Christ is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; and when redemption comes in there will be an end of death.<a name=302:11></a> He will take us out of the scene of sin and death to be with Himself in the Father's house.<a name=302:12></a> He is redemption to us; and therefore we look for Him from heaven as Saviour.<a name=302:13></a> We look for Him as the Saviour of the body.<a name=302:14></a> He will bring our body into complete likeness to His body, His glorious body.<a name=302:15></a>
